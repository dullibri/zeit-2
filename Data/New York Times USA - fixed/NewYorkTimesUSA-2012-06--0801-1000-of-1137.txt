HEADLINE: Iran Officials Assert Defiance of West in Aftermath of Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iranian politicians and military commanders said Wednesday that their country would never relinquish what they called its nuclear rights, a day after talks between Iran and world powers in Moscow failed to make substantive progress in the dispute over Iran's uranium enrichment.
Some commanders even asserted that Iran was not only impervious to Western threats but poised to dominate economically, despite evidence that the accumulation of sanctions on Iran, which are set to intensify in a few weeks, could cripple its ability to sell oil, the country's economic lifeline. 
But the higher-ranking Iranian officials who set out the countries policies and whose comments determine the scope of reactions to international events have not yet publicly reflected on the outcome of the Moscow talks.
Besides the Tuesday news conference by Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, in Moscow, who said the talks had been ''realistic and serious,'' there has been no reaction by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The talks yielded no result other than a lower level technical meeting in two weeks and only the possibility of the top negotiators getting together.
The technical meeting will take place a few days after the European Union's July 1 embargo on Iranian oil and ban on shipping insurance for Iranian oil, which will vastly complicate Iranian oil sales to Asian buyers. Most maritime insurers are based in Europe and they are prohibited from writing policies on any Iranian oil shipped anywhere. South Korean officials on Wednesday told the Korean Yonhap news agency the new sanctions would force them to completely stop buying oil from Iran, even though the country secured an American waiver allowing South Korea to buy some Iranian oil without incurring penalties under a United States law that sanctions Iran. Japan, another major customer of Iranian crude that has secured an American waiver, is taking steps to provide government guarantees on insurance.
A senior member of Iran's parliament, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, in a Wednesday news conference, stressed that the Moscow talks had been positive for Iran as they allowed the country to gauge whether the world powers are serious in the negotiations. ''Iran submitted a good proposal to them,'' he said.
While Iran's leaders initially showed optimism over renewed talks on their nuclear program in April, they became disappointed after what they say was the United States withdrawal of a promise to affirm their right to enrich uranium.
Iran is in violation of a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that it halt all forms of uranium enrichment. Iran regards the resolutions as illegitimate.
Western powers and Israel have accused Iran of stockpiling enriched uranium as part of an effort to achieve the capability to make nuclear weapons. The Iranians have denied those accusations and say a fatwa, or religious decree, by Ayatollah Khamenei forbids such weapons as against Islam.
Iranian leaders, including President Ahmadinejad, have hinted that if the world powers officially accepted Iran's nuclear energy program, Iran would halt its enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity, which is considered a technical step away from weapons grade purity of 90 percent.
''The world powers should recognize Iran's nuclear rights. Iran will never give up its right to achieve peaceful nuclear technology,'' Mr. Bahonar told the state Islamic Republic News Agency.
The rial, Iran's currency, lost some value against the dollar and euro in the aftermath of the Moscow talks, partly on expectations that the looming new sanctions on Iran would further impair its economy. The rial has lost over half its value relative to the dollar in the past 12 months, which has doubled prices of many imports.
There have been no new calls from Iranian officials telling citizens to be prepare for difficult times, but the commander-in-chief of the voluntary paramilitary forces said Wednesday said that world powers would fail in their coercion efforts.
''Iranian people are ready to prove that the world powers are nothing, which means that they cannot wage a war or put pressure on Iran,'' the commander, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Naqdi, was quoted as saying by the semiofficial Fars news agency.
Some said Iran's economy was in its best shape ever and poised to emerge as a world powerhouse.
The commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, said that ''60 percent of the energy of the universe has been secured by Iran,'' the semiofficial Islamic Labour New Agency reported, making Iran ready to ''dominate the world economy.''
Pressures and sanctions have only made Iran stronger, he concluded. ''Today we are witnessing the political funeral of the West,'' General Salami said.

HEADLINE: Output Slower, Fed Is Taking A Modest Step

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a pattern that has become familiar, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the economy was growing more slowly than it had forecast, in part because its efforts to hasten recovery had proved insufficient.
With the economy stumbling into the summer months after the false promise of a relatively strong winter, the Fed announced a modest expansion of its efforts to stimulate growth.
The Fed said its senior officials now expected growth of 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent this year, half a percentage point lower than they forecast in April. They predicted the unemployment rate would not drop below 8 percent this year, and that inflation would not climb above 1.7 percent. 
Those are the vital signs of a patient who will be ill for some time. And the Fed noted that the outlook could worsen if events in Europe unnerved financial markets or if politicians in Washington failed to resolve a stalemate over fiscal policy.
The central bank pledged to buy $267 billion in long-term Treasury securities over the next six months as part of a continuing campaign to reduce borrowing costs.
It is the first time since January that the Fed has intensified its efforts to revive economic growth, and the first time since September that it has announced a new round of asset purchases. This is the fifth such announcement since 2008.
But the new program is not large enough to provide significant economic support. Instead it amounts to a placeholder, an effort to soothe markets and preserve the status quo while the Fed seeks greater clarity about the health of the economic recovery.
''We have to get further information about the state of the economy, about where things are going and about what's happening in Europe,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said at a news conference after the release of the policy statement and projections.
His comments raised the prospect that the Fed would act again later this year.
''We are prepared to do what is necessary,'' he said, in a version of the pledge that has become his byword. ''We are prepared to provide support for the economy.''
Investors appeared to respond with disappointment. Major equity indexes fell after the Fed's policy was announced, rose for a while, and then fell throughout Mr. Bernanke's 45-minute news conference before staging a late rally to end the day little changed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.2 percent.
The Fed is already engaged in broad efforts to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. It has kept short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and is holding more than $2.5 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to hold long-term interest rates down.
But the unemployment rate, after declining rapidly during the final months of 2008, has stalled above 8 percent. More than 20 million Americans could not find full-time work last month, three years after the recession ended.
The Fed's policy-making committee said Wednesday that while it expected growth would continue at a ''moderate pace,'' job creation and household spending both slowed in recent months. Mr. Bernanke said the housing depression, domestic fiscal policy and Europe's downturn were dragging on growth.
The Fed's economic forecast, released separately, reflected reduced prospects for 2013. Officials estimated the nation's economy would grow from 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent next year, down from its April projection of 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to range from 7.5 to 8 percent at the end of 2013, up from an April forecast of 7.3 to 7.7 percent.
Fed officials appeared united earlier this year in the view that monetary policy had done enough to bolster growth. But the accumulation of lukewarm data has cracked that united front. Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, issued public calls for new action, and others who argued for more aggressive easing last year also seemed to be girding for a return to the barricades. The Fed's conservative wing, meanwhile, renewed its warnings about future inflation.
The committee landed between the two camps on Wednesday, reflecting the moderating influence of Mr. Bernanke, who controls the decision-making process.
The new asset purchases extend a commitment scheduled to end this month to buy $400 million in Treasuries, known as Operation Twist because the purchases are financed by sales from the Fed's holdings of short-term securities. Extending the program by six months has poetic virtues, but it also reflects the imminent exhaustion of the Fed's holdings of the short-term securities.
Studies of this first installment of Operation Twist have concluded that it reduced long-term interest rates by 0.15 to 0.20 percentage points. But its economic impact, like those of the Fed's earlier asset purchases, has been muted by the inability of many businesses and consumers to obtain loans. Economists estimate that this second installment will have an even smaller impact, commensurate with its size.
''They bought some time and some insurance to sit back and see how the situation evolved,'' said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC.
The decision was supported by 11 members of the committee. The only opposition came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has repeatedly dissented this year, arguing against additional action.
Republican politicians have pressed the Fed to refrain from new actions, arguing that it is more likely to set off higher inflation than lower unemployment.
Mr. Bernanke was dismissive of those criticisms on Wednesday. He noted that inflation remained firmly in check. The Fed projects that wages and prices will increase more slowly this year than the 2 percent pace it considers optimal.
He expressed confidence that asset purchases could help the economy. ''I wouldn't accept the proposition that the Fed has no more ammunition,'' he said. ''Our tools, while nonstandard, still can create more accommodative conditions, still provide support of the economy, still help us return to a more normal economic situation.''
At the same time, Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed was restrained by the uncertain consequences of its actions. Efforts by central banks to hold down interest rates have sometimes contributed to speculative bubbles, for example.
And in saying that the Fed was prepared to do more if necessary, he made clear that he did not regard the current economic situation as sufficient cause.''I don't think they should be launched lightly,'' he said of the possibility of additional asset purchases. ''There should be some conviction that they're needed.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Urged to Confront Iran on Nuclear Work

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Artin Afkhami from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With high-stakes negotiations over Iran's nuclear program at an impasse, the Obama administration is under mounting pressure to rethink a diplomatic exercise that many argue is simply stringing along the rest of the world.
After two days of fruitless talks in Moscow, negotiators for the United States and other major powers did not even schedule another high-level meeting with Iran, committing only to a lower-level session in July to go over the technical details of a proposal to suspend the enrichment of uranium that Iran has already rejected in principle. 
Dennis B. Ross, a former senior White House adviser on Iran, said he believed the negotiations had become a trap, allowing Iran to continue enriching nuclear fuel while the two sides fail to agree on even interim measures to slow the Iranian program. The major powers, he said, should scrap the step-by-step approach in favor of a comprehensive deal that would test Iran's sincerity, but could also hasten a military confrontation.
''The issue here is, 'How do you deal with a process that's going to be harder and harder to justify?' '' said Mr. Ross, who left the administration in December and is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''If it looks like you're engaging in a process for the sake of process, that's a bigger problem.''
Other critics are even blunter, labeling the talks a ''charade'' and demanding that Congress pass another round of sanctions against Iran. On Friday, 44 Republican and Democratic senators sent a letter to President Obama urging him to abandon the negotiations if the Moscow meeting failed to produce any concessions from Iran.
''Talks are going slowly but Iran's centrifuges are moving quickly,'' said Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has taken a tough line against Tehran.
Mr. Sherman said the United States should impose sanctions against all of Iran's banks that go beyond unilateral measures aimed at cutting off its Central Bank. Those measures, which will take effect at the end of the month, could still cause a change of heart on the part of the Iranians, administration officials say.
These officials acknowledge that there are deep gaps between the two sides and no sign yet that the Iranians have made a genuine decision to bargain. But with the banking sanctions and a European Union oil embargo about to take effect, they insist that the step-by-step approach is worth pursuing a while longer.
At the working-level meeting, on July 3 in Istanbul, officials said they would seek further details on an Iranian proposal made in Moscow that left Western diplomats puzzled. The proposal was made in response to the demand that Iran suspend its enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, ship out its existing stockpile of that uranium and shut down its heavily fortified Fordo enrichment facility near the holy city of Qum.
While the Iranian offer made reference to 20 percent uranium, it was, in the words of a senior administration official, ''elliptical.'' And even though the diplomats met for hours on Monday and Tuesday, the official said there was not enough time to determine whether the Iranian offer held the prospect for progress.
''Iran submitted a good proposal to them,'' Mohammad Reza Bahonar, a senior member of Iran's Parliament, said at a news conference in Tehran.
Iranian officials and commanders reiterated that they would never relinquish what they called Iran's nuclear rights. Some asserted that not only was Iran impervious to Western threats but was also poised to prosper economically, despite evidence that the sanctions could cripple its ability to sell oil, its financial lifeline.
Such assertions do not mask the economic pain that analysts said was about to fall on Iran with the imposition of the oil sanctions. To some experts, that is reason enough to allow the diplomatic process to grind on.
''It looks hopeless now, but let's not blind ourselves with our own rational Western culture,'' said Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. ''This is a trading culture. It can turn on a dime.''
Mr. Ross, in an article published in The New Republic, argued that the major powers should skip all these steps and offer the Iranians a civil nuclear power capacity that would be limited and monitored in a way that would not allow Iran to develop a weapon. If Iran rejected that offer, he said, it would clarify Tehran's intentions.
Shifting to such an approach, Mr. Ross said, would also assuage the doubts of the Israelis, who say the Iranians are using the talks to buy time while they enrich fuel to use in bombs. And it would give the West sounder justification for a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, since Tehran's ultimate goal would no longer be ambiguous.
''For them to really feel they need to reach an agreement, they need to know that if diplomacy fails, the pressure is on them,'' Mr. Ross said in a telephone interview from Israel, where he was meeting with Israeli officials.
Mr. Ross said he worried that the calendar, which initially worked against Iran because of the sanctions, was now in its favor. In particular, he said, the Iranians appeared to be calculating that Mr. Obama wanted to keep diplomacy going until after Election Day on Nov. 6. ''They read the 6th as us not wanting diplomacy to fail,'' he said.
Though Mr. Ross keeps lines to former colleagues at the White House, he has not persuaded the administration to change course. A senior administration official said pursuing a comprehensive deal would take months of negotiation, during which time Tehran would continue to enrich uranium. Agreeing on interim steps could freeze Iran's enrichment sooner.
''Time is problematic,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. ''As time moves on, it gets more problematic.''

HEADLINE: Senate Weighs Bill Overhauling Agriculture Programs

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The farm bill under debate in the Senate would be the nation's first major overhaul of federal agriculture programs in decades, including an end to the policy of paying farmers whether they grow crops or not.
The House has not produced its own farm bill, and any proposed legislation could face resistance from fiscal conservatives and lawmakers aligned with the Tea Party who want greater cuts in farm programs and food stamps. The House was expected to begin work on its own bill next week, but the majority whip, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, asked the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday to delay work on the bill until July 11. 
By eliminating such payments to farmers and farmland owners the Senate bill would make the highly subsidized crop insurance program the primary safety net when crop prices drop. Currently, the government subsidizes about 62 percent of the crop insurance premiums, and the policies typically guarantee 75 to 85 percent of a farmer's revenue.
The bill creates programs to protect farmers from additional revenue losses and to cover their insurance deductibles.
The legislation also would add more money for programs for specialty crop growers, like farmers who grow fruits and vegetables. Produce growers have traditionally received few subsidies from the federal government. The proposed farm bill would expand block grants to states for research and promotion of fruits and vegetables.
''This is a strong farm bill for specialty crops,'' said Robert Guenther, senior vice president for public policy at the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers.
The Senate legislation also would repeal a longstanding provision in the farm bill that prevents farmers who get direct payments for growing commodity crops like wheat and corn from growing fruits and vegetables. The restrictions would be lifted because growers of commodity crops would lose their direct payments.
Farmers in the Midwest who have long complained about the planting restrictions say they are also glad to see them end.
One farmer, Jack Hedin of Rushford, Minn., was forced to pay $9,000 in fines in 2008 after planting watermelons, tomatoes and vegetables on 25 acres of land that he rented from a farmer who got direct payments.
Mr. Hedin said the ending of direct payments and the planting restrictions was long overdue.
''It's a good thing for the fruit and vegetables growers like myself who are in the Corn Belt, where everyone gets direct payments and farmers who wanted to grow produce have limited access to land because of the restrictions,'' he said.
The spending cuts in the Senate bill, which amounts to $23 billion, come largely from the elimination of direct payments, which cost about $5 billion a year, and cutting about $4.5 billion from the food stamp program.
A vote by the full Senate is expected Thursday afternoon, said the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.
Southern farmers, especially peanut growers, have opposed the bill because it ends direct payments. The farmers argue that crop insurance would not provide an adequate safety net for them.
A number of budget watchdog and environment groups have also opposed the Senate legislation. A major point of contention has been the crop insurance program, which cost about $7.3 billion last year, up from $951 million in 2000, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. A Congressional Budget Office report said the program could cost about $90 billion over the next 10 years.
Unlike its other farm programs, the government does not impose income caps or payment limits on crop insurance subsidies. But Wednesday evening the Senate voted 66 to 33 to cap payments in the crop insurance program for farmers reporting $750,000 or more in annual adjusted gross income. Another amendment added soil and water conservation requirements to the crop insurance program.
A recent report by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research group, found that 26 farm operations got more than $1 million in crop insurance subsidies last year. An amendment by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, that would have restored cuts to the food stamp program by cutting subsidies to companies that sell crop insurance was defeated.
Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, said the Senate bill failed to achieve real savings.
Mr. Ellis said that the bill plows savings from the cuts into two new programs for farmers and that despite the cuts, the new farm bill would cost 60 percent more than the last bill passed in 2008, which is expected to run more than $600 billion over 10 years.
''With farm country doing as well as it is and farm income at record highs, the Senate missed an opportunity to pass a bill with real reform,'' Mr. Ellis said.

HEADLINE: Those 857 Desks? A Message for the Candidates

BYLINE: By ADESHINA EMMANUEL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tourists trying to figure out how to reach the capital's monuments and museums on Wednesday found something on the National Mall that was not on their maps: 857 student desks arrayed near the Washington Monument.
Each desk represents one of the 857 students who drop out of high school in the United States every single hour, every single school day, according to the College Board, which arranged the display to underline its effort to urge presidential candidates to put education at the top of their to-do lists. 
The board had nearly a dozen people, iPads in hand, gathering signatures in nearly 100-degree weather for an online petition that said: ''If you want my support, I need to hear more from you about how you plan to fix the problems with education. And not just the same old platitudes. I want to know that you have real, tangible solutions, and that once in office, you're ready to take serious action. I'll be watching your acceptance speech at your party's convention.''
More than 22,000 people had signed the petition by Wednesday evening, with most signatures coming from people who had found it online.
The effort is part of the College Board's ''Don't Forget Ed!'' campaign, the organization's first venture into the world of politics.
On Tuesday, four semi-trucks brought the desks, and 50 people unloaded and arranged them, working eight hours in the sun.
The man responsible for executing the display is Adam Hollander, 38, of New York, executive creative producer for Brand Marketers. ''We now live in a very visual culture,'' he said, his complexion florid after hours in the sun on Tuesday. ''Now, you have to see it to believe it. Everybody hears that 857 number, but it doesn't really mean anything until you're able to see it.''
Lee and Gina Gloscoe of Nebraska, both 48, were strolling on the Mall on Wednesday with their three daughters when they saw the display.
''Of course we're wondering why would they be out in the middle of the hot, burning sun,'' said Mrs. Gloscoe, a speech pathologist. ''When we got here and read the sign, it was quite striking. It gives a good visual of the number of kids who are dropping out of school.''
Both President Obama and Mitt Romney, his presumptive Republican opponent, often mention the importance of education, usually in the context of fixing the country's economy and creating jobs, or of making college more affordable -- the subject of a speech by Mr. Obama in January. In a speech in May, Mr. Romney proposed allowing poor and disabled students to use federal money to attend any public, private or online school they choose.
A group of girls enrolled in a summer art camp stopped by the desks on display and offered their thoughts on education.
''I think it's really bad that we have enough money to fund wars and we have enough money to fund huge projects, but we don't have enough money to keep kids in school,'' said Hannah Getto, 13, of Michigan.
Gabrielle Moore, 14, of Virginia, did not buy the idea that changes to education should wait until the economy and the housing market recover. ''We don't know how long this is going to last, and we can't just push it to the side and wait until later,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Talking About Why Women Can't Have It All

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Anne-Marie Slaughter about why women can't juggle a high-powered job and being fully present as parents - at least not the way America's economy and society are structured today. 

 BODY:
The cover story for the July/August issue of The Atlantic is one bound to stir conversation - as it was meant to. In "," Anne-Marie Slaughter, the director of policy planning at the State Department under Hillary Rodham Clinton from 2009 to 2011, writes from personal experience about the reasons women can't juggle both the demands of a high-powered job and being fully present as parents - at least not with the way America's economy and society are structured today. After two years in Washington doing work she loved, she returned to academia at Princeton University, not because she didn't want to stay in public service, but because "juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible."
Professor Slaughter and I spoke by phone on the one evening we could both make work; she from a train just past the Baltimore tunnel, and me from my home office, with a steady stream of interrupting children on the cusp of bedtime. 
We spoke, too, from a small shared history: she began her academic career teaching at the law school I attended, and nearly two decades ago, I was one of the young women looking to her and others like her for guidance on how to combine career and family. We're both acutely aware of how lucky we have been to have the options we had. As she writes, millions of other working women face far more difficult circumstances than our narrow demographic. But we're also both aware of how the circumstances of professional life have had an impact on our choices. 
What follows isn't really an interview, but a conversation: a conversation about compromises, and about the myths ( ; and ) Professor Slaughter believes women have to stop perpetuating before both women and men can strike a better balance, and before women will be able to more readily achieve and maintain leadership positions. I am the "Q"'s, and she is the "A"'s, though we both had both questions and answers. In some places, I have edited our words for clarity.
Q.
Who did you write this for? Who were you hoping would read it, and be changed?
A.
 Mostly for younger women who are asking how on earth they're going to balance work and family, and who are profoundly dissatisfied with the answers that my generation is giving them. 
We say either "you can have it all" or "you can have it all, but not at the same time." The first is true only in extraordinary circumstances. It's no accident that one area where we see near parity among men and women as leaders is among presidents of Ivy League universities. That's because academia allows you to control your own time in a way most careers don't. I also wanted to say to my generation, "Hey, we're not actually helping by just repeating this mantra." For those of us who have managed who do it, we need to admit that we are the exception and not the rule. We need to stop congratulating ourselves and focus on the reality for most women. 
I'm hoping we can make space for women and men parents to ask for what they need. Men are equally constrained by career expectations from asking for room to have their family lives. The whole idea that you can't cut it if you have to go home is hard on any engaged parent. When I was dean [of the the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs], I was very conscious of openly saying "I have to go to a parent-teacher meeting. I have to go home for dinner." What kind of society doesn't let us say these things? People who have to pretend they're doing something else are just going to be miserable, and ultimately they're going to drop out. 
Q.
I'm getting a spate of requests from public relations people regarding male C.E.O.'s who want to talk to me about how they balance work and family. I told the last one that I'd talk to the C.E.O. if he'd tell me honestly whether he's the one trying to figure out what to do with his kids during the gap between school and camp, or if his wife is on that one (we didn't talk). What do you think is going on?
A.
Clearly they know this matters in terms of people choosing where to work, and that itself is an encouraging sign, even though in my experience the apparent trappings of the willingness to accommodate family life are far greater than the actual willingness to accommodate.
Q.
So what are the "trappings of the willingness to accommodate"?
A.
 The core question is: are you actually willing to make a trade-off between the perfect and the very, very good so that your employee can have enough time not just to "make it work" but to have a life that they are reasonably happy living. That's really what it comes down to.
Q.
Don't you think part of what's wrong lies in between how employers see that trade-off? It's not between the perfect and the good. It's between the appearance that you've done everything you possibly can by working 24/7 and some reasonable alternative. Perfection is not something you're going to achieve.
A.
No, that's true. You're not achieving perfection; you're achieving exhaustion. But that deep cult of "time macho" says somehow you're better and tougher and stronger if you work harder and longer. If people were in charge who had to balance something other than being in the office all the time, then we wouldn't have this culture.
Q.
Facebook C.E.O. Sheryl Sandberg has said that she regrets all the times she left work for family dinners, but didn't dare acknowledge publicly the reason she was leaving. Is that the kind of cultural change you're talking about?
A.
I think that's precisely what she needs to be saying, and I think that saying that is far more important than exhorting the younger generation to be more ambitious. If people think that they can go home, and have dinner with their kids and then go back to work, then that opens up a whole lot of space that's not currently there. 
Q.
 It seems like we're not talking about a change in policy, but a change in social culture. Does that make it harder?
A.
It is harder, but on the other hand, what we know about culture change is that there are tipping points. Norms can change dramatically. On the one hand, it's harder because we can't point to very specific things and say, change that, but once it starts changing, it's likely to change much faster than we'd expect. I'm basically trying to give people the space to start demanding those kinds of changes. 
It's like empowering nonsmokers to ask smokers to step outside. We need to have managers who will look at someone who's still in the office at midnight and say, look, you're not managing your time as well as the person who can do the same amount of work and be out of here by 6:30. Then, things change.
Imagine what kind of policies people would adopt if this idea that work and family life should balance, for everyone, was at the forefront of their minds. There are just countless places we could make changes without hurting productivity, and probably improve it. I frankly hope women and men will read this and start saying "why don't we do that?" or "why don't we ask for that?" or "why is this taboo to say?"
Even as a writer focused on issues of family, I have spent a fair amount of time at "doctors' appointments" rather than "children's doctors' appointments." It is surely easier for me to break that silence than it would be for many, but it still felt powerful, and honest, in a way I enjoyed. Can you - will you - change the way you talk about the intersection between family and work? Will changing the conversation really move the culture?

HEADLINE: Daily Report: EBay to Power a Data Center With Fuel Cells

BYLINE: DAVID F. GALLAGHER


HIGHLIGHT: EBay plans to build a data center that will draw its power from fuel cells rather than the national power grid, which is heavily dependent on coal plants, James Glanz reports in Thursday's New York Times. 

 BODY:
EBay plans to build a data center that will draw its power from fuel cells rather than the national power grid, which is heavily dependent on coal plants, James Glanz reports in Thursday's New York Times.
The project will make eBay the first major tech company to use fuel cells as a primary source for energy-hungry data centers. Environmental groups have issued a series of rebukes to Internet companies because of their heavy reliance on coal-fired power to run their centers.
EBay plans to use about six million watts of power generated on-site by fuel cells, which are a substantially cleaner and more efficient source of energy than coal, in the new data center in South Jordan, Utah. The company also operates PayPal, the online payment service, out of the South Jordan site. Bloom Energy, a private company in Sunnyvale, Calif., will make the fuel cells.
The new center will double the size of an existing data center there. The standard power grid will serve mainly as a source of backup power for the new center. Even so, the fuel cells will account for less than 15 percent of the energy needs of all eBay data centers around the country - a clue that the industry is likely to remain deeply dependent on the grid and its energy mix indefinitely.
"Does it have risk? Sure. Did it require investment? Sure. But it's an investment and a risk that is worth taking," said John Donahoe, president and chief executive of eBay. Mr. Donahoe and KR Sridhar, co-founder and chief executive of Bloom Energy, confirmed the fuel cell plans. EBay signed an agreement this week with Bloom for the fuel cells.
The cells are essentially large batteries whose charge is maintained by the hydrocarbon energy contained in natural gas. Fuel cells by various manufacturers have become more economically competitive with grid power in recent years as the price of natural gas has plummeted.

HEADLINE: In Need, in New York

BYLINE: ALEX MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: One in seven homeless people have served in the military. This year, at 25, I became one of those homeless veterans. 

 BODY:
A native of Chicago's South Side, I was raised in poverty. Several times my mother and I had to take refuge in other people's homes, and sometimes in shelters. I thought that by joining the Navy at 18, I would get the training and education I needed to improve my life and help my family. 
Yet once I was honorably discharged in 2008, with good conduct medals and, from a service-related injury, seven screws in my foot and ankle, I found the recession had left few available jobs. I worked as a server at a pizza joint and as a salesman at a retail store. Finally I did maintenance at the veterans hospital in the Bronx. I should have taken a full-time job there when it was available, but felt sure I could find something that paid higher. I was proud, and I was wrong. For a long time, I got by on the G.I. bill benefits and scholarship grants I received from going to community college and, more recently, the New School. But eventually I couldn't get by anymore; I couldn't even pay rent. 
One in seven homeless people have previously served in the military. This year, at 25, I became one of those homeless veterans.
One of my most vivid memories of New York City shelters is of watching a fellow black veteran having a heated argument with himself. The oddest thing was that no words were said - the man spit and sputtered and pounded his fist on his chest, all while only moving his lips. It was as if a mime was violently illustrating anger to a person who had never experienced it. 
It reminded me of a conversation I'd once had in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Bored of waiting to hit land, which could take two months or more, my shipmates and I made up games. One such game, which we called "Wish List," was simple. We had to envision the most extravagant thing we'd do in order to get an early discharge from the Navy. One guy said he'd pretend he was crazy - eat foreign objects and pull his pants down while pledging allegiance to Harvey the pooka instead of the United States of America. That got laughs.
 It was hard to laugh at that veteran in the shelter, though. And others were worse off than he. The mistake that the shelter system makes is to clump everyone together. Those unstable vets lay in cots directly next to stable soldiers who lay next to ex-cons with any number of offenses. It was hard sleeping at night not knowing how innocent or guilty the former prisoner in the bed next to me was. Just about every shelter had gang members or former gang members and stories of violence and theft. Sadly, there was always someone who had taken, or at least claimed to have taken, the life of another. There was speculation that sex offenders were being quietly shuffled through the system, too. 
I experienced firsthand the frustrations veterans feel in shelters each day. We were told how little we mattered by social workers with limited patience and even less training in working with recently deployed soldiers, and pushed into applying for public assistance. I wanted a job, not welfare, but I was told that no New York City shelter would house me if I didn't apply for food stamps and warned I would fail to find work. 
Despite the setbacks, I am grateful for some of the acquaintances I made. I met a former service member who worked for NASA before a crack addiction led to theft, a prison sentence and homelessness. I got to know an Army doctor who served in Vietnam. Doc, as we called him, lost it during combat and even admitted to enjoying killing people, but his charm and patience made that hard to believe. Another former-Navy man was an astronomy geek, just like me, so we hit it off instantly. 
In the beginning, I blamed the government for our fate, for training us for sophisticated equipment that is found only in the military, thus limiting our job opportunities in the civilian world, and for failing to put better safeguards in place to keep veterans off the streets. I pointed fingers at my college for only granting me a small sum for food and transportation while my world was crumbling. I even found fault with my mother, for dying and leaving me and my siblings to pay for her funeral and burial costs. 
But ultimately, my experience has made me realize that I'm more responsible for my situation than I'd like to admit. Drinking to excess and my uncanny ability to withstand hardship when help should be requested are two of the main culprits. Today I'm focusing on my education; I moved out of the shelter last month and am now living in a beautiful duplex in New Jersey. I have been able to find purpose in all of this: a persistent determination to do better for myself, ironically the very lesson the Navy instilled in me when I joined eight years ago.

HEADLINE: Losing Faith in American Institutions

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The downward spiral in Americans' trust is not unique to government, though, and it's also not terribly recent. 

 BODY:
As Tyler Cowen (and then I) wrote about earlier this week, trust in government is declining.
The decline in American trust is not unique to government, though, and it's also not terribly recent.
Gallup has just released its latest figures on Americans' confidence in various institutions. The numbers are all pretty grim, with new lows recorded for Americans' confidence levels in public schools, churches, banks and television news.
These latest record-lows were within the margin of sampling error for last year's measurements, I should note, but the longer-term trend is still down, down, down.
Here's an interactive chart I put together showing the share of Americans who have expressed "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in a selection of major institutions since 1973:
Click on almost any category charted in the graph above, and you'll see that confidence has generally been falling. (Mousing over individual data points will show you the specific share of American adults expressing confidence in any given year, too.) 
Institutions that have enjoyed a relatively steady increase in public confidence -- like the military -- are the exception.
It's not clear why trust in so many major institutions is falling. Clearly the trend predates the financial crisis. Maybe more combative political rhetoric is to blame. Maybe it's a more sensationalistic, 24-hour news media cycle. Maybe it's the rising "myth of the meritocracy," as Christopher Hayes argues in his new book.
Or maybe the relative transparency afforded by the Internet age has given Americans more evidence that the organizations they used to trust can make mistakes.
In any case, if these trends continue, they could further diminish the potency of various policy tools, as Mr. Cowen explained.
(Results for the latest Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted June 7-10 with a random sample of 1,004 adults, 18 or older, living in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. The maximum margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.)

HEADLINE: In Kampala, Classics Have Their Day in the Sun

BYLINE: JULIA MAYERSOHN


HIGHLIGHT: At a car show held recently in the Ugandan capital, "classic" was in the eye of the beholder. 

 BODY:
KAMPALA, Uganda -- "Auto shows have not been big in Uganda," said the listing in The Kampala Sun, a tabloid newspaper here. "However, we are getting there. This Vintage and Classic Auto Show at the Sheraton should prove that Uganda's 'automobility' is high."
Uganda might be among the poorest countries in the world, with exceptionally poor health indicators and teetering infrastructure, but that would not stop Kampala's car enthusiasts from enjoying a day out in their finery. Recovering from the riots and rampant inflation of 2011, the capital is in a bullish mood.
And so it was, while most of the city was watching the soccer match against Congo Brazzaville last weekend -- the Uganda Cranes won, 4-0 -- a certain subset of the city convened on the grounds of the Sheraton Kampala Hotel.
The Sheraton is a favored gathering place for the city's elite, but the crowd at the auto show would not be unsuited to a cruise night in any city in America. The owners were overwhelmingly male, compelled by nostalgia or a sense of duty to maintain a grandfather's car, and seemed glad to bask in the cachet of showing off their restored beauties.
Most owners I spoke with were proud that their cars were in original condition, some claiming that the cars were on their original set of tires. Not so Sabiita Kiwanuka, who bought his 1958 Mercedes-Benz sedan in the United States, imported it and restored it. He said he was required to touch up the paint and replace the side-view mirrors after run-ins with Kampala's army of "boda boda" motorcycle taxis, who dart through the city traffic.
The owners of this '76 Volkswagen Microbus, meanwhile, offer guided safaris. Six-inch heels optional.

HEADLINE: A Darkening Jobs Picture

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The latest weekly employment forecast from Moody's Analytics is looking for weaker gains this month and for the crucial period before the election. 

 BODY:
The jobs picture is darkening. The latest batch of economic data has been fairly weak, especially surveys from the manufacturing sector. As a result, The Times's weekly jobs tracker, based on forecasts from Moody's Analytics, now shows a projected employment gain of only 125,000 in June, down from a projection of 150,000 last week.
Economists at Moody's write:
June is shaping up as another difficult month for the U.S. job market, raising the odds that the Federal Reserve will have to do more, potentially as soon as August. ...
Manufacturing has been the backbone of the recovery, but industry is showing signs of fatigue; factory output has declined in two of the past three months. Manufacturers' confidence appears to have been rattled, as the first two regional manufacturing surveys for June were weak, including the employment details. ...
Initial jobless claims failed to drop appreciably in the week ending June 16, leaving them up 15,000 between the May and June payroll survey weeks. The four-week moving average of new filings is at its highest level this year. Still, initial claims haven't spiked, which signals that businesses are retrenching.
With Moody's also downgrading its projections for July and August, the latest outlook revises the projected average monthly job growth for the six-month period before the presidential election to 149,000, from last week's 157,000. That is still squarely in the range historically associated with a close electoral outcome, but not an encouraging direction for the incumbent.

HEADLINE: Dreaming Up Whole New Carbon Markets

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: The Department of Energy weighs the possibility of developing a market for carbon dioxide as a commercial product. 

 BODY:
Normally, when supporters of renewable energy talk about carbon markets, they're referring to a system of traded credits that industries buy to compensate for their emissions of greenhouse gases, like the ones already sold in Europe and under development in California and Canada. But at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum-Wall Street, an annual conference organized by the American Council on Renewable Energy, the talk on Wednesday was of developing a different kind of carbon market where the gas would be bought and sold like a commodity to encourage carbon capture.
Although carbon capture projects have stumbled lately, oil companies buy carbon dioxide, usually in individual transactions, for a process known as enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon dioxide is pumped into the ground to force extra oil out of the fields. But naturally occurring carbon is in decline, and there is more demand than can be met, said Ann E. Banks, chief commercial officer of the Summit Power Group, which is developing a project that will pipe carbon dioxide captured from gasified coal to help extract oil in West Texas.
The Department of Energy is therefore looking into the potential for developing the other carbon market. In the conference's keynote address, Richard Kauffman, a senior adviser to Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, said that such a market could play an important role in increasing domestic oil production and lowering emissions. There are other uses, too, like feeding algae, which can produce biofuel; stimulating plant growth in greenhouses; and turning it into a coolant for air conditioners. 
"Imagine a market developing - a commercial market -- for CO2," he said, adding, "We might find that there are a lot of uses for it."

Mr. Kauffman, a former investment banker and private equity investor who joined the Energy Department last September, did not offer details on what such a market might look like, and he emphasized that it was only one of several ideas under discussion to encourage the spread of alternative energy. Other potential steps to lower the cost of financing renewable energy projects include allowing the use of master limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts for clean-tech ventures, developing new financing structures with the Department of Defense, and creating business models for utilities that allow them to thrive even though they are selling less electricity as more residential and commercial customers begin generating their own power.
 "Let's keep thinking about ways to harness market forces to achieve both policy and investment goals," he said.

HEADLINE: In Detroit, the Green Garage Is a Different Kind of Incubator

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: Tom Brennan would like to see a start-up culture that's a rough analogue of the slow-food movement: intimate, deliberate and unhurried. 

 BODY:
Built in 1920, the brick warehouse at 4444 Second Avenue in Detroit used to be a showroom for the city's pride: Model T-based automobiles. Now it's a metaphor for urban reinvention. Last fall, the building reopened as the Green Garage, a living laboratory and co-working space for the what its owners, Tom and Peggy Brennan, see as the future of Motown -- triple-bottom-line sustainable enterprises that define success by social and environmental measures as well as by financial profit.
Not everyone can envision a future in this place. Even as the postbailout auto industry shows signs of life, Detroit's landscape, with its derelict skyscrapers, abandoned homes and shrinking population, has become a potent symbol of economic collapse. But the Brennans see the potential for new growth here. Though Detroit already has several business incubators, the Green Garage, they say, will walk a different path. 
Mr. Brennan says he believes that traditional incubator and accelerator programs extrude entrepreneurs through a mechanized, one-size-fits-all process, sometimes spurring founders to charge ahead without first finding clarity on what they want to do, or why. Instead of focusing on acceleration, he's working to build a start-up culture that's a rough analogue of the slow-food movement: intimate, deliberate, unhurried. It's an organic approach he knows won't be for everyone.
In traditional programs, he said, "We have people who have an idea being told that they need to have a business plan. They need to have an elevator pitch. They need to take out a loan. They need to create a legal entity. They need to pay for some marketing advice and an attorney. But the punch line of the thing is at the end of that, they're broke. Because they have a legal entity, they have a business plan, they have a loan that has to be paid this month. But they don't have a business."
Mr. Brennan is a 59-year-old Michigan native who spent most of his career at the global consulting firm Accenture, where he worked with large multinational clients, including several members of the Fortune 50. For him, it's a tremendous shift to be working with small, triple-bottom-line ventures that he hopes will turn a profit while reaping social and environmental benefits, too.
"At first, I felt like I was coming in with this major backhoe, when what you needed was a little shovel," Mr. Brennan said, describing the downscaling process. "Small is big. We think that it's the cumulative affect of all the small changes that is really going to be the big thing."
More than 200 community volunteers came together to help design and renovate the Green Garage. In accordance with its eco-friendly mission, they used mostly reclaimed materials, generated just one-and-a-half Dumpsters' worth of waste, and used passive means - a white roof, triple-glazed windows and extra-thick insulation - to cut the building's energy demand by 90 percent. The remaining demand is provided by renewable means. (Thanks in part to a solar-powered system for climate control that circulates hot water through pipes below the floor, the heating bill for one year -- harsh Michigan winters included -- is about what a traditionally outfitted building one-twentieth of the Green Garage's size would pay, Mr. Brennan said.)
So far, the 11,500-square-foot space has attracted more than 20 one- to five-person companies. Participants brainstorm together in small working groups. They share gardening chores in a newly greened alley alongside the building. Each Friday, they break bread with visitors from the community at large .
They lease their Green Garage work spaces at rates ranging from $50 a month for an open chair at one of the room's shared tables to $1,000 for an office-size area that fits four to five people. The Brennans also plan to generate revenue by offering consulting services to outside businesses pursuing triple-bottom-line strategies.
A few of the in-house businesses, like Dickinson by Design, which makes furniture and renovates homes using recycled materials, are already established and humming along; the company's founder, Chad Dickinson, moved to Detroit from Nashville and just hired his first employee. Other enterprises are new and finding their way, eschewing traditional means of financing - Mr. Brennan isn't big on loans that burden still-developing plans with debt - and looking to the community for help, ideas and materials. One such start-up, De-tread, plans to harvest the thousands of discarded tires that are a blight and health hazard around the city and turn the rubber into new products, including floor mats for cars, a good match for automobile manufacturers that have started pledging to include recycled content in new vehicles.
Jason Peet, 34, who interviews potential Green Garage residents, is the founder of a start-up called Mend, which uses old-growth beams from Detroit homes slated for demolition and refashions them into tables and housewares, each accompanied by a historical account of the home where the materials originated. Before joining the Green Garage, Mr. Peet attended a seminar at another incubator for local businesses. "They had this whole fast-track program, it gets you to a business plan very quickly," he recalled. At the time, however, Mr. Peet was going through a divorce, had a 6-year-old son, and didn't want to take out a loan to get the capital he'd need for a speedy start.
He switched tracks after meeting Mr. Brennan, who gave him a job as a carpenter on the Green Garage's renovations, a way to pay his bills while working to conceive Mend on the side. A year later, Mr. Peet said, he's reached the prototype stage for Mend, while keeping his finances intact.
"I haven't really come out of pocket for it," he said, adding that he feels good about the slow and measured growth of his plan. "The core needs to be real solid before you go forward."
What do you think? Would you want to be part of a collaborative business community like the Green Garage?

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
A long-simmering fight between Republican lawmakers and the Obama administration sharply escalated on Wednesday, as a Congressional panel recommended that the House of Representatives cite Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. for contempt, Charlie Savage reports. Before the vote, the White House had moved to invoke executive privilege to shield Justice Department documents from disclosure, the first time that President Obama had asserted his secrecy powers in response to a Congressional inquiry.

        
Three $1 million contributions in May gave a boost to the fortunes of the Democratic "super PAC" backing President Obama. Still, Michael D. Shear and Derek Willis report, Mr. Obama's campaign expressed concern about the fall, with one adviser saying, "Make no mistake, we will be outspent."

        
To a remarkable degree, Mitt Romney's financial haul has hinged on his relentless personal cultivation of contributors, a political ritual for which President Obama has shown little enthusiasm and Senator John McCain, the last Republican nominee, displayed outright disdain. The result is an infusion of high-dollar donations that account for the vast majority of Mr. Romney's campaign contributions and helped him outraise Mr. Obama last month, a symbolic and psychological milestone that set off alarms with the Democratic political world, Michael Barbaro reports.

        
For more than a year now, Republicans in Washington have been trying to establish themselves as champions of domestic energy by pressing the case that White House regulations are putting a damper on production, Jonathan Weisman writes. But some voters in Western Pennsylvania are asking, "What regulations?"

        
The farm bill under debate in the Senate would be the nation's first major overhaul of federal agriculture programs, but the House has not produced its own version, and any proposed legislation could face stiff resistance from fiscal conservatives who want greater cuts in farm programs and food stamps, Ron Nixon reports. By eliminating payments to farmers and farmland owners, the Senate bill would make the highly subsidized crop insurance program the primary safety net when farm prices drop.
Around the Web

        
Both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are in dire debt stemming from their failed presidential runs, with Mr. Gingrich even selling a used laptop computer to raise money, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama will deliver remarks calling on Congress to stop interest rates on student loans from doubling on July 1.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., top White House advisers and professional athletes will gather to formally release a new public service announcement about dating violence.

        
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will join John Skipper, the president of ESPN, for an announcement regarding international efforts to empower women and girls through sports.

HEADLINE: Presidential Geography: Montana

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The state is undergoing fundamental shifts - in its population, its economy and its politics. 

 BODY:
Montana was an unexpected battleground in 2008. After giving George W. Bush victories of 21 percentage points in 2004 and 25 percentage points in 2000, Senator John McCain just barely won the state's three electoral votes in 2008, edging out President Obama 49 percent to 47 percent.
In 2012, however, the battle is likely to miss Montana. Both campaigns have largely left the state alone, and most observers expect Mitt Romney to win Montana fairly easily. Even the Obama campaign counted the state as Mr. Romney's in an electoral map featured in a campaign video. 
Still, 20-plus percentage point Republican victories in Montana will probably be harder to come by in the future. The state is undergoing fundamental shifts, in its population, its economy and its politics. FiveThirtyEight spoke with David Parker, an associate professor of political science at Montana State University (he also writes for Big Sky Political Analysis).
Most of the plains counties in eastern Montana, traditionally the most conservative part of the state, have been losing population for years. During the last several decades, mining and agriculture - top industries in the region - both soured for long stretches of time, causing a slow exodus. In Garfield County, one in five people left during the 1990s.
At the same time, western Montana has seen a large influx of migrants from the West Coast, from more liberal cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Many outdoor-loving entrepreneurs, untethered from their customers by the spread of high-speed Internet, have relocated to western Montana's mountainous landscape, helping to make the region's economy more diverse than the eastern part of the state, and less dependent on resource extraction (although, to the east's growing resentment, the entire state benefits from the current energy boom).
Most of Montana's Democratic strongholds are in the west. In 2008, Mr. Obama did well in Butte and Anaconda, old mining towns where the ore is mostly gone but the union ethos remains; Helena, the state capital; and university towns like Missoula and Bozeman. Mr. Obama also won counties in the north and west with Native American reservations.
The flight from eastern Montana and influx into western Montana have combined to make the state more friendly to Democratic politicians, particularly in state-level races. Montana has a Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and two Democratic senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester. (Mr. Tester is up for re-election in 2012 and being challenged by a Republican who is Montana's lone representative, Denny Rehberg. The Senate race, which is very close, is receiving the bulk of the political attention in the state.) 
But Montana's slow shift toward the political center is not guaranteed to continue. For one thing, even as conservative areas have lost population, party loyalty has waned, making voting behavior harder to predict. 
Furthermore, hydraulic fracturing - commonly known as fracking - has recently unleashed an oil boom on the Bakken shale field, which extends over northeastern Montana. Bakken oil is a major reason Montana's unemployment rate has consistently been lower than the national average, as thousands of jobs have been created. The flood of migrants moving to Montana to fill those jobs may alter the state's political balance, perhaps arresting or even reversing the loss of population on Montana's eastern plains. But it is still unclear what impact the newcomers might have.
The Bellwether: Yellowstone County
Home to Billings, the state's largest city at just over 100,000 people, Yellowstone County in 2008 voted for Mr. McCain by a margin of 6 percentage points. That's almost exactly in line with the state's Cook Political Report Partisan Voting Index score, R+7. And in the past three presidential elections, the two party vote shares in Yellowstone County have consistently been just 2 or 3 percentage points more Republican than the state.
The Bottom Line
The FiveThirtyEight model gives Mr. Obama just a 17 percent chance of winning Montana. And even if the nation's tepid economic recovery suddenly gained steam, it's not clear Mr. Obama's prospects in Montana would improve as much as they might in other states. Montana's economy is already relatively healthy.
If the first state in our Presidential Geography series, New Mexico, holds the potential to be a high water mark in a Republican wave election, Montana likely represents the reverse: one of the most Republican states that could be won by a Democratic presidential candidate in a Democratic wave election.
But 2012 will probably not be that election.

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Resigns

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: John E. Bryson announced his resignation as President Obama's commerce secretary on Thursday following an incident in which he had a seizure and was involved in a sequence of automobile accidents. 

 BODY:
8:54 p.m. | Updated WASHINGTON - John E. Bryson announced his resignation as President Obama's commerce secretary on Thursday, citing medical reasons after an episode in which he had a seizure and was involved in a sequence of car crashes.
Mr. Bryson, a longtime California electricity conglomerate executive, served in the cabinet for just eight months and had kept a low profile in Washington during his short tenure. But that changed when he was found unconscious behind the wheel of his car in California earlier this month after reportedly hitting two other vehicles.
Although tests for Mr. Bryson are continuing, a Commerce Department official said a neurologist has diagnosed a complex partial seizure, which can affect brain function and leave a person in a state of confusion. He had never had a seizure before and did not have any known health ailments, the official said, and he had limited recollection of the episode.
After initially taking a medical leave, Mr. Bryson decided on Wednesday to step down from his job and talked with Mr. Obama by telephone that night. He then sent the president a letter making his decision formal, and announced it on Thursday morning to department employees.
"The work that you do to help America's entrepreneurs and businesses build our economy and create jobs is more important now than ever and I have come to the conclusion that I need to step down to prevent distractions from this critical mission," Mr. Bryson wrote to his staff.
Mr. Obama released a statement in which he thanked Mr. Bryson and invited him to the Oval Office to pose for pictures, but neither man made any comments or took questions. "As secretary, John fought tirelessly for our nation's businesses and workers, helping to bolster our exports and promote American manufacturing and products at home and abroad," Mr. Obama said in the written statement.
Rebecca M. Blank, the deputy commerce secretary who has been serving as acting secretary since Mr. Bryson took a leave, will continue to run the department, with its $7.5 billion budget and 47,000 employees worldwide. Given the short time left before Congress leaves town for the fall election campaign, it may be difficult for the president to recruit, vet, nominate and confirm a permanent replacement.
The White House heaped praise on Ms. Blank, and Mr. Obama could leave her in place until after the election, when he will know whether he has a second term. Given the political attention on the economy, however, he may feel pressed to name a nominee before then.
Mr. Bryson, 68, the former chief executive of Edison International in Southern California and a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, was nominated in May 2011 and, after a brief struggle in the Senate, was confirmed last October.
While in office, he summarized his priority with the phrase "build it here and sell it everywhere," focusing on supporting manufacturing, increasing exports and encouraging more companies to locate or expand operations in the United States. He eschewed the Washington scene, spending much of his time visiting businesses across the country.
Democrats praised him on Thursday and Republicans, in deference to his health, generally remained quiet.
"I have great respect for John and his desire to resign in an effort to make sure there are no distractions toward job growth and advancing America's businesses and entrepreneurs for a full economic recovery," Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the commerce committee, said in a statement.
Mr. Bryson, who has a home in San Marino, Calif., was there to deliver a commencement address at the private school his four daughters had attended when he experienced the seizure. Driving a Lexus in suburban San Gabriel on June 9, Mr. Bryson rolled into the back of a Buick waiting at a train crossing, according to authorities. After talking briefly with the other driver, he got back into his car and hit the Buick again as he was driving off, the police said. Minutes later, he crashed into the rear of another car about two miles away.
Mr. Bryson was cited for a hit-and-run accident. Authorities reported no indications of illegal drugs or alcohol, although they were waiting for final tests. No one was seriously hurt, and damage to the cars was minor.

HEADLINE: Washington Mutual's Former Chief Takes Issue With Book's Portrayal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Kerry K. Killinger, the bank's chief executive until his ouster in 2008, is taking issue with a new book about Washington Mutual. 

 BODY:
A new book about Washington Mutual, The Lost Bank, by Kirsten Grind, has been praised for its in-depth account of biggest bank failure in the nation's history.
But one reader wasn't such a fan: Kerry K. Killinger, who was the bank's chief executive until his ouster in 2008.
Mr. Killinger said the book had "major inaccuracies," according to a letter sent to "family and friends" and obtained by DealBook. The book, Mr. Killinger says, sets aside certain aspects of the collapse of the bank, which was sold at a fire-sale price to JPMorgan Chase after being seized by the government during the financial crisis.
"It is important to me [sic] set the record straight," Mr. Killinger says in the letter.
"I strongly disagree with certain personal accounts in the book, which came from sources with personal, business or political agendas or unbalanced points of view," he continues.
Mr. Killinger, who is described in the book as a relentlessly ambitious chief executive, pushing his bank to make ever-riskier loans against the advice of his chief risk officer, says in the letter that Washington Mutual made an effort to reduce residential lending when "the outlook for housing changed." He says the book "largely ignores" this attempt to reduce the bank's exposure.
In addition, Mr. Killinger argues that many in the financial industry failed to predict the extent of the housing collapse, a point that he says the book "largely misses." 
Ms. Grind, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal who covered Washington Mutual for the Puget Sound Business Journal in Seattle, defended her account of the bank's final years.
"What this kind of letter shows is that there's still this failure of some financial company executives to really come to terms with what they did," she said. "The vast volume of people I spoke with for this book would say the exact opposite of what's in this letter."
The book does include some of the topics that Mr. Killinger says are missing. "Acceptance about the housing market's invulnerability was pervasive," Ms. Grind writes. "It originated at the top levels of government and trickled down from there."
Neither Mr. Killinger nor his attorney responded to e-mails and phone messages requesting comment.
Mr. Killinger declined to be interviewed for the book, he says in the letter. He spoke with Ms. Grind in 2010 for a story in the Puget Sound Business Journal ahead of his Senate testimony. But he declined additional interviews, he says, when "it seemed clear to me that the book would not be fair and balanced."
Ms. Grind said she repeatedly asked Mr. Killinger for comment.
"I really wish he had talked to me. I think he should have," she said. "A lot of people who were under similar stress and controversy did."
Last week, a reviewer said the book's account was balanced.
"Grind manages to make the wonky accessible and portray her characters as fallible human beings, as opposed to the usual Wall Street caricatures," wrote Gavin Aronsen in Mother Jones.
The full letter from Mr. Killinger is below.
Dear Family and Friends,
A new book on Washington Mutual titled The Lost Bank was released this week, and it contains a number of inaccuracies. As my closest family and friends, it is important to me [sic] set the record straight on some of book's major inaccuracies. While I am unable to address all of the book's many inaccuracies, the below addresses some of its larger issues.
Washington Mutual had long-term plans to grow most of its business lines, but these plans were changed and actions were taken to reduce residential lending when the outlook for housing changed. The Lost Bank largely ignores the many steps that Washington Mutual's board and management took to reduce the company's exposure to the housing market. As one example, the company reduced residential first mortgage loan originations by 74 percent from 2003 to 2007, dramatically reducing market share while many competitors were growing market share. The board and management reasonably believed that these measures along with the billions of new capital raised would be sufficient for the company to weather the financial storm.
The book also largely misses the point that most sophisticated participants in the financial industry failed to accurately predict the extent of the national housing downtown [sic]. Included among those who did not predict the magnitude of the downturn are past and present Chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, virtually all leading economists and leaders of institutions ranging from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to AIG, Citibank, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, to name just a few, in addition to Washington Mutual. Any fair recounting of the financial crisis would note that any errors made in failing to anticipate the severity of the housing collapse were made collectively by the entire financial industry and the government.
I loved Washington Mutual and tirelessly built the company for the long term. I accept responsibility for the company's performance under my leadership and I know that the board and management always did what they believed was in the best long-term interests of the company. It is a gross understatement to say that I am greatly saddened that the company is not here today and that it was not provided the many benefits and programs that were so beneficial to large Wall Street banks when the financial crisis reached its peak.
Further, I strongly disagree with certain personal accounts in the book, which came from sources with personal, business or political agendas or unbalanced points of view.
Two years ago, I met with the author of this book, which was the only meeting with a reporter I granted since leaving Washington Mutual. Subsequently I declined to participate in the writing of the book or be further interviewed, because it seemed clear to me that the book would not be fair and balanced. For example, the following information, which is very instructive about what was really going on at Washington Mutual, was provided to the author, and, it was largely ignored in the book:
Retail Banking was Washington Mutual's largest and most important business while residential lending was a smaller and declining part of the company's business beginning in 2004. For example, from 2003 through 2008, core retail bank checking accounts grew by 58 percent while residential first-mortgage lending declined by more than two-thirds. Providing customers great value and friendly service was a core value of the company.
Washington Mutual's board approved a strategic plan to gradually increase the sub prime and option ARM portfolios over a number of years. However, as the company became more cautious on the outlook for housing, it reduced the subprime channel and option ARM portfolios in 2006, 2007 and 2008. New option ARM loan originations declined by 65 percent from 2004 to 2007. This was not an accident but an intentional effort to limit risk to the company.
Washington Mutual's board and management took tough and decisive actions to reduce residential mortgage loan originations by 74 percent and cut its market share in half from 2003 to 2007. Actions included closing loan centers outside of its retail banking states in 2004, selling 30 percent of its loan-servicing portfolio in 2005, and cutting home loans group staffing by more than 50 percent from 2003 to 2007.
Subprime channel loans were always a small part of Washington Mutual's business. Actions taken in 2005, 2006 and 2007 greatly reduced loan originations and market share. New originations were eliminated in 2007. 94 percent of the loans held in Washington Mutual's option ARM portfolio at June 30, 2008 were originated with a loan-to-value of 80 percent or less and the average FICO score was 701.
On a final note, we enjoyed many years of great success, and I thank all of our outstanding employees for what they did. I also want to thank all of you for your continued kindness and support over the past few years. But most of all, I want to thank the love of my life, my wife Linda, who is always there for me. As many of you know, our first date was eleven years ago this month. It was the best thing to ever happen to me and I will always appreciate her love and support.
Thanks for letting me share these thoughts and I hope you and your family have a great summer.
Kerry

HEADLINE: The Debt Ceiling Escape Hatch

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: Will Democrats invoke the 14th amendment to protect the nation's credit? 

 BODY:
Last year, when House Republicans pushed the government to the point of default by threatening not to raise the debt limit, there was a lot of frantic talk about using the Constitution as an escape hatch. Because the 14th Amendment prohibits any action that raises doubt about the public debt, the theory went, President Obama could declare the ceiling unconstitutional and simply ignore the House's threat.
The idea was endorsed by Bill Clinton and several economic scholars, but it never really caught on among elected Democrats. Mr. Obama expressed skepticism about it, and Democratic leaders - who lack the confrontational DNA of their Republican counterparts - decided not to push it.

But now that Speaker John Boehner is promising a rerun of the whole fiasco within the next year, the Constitutional option is starting to have a little more appeal. On Wednesday, in a meeting with a group of columnists, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, urged the president to use the 14th Amendment to protect the nation's credit from another extortion attempt.
"You cannot put the country through the uncertainty" again, she said, according to Matthew Yglesias of Slate.
Ms. Pelosi's statement is an encouraging sign that Democrats may take a very different approach when Mr. Boehner reloads later this year or early next, whenever the current debt limit is reached. Led by Mr. Obama at his most nave, the Democratic reaction to last year's extortion was to negotiate, to seek a grand bargain that inevitably disintegrated when Republicans refused to raise taxes on the rich.
What they got instead was a brutal sequester of military and domestic spending-
parts of which are loathed by virtually everyone in Washington-that threatens to derail the economy when it begins next January. The crisis deeply damaged the country's financial reputation, produced a downgrade in its credit rating, and led to single-digit approval ratings of Congress.
Ms. Pelosi obviously doesn't want to go through that again, and it's hard to imagine why Mr. Obama would, assuming he is re-elected. If other Democrats begin pushing the idea that the debt limit is unconstitutional, it might stiffen the president's spine to use the option, particularly now that Republicans have stated they will never again raise the limit without getting huge spending cuts in return.
It's not as if he'd be ending a hallowed American tradition. The debt limit was always a fraud on the public, providing the illusion of a firm outside boundary to government borrowing when none was ever needed. Congress controls spending and taxes, and can raise or lower the debt as easily as it regularly used to increase the debt limit. A terrific 1961 editorial in the Times chided President Kennedy for not trying to repeal this "meaningless" statute.
Using the 14th Amendment option would lead to a messy fight, and the legal outcome is far from clear. But it's a fight worth having, because the alternative, as the country has seen, will be far worse.

HEADLINE: In Speech, Romney Takes Softer Tone on Immigration

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney on Thursday offered what he called a strategy for "bipartisan and long-term immigration reform" as he prepared to address a convention of Latino elected officials in Florida. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney on Thursday offered what he called a strategy for "bipartisan and long-term immigration reform" in an address to a convention of Latino elected officials in Florida.
In the speech, which also touched on the economy, Mr. Romney dropped the confrontational tone he took on immigration during the Republican primary. Instead, he promised to work in a series of areas to help immigrants and their families while discouraging people from coming to the country illegally.
"Immigration reform is not just a moral imperative, but an economic necessity as well," Mr. Romney said. "We can find common ground here, and we must. We owe it to ourselves as Americans to ensure that our country remains a land of opportunity - both for those who were born here and for those who share our values, respect our laws, and want to come to our shores."
But Mr. Romney, who has refused to say whether he would overturn a policy announced last week by President Obama that would stop the deportation of some illegal immigrants who were brought to the country as children, again sidestepped that question.
"Some people have asked if I will let stand the president's executive action," he said. "The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure."
Even as he started speaking, Mr. Romney's campaign released an outline of his plan, which would include giving green cards to immigrants who earn advanced degrees at American universities; providing a path to legal status for illegal immigrants who serve in the military; and cutting red tape.
"As president, I will stand for a path to legal status for anyone who is willing to stand up and defend this great nation through military service," Mr. Romney said.
The nearly twenty-minute speech was met with tepid applause and moments of pointed silence. He seemed to hit his stride near the middle of his remarks, when he talked about balancing the budget, giving parents a choice of where to send their children to school, and providing a path to legal status for immigrants who have served in the military. At the end, about half the room stood up to applaud.
Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, said that the fact that Mr. Romney addressed the conference was a meaningful gesture.
"It was a great speech, I was real impressed with it and I'm glad he came," Mr. Bush said. "I think he was received respectfully and warmly."
Democrats criticized Mr. Romney on immigration issues even before the speech was delivered.
In a memo to reporters, Bill Burton, a founder of Priorities USA Action, a "super PAC" backing Mr. Obama, wrote that Mr. Romney was attempting to hide his real views on the issue from voters.
"Mitt Romney's speech in Florida today will be an attempt to cover up the divisive rhetoric and draconian policies he has espoused for years on immigration," Mr. Burton wrote. "Today's slick speech will not change the fact that Romney has repeatedly used divisive language to propose an extreme immigration policy."
The issue of immigration is shaping up as a critical one in the presidential election. Mr. Romney trails President Obama by wide margins among Hispanic voters, a gap which could provide the difference in important swing states like Colorado, Nevada, Florida and Virginia, where Latino populations are growing.
Mr. Obama is scheduled to speak to the same group on Friday. But for now, the pressure is on Mr. Romney to increase his appeal among Hispanic voters.
Advisers inside and outside Mr. Romney's campaign have urged him to shape a positive message to Hispanics on immigration and dispel the harsh image he created during the primaries.
"Ultimately what we're talking about here is the tone is what has hurt Republicans in the past, not the policies,'' said Alberto Martinez, an adviser and spokesman for the campaign on Hispanic issues.
But that effort is likely to run headfirst into some of Mr. Romney's conservative supporters. Many in the Republican base believe that any solution that lets illegal immigrants remain in the country is unacceptable. During the primary race Mr. Romney courted these voters with talk of "self-deportation" and his approval of Arizona's harsh immigration law.
In two previous addresses to Hispanic groups, Mr. Romney ignored immigration. On Wednesday the Romney campaign abruptly cut short a telephone press conference when all the questions were about immigration - and the campaign wanted to talk about the economy.
"The reason that immigration is important is not because it's the priority issue but because it's the issue that can turn Hispanics off,'' said Ana Navarro, a Florida-based adviser to Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2008. "If a candidate has the wrong tone and the wrong rhetoric on immigration, Hispanics won't listen to any of his proposals on anything else.
Ahead of the Florida speech on Thursday, Mr. Romney's campaign promised to forge "lasting solutions" to what he called the "nation's broken immigration system." He said he would work with both parties to pass immigration reform.
But the brief outline did not say how he would overcome the gridlock that has blocked comprehensive immigration reform in the Congress for more than a decade.
Senator McCain, Republican of Arizona, also promised to work with Democrats on illegal immigration reform. He abandoned that effort in 2007 in the face of intense opposition by conservatives.
Mr. Obama also pledged during the 2008 campaign to pursue comprehensive changes to the immigration system in the country. The president increased border enforcement, but faced similar opposition among Republicans in Congress to pursuit of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.

HEADLINE: Indiana Governor to Be President of Purdue

BYLINE: STEVEN YACCINO


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana was unanimously voted the next president of Purdue University by the university's board. 

 BODY:
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana was unanimously voted the next president of Purdue University by the board of trustees on Thursday, making official what had been reported by a number of local and national news outlets this week.
Mr. Daniels, a Republican who cannot run for a third term because of term limits, will start as the university's 12th president in January. 
"No institution of any kind means more to Indiana today or tomorrow as Purdue University," Mr. Daniels said in a statement released by the university.
"Its research gives rise to the innovative new goods, services and companies on which American and Hoosier prosperity must be built," he added. "I can conceive of no other assignment in which a person has the chance to contribute more to building the kind of Indiana of which we dream."
Purdue, about an hour northwest of Indianapolis, enrolls around 75,000 students on its West Lafayette and regional campuses, and employs more than 18,000 people statewide. The university's president, France A. Crdova, announced last July that she would be leaving this summer.
Speculation that Mr. Daniels, a fiscal conservative popular within his party, would be trading a political career for the world of academia began on Tuesday, after unnamed sources close to the governor and the university confirmed that university trustees would be considering him as the next president on Thursday morning. Mr. Daniels' office and university officials declined to comment before the vote.
Now able to speak openly about the decision, the university is promoting its new leader as one that will boost its reputation.
"Gov. Mitch Daniels will continue to raise the global profile of Purdue," Keith Krach, the university's chairman, said in a statement. "He's committed to the success of our land-grant institution, he's an advocate for economic progress through innovative research and he's made Indiana the state to watch for the last several years."
Mr. Daniels declined to run for president last year, citing family concerns. His new post at Purdue also appears to put an end to speculation that Mitt Romeny was considering him as a potential vice presidential pick. 
"Effective immediately, I will recuse myself from any partisan political activities or commentary," said Mr. Daniels after the trustee vote, according to written remarks.
But out of the political spotlight for good?
"As governor of Indiana and prior to his time as an elected official, Mitch Daniels has been instrumental to the Republican Party," said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, "and he will continue to be a leader for conservative principles."

HEADLINE: An Earth Summit Draws on Oil, Mining and Utility Largess

BYLINE: TAYLOR BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: Energy and mining companies like Eletrobras, Petrobras and Vale are contributing about $10 million each to the sustainable development conference in Rio. 

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO - The cups at the water coolers here at Rio+20, the global sustainability conference taking place Wednesday through Friday, are made of rough biodegradable corn fiber rather than plastic. Vans running on second-generation ethanol made from sugar cane bagasse take conference members, free of charge, from the hotels on the Copacabana beach to the conference center an hour away. 
There, speedy Wi-Fi is offered to tens of thousands of participants so they can avoid printing out Rio+20 documents, and biodiesel generators power the million square feet of conference grounds.
Some of this is financed by millions of dollars in financial support from Brazil's largest energy, extraction and petroleum corporations. Those include businesses like the mining giant Vale, voted the "worst company of the year" in the 2012 Public Eye Awards, and Eletrobras, the state electricity company, a partner with Vale in developing the Belo Monte dam project on the Xingu River.
Environmental activists oppose the project, saying that it will drive out thousands of indigenous and other people by drying up the river and causing them to lose their livelihoods. The government has emphasized that no indigenous people will be forcibly removed from their land by the project.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States, asked Brazil last year to suspend dam construction until an agreement was reached with the indigenous communities; the government declined. 
Belo Monte is the largest among dozens of controversial dam projects planned in Brazil's Amazon region. Although various environmental groups have protested the Belo Monte project on the sidelines of Rio+20, relatively few seem to making a big point of the conference's corporate sponsorship.
Of the quarter-billion dollars or so that Brazil plans to spend on the conference, most -- some $210 million -- comes from a special government fund, according to official documents cited by the Brazilian newspaper Valor Econmico. About $10 million was contributed by each of the official Rio+20 partners, corporations including Vale, Eletrobras and Petrobras, the state oil company. The conference expenses primarily involve installations, logistics, transportation, accommodations and security. Some 20,000 soldiers, police officers, municipal guards and intelligence service agents have been deployed on Rio's streets for the event.
Friday, 4:56 p.m. | Updated Asked about its choice to accept corporate sponsorship from energy and mining companies, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it has specifically sought to include corporations to "bring these industries closer to environmental-friendly standards." All companies that presented themselves as "willing partners" of Rio+20 were accepted, it added. 
Eletrobras, which has a 49.98 percent stake in the Belo Monte dam, said in a statement that its sponsorship role was "appropriate" because of its investment in hydroelectric power, a clean energy source. It said that Brazil needed to increase its capacity by 5,000 to 6,000 megawatts a year to meet the demands of the nation's population of nearly 200 million, and that roughly 80 percent of potential hydroelectric production is in the Amazon region. 
Vale, which is investing $1.5 billion in the dam and has a 9 percent stake in the project, said it was acting as a Rio+20 sponsor so that the conference would have "a larger dimension and visibility for society over all, given the themes that are being discussed, which are of great interest to the business." 
Petrobras, which routinely finances cultural events and nongovernmental organizations in Brazil, is now aggressively developing (along with foreign oil companies) deepwater "pre-salt" oil reserves about 200 miles off Brazil's shores. The government has promoted the pre-salt find as a kind of national bounty set to catapult Brazil to the level of Arab oil-producing nations and elevate Venezuela's status as an oil exporter. 
But environmental groups like Greenpeace have complained that consumption of oil from the pre-salt fields could add 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere over the next 40 years. Petrobras's heavy investment in extracting the deepwater oil will assure that Brazil is petroleum-dependent for decades to come, the group adds.
The company emphasizes that it has been ranked on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for six years and is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, which commits businesses to aligning their operations with high principles on the environment, human rights and other causes. 
Such corporate participation in Rio+20 does not sit well with Danilo Chammas, a lawyer with (Justice on the Trails), the group that nominated Vale for the Public Eye Award. The group took part in a 2,000-strong protest on Tuesday in front of the company's headquarters in Rio.
 "It's a shame," he said, adding: "Many people should be questioning this."

HEADLINE: Dispatches from Rio: None from Obama?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: What President Obama might have said had he gone to the Rio environment summit. 

 BODY:
I understand why President Obama is not going to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio, which is a reprise of the 1992 Earth Summit there at which President George H. W. Bush and nearly all the world's leaders appeared. (He's skipping the conference despite taking direct heat in a YouTube message to Rio from Senator James Inhofe, the Republican of Oklahoma and steadfast ally of big coal and indirect heat from Senator John Kerry, the Democrat of Massachusetts who gave a long floor speech on global warming and the Rio meeting yesterday, decrying "the conspiracy of silence that now characterizes Washington's handling of the climate issue.")
Climate change is not, and never has been, a salient issue for American voters and -- despite the starkly different stances on this issue between the president and Mitt Romney -- won't be close to a deciding factor in November. The other issues in Rio are mostly trouble for an American president, having to do with foreign assistance, inequitable distribution of wealth and power, oceans (the United States is still blocked from ratifying the Law of the Sea treaty by a small Senate bloc) and efforts to find common approaches to conserving global assets like the planet's biological diversity -- a fight far beyond the power of a single leader to sway.
Keep in mind that Obama is hardly the only leader from a major power skipping the meeting. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain are among the missing. (President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria is among those taking heat at home for going.) A Guardian article, "Eurozone crisis and US presidential race 'damaged Rio+20 prospects'," sums things up pretty well.
Obama's stand-in, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, will surely do a fine job as the formal sessions conclude before the weekend. The White House has quietly promoted activities related to sustainable development. Still, it's worth considering what Obama might have said there or could say in a message to Rio from the White House, if he wanted to live up to his pledge, articulated in Rolling Stone this spring, to engage directly on addressing climate change. I mused on all of these points with John Hockenberry on the public radio program The Takeaway this morning. Here's a player to click to hear the segment, along with some transcribed highlights: 
When Hockenberry asked why Obama isn't going, I offered this hypothesis:
It's impossible to think about having substantial initiatives move forward when you're still fighting home-front issues like jobs.... This is just not a presidential politics issue. In a re-election year you don't step into a minefield when you know there are mines there that will explode and there's no upside in him going. It might strike some nice chords, but politically there's just no argument for him.
Hockenberry pressed in. Given that the basic science on global warming is settled and that an international process is still moving forward, he said, where's the political hazard? 
We didn't have time to explore evidence that there was a meaningful international process moving forward. I followed up with this broader point about an opportunity the president does have to make a case for a sustained push on energy choices that work for the long haul (yes, I know that long-haul strategies aren't a great fit for here-and-now politics):
A lot of us have written imagined speeches for President Obama, on opportunities he's had to project a new American imperative being energy. And actually one of the encouraging things in Rio and from the United Nations since the failure of Copenhagen is to broaden out and acknowledge that the world has two energy challenges. One is climate, in other words, how do you avoid overdosing on fossil energy, and the other is the fact that there are two billion people on the planet who still can't turn on a light bulb. 
And that's now a big imperative. And I think there's an argument, both domestically and globally, for a true leader to say that the world's imperative now, as we go through this crest of our population and consumption in the next few decades, is to find ways to energize societies. And I haven't seen that from him. You could do that without a political downside if you do it in the right way.

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Credit Ratings of 15 Big Banks

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: After putting banks on watch four months ago, Moody's Investors Service on Thursday cut the credit ratings of 15 large financial firms, in a move that could do lasting damage to their bottom lines and weigh on the markets. 

 BODY:
10:33 p.m. | Updated 
Already grappling with weak profits and global economic turmoil, 15 major banks were hit with credit downgrades on Thursday that could do more damage to their bottom lines and further unsettle equity markets.
The credit agency, Moody's Investors Service, which warned banks in February that a downgrade was possible, cut the credit scores of banks to new lows to reflect new risks that the industry has encountered since the financial crisis.
"The risks of this industry became apparent in the financial crisis," said Robert Young, a managing director at Moody's. "These new ratings capture those risks."
Citigroup and Bank of America, which have struggled to fully recover from the financial crisis, were among the hardest hit. After the downgrades, the banks stand barely above the minimum for an investment grade rating, a sign of the difficult business conditions they face.
Executives at the banks argued on Thursday that the new ratings failed to reflect the safeguards and changes that they had put in place in recent years.
The cuts come at a time of tumult within the industry. Banks have struggled to improve their profits against the backdrop of the European sovereign debt crisis, a weak American economy and new regulations.
The downgrades may amplify their problems. With lower ratings, creditors could charge the banks more on their loans. Big clients may also move their business to less-risky companies, further crimping earnings.
As bank profits falter, consumers could also be affected. Companies often try to make up for lost revenue by passing costs on to customers.
In the face of new regulations, banks have raised fees and other sources of income to bolster their business.
Moody's downgrades are part of a broad effort to make its analysis more rigorous. During the financial crisis, Moody's and its rivals got a black eye for placing high ratings on mortgage bonds that later imploded. 
Moody's approach reflects its belief that large banks have weaknesses that could still hurt their creditors.
Along with Citigroup and Bank of America, the credit rating agency took action on 13 other banks, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS, HSBC, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Crdit Agricole, Socit Gnrale, Royal Bank of Canada, and Royal Bank of Scotland.
But some analysts feel that Moody's is playing a game of catch-up. The latest actions, say critics, are backward-looking and do not consider the measures that banks have taken to strengthen themselves, including raising capital and getting out of certain risky businesses like proprietary trading.
"I feel that Moody's action is five years too late," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
The threat of a downgrade has rippled through the markets for months. After Moody's held out the prospect of a three-notch downgrade for Morgan Stanley in February, the bank's shares dropped by more than 25 percent. Moody's ended up cutting the firm's rating by two levels.
Now, bank executives will try to convince their creditors and large customers that Moody's has overreacted.
On Thursday, Citi said in a statement that Moody's approach "fails to recognize Citi's transformation over the past several years," adding that "Citi strongly disagrees with Moody's analysis of the banking industry and firmly believes its downgrade of Citi is arbitrary and completely unwarranted."
Bank of America echoed such sentiments: "In addition to strengthening our governance and risk management, Bank of America ended the first quarter of 2012 with record capital ratios."
Those capital positions, which are banks' main buffer against losses, could be a point of strength across the industry. The lack of capital in the crisis left the financial system vulnerable, prompting the government to bail out many of the largest banks. Since then, they have increased their cushions. Today, Morgan Stanley's capital is twice what it was in 2007.
"The banking system is safer today than any time in the last 30 years," said Mr. Cassidy. "We have not seen capital levels like this since the 1930s."
Even so, Moody's remains concerned. In its report Thursday, the credit rating agency said it saw several weaknesses in the banks' Wall Street operations, including their complexity and opacity. Moody's highlighted a history of volatile profits and problems with risk management.
In its review, Moody's mentioned the recent trading debacle at JPMorgan Chase. In May, the bank disclosed that a bet on financial instruments tied to corporate bonds had soured; those losses could reach $5 billion.
The agency also noted the industry's continued dependence on short-term loans to finance their Wall Street operations. This type of credit dried up quickly in the crisis, forcing them to borrow from the government.
Some banking experts welcomed the downgrades, saying the credit rating agencies were finally beginning to reflect the risks within large banks. "These downgrades are good news," said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University. "Right now, their balance sheets are very fragile."
The downgrades could widen the divide in the banking system.
Some customers may simply choose to transfer their business from the lowest-rated banks. One beneficiary may be JPMorgan Chase. It was downgraded two notches but still has a higher rating than Goldman Sachs.
Moody's may cut some of its ratings still further once a critical part of the financial overhaul comes into place. The Dodd-Frank legislation aims to give regulators the power to wind down large banks and inflict losses on banks' creditors in the process. Once these powers take effect, Moody's may downgrade the banks to reflect the fact that the government is less likely to bail out large banks.
Some analysts see the downgrades as only one step toward making the financial system safer. For one, the country does not have a coherent solution for dealing with large banks when they run into trouble, said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Crdit Agricole Securities.
"Will actions like this make the banking system safer? The jury's still out on that," said Mr. Mayo. "That's unfortunate four years after the crisis."
An earlier version of the article incorrectly stated that Bank of America's credit dropped by two notches. It dropped by one notch.

HEADLINE: As Facebook Seeks Answers, S.E.C. Investigates Exchanges

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS, EVELYN M. RUSLI and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Investor confidence in the markets has waned after problems on the day Facebook shares began trading. 

 BODY:
Nasdaq has blamed Facebook's botched debut last month on flawed computers and "technical errors."
Regulators suspect it may be something more. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into the exchange for its role in the initial public offering of Facebook, according to people briefed on the inquiry. Regulators are examining whether Nasdaq failed to properly test its trading systems, which broke down during the I.P.O., and whether the exchange violated rules when it rewrote computer code to jump-start trading.
The Facebook investigation comes after a broader inquiry into trading breakdowns and other problems at the nation's largest exchanges, including two previously undisclosed cases involving Nasdaq's archrival, the New York Stock Exchange, the people said.
The agency's enforcement unit, which has opened more than a dozen related cases, is examining whether exchanges lack adequate controls and favor select investors.
As investor confidence in the market wanes, the worry is that missteps by the exchanges are contributing to the dissatisfaction. Since the financial crisis, investors have seen their portfolios erode, prompting them to flee stocks.
"If exchanges have technical problems, that slows capital formation and erodes the confidence," said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who held a hearing this week on the initial public offering process.
While none of the exchanges has been accused of any wrongdoing and the S.E.C. may never take enforcement action, the crackdown represents a significant shift. Traditionally, the agency has been relatively cozy with the industry, which is increasingly under pressure to produce profits since the exchanges became publicly traded companies.
Along with the threat of enforcement cases, the S.E.C. has stepped up its inspections of exchanges and introduced several measures to improve the safety of the markets. For example, the agency has approved proposals that would help limit volatility in specific stocks, including circuit breakers that would halt trading.
 "Cases against exchanges are few and far between, and inevitably a big deal," said Stephen J. Crimmins, a partner at the law firm K&L Gates and a former enforcement official at the S.E.C.
Facebook's initial public offering highlights the problems facing exchanges - and how regulators are finding their responses lacking. 
On May 18, its first day of trading, Facebook got off to a rocky start. Nasdaq delayed the start of trading and later flooded the market with shares, adding to investor trepidation. 
Nasdaq's lack of communication - and at times, lack of contrition - aggravated the situation, according to documents and executives, bankers and regulators. On a May 31 call with the chairwoman of the S.E.C., Mary L. Schapiro, and other officials, Nasdaq's chief executive expressed confusion about the S.E.C.'s aggressive approach.
"We're regulators, too," said the chief executive, Robert Greifeld, adding "we're all in this together."
The Facebook debacle comes after a flurry of trading breakdowns. In March, BATS Global Markets canceled its own I.P.O., after its systems faltered. Nasdaq last year halted trading in dozens of stocks amid technical problems.
Such experiences echo the so-called flash crash. On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 700 points in minutes, before recovering shortly thereafter.
In nearly every case, companies blamed technical malfunctions. But regulators say some breakdowns may point to more fundamental issues.
The S.E.C. is also examining whether some exchanges give undue priority to high-frequency trading firms and big institutional investors through its order types and data disclosure.
The New York Stock Exchange is among the most prominent players facing scrutiny from regulators, who have opened two investigations into the Big Board, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the cases are not public.
The S.E.C., the people said, is examining whether the New York exchange violated rules by distributing in-depth stock data to paying clients faster than the public received general information. The issue was first discovered in the rubble of the flash crash.
The exchange declined to comment. But people close to the exchange have attributed the problem to unintended technical shortcomings.
The S.E.C., which has penalized the Direct Edge exchange for having "weak internal controls," is also pursuing the Chicago Board Options Exchange for not properly policing the markets.
In February, BATS Global Markets acknowledged receiving a request from the S.E.C. The agency, a person briefed on the matter said, is examining whether any collaboration between BATS and high-frequency trading firms could hinder competition.
Nasdaq represents one of the most prominent cases.
On the day of Facebook's debut, its finance team, led by David A. Ebersman, stood on Morgan Stanley's trading floor surrounded by scores of traders sporting white baseball caps stamped with "Facebook." While the mood was initially festive, he was growing anxious.
The chief financial officer turned to the bankers: "Why aren't we starting?" Nearby, a trader clutched phones to his ears, one with a call to another bank, the other to Nasdaq.
At about 11 a.m., Nasdaq said trading would begin in five minutes. After nothing happened, Nasdaq officials phoned S.E.C. trading experts to explain that everything was under control, according to a person briefed on the call.
Nasdaq's computers were programmed to accept last-second modifications to orders of Facebook shares. When these trades kept piling in, the system reset the price over and over again. Some orders were not executed - or were placed at prices other than the opening bid of $42. Many traders, who usually receive confirmations in seconds, had no idea how many shares they held. "We were flying blind," said one person at a market-making firm.
The S.E.C. is examining why Nasdaq lacked an action plan for navigating such a crisis, including plans to abort the I.P.O., and whether it failed to follow federal guidelines in running system tests. Nasdaq did run some 400 tests ahead of the Facebook I.P.O., and the company used the system in question for more than five years. Mr. Greifeld has publicly blamed "design flaws" in the system.
Ultimately, Nasdaq overrode the system manually, switching to a backup server. That move, too, has drawn scrutiny. Exchanges must follow their own strict trading procedures. In this case, Nasdaq changed its procedure on the fly without amending its rules. While the exchange may not have followed the letter of the law, a person close to Nasdaq said that the company had previously used the backup system with approval from regulators.
The exchange declined to comment. 
Shares started trading at 11:30 a.m., sending brief applause through Morgan Stanley's trading floor. The Facebook team, which had been hoping for a 5 to 10 percent jump from the offering price of $38, was relieved when it rose. The team headed to Teterboro Airport to fly back to California.
Then at 1:50 p.m., a second wave of confusion ripped through Wall Street. Traders saw an unexpected sell order of roughly 11 million shares. Some wondered whether a big hedge fund had dumped shares. Investors, on the fence about buying, backed off. Others sold. Within minutes, Facebook slipped $2, to roughly $40.
There was no mystery hedge fund seller. As Nasdaq started processing trades backed up in the system, those shares were dumped on the market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. About the same time, some Facebook shares that had ended up in an account at Nasdaq were also sold without warning. The move may have violated Nasdaq's own rules, which do not explicitly allow the exchange to take a position in the shares of an I.P.O., according to one of the people.
While some analysts have pinned Facebook's woes on Nasdaq, others have blamed the company and its bankers for being too aggressive on the size and price of the offering.
Facebook shares ended that first day at $38.23, roughly where they started.
Two days later, Mr. Greifeld called the I.P.O. "quite successful" over all and said that technical issues had not affected the price.
Facebook's management team, which was beginning to grasp the extent of the problems, was livid. Some wondered why Nasdaq had made little effort to keep them apprised on Friday and kept them out of decision-making. 
Mr. Greifeld called a senior executive, asking how the exchange could get back into its good graces. The executive erupted. "Bob," the executive said, "You don't understand what a hole you're in."
Nasdaq soon aggravated the trading woes. The exchange informed traders it might offer "financial accommodation" for claims filed on Monday. Some investors dumped shares, to prove a loss.
In the first hour of Monday trading, Facebook plunged from $38 to less than $34, swiftly wiping out billions of dollars in market value.

HEADLINE: The Schadenfreude Sports Fan

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Figuring out which teams to root against is a nuanced and delicate matter. 

 BODY:
Tough week. Blistering heat. Europe on the brink. The activist Supreme Court just days from possibly taking health care away from millions. And then, those diversions of lasting consequence on the court and on the pitch.
It would be wonderful to be able to give a full-throated swoon of love to basketball's king or Europe's top soccer dog. But duplicity, betrayal and peripheral political misconduct have muddied the waters. For the thinking sports citizen, beaten down by the corporate adultery of team-stealing owners and the preening of certain national soccer teams, it's not easy to raise a banner without an asterisk.
The schadenfreude sports fan, therefore, has little choice but to wish ill upon the more odious villains, with gusto. You choose your victor-aspirant based on who does the least evil.
Basketball, for this Seattle native, was the easiest choice. People hate LeBron James of the Miami Heat for reasons that have nothing to do with his otherworldly talent. And in the Oklahoma City Thunder we have the sweet shot of Kevin Durant and the cool beard of James Harden. 
But the pick here was always clear: Heat! The owners of Oklahoma City's team stole them from Seattle - Durant was the first-round draft choice of the SuperSonics - after lying about whether they would keep them in the city where they were born, and beloved for 41 years.

It's a redundancy, of course, to fuse liars and team owners. Let me add extortionists as well. The leverage of choice is to threaten a town with loss of an institution that provided memories for countless families. They play with our emotions as they reach for the civic purse. If denied, they flee for fresh suckers.
In Seattle's case, an arena remodeled with considerable public effort in 1995 and praised by Commissioner David Stern of the N.B.A. as a first-rate facility was suddenly declared obsolete and unworthy of housing the team a mere seven years later. New owners from Oklahoma City claimed to want to keep the team in Seattle, but e-mails between them later revealed the opposite. 
So, the team that won the N.B.A. championship in 1979, and that has a history that that includes Bill Russell as a coach, and players like Gary Payton and Lenny Wilkens, was torn from Seattle and replanted in Oklahoma City in 2008. 
There, the former Sonics play in something called Chesapeake Energy Arena, named for a troubled natural gas company. If you own shares in Chesapeake, you burn every time you hear the name; the stock has plunged more than 50 percent during the last year, and the company has been hit with more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake's chairman and a co-owner of the Thunder, is facing inquiries by the I.R.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ohio Attorney General over his use of the company as a personal A.T.M. for his lavish and leveraged lifestyle.
It takes a rare skill to be named "America's Most Reckless Billionaire," as McClendon was on the cover of Forbes magazine last year. He bankrolls anti-gay initiatives, and was a chief financier behind the dishonorable smearing of the honorable record of a Vietnam veteran - the Swift Boat attack on John Kerry. There is simply no comparison between LeBron James's move from Cleveland to Miami, and the misery and ugliness that this owner, McClendon, has brought to the public square.
But I'm in the minority on this. An ESPN map based on fan preference showed that only two states - Florida and Washington - were rooting for the Heat. And I can already hear complaints from Sacramento, which may lose its struggling basketball team to investors trying to bring professional hoops back to Seattle. 
So, let me make a pitch to every baseball fan whose heart still bleeds from the loss of the Brooklyn Dodgers, every driveway hoopster who can remember when Buffalo had an N.B.A. team (now the Los Angeles Clippers), every football lover who still can't believe that Los Angeles lost its Rams to St. Louis. In good conscience, you can never support the Oklahoma City robber barons.
On to soccer. All month, the beautiful game has offered brisk match-ups to determine the European Championship, the greatest crown outside of the World Cup. Friday's match in the quarterfinals - Greece versus Germany - presents the schadenfreude sports fan with a real dilemma.
The Germans are dominant, quick-striking, imperious. And then there is the soccer team, a match for the way the national government treats Greece. The Greeks are the proverbial plucky underdogs. But you also have that profligate spending, refuse-to-collect-taxes-while-defaulting-on-your-bonds thing that threatens to bring down the global economy and put the kind of people that Aubrey McClendon supports in charge of the country.
I have to go with Greece over their biggest creditor. This ancient civilization needs the lift. Germany already owns everything in Europe. 
Elsewhere, golf has been an easy schadenfreude call ever since the serial adulteries of Tiger Woods came to light. Whatever cool young linksman or gentlemanly veteran can make Tiger groan is my guy. 
Next month is the Tour de France. Count me among the legion of lovers of this fantastic race who have arrived at the sad conclusion that most cyclists are blood-doping, making a hero hard to come by. Sigh.
And yet, though I burn at the character flaws of otherwise flawless athletes, the avarice of owners and the arrogance of national teams, I can't hate the games. Never. In a world of predictable follies, these compact dramas on grass, hardwood or roadsides are among the last unscripted events of modern life.

HEADLINE: For the Ron Paul Wing, Now What?

BYLINE: BRIAN DOHERTY


HIGHLIGHT: The libertarian campaign is far from over. 

 BODY:
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has admitted that he won't have enough delegates at the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August to win the nomination.
But right after that announcement he racked up another win: his supporters now make up the majority of the delegation from the caucus state of Iowa. That's the state allegedly "won" by Mitt Romney in January, which was later revealed to have been "won" by Rick Santorum.
Paul's campaign has risen from many deaths. In mid-May, he announced he'd no longer campaign in upcoming primary states. He encouraged his forces to concentrate on caucus states, where dedication to a long process of local, district and state party meetings can trump just getting a mass of voters out on primary day to dutifully record a vote for the frontrunner.
Everyone spun that May announcement as "Paul drops out." Since then, following his strategy, Paul's people won delegations in Minnesota, Louisiana (in a victory contested by a rump Romney faction), and now Iowa. He already had Maine.
What can Paul and his movement do with these victories? Paul's ratcheting back of his campaign in May came directly on the heels of two Republican state conventions, in Oklahoma and Arizona, which fell into wild tumult because of fights - sometimes literally physical fights - between the Paul and Romney forces. The Paul people in Oklahoma held their own rump convention in a parking lot. The Arizona Paul fans made news for booing Josh Romney.
That booing is symbolic of the struggle between two significant competing visions of what the Republican Party will be, a struggle, by the way, that is no longer between a vast majority and a tiny fringe. Paul people consider themselves not weird outsiders, but the true conservatives who actually want to rein in government within affordable, constitutional limits. Ron Paul's campaign spokesmen are quick to distance themselves from any hint of the Paul movement being an angry, raucous anti-establishment rabble - the words "respect" and "decorum" flow from their lips as much as "limited government" and "end the Fed now."
But Paul's supporters want to keep fighting, and ferociously. Some in the radical Paul grassroots darkly assumed that the winding-down announcements were deliberately designed by sellout campaign pros to damp down their wildest enthusiasms.
One California lawyer, Richard Gilbert, got disgusted by what he saw as the official campaign's lack of will to fight what he thinks were rampant dirty tricks and cheating on the state level by Romney forces. He filed (without the approval or support of the campaign) a federal lawsuit against the Republican National Committee. The suit argues that the R.N.C. cannot legally bind any delegate to vote for Romney. Paul's more ardent fans believe that in an open convention, Paul still could win outright.
While Ron Paul has no future in politics, the Ron Paul machine and his son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, will. That's why the political pros in the Paul movement don't appreciate acting-out like Richard Gilbert's lawsuit. That's also why Rand Paul risked the wrath of his father's hardcore fans by endorsing Mitt Romney, just as soon as Ron Paul admitted he would not win.
Senator Paul knows he needs to reach beyond his father's 10-15 percent base in the primaries to more mainstream, red-state, talk-radio Republicans. He can't do that by marking himself as a traitor to the party. So he stands behind nominee Romney and plans to actively campaign for him.
But he also can't mark himself a traitor to the Ron Paul cause. So Rand Paul followed up his endorsement by calling out Romney in the pages of National Review for Romney's declaration that he would have the authority as president to start a war with Iran. That sort of foreign policy adventurism - especially when done without respect for Congress's traditional constitutional power over declaring war - is anathema to the core Ron Paul crowd, and Rand Paul condemned it.
Ron Paul antiwar appeal won him friends on the left, but it was also why this politician with impeccable credentials on core Republican issues like taxes (he wants to eliminate the income tax), spending (he's the only Republican candidate with a budget that balanced in three years with no new taxes), and regulation (he thinks they strangle the wealth-creating properties of free markets) had such a hard time gaining traction with the Tea Party base, who don't see the connection Paul sees between a constitutionally limited, affordable government and a less expansionist foreign policy.
If the Tea Party really were transpartisan outsiders dedicated to fighting bailouts and shrinking spending, Ron Paul should have been their man. In 2012, they've revealed themselves more as loyal Republicans than as a rebel army. Paul's campaign is trying to gently guide the Paul movement through that same transition.
It's a hard maneuver, if they wish to stand for his libertarian principles. Still, Paul's appeal within the party is growing, not shrinking. He raised more money this time around than last time, despite having little concrete to show his supporters from the last campaign. He got more than twice as many votes and percentages of votes. He will have hundreds of delegates on the floor in Tampa. He will likely have many more hundreds of supporters rallying in the streets in Tampa.
On the one hand, Ron Paul's refusal to run as the candidate of a third party shows that he sees his cause's fate linked with the future of the Republican Party. On the other, his refusal to endorse Romney shows that if they want to help shape that party in a more libertarian direction, he and his supporters can't just go along to get along.
Indeed, despite the Rand Paul endorsement, Romney will be hard-pressed to win the votes of many Paul fans in November, though he's clearly trying not to offend them intentionally by openly disrespecting their man. Paul's fans are driven by a sense of crisis. For his whole political career, Paul has been predicting big trouble based on government overreach - with spending, with monetary policy, with managing Americans' choices, and with a world-straddling, expensive, imperial foreign policy. Paul's devotees see those crises as no longer looming, but here right now. America, they think, could soon be Greece. And they don't see how a Romney who supported bailouts, who thinks a trillion-dollar spending cut would harm the economy, who helped lay the groundwork for ObamaCare, who believes in more overseas wars, can save America.
It's easy for establishments to mock that sort of fervor. But the Republican Party has seen young, radically anti-government, quirky, curious movements conquer before. The Goldwater kids did it in the '60s; the Religious Right did it in the wake of Pat Robertson's failed presidential bid in 1988.
When Paul announced last July that he wouldn't seek re-election for the House seat he's held since 1997, he said, "I don't think I have a political career so much as trying to change the course of history." That's what his supporters still want to do. Many of them have decided that they need to do that by taking over the Republican Party from the bottom up. Many of them also realize that they can't change the course of history sufficiently by voting for Mitt Romney. Even when Ron Paul is gone, his supporters will be continuing the Ron Paul campaign.

HEADLINE: Mark Boulos: 'Projects 97'

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Museum of Modern Art
Through July 16
The two separate, synchronous videos that make up Mark Boulos's fierce installation ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air,'' part of MoMA's Projects series, deal with a single subject, the production and sale of fuel oil. But they approach this theme from opposite ends of the supply-and-demand spectrum. 
One was filmed in Africa, in the Niger River Delta, where extraction of oil for export, largely by Western corporations, has produced an environmental catastrophe. While sizable profits from drilling go to Nigeria's central government, the farmers and fisherman who live in the delta receive next to nothing. Worse, the water and vegetation on which their sustenance depends is now dangerously polluted.
In response, the militant group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has gone into action, kidnapping oil workers, sabotaging equipment and fighting the Nigerian Army. Interviews with masked members of the movement, who speak of their cause with quiet fury and perform rituals to invoke the protection of guardian spirits during battle, form the bulk of the Mr. Boulos's African video.
The second video has what would seem to be a more prosaic setting: the futures-and-derivatives trading pit of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But the shooting was done on the first day of the 2008 credit crisis, and a sense of hysteria is palpable. The room is packed with traders bidding competitively on commodities futures, including oil, and the collective behavior looks, if anything, more aggressive and ritually driven than that of the Niger Delta guerrillas.
Mr. Boulos, who was born in the United States in 1975 and now lives in Europe, sends ideas out in many directions with this pairing, the basic one being that any commodity can have a completely different reality and value depending on who is looking at it.
To the inhabitants of the Niger Delta, oil is a specific, destructive, stolen substance; to Western stock traders it's an abstract source of competitive and speculative profits.
In the MoMA installation, overseen by Cara Starke and Stephanie Weber, the two 15-minute videos are on opposite walls of a long room, and cannot be viewed simultaneously. As they play, you feel under assault from two directions in a powerful piece that raises many more questions than it answers about economics, exploitation and violence.
The only resolution, however illusional, seems to be the one suggested by the title itself. It quotes the opening phrase of a sentence from the Communist Manifesto, which continues: ''all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.''

HEADLINE: As Growth Ebbs, Brazil Powers Up Its Bulldozers

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
IPOJUCA, Brazil -- More than 40,000 laborers swarm the port complex here in northeast Brazil, building a refinery for the state oil company. Five thousand others toil at a shipyard, another government-led project. Real estate prices are soaring and unemployment is falling in this region along the Atlantic coast, once known for its festering poverty.
In a show of the extraordinary sway that Brazil's government wields in nearly every important area of the economy, President Dilma Rousseff is accelerating an array of stimulus projects throughout the country aimed at blunting a slowdown that has reduced Brazil's economic growth to a snail's pace.
Ms. Rousseff's assertiveness in enhancing the government's role in molding economic policy is not wholly unlike China's state-led investment, an increasingly popular model in the developing world. Brazil's stimulus spending has helped preserve jobs, keeping unemployment at a historic low of 5.8 percent, down from 13 percent a decade ago. Months into a sharp slowdown, Ms. Rousseff's approval ratings stand at more than 60 percent. 
But in an echo of the debate about heavy government borrowing in the United States and Europe after the global downturn, Ms. Rouseff's moves are starting to meet resistance in Brazil. Some experts fear that Brazil is becoming too dependent on government intervention to smooth the ups and downs of an economy that remains tied to commodity cycles; others fear that the creation of state-supported champions in the business world give the government even greater power to dictate policy shifts, potentially eroding Brazil's exposure to market forces.
Economists here still have unhappy memories of the aftermath of the ''Brazilian miracle'' of the late 1960s and early '70s, when a state-directed boom fostered fast growth for a time, but ended in rapid inflation, low productivity and a radical restructuring of the economy.
''The government is pressing ahead with projects of pharaonic proportions, when areas like basic sanitation need urgent attention,'' said Sergio Lazzarini, an economist at Insper, a Sao Paulo business school, who has written widely on Brazil's state capitalism. The investment push is already showing signs of strain. So many infrastructure projects have been approved at once, including stadiums for the World Cup soccer tournament in 2014 and hydroelectric plants in the Amazon, that the government is having a hard time spending all the money allocated. For instance, just a fifth of the $7 billion budgeted for highway projects in 2012 has been spent.
In Ipojuca, contractors on state projects are luring workers from other government investment priorities, like the construction of a network of concrete canals in the Sertao, the semiarid hinterland in northeast Brazil. Delays and cost overruns, partly because of labor shortages, have plagued big stretches of that project, which is part of a $4 billion effort to divert the flow of the Sao Francisco River to villages in need of irrigation.
Ms. Rousseff vigorously defends her response to the slowdown (Brazil eked out 0.2 percent growth in the first quarter). In a speech this month, she drew a stark comparison to the austerity policies in Europe, where more than half of the young people in some countries are without jobs. ''We don't have a vision which justifies an adjustment leaving 54 percent of a country's young people without work,'' she said. ''We never thought that way; our policy is clearly in defense of employment.''
Ms. Rousseff's position reflects Brazil's fiscal running room, since improvements in tax collection and the earlier surge in the economy helped bolster state finances. But her thinking is also rooted in Brazil's strong tradition of government leadership of the economy.
The officials at the helm of Brazil's state-controlled companies argue that the nation still needs such sprawling projects to consolidate the gains in reducing inequality. ''It's a catalyst of job creation,'' Maria das Gracas Foster, the chief executive of the national oil company, Petrobras, said in an interview, referring to policies requiring Petrobras to buy Brazilian-made ships even though state-supported shipyards are mired in delays.
Brazil has a web of state-controlled energy companies, including Petrobras, and banks like Banco do Brasil, Latin America's largest lender by assets.
More subtly, but with perhaps even greater lasting impact, the authorities also wield economic influence through the National Bank for Social and Economic Development, an institution in Rio de Janeiro that has mushroomed, lending four times as much as the World Bank does around the globe.
Like the World Bank, the national development bank finances big infrastructure projects aimed at alleviating poverty and boosting development. Founded in 1952, the bank remained under state control throughout Brazil's privatization wave in the 1990s, even financing many of the government auctions of state companies.
Under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government, from 2003 to 2010, the bank aggressively expanded, acquiring minority stakes in a number of private companies. Some are huge, like JBS, the world's largest meatpacker. Others are start-ups, like Bug Agentes Biologicos, which mass-produces wasps to combat the larvae threatening soybean crops.
Altogether, the development bank, along with the pension funds of big state companies, now hold stakes in nearly 200 Brazilian companies, up from 95 a decade ago. In some cases, these holdings allow the government to oust powerful corporate leaders. They showed that capacity in 2011, forcing Roger Agnelli, chief executive of the mining giant Vale, to resign after he upset officials by firing 1,300 employees and slashing investments in Brazil.
Ms. Rousseff's government is showing its teeth to Brazil's financial elite again this year. She has seized on the economic slowdown as an opportunity to persuade Brazil's private banks to lower interest rates, which until recently were among the highest in the world, by pushing Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal, another large state bank, to cut their own rates.
Initially, the response from Brazil's powerful banking establishment was tepid. ''You can take a horse to the riverbank, but you can't force it to drink water,'' Rubens Sardenberg, chief economist of the powerful Febraban association of banks in Sao Paulo, said in May.
The reaction from Ms. Rousseff's office was blunt. ''The horse can die of thirst,'' said an official in her government, reflecting the president's irritation. The banking group promptly withdrew the economist's comments, and private banks started following the giant state banks in lowering rates.
Perhaps aware of such reactions, Brazil's business establishment rarely voices explicit criticism of state intervention in the economy. But while Brazil remains far more receptive to private investment than neighboring Argentina, concern is nevertheless building as growth stalls.
While bowing to her wishes, some business interests are starting to chafe under Ms. Rousseff's interventionist policies. ''We urgently need to shift our course,'' the influential business magazine Exame said in an editorial this month, complaining about what it called Ms. Rousseff's ''strong hand.''
Concerns have emerged over growing consumer debt, with nine million Brazilians taking out loans in 2011 for the first time. At the same time, the valuations of some of Brazil's largest companies have declined, and the currency, the real, has tumbled against the dollar.
Ipojuca is in Pernambuco State, where both the advantages and drawbacks are on display of the heavy reliance on the government for investment decisions. On the positive side is Brazil's resilience at a time of global economic turbulence.
''Of course, we're concerned about contagion reaching our shores, but there is no sense of crisis at the moment,'' said Frederico da Costa Amancio, chief executive of the Port of Suape, home to the Petrobras refinery that is under construction alongside factories that produce everything from wind-power turbines to potato chips.
But in villages like Agrovila Seis in the interior, state investment has been a mixed blessing. After a windfall in 2007, when the earth-moving machines arrived and foremen started hiring workers to dig canals intended to divert the Sao Francisco River, the optimism dissipated after contractors began suspending work last year, raising fears of white elephants on the Sertao.
Ms. Rousseff personally visited the work sites in February. Later, she vowed to increase the number of workers on the project by the end of the year to 6,500 from 4,500. Still, Agrovila Seis is limping along for now, reflecting the disarray of one of Brazil's largest infrastructure projects. Empty housing for workers gives part of the village the feel of a ghost town.
''I try not to feel despondent about my debts,'' said Eliane da Silva, a restaurant owner in the village who took out loans to buy equipment; her clientele, made up largely of work crews, has plunged. ''I try to imagine where all the money went for this project.''

HEADLINE: Different Ways of Looking at Iran

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Hugs From Iran,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, June 14), presented a refreshing and much needed perspective on Iran and Iranians. The current government of Iran does not represent its people either politically or even culturally. The Iranian culture, as Mr. Kristof experienced, values hospitality, kindness and, yes, even tolerance.
Iran is a collection of ethnic and religious groups, and the country has for thousands of years been a haven for minorities, including Jews. The current regime is not based on Iran's cultural or historical traditions. It does not represent the political philosophy of the country. If anything, it is an aberration that goes against all ideals of Persian leadership that can be found in the literature and mythology of the country going back thousands of years. 
Iran can be one of the West's best allies in the region.
AFSANEH NAHAVANDI Phoenix, June 16, 2012
The writer is a professor of public administration at Arizona State University.
To the Editor:
In ''Pinched and Griping in Iran'' (column, June 17), about a recent trip to Iran, Nicholas D. Kristof applauds the very sanctions that are making life more difficult for the ordinary people he met. He is gravely mistaken in believing that intensifying sanctions is going to prompt economic collapse, leading to regime change. For over 30 years, journalists and pundits have been talking about an imminent counterrevolution to the Islamic Republic, but to no avail.
If Mr. Kristof believes that widespread discontent with current conditions in Iran is an indicator that the ruling system is on the brink of its own demise, then one would have to then apply this to the American political system, in which the public has lost all faith amid a ruinous economy and bankrupt government. Yet nobody actually believes that this will happen.
Also, it is fairly clear that those who approach foreign journalists, or consent to be interviewed by them, tend to be the more xenophilic and anti-government segment of society. Hence, Mr. Kristof's analysis of the pro-American sentiments of the Iranian people is likely to be merely anecdotal and thus heavily skewed.
REZA ESFANDIARI Manchester, England, June 18, 2012
To the Editor:
Unfortunately, Nicholas D. Kristof's column represents wishful thinking. Economic sanctions are ineffective against totalitarian regimes. Consider Fidel Castro's Cuba. Even though Cubans have lived with economic hardship in one of the most isolated countries in the world, one man kept millions of people in his iron grip for more than 50 years. The same is true of North Korea.
The Iranian regime is even more cruel than these despotic countries. The Islamic despots had thousands of Iranians, including large numbers of children and teenagers, walk through minefields in ''human waves'' in order to clear the fields for the Iranian military during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.
This regime, which has nothing to fear from its terrified population, will certainly have no qualms about subjecting its citizens to economic hardship.
CHARLES ICKOWICZ Teaneck, N.J., June 17, 2012
To the Editor:
''Pinched and Griping in Iran'' tells us that the sanctions against Iran are indeed working, and that a military strike against Iranian nuclear sites may well undo all the progress that has been made. These words and facts should be heeded by those right-leaning American politicians poorly informed about the complexities of the Mideast.

HEADLINE: Call Me, Pay Fee

BYLINE: By JAMES B. RULE. 
James B. Rule is a sociologist and a scholar at the Center for the Study of Law and Society at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
WITH the fall elections looming, you may be reconsidering your relationship with your telephone. In states with intensely fought races during the primary season, phone subscribers have complained of receiving as many as 20 election-related calls -- mostly automated ''robocalls'' -- per week. These entreaties add to the already heavy load of unwanted commercial calls for everything from credit cards to weight-loss programs.
Enabling these calls are vast industries devoted to collecting personal data about us and selling it to parties seeking to commandeer our attention, our dollars or our votes. Just as fortunes are made by ''renting the eyeballs'' of Internet users, entrepreneurs prosper by leasing eardrums. 
Officially, some limits are in place, most notably the National Do Not Call Registry, created by Congress in 2003. By one count, nearly three-quarters of American phone subscribers have enrolled on this list. But the exceptions and loopholes written into this legislation are revealing. Political candidates and organizations are exempted. So are nonprofit organizations, those conducting surveys or polls, and companies with whom the person called has an ''established business relationship'' -- all notions inviting elastic interpretation.
Worse, determined robocallers now overwhelm even these flexible limits, cheaply placing millions of calls from beyond American borders using decentralizing technologies like voice-over-Internet protocol. Complaints to the Federal Trade Commission bring no relief.
There is no reason to tolerate these incivilities. A simple, low-tech regulatory change could shift the advantage decisively back in the direction of privacy.
All telephone service providers should be required to offer every subscriber the option of accepting only ''bonded'' calls. To complete a call to a subscriber electing this option, the caller would have to show willingness and ability to compensate the recipient -- should the latter designate the call a nuisance. Before calls to these numbers could be completed, a message would state the amount of the potential charge. A few seconds after the connection is established, the recipient would have the option of terminating the call and charging the caller by pressing a keypad button.
Phone customers choosing this option could specify the amount that callers would place at risk. And they could maintain lists of favored callers, from whom calls would be accepted without risk of penalty. These might include relatives, friends, organizations from which communications are particularly welcome or parties from whom a callback has been specifically requested.
Technologies and management practices to support such an option already exist. The pay-per-call 900 number system has long been available to businesses seeking to charge callers for their time. This measure would extend the same benefits of communication technology to ordinary citizens and consumers.
As with other privacy-invading practices, sponsors of automated mass phone calling will predictably defend junk calling as an essential exercise of First Amendment rights. We live in an information society, they'll quickly remind us. Restricting the free flow of ideas could jeopardize our freedom and prosperity. This line of reasoning has won legal support right up to the Supreme Court -- witness the recent resurgence of ''corporate free speech'' doctrines.
Such arguments would be compelling in a Jeffersonian democracy, where parties to the communications enjoyed something like parity of position. But the social and technological realities of the 21st century have left that world behind. Ordinary people today confront well-financed, sophisticated organizations capable of carpet-bombing the public with insistent one-way exhortations. Relations between these callers and their targets are utterly unequal. The victims don't have a chance in a million of reaching the harassing callers to share a piece of their indignant minds. The courts have gone back and forth over history balancing rights of free expression against those of privacy. But ultimately the law does recognize a distinction between communication and harassment.
Far from constricting the information flows that are essential to economic dynamism and well-informed civic discourse, an innovation like this would raise the quality of telephone communications, while reducing their sheer numbers. No one, of course, would be compelled to select this feature for his or her phone service. But those who did would create incentives for callers to make only calls likely to win the appreciation, or at least the respect, of the recipient. Institutional callers that now offend thousands to obtain a positive response from a tiny minority would be obliged to weigh the effects of their entreaties on all those whose attention they commandeer.

 BODY:
LUMEN 2012 (Saturday) It wasn't until February that Christopher Eamon, the curator of Lumen festival on Staten Island, knew that the mountains of salt weren't going anywhere. This free festival, dedicated to video, interactive and performance art, is being held from 6 p.m. until midnight at the Atlantic Salt Company, which provides New York with road salt. This year's mild winter meant the mounds didn't budge. So Mr. Eamon and Melanie Cohn, executive director of the Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island, the festival's sponsor, decided to use the 150,000 tons of salt as a canvas. The biggest mound will serve as a screen for projections -- Marco Brambilla's re-creation of the lunar landing, and a neon salt digger courtesy of a Brooklyn artist, Jeanne Verdoux, who made the cut in a local open call. The others will be surrounded by performances and site-specific installations. ''We're going to shape the salt in various formations and do something like a salt Zen garden,'' Mr. Eamon said via Skype on Tuesday. 
This is the largest Lumen yet, said Ms. Cohn, with 50 artists -- including the likes of Tony Oursler and Alex Prager -- across an industrial site, a Poemobile (a truck that shares local poets' work) and food trucks. The setting, on the bank of Kill Van Kull tidal strait, is its own attraction: ''You can see the edge of Manhattan,'' Ms. Cohn said, ''and these huge container boats come through.'' She added, ''There's something very dramatic about that.'' The festival also includes film, dance, projections on buildings, and other things that would not necessarily fit into a gallery setting. Rama Chorpash is using live fireflies to recreate what Staten Island looked like, preindustrialization. ''It's such an amazing opportunity for experimentation,'' Mr. Eamon said. ''So outside the white box.'' More details are available at lumenfest.org. (Melena Ryzik)

HEADLINE: Portrait of Bacon-Freud Back Up for Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
LONDON -- The e-mail blast was sent late last month. ''An exciting new discovery at Christie's,'' read a statement from Francis Outred, the head of the postwar and contemporary art department in Europe for Christie's. Mr. Outred was describing a 1964 painting by Francis Bacon, ''Study for Self-Portrait,'' which he said was the only full-length self-portrait to combine Bacon's face with the body of his friend the painter Lucian Freud.
The canvas's entry in the catalog for the Wednesday sale here goes on for 10 pages and includes 20 illustrations. It says the painting is the ''property of a private New York collector.'' A symbol next to the lot number indicates that Christie's has a financial interest in ''Study for Self-Portrait,'' but the details are unclear. 
What Christie's has not disclosed in the provenance is that the painting was up for sale at Christie's in New York in November 2008, when it did not draw a single bid. The work was also the subject of a lawsuit, settled last July, filed in March 2009 in the United States District Court in Manhattan by a family trust led by the Connecticut collector George A. Weiss. The trust said that Christie's had reneged on a $40 million guarantee, which is an undisclosed sum promised the seller regardless of a sale's outcome.
That guarantee had been offered in July 2008, before the markets plummeted. But by September, after Christie's had possession of the painting, it said it would no longer honor the guarantee because of the uncertain economy.
The painting was put up for auction anyway, and when it didn't sell, Mr. Weiss's family trust sued Christie's for the $40 million it says it was promised. In next week's sale catalog the estimate simply says, ''on request,'' although Christie's experts are telling clients they believe it should sell for around $:20 million, or about $31.3 million.
Mr. Weiss did not return phone calls seeking comment. Ivor Braka, a London dealer who is Mr. Weiss's agent, said he was ''unable to comment'' on the settlement of the lawsuit.
In a statement Christie's said it ''is delighted to be offering this important work for sale next week in London following an amicable agreement with the client in 2011.''
The portrait depicts Bacon perched on a bed, body twisted from head to toe. It was only this year that Christie's experts determined that the body was based on a photograph of Freud.
Christie's is hoping to capitalize on the record prices paid for Bacon works in recent seasons. A 1976 triptych went for $86.3 million in May 2008 at Sotheby's in New York, and a 1975 self-portrait brought $34.4 million at Christie's in London in June 2008. But both sales occurred before the markets slumped, and some dealers believe that Christie's is offering the painting too soon after its last auction appearance.
While nobody will reveal the details of Christie's settlement with Mr. Weiss's family trust -- citing confidentiality agreements -- some experts with knowledge of the lawsuit said they believe that Christie's ended up giving the trust a figure close to the $40 million it was after. If that is true, then Christie's, not Mr. Weiss, owns the painting, regardless of the catalog's designation.
Again, Christie's declined to comment.
ONO'S 'LIGHT'
Outside the entrance to the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens here there are six dogwood trees with paper messages dangling from their branches in many languages. ''Less fear and greed,'' one reads; ''Peace and Love,'' another. The messages are at the invitation of Yoko Ono, who at nearly 80 is the subject of ''Yoko Ono: To the Light,'' which opened on Tuesday.
Her first show here in more than a decade, it includes videos like ''Fly'' and ''Amaze'' (1971/2012). ''Fly,'' made with John Lennon, traces a fly as it travels across a naked woman's body. ''Amaze'' is a labyrinth of a clear plastic and aluminum.
Ms. Ono's presence will reach beyond the confines of Kensington Gardens. From Thursday through Sept. 9 her video ''Imagine Peace'' will be translated into 24 languages on 25 video screens throughout Britain, including those in Victoria Park and Hyde Park and on the Underground at Canary Wharf in London. Lennon's 1971 song ''Imagine'' accompanies the video.
The ''Imagine Peace'' videos were organized by the Art Production Fund, based in New York. Like the exhibition at the Serpentine the videos are part of the London 2012 Festival, in anticipation of the Olympics.
MUNCH, BUT NO 'SCREAM'
When people think of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch, they think of ''The Scream,'' his celebrated depiction of angst and existential dread that has been endlessly reproduced, and made even more famous when a version of it sold for nearly $120 million at Sotheby's in New York last month, becoming the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.
But there is a whole other side to Munch that Nicholas Cullinan, curator of international Modern art at the Tate Modern, has been exploring with colleagues from the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt. Their findings are chronicled in the exhibition ''Edvard Munch: The Modern Eye,'' which opens at the Tate Modern here on Thursday.
That the exhibition does not include one image of ''The Scream'' is deliberate, Mr. Cullinan said. All but the one that sold at Sotheby's are in Norwegian museums and do not travel. ''It's kind of like a Norwegian Mona Lisa, and there was no Mona Lisa in the Leonardo show,'' Mr. Cullinan said, referring to the blockbuster exhibition at the National Gallery in London that closed in February. ''We are looking at Munch's career as a whole, examining the artist's paintings and drawings made in the first half of the 20th century and his interest in the rise of photography, film and innovations in theater.''
While Munch is seen mostly as a 19th-century painter, he produced much of his groundbreaking work in the early years of the 20th century. The show will include some 160 works.
''Many people don't realize that Munch died in 1944, the same year as Kandinsky and Mondrian, and those are his peers,'' Mr. Cullinan said. ''It's a slightly anachronistic idea that his work is confined to the late 19th century.''

HEADLINE: Finger-Pointing at Nasdaq

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS, EVELYN M. RUSLI and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Nasdaq has blamed Facebook's botched debut last month on flawed computers and ''technical errors.''
Regulators suspect it may be something more. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into the exchange for its role in the initial public offering of Facebook, according to people briefed on the inquiry. Regulators are examining whether Nasdaq failed to properly test its trading systems, which broke down during the I.P.O., and whether the exchange violated rules when it rewrote computer code to jump-start trading.
The Facebook investigation comes after a broader inquiry into trading breakdowns and other problems at the nation's largest exchanges, including two previously undisclosed cases involving Nasdaq's archrival, the New York Stock Exchange, the people said.
The agency's enforcement unit, which has opened more than a dozen related cases, is examining whether exchanges lack adequate controls and favor select investors. 
As investor confidence in the market wanes, the worry is that missteps by the exchanges are contributing to the dissatisfaction. Since the financial crisis, investors have seen their portfolios erode, prompting them to flee stocks.
''If exchanges have technical problems, that slows capital formation and erodes the confidence,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who held a hearing this week on the initial public offering process.
While none of the exchanges has been accused of any wrongdoing and the S.E.C. may never take enforcement action, the crackdown represents a significant shift. Traditionally, the agency has been relatively cozy with the industry, which is increasingly under pressure to produce profits since the exchanges became publicly traded companies.
Along with the threat of enforcement cases, the S.E.C. has introduced several measures to improve the safety of the markets. For example, the agency has approved proposals that would help limit volatility in specific stocks, including circuit breakers that would halt trading.
''Cases against exchanges are few and far between, and inevitably a big deal,'' said Stephen J. Crimmins, a partner at the law firm K&L Gates and a former enforcement official at the S.E.C.
Facebook's initial public offering highlights the problems facing exchanges - and how regulators are finding their responses lacking.
On May 18, its first day of trading, Facebook got off to a rocky start. Nasdaq delayed the start of trading and later flooded the market with shares, adding to investor trepidation.
Nasdaq's lack of communication - and at times, lack of contrition - aggravated the situation, according to documents and executives, bankers and regulators. On a May 31 call with the chairwoman of the S.E.C., Mary L. Schapiro, and other officials, Nasdaq's chief executive expressed confusion about the S.E.C.'s aggressive approach.
''We're regulators, too,'' said the chief executive, Robert Greifeld, adding ''we're all in this together.''
The Facebook debacle comes after a flurry of trading breakdowns. In March, BATS Global Markets canceled its own I.P.O., after its systems faltered. Nasdaq last year halted trading in dozens of stocks amid technical problems.
Such experiences echo the so-called flash crash. On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 700 points in minutes, before recovering shortly thereafter.
In nearly every case, companies blamed technical malfunctions. But regulators say some breakdowns may point to more fundamental issues.
The S.E.C. is also examining whether some exchanges give undue priority to high-frequency trading firms and big institutional investors through its order types and data disclosure.
The New York Stock Exchange is among the most prominent players facing scrutiny from regulators, who have opened two investigations into the Big Board, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the cases are not public.
The S.E.C., the people said, is examining whether the New York exchange violated technical rules by distributing in-depth stock data to paying clients faster than the public received general information. The issue was first discovered in the rubble of the flash crash.
The exchange declined to comment. But people close to the exchange have attributed the problem to unintended technical shortcomings.
The S.E.C., which has penalized the Direct Edge exchange for having ''weak internal controls,'' is also pursuing the Chicago Board Options Exchange for not properly policing the markets.
In February, BATS Global Markets acknowledged receiving a request from the S.E.C. The agency, a person briefed on the matter said, is examining whether any collaboration between BATS and high-frequency trading firms could hinder competition.
Nasdaq represents one of the most prominent cases.
On the day of Facebook's debut, its finance team, led by David A. Ebersman, stood on Morgan Stanley's trading floor surrounded by scores of traders sporting white baseball caps stamped with ''Facebook.'' While the mood was initially festive, he was growing anxious.
The chief financial officer turned to the bankers: ''Why aren't we starting?'' Nearby, a trader clutched phones to his ears, one with a call to another bank, the other to Nasdaq.
At about 11 a.m., Nasdaq said trading would begin in five minutes. After nothing happened, Nasdaq officials phoned S.E.C. trading experts to explain that everything was under control, according to a person briefed on the call.
Nasdaq's computers were programmed to accept last-second modifications to orders of Facebook shares. When these trades kept piling in, the system reset the price over and over again. Some orders were not executed - or were placed at prices other than the opening bid of $42. Many traders, who usually receive confirmations in seconds, had no idea how many shares they held. ''We were flying blind,'' said one person at a market-making firm.
The S.E.C. is examining why Nasdaq lacked an action plan for navigating such a crisis, including plans to abort the I.P.O., and whether it failed to follow federal guidelines in running system tests. Nasdaq did run some 400 tests ahead of the Facebook I.P.O., and the company used the system in question for more than five years. Mr. Greifeld has publicly blamed ''design flaws'' in the system.
Ultimately, Nasdaq overrode the system manually, switching to a backup server. That move, too, has drawn scrutiny. Exchanges must follow their own strict trading procedures. In this case, Nasdaq changed its procedure on the fly without amending its rules. While the exchange may not have followed the letter of the law, a person close to Nasdaq said that the company had previously used the backup system with approval from regulators.
Shares started trading at 11:30 a.m., sending brief applause through Morgan Stanley's trading floor. The Facebook team, which had been hoping for a 5 to 10 percent jump from the offering price of $38, was relieved when it rose. The team headed to Teterboro Airport to fly back to California.
Then at 1:50 p.m., a second wave of confusion ripped through Wall Street. Traders saw an unexpected sell order of roughly 11 million shares. Some wondered whether a big hedge fund had dumped shares. Investors, on the fence about buying, backed off. Others sold. Within minutes, Facebook slipped $2, to roughly $40.
There was no mystery hedge fund seller. As Nasdaq started processing trades backed up in the system, those shares were dumped on the market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. About the same time, some Facebook shares that had ended up in an account at Nasdaq were also sold without warning. The move may have violated Nasdaq's own rules, which do not explicitly allow the exchange to take a position in the shares of an I.P.O., according to one of the people.
While some analysts have pinned Facebook's woes on Nasdaq, others have blamed the company and its bankers for being too aggressive on the size and price of the offering.
Facebook shares ended that first day at $38.23, roughly where they started.
Two days later, Mr. Greifeld called the I.P.O. ''quite successful'' over all and said that technical issues had not affected the price.
Facebook's management team, which was beginning to grasp the extent of the problems, was livid. Some wondered why Nasdaq had made little effort to keep them apprised on Friday and kept them out of decision-making.
Mr. Greifeld called a senior executive, asking how the exchange could get back into its good graces. The executive erupted. ''Bob,'' the executive said, ''You don't understand what a hole you're in.''
Nasdaq soon aggravated the trading woes. The exchange informed traders it might offer ''financial accommodation'' for claims filed on Monday. Some investors dumped shares, to prove a loss.
In the first hour of Monday trading, Facebook plunged from $38 to less than $34, swiftly wiping out billions of dollars in market value.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Markets Down Sharply on Economic News

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Major stock indexes fell to their lowest levels of the week on Thursday, driven down by worries about global economic growth, troubled banks and falling oil prices.
A stream of economic data presented a bleak picture globally on Thursday. Manufacturing activity in China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States', shrank, while euro zone business activity retreated for a fifth month, the latest data showed. In the United States, other reports showed a decline in existing home sales in May and a rise in first-time jobless claims that was worse than forecast, while regional factory activity contracted.
''The home sales market is still on the mend,'' said Patrick Newport, a United States economist for IHS Global Insight, in a research commentary. ''But the path to recovery will be a slow and bumpy one. The key obstacle to a strong recovery right now is tight credit.'' 
Earlier in the week, traders bid up stocks in hopes that a Federal Reserve announcement scheduled for Wednesday would include a measure to stimulate the economy. But the Federal Reserve decision to extend its asset purchase program by buying about $267 billion in longer-term Treasury securities led analysts to question how much the program, which is intended to drive down long-term interest rates, would help economic growth.
''The market was really looking for more dollars than what they got,'' Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said. ''And the markets are reacting to more dollar scarcity than anything.''
A note on Thursday from Goldman Sachs market strategists recommended a short position in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after the Fed announcement.
''And we now think, with incremental U.S. monetary policy on hold, the market will need to confront a deteriorating growth picture near term,'' it said.
As global economic data suggested a slowdown in crucial industries, commodity prices fell. Brent crude oil dipped below $90 a barrel, the first time it has done so since December 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 250.82 points, or 1.96 percent, to close at 12,573.57, its lowest level since June 1. The S.& P. 500 was down 30.18 points, or 2.23 percent, at 1,325.51, its lowest level this week. The Nasdaq composite index fell 71.36 points, or 2.44 percent, to 2,859.09.
''The economic data coming out of China and Europe are not very good,'' Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said. ''You throw in the unemployment figures here not improving much. It is just raising concern the global economy is slowing down more than otherwise thought.''
''That is just crushing oil prices and energy stocks,'' he added.
Energy and materials stocks led the losses in the broader equities market, falling 4 percent and 3.3 percent.
Considering the ample stocks, particularly in the United States, the markets were less concerned about supply constraints than they were about weak demand. Brent crude prices, which Mr. Youngberg said were a good gauge for the market's outlook for the global economy, reflected the current thinking.
''Right now the sentiment has definitely gotten more pessimistic,'' Mr. Youngberg said.
Financial companies were not spared. In Europe, an audit of Spanish banks showing that they would require more capital added to the bleak picture for the euro zone. During trading hours, expectations loomed that Moody's Investors Service would announce credit ratings downgrades on 15 major banks. The S.& P. index that tracks financial stocks declined 2.3 percent.
Initial jobless claims were 387,000 in the week ending June 16, higher than forecasts and the 386,000 in the previous weekly count. Existing-home sales fell 1.5 percent in May. An index of factory activity reported by the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia showed a deepening contraction in June, to a reading of minus 16.6 from minus 5.8 in May.
Mr. Hembre said the macroeconomic picture was not the primary source of market weakness, but it added to the deterioration after the Fed meeting.
''It is primarily a function of the run-up of the market into the Fed meeting yesterday, and the minimalist response on the part of the Fed,'' Mr. Hembre said.
''You had the expectations of support, and they were timid, modest and disappointing,'' he said. ''Then you get these economic numbers that just blew out to the downside.''
Interest rates were lower as the uncertainty in other markets drove investors into the safety of fixed-income securities. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 101 6/32, and the yield fell to 1.62 percent from 1.65 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Top Agency Cuts Credit Ratings Of 15 Big Banks

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Already grappling with weak profits and global economic turmoil, 15 major banks were hit with credit downgrades on Thursday that could do more damage to their bottom lines and further unsettle equity markets.
The credit agency, Moody's Investors Service, which warned banks in February that a downgrade was possible, cut the credit scores of banks to new lows to reflect new risks that the industry has encountered since the financial crisis.
''The risks of this industry became apparent in the financial crisis,'' said Robert Young, a managing director at Moody's. ''These new ratings capture those risks.'' 
Citigroup and Bank of America, which have struggled to fully recover from the financial crisis, were among the hardest hit. After the downgrades, the banks stand barely above the minimum for an investment grade rating, a level also known as junk and a sign of the difficult business conditions they face.
Executives at the banks argued on Thursday that the new ratings failed to reflect the safeguards and changes that they had put in place in recent years.
The cuts come at a time of tumult within the industry. Banks have struggled to improve their profits against the backdrop of the European sovereign debt crisis, a weak American economy and new regulations.
The downgrades may amplify their problems. With lower ratings, creditors could charge the banks more on their loans. Big clients may also move their business to less-risky companies, further crimping earnings.
As bank profits falter, consumers could also be affected. Companies often try to make up for lost revenue by passing costs on to customers.
In the face of new regulations, banks have raised fees and other sources of income to bolster their business.
Moody's downgrades are part of a broad effort to make its analysis more rigorous. During the financial crisis, Moody's and its rivals got a black eye for placing high ratings on mortgage bonds that later imploded. Moody's approach reflects its belief that large banks have weaknesses that could still hurt their creditors.
But some analysts feel that Moody's is playing a game of catch-up. The latest actions, say critics, are backward-looking and do not consider the measures that banks have taken to strengthen themselves, including raising capital and getting out of certain risky businesses like proprietary trading.
''I feel that Moody's action is five years too late,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
The threat of a downgrade has rippled through the markets for months. After Moody's held out the prospect of a three-notch downgrade for Morgan Stanley in February, the bank's shares dropped by more than 25 percent. Moody's ended up cutting the firm's rating by two levels.
Now, bank executives will try to convince their creditors and large customers that Moody's has overreacted.
On Thursday, Citi said in a statement that Moody's approach ''fails to recognize Citi's transformation over the past several years,'' adding that ''Citi strongly disagrees with Moody's analysis of the banking industry and firmly believes its downgrade of Citi is arbitrary and completely unwarranted.''
Bank of America echoed such sentiments: ''In addition to strengthening our governance and risk management, Bank of America ended the first quarter of 2012 with record capital ratios.''
Those capital positions, which are banks' main buffer against losses, could be a point of strength across the industry. The lack of capital in the crisis left the financial system vulnerable, prompting the government to bail out many of the largest banks. Since then, they have increased their cushions. Today, Morgan Stanley's capital is twice what it was in 2007.
''The banking system is safer today than any time in the last 30 years,'' said Mr. Cassidy. ''We have not seen capital levels like this since the 1930s.''
Even so, Moody's remains concerned. In its report Thursday, the credit rating agency said it saw several weaknesses in the banks' Wall Street operations, including their complexity and opacity. Moody's highlighted a history of volatile profits and problems with risk management.
In its review, Moody's mentioned the recent trading debacle at JPMorgan Chase. In May, the bank disclosed that a bet on financial instruments tied to corporate bonds had soured; those losses could reach $5 billion.
The agency also noted the industry's continued dependence on short-term loans to finance their Wall Street operations. This type of credit dried up quickly in the crisis, forcing them to borrow from the government.
Some banking experts welcomed the downgrades, saying the credit rating agencies were finally beginning to reflect the risks within large banks. ''These downgrades are good news,'' said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University. ''Right now, their balance sheets are very fragile.''
The downgrades could widen the divide in the banking system.
Some customers may simply choose to transfer their business from the lowest-rated banks. One beneficiary may be JPMorgan Chase. It was downgraded two notches but still has a higher rating than Goldman Sachs.
Moody's may cut some of its ratings still further once a critical part of the financial overhaul comes into place. The Dodd-Frank legislation aims to give regulators the power to wind down large banks and inflict losses on banks' creditors in the process. Once these powers take effect, Moody's may downgrade the banks to reflect the fact that the government is less likely to bail out large banks.
Some analysts see the downgrades as only one step toward making the financial system safer. For one, the country does not have a coherent solution for dealing with large banks when they run into trouble, said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities.
''Will actions like this make the banking system safer? The jury's still out on that,'' said Mr. Mayo. ''That's unfortunate four years after the crisis.''

HEADLINE: Slight Decline in Claims for U.S. Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits was little changed last week, according to government data on Thursday, suggesting that the labor market was still struggling.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 387,000, the Labor Department said. The prior week's figure was revised up to 389,000 from the previously reported 386,000. 
The four-week moving average for new claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, increased 3,500 to 386,250 -- the highest level since early December.
''This confirms the weak labor market we have,'' said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ''I suspect we would see a modest rebound in payrolls in June but it would still be below 150,000. It's going to be another month of subpar jobs data.''
Labor market weakness prompted the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to ease monetary policy further by extending a program to re-weight bonds it already holds toward longer maturities to hold down borrowing costs.
Much of the recent weakness in the labor market has been caused by a decline in hiring, rather than increased layoffs.
New applications for unemployment benefits have barely budged since April.
The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid was unchanged at 3.3 million in the week ended June 9.
The number of people on extended benefits fell 24,638 to 110,864 in the week ended June 2, the latest week for which data is available, as more states lost eligibility for extended benefits for the long-term unemployed.
Economists expect that as more people fall off the unemployment benefit rolls, that will push down the jobless rate as they are forced to take jobs they would not normally have considered or drop out of the labor force.
A total of 5.83 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during the week ended June 2 under all programs, down 1,164 from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Sanctions Against Iran

 BODY:
It is disappointing but not surprising that two days of negotiations this week failed to produce any real progress toward curbing Iran's nuclear program. Iran, always playing the angles, is still trying to figure out how much economic pain it is willing to accept to maintain its nuclear ambitions and what, if anything, it is willing to give up. 
It is in the interest of the United States and its allies to keep talking, especially since a new round of sanctions are scheduled to go into effect. On June 28, the United States can start barring foreign banks doing oil-related business with the Central Bank of Iran from access to the American financial market. Starting on July 1, all members of the European Union will be prohibited from buying oil from Iran and insurance for ships that carry Iranian oil.
The meetings in Moscow were the third in a series involving Iran and the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany. To avoid a collapse in talks, they agreed that lower-level experts will meet on July 3.
The goal has to be to shut down all of the program that gives Iran the capability to build a bomb. The United Nations Security Council ordered that all enrichment should be ended six years ago, but the major powers were right to start the talks with a more short-term goal: to stop the most dangerous kind of enrichment.
Negotiators offered fuel for a medical reactor and aircraft replacement parts if Iran agreed to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity -- near bomb grade -- send its stockpile out of the country for fabrication into fuel rods and shut the underground facility at Fordo where the 20 percent enrichment is taking place.
Iran hinted in Moscow that it might limit enrichment to below that level but wanted more relief from sanctions and for the major powers to declare that it has a right to enrich uranium. The major powers say Iran will have that right if it proves it is not building a weapon.
We don't know if any mix of diplomacy and sanctions will persuade Iran to give up its ambitions. But there is no quick military fix. Even a sustained air campaign would likely set Iran's nuclear program back only by a few years and would rally huge sympathy for Tehran both at home and abroad. The current international consensus for sanctions, and the punishments, would evaporate.
That hasn't stopped American politicians from both parties from posturing on the issue. Before the Moscow talks, 44 Republican and Democratic senators sent President Obama a letter demanding that he abandon negotiations if there were no Iranian concessions.
The critics neglect to mention that Iran's program grew significantly when George W. Bush was president and opportunities were lost to constrain it at a much lower level. No president has been as successful as Mr. Obama in rallying the major powers to impose sanctions with bite. These are the first serious nuclear talks in years, and there is still time to let them run.

HEADLINE: Developer To Revive A Project In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A planned $1.4 billion residential development at the Domino Sugar refinery in Brooklyn that was given up for dead last year took on new life on Thursday when a new developer signed a contract to buy the property.
The original developer, C.P.C. Resources, ran into financial problems after years of planning and eventually defaulted on its loans, dashing hopes for the project's affordable housing and a waterfront esplanade.
C.P.C. Resources has now agreed to sell the 11-acre waterfront property for $185 million to the Walentas real estate family. If the sale is completed in the fall, the family expects to start work soon afterward. 
Once home to one of the largest sugar refineries in the world, the site, in Williamsburg, offers breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline.
The original plans for what was called New Domino included preserving the refinery building and its 40-foot-tall sign; shops; office space; a park: and 2,200 apartments, of which 660, or 30 percent, would be set aside for low- and moderate-income families.
''We're super-excited about it,'' said Jed Walentas, a principal at the family's company, Two Trees Management. ''This is a long-term investment for us. There are probably some opportunities to make improvements on the plans.''
The sale is yet another signal of the resurgent rental market in Williamsburg; Long Island City, Queens; and Manhattan, where rents have climbed an estimated 10 percent in the last year.
But Mr. Walentas could face stiff opposition from community groups and elected officials if he tries to build fewer than 660 apartments for low- and moderate-income families. The project was approved in 2010 after fierce debate in Williamsburg, once a working-class neighborhood suddenly awash in luxury high-rises.
''We're happy that someone can take this over and build it,'' said Rob Solano, executive director of Churches United for Fair Housing. ''It's extremely important that the Domino project is built with all the affordable housing that was promised.''
Councilwoman Diana Reyna, who represents the neighborhood, said affordable housing was critical.
''We're looking forward to seeing how the new developer will deliver on the promises made to the community,'' Ms. Reyna said.
The deal would be a boon for C.P.C. Resources, a subsidiary of the Community Preservation Corporation, which stumbled badly in the economic downturn.
C.P.C. Resources bought the Domino property in 2004. But it took six years to rezone the property and gain the necessary city approvals. The group promised not only to preserve the refinery's main building, but also to build a large block of affordable apartments, lease space to a supermarket and allow public access to the waterfront.
By the end of 2011, C.P.C. Resources was in danger of folding. It feared that the Domino land was worth less than the $130 million it owed lenders.
Earlier this year, C.P.C. Resources sought a new partner for the project or a developer with a similar vision. The company's existing partner, the Katan Group, tried to block the sale.
After Rafael E. Cestero, the new president of C.P.C. Resources, reached an agreement to sell the property to Two Trees for $165 million, Katan offered to buy it for $185 million with the Chetrit Group and David Bistricer, a developer who has clashed with housing advocates. Instead, Two Trees raised its offer and signed a contract.
''This deal is a great opportunity to realize our vision for Domino as a vibrant, mixed-income, mixed-use waterfront community,'' Mr. Cestero said.
Y. David Scharf, a lawyer for Katan, issued a statement saying he had learned of the deal with Two Trees only on Thursday morning. ''We are evaluating the contract, its terms and ramifications alongside what seem to have been offers with superior terms,'' he said. ''We have serious reservations about the propriety of the Two Trees deal.''

HEADLINE: To Settle Lawsuit, Facebook Alters Policy for Its Like Button

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Complicating its efforts to accelerate advertising revenue, Facebook has agreed to make it clear to users that when they click to like a product on Facebook, their names and photos can be used to plug the product. They will also be given a chance to decline the opportunity to be unpaid endorsers. 
The changes are part of a settlement for a class-action lawsuit against Facebook in Federal District Court in California. The agreement compels the company to change one of its most effective advertising tools, known as Sponsored Stories.
According to the agreement, filed Wednesday with the court in San Jose, Facebook users will be able to control and see which of their actions on Facebook are used to generate advertisements seen by their Facebook friends. For Facebook users under 18, there is an additional requirement: the company must give parents the opportunity to keep their children out of advertisements.
The settlement does not inhibit the company from using Sponsored Stories, which Facebook executives have repeatedly described as the most effective form of advertising in part because they do not seem like traditional advertisements. Both on the Web and on a mobile device, a Sponsored Story features the name and picture of a Facebook friend who has clicked on the like button for a product or organization.
This is exactly why Sponsored Stories can be bewildering, or off-putting, to some users. Until now, Facebook users were unaware when and how they were exploited for advertising, and they may not have realized that a click on something as vague as a like button could be used to enrich Facebook, the company.
Facebook has declined to comment on the settlement itself. In its defense, it argued that users gave ''implied consent'' every time they clicked the like button for a particular page, whether it was Ben and Jerry's ice cream or Barack Obama for president.
It will amend its terms of use to explain that users give the company permission to use their name, profile picture and content.
''This means for example that you permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your name and/or profile picture with your content or information,'' the language included in the court document reads.
The company will also offer settings that let users control which of their actions -- which individual like, listen, or read -- will appear in Sponsored Stories.
The changes are to be made within the next six months. How many Facebook users will decline to participate in the ads remains to be seen. An economist hired by the plaintiffs' lawyers, Fernando Torres, testified that giving users such a choice could cost Facebook $103 million in advertising revenue.
Luckily for the company, warnings and notices may not keep people from sharing on Facebook. A recent analysis of the accounts of a million Facebook users concluded that nearly 9 out of 10 Americans -- and slightly fewer Europeans -- share information about themselves that can be misused, according to Secure.me, a company that offers privacy services to users of social networks.
According to the settlement, Facebook agreed to donate $10 million to nonprofit organizations, including Consumers Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several law school programs that specialize in privacy. The company also agreed to pay $10 million in plaintiffs' legal fees.

HEADLINE: Approving Billions in Cuts to Social Services, California Reaches a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Just 10 days before the start of the new fiscal year, Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democratic-controlled Legislature reached a budget deal on Thursday to close a nearly $16 billion budget gap. The agreement came after days of negotiations, with legislative leaders reluctant to make the cuts that Governor Brown said were urgently needed. 
That the budget met its deadline for only the third time in the last two decades was seen as a cause for celebration, though the spending plan hardly contained good news.
And even more cuts loom on the horizon if voters do not approve Governor Brown's proposed tax increase, which will be placed before them in November. Besides an array of immediate cuts, the budget includes $6 billion in trigger cuts, coming primarily from the state's education system, if voters do not back the tax measure.
The cuts already in the deal rely on limiting eligibility for welfare and other changes to social services programs. The deal will put a 24-month limit on the state's welfare program, although it allows for some exceptions in counties with high unemployment. It also cuts the number of spaces available in state-subsidized child-care programs.
''This agreement strongly positions the state to withstand the economic challenges and uncertainties ahead,'' Governor Brown said in a statement. ''We have restructured and downsized our prison system, moved government closer to the people, made billions in difficult cuts, and now the Legislature is poised to make even more difficult cuts and permanently reform welfare.''
The Legislature is expected to vote on the deal next week.
Under the governor's tax proposal, the state would receive $6.9 billion in taxes from an increase in sales tax to 7.75 percent, up from 7.5 percent, and a surcharge on income tax for those earning more than $250,000 a year. If voters reject the plan, an additional $6 billion will be carved out of the budget next January, primarily from the state's primary schools and higher education system.
But Mr. Brown's tax plan will have to compete with a rival tax increase proposal backed by the state's Parent Teacher Association, which would use the revenue to send more money to public schools.
Last year, the Legislature passed an optimistic budget plan and later had to cut nearly $1 billion when the revenue did not come in as expected. Then, in May, Governor Brown announced that the state's budget gap had grown to $16 billion, rather than the $9 billion his administration had projected in January.
Optimistic revenue projections have troubled the Legislature for the last several years, as the state has grappled with a financial crisis of a seriousness not seen since the Great Depression. When Mr. Brown took office last year, he pledged not to rely on gimmicks that many had criticized the Legislature for using in the past.
''As always, the negotiations were tough,'' Darrell Steinberg, the State Senate leader, said in a statement. ''But we move forward together with a state budget that's structurally balanced, setting us on the path to putting this nagging deficit behind us.''

HEADLINE: Louisiana Illegally Fired 7,500 Teachers, Judge Says

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- As much as some may wish otherwise, there is no starting from scratch when rebuilding a city, or a school system.
A judge confirmed that here on Wednesday, ruling that the Orleans Parish School Board and the Louisiana Department of Education, in laying the groundwork for a school reform movement that has become nationally recognized, illegally fired 7,500 school employees.
The decision by Ethel S. Julien, a civil District Court judge, backed by 45 pages of reasoning and historical narrative, reinforced a long-held counternarrative of the beginnings of that movement. 
The judge described the state education superintendent, just two weeks after Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005, asking for billions of dollars from the federal government and saying that a significant portion would be used to pay out-of-work employees, the vast majority of whom were from Orleans Parish.
But in the following months, the state-run Recovery School District won control of nearly all New Orleans schools from the local school board, as well as most of the board's operating budget. The requested federal funds were directed to the recovery district.
In December 2005, the local school board, with few schools and little money in its control, passed a resolution firing 7,500 school employees, who at that time had been on ''disaster leave without pay,'' an employment status that Judge Julien found in her decision to be ''fictional.'' She concluded that the state was liable for rendering the local board unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to its workers.
Judge Julien found that state law required the board to show just cause, in writing, before firing a tenured teacher, and that fired employees are entitled to hearings. She also found that a special policy for force reductions at a time of economic crisis required the creation of a ''recall list'' -- designed to refill the vacancies with those who had been laid off -- and that even in that situation, employees who were dismissed were entitled to a hearing.
None of these were done, and vacancies that arose when schools began to open, most of them charter schools, were filled by outsiders.
The class action suit that led to Wednesday's decision has made sluggish progress through the court system, starting as a petition in October 2005 by several employees denied an opportunity to work at new charter schools here. Only later did the suit reach its current form: a claim for damages by seven former employees, including teachers, administrators and a secretary. The case, or some aspect of it, has reached the State Supreme Court six times, said Willie M. Zanders, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
''We were optimistic during those seven years,'' Mr. Zanders said. ''We just thought we needed to stay the course. The judicial system was working, and we've been very successful.''
The plaintiffs' awards, ranging from $48,000 to $480,000, were calculated as the difference between the money they earned after Katrina and the money they would have earned, in pay and benefits, if they had continued as employees of the school board. If the case survives a likely appeal, the financial ramifications could be substantial, considering there are 6,900 people in the class.
''We are studying the opinion and looking at appellate issues,'' said Michael H. Rubin, a lawyer representing the defendants.
Beyond the financial considerations, however, are issues about the city's school reform efforts, which have been hailed by many both nationally and in New Orleans but have inspired a profound sense of disenfranchisement in others.
''It certainly opens up the broader question of 'At what cost are we willing to change?' '' said Andre Perry, the associate director for educational initiatives at the New Orleans-based Loyola Institute for Quality and Equity in Education. ''It should not be by any means necessary.''

HEADLINE: Natural Gas For Vehicles Could Use U.S. Support

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The fuel is cheap and plentiful. But there is little infrastructure to deliver it to users, and so there is little demand for equipment to use it.
That, in brief, is what is wrong with the natural gas vehicle market.
And in those facts could be the genesis of an idea for a federal program that would create jobs, save money for consumers and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
If there were natural gas filling stations along the Interstate highway system, the long-haul trucking industry would almost certainly begin to buy natural gas-fueled trucks. But since there are few such trucks now, the first such stations would have few customers when they opened, meaning they would seem like dubious commercial ventures.
Despite that, some stations are being built by the natural gas industry. But the progress is slow, and the oil imports keep coming. 
So why not have the government, which can borrow money for almost nothing -- about three-quarters of 1 percent for five years -- put up money to subsidize such stations? Doing so would provide jobs for construction workers, and thus amount to economic stimulus that could really affect a depressed area of the economy. The unemployment rate for construction workers is now 14.2 percent, far above the rate for the rest of the economy. As demand for natural gas vehicles rose, there would also be demand for workers to make them.
The main reason all this makes sense now is that the emerging technology of hydraulic fracturing, or ''fracking,'' has produced an abundance of natural gas, driving down prices.
A few decades ago, it was taken for granted that, in the long run, the fact that natural gas was less polluting would lead to it costing more than oil on an energy-equivalent basis. Perhaps natural gas should cost 120 percent as much as oil, we thought then.
But the natural gas market is a North American one, because there is little capacity to export gas, while the oil market is a global one. With the current natural gas glut, the American price is less than 20 percent of the price of oil.
There is nothing new about the idea of widespread use of natural gas vehicles. ''In 1975,'' recalled Frank Zarb, who was then President Gerald R. Ford's energy czar, ''I thought there would be a fight between the electric car and the natural gas car.''
Nor is there anything new about the government trying to stimulate the market. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that some fleets buy natural gas vehicles. But then the world entered a prolonged period of relatively cheap oil -- the average price was less than $19 a barrel from the end of 1992 through 1998 -- and both politicians and citizens stopped worrying much about it.
But natural gas vehicles never went away. While some local fleets that had bought such vehicles as a result of the 1992 law got rid of them, others did not. A substantial part of the market for city buses and garbage trucks is now filled by natural gas vehicles. The nature of the business is that those vehicles travel limited routes and can return to their bases -- and to a refueling station -- each night.
All told, there are about 130,000 natural gas vehicles in the United States, about 1 percent of the worldwide total of 13 million vehicles, according to Kathryn Clay, the executive director of the Drive Natural Gas Initiative, a project financed by natural gas producers and pipelines.
Not many vehicles are aimed at consumers. Honda has a natural gas version of the Civic, initially sold only to fleets that already had natural gas terminals. Since 2005, the car has been available to retail customers.
In Europe, numerous bifuel vehicles can use either natural gas or gasoline, much as hybrid cars can use either gasoline or electricity, but they are only starting to arrive here. American car companies have announced plans to sell bifuel pickup trucks, but the market for them will primarily be companies with their own refueling infrastructure.
That is kind of amazing. Imagine if gasoline vehicles were sold only to those who could afford to build and operate their own gas station.
It is a measure of how far away from government action we have come that no one seems to be pushing for the government to step up and directly provide the spark for getting an infrastructure in place that would enable Americans to use much more of the natural gas that has become abundant, and therefore much less of the oil that must be imported at high prices.
Instead, the natural gas industry supported a bill that would have offered tax credits to those who invested in the infrastructure as well as those who made the vehicles and those who bought them. It was opposed by the chemical industry, which uses a lot of natural gas and wants to keep it cheap. The bill got 51 votes in the Senate, but these days it needs 60 to do anything.
There are already big tax subsidies for electric cars, so a case can be made for the similar treatment of natural gas vehicles. But given how cheap natural gas is, it might be far cheaper for the government to provide direct subsidies to get the infrastructure going, rather than provide ongoing subsidies via tax credits.
Two kinds of natural gas are used by vehicles. Smaller vehicles use compressed natural gas, while big trucks use liquefied natural gas. The infrastructure would need to support both forms.
Christopher R. Knittel, a professor of energy economics at M.I.T., says he thinks the government should take several steps to promote the use of natural gas in vehicles. One step would be to encourage local natural gas utilities to open up their own stations to sell gas for vehicles. He would also like to encourage people to buy their own equipment to compress natural gas at home, using the gas already delivered through pipelines. Such equipment is available now, but few have bought it.
''Markets work when prices reflect the social cost of the products,'' he said in an interview. ''For a variety of reasons, the cost of gasoline now does not reflect all of those costs.'' He pointed not only to the cost of pollution but to the risk to the economy from an oil-price shock and to the political dangers of being so dependent on Mideast oil.
''Recent advances in natural gas drilling as well as increases in oil prices appear to have made natural gas competitive with oil in the long run,'' Mr. Knittel wrote in a paper released last week by the Brookings Institution. But, he added, ''such a change in price may not be enough to cause the United States to substitute natural gas for oil in the transportation sector, even when it is socially beneficial to do so.''
If natural gas did become widely used in vehicles, a number of things would happen. Natural gas prices would rise, of course, which is why the natural gas industry is eager for that to happen.
That would offend the chemical industry, and might alarm homeowners who heat with natural gas. It would reduce the United States trade deficit and, by lowering the use of oil, put a damper on that market. Higher natural gas prices could also make other alternative fuels more likely to be economical, something that is hard to accomplish now with natural gas so cheap.
Natural gas prices are now so low that it is possible the market will develop without government help. A number of plans have been announced to build refueling stations near interstate highways, in hopes of attracting trucking companies that use those routes. But given the need for quick action -- last year the United States spent $750 billion importing oil and oil products -- it makes sense for the government to move to develop the natural gas transportation market as quickly as possible.
Some economists have trouble understanding why so little is happening in Washington. ''I think a political leader who jumped on this issue would be very successful,'' said James D. Hamilton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has been pushing natural gas use in transportation on the Econbrowser blog.
In a different political environment, it would be an obvious policy proposal for a presidential candidate. But so far, it is an idea without visible political support.
Correction: June 23, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the case for a federal program to support a fueling infrastructure for natural gas vehicles, misstated Honda's marketing of its natural gas-fueled Civic. While the car was initially aimed at customers with their own natural gas terminals, it has been available to retail customers since 2005; it is not the case that it is marketed only to fleets.

HEADLINE: Top Agency Cuts Credit Ratings Of 15 Big Banks

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
10:33 p.m. Updated Already grappling with weak profits and global economic turmoil, 15 major banks were hit with credit downgrades on Thursday that could do more damage to their bottom lines and further unsettle equity markets.
The credit agency, Moody's Investors Service, which warned banks in February that a downgrade was possible, cut the credit scores of banks to new lows to reflect new risks that the industry has encountered since the financial crisis.
''The risks of this industry became apparent in the financial crisis,'' said Robert Young, a managing director at Moody's. ''These new ratings capture those risks.''
Citigroup and Bank of America, which have struggled to fully recover from the financial crisis, were among the hardest hit. After the downgrades, the banks stand barely above the minimum for an investment grade rating, a sign of the difficult business conditions they face. 
Executives at the banks argued on Thursday that the new ratings failed to reflect the safeguards and changes that they had put in place in recent years.
The cuts come at a time of tumult within the industry. Banks have struggled to improve their profits against the backdrop of the European sovereign debt crisis, a weak American economy and new regulations.
The downgrades may amplify their problems. With lower ratings, creditors could charge the banks more on their loans. Big clients may also move their business to less-risky companies, further crimping earnings.
As bank profits falter, consumers could also be affected. Companies often try to make up for lost revenue by passing costs on to customers.
In the face of new regulations, banks have raised fees and other sources of income to bolster their business.
Moody's downgrades are part of a broad effort to make its analysis more rigorous. During the financial crisis, Moody's and its rivals got a black eye for placing high ratings on mortgage bonds that later imploded.
Moody's approach reflects its belief that large banks have weaknesses that could still hurt their creditors.
Along with Citigroup and Bank of America, the credit rating agency took action on 13 other banks, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS, HSBC, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Royal Bank of Canada, and Royal Bank of Scotland.
But some analysts feel that Moody's is playing a game of catch-up. The latest actions, say critics, are backward-looking and do not consider the measures that banks have taken to strengthen themselves, including raising capital and getting out of certain risky businesses like proprietary trading.
''I feel that Moody's action is five years too late,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
The threat of a downgrade has rippled through the markets for months. After Moody's held out the prospect of a three-notch downgrade for Morgan Stanley in February, the bank's shares dropped by more than 25 percent. Moody's ended up cutting the firm's rating by two levels.
Now, bank executives will try to convince their creditors and large customers that Moody's has overreacted.
On Thursday, Citi said in a statement that Moody's approach ''fails to recognize Citi's transformation over the past several years,'' adding that ''Citi strongly disagrees with Moody's analysis of the banking industry and firmly believes its downgrade of Citi is arbitrary and completely unwarranted.''
Bank of America echoed such sentiments: ''In addition to strengthening our governance and risk management, Bank of America ended the first quarter of 2012 with record capital ratios.''
Those capital positions, which are banks' main buffer against losses, could be a point of strength across the industry. The lack of capital in the crisis left the financial system vulnerable, prompting the government to bail out many of the largest banks. Since then, they have increased their cushions. Today, Morgan Stanley's capital is twice what it was in 2007.
''The banking system is safer today than any time in the last 30 years,'' said Mr. Cassidy. ''We have not seen capital levels like this since the 1930s.''
Even so, Moody's remains concerned. In its report Thursday, the credit rating agency said it saw several weaknesses in the banks' Wall Street operations, including their complexity and opacity. Moody's highlighted a history of volatile profits and problems with risk management.
In its review, Moody's mentioned the recent trading debacle at JPMorgan Chase. In May, the bank disclosed that a bet on financial instruments tied to corporate bonds had soured; those losses could reach $5 billion.
The agency also noted the industry's continued dependence on short-term loans to finance their Wall Street operations. This type of credit dried up quickly in the crisis, forcing them to borrow from the government.
Some banking experts welcomed the downgrades, saying the credit rating agencies were finally beginning to reflect the risks within large banks. ''These downgrades are good news,'' said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University. ''Right now, their balance sheets are very fragile.''
The downgrades could widen the divide in the banking system.
Some customers may simply choose to transfer their business from the lowest-rated banks. One beneficiary may be JPMorgan Chase. It was downgraded two notches but still has a higher rating than Goldman Sachs.
Moody's may cut some of its ratings still further once a critical part of the financial overhaul comes into place. The Dodd-Frank legislation aims to give regulators the power to wind down large banks and inflict losses on banks' creditors in the process. Once these powers take effect, Moody's may downgrade the banks to reflect the fact that the government is less likely to bail out large banks.
Some analysts see the downgrades as only one step toward making the financial system safer. For one, the country does not have a coherent solution for dealing with large banks when they run into trouble, said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities.
''Will actions like this make the banking system safer? The jury's still out on that,'' said Mr. Mayo. ''That's unfortunate four years after the crisis.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: June 23, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about a credit downgrade of 15 large banks by Moody's Investors Service misstated, in some editions, its cut for Bank of America. Bank of America's credit rating was cut by one notch, to Baa2, from Baa1; it was not cut by two notches.

HEADLINE: Customers Do the Selling for Travel Firms

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
PERHAPS not coincidentally in an era of interpersonal, often electronic communication, three travel brands have introduced campaigns based on the concept of a travel diary.
Campaigns by Crystal Cruises and Air France invite prospective customers to use special apps to create online photo souvenirs of their trips, which they can share with Facebook friends or post on the companies' Facebook page. Crystal also has introduced an advertising campaign whose tagline is ''Begin a new story.''
Sofitel, a high-end, global brand of Accor, the French hotel company, has begun a series of magazine ads, each containing a glamorous photo of a hotel opposite a photo of a handwritten travel diary page. 
''Stories are the currency of conversation,'' said Jonah Berger, professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Air France and Crystal ''are realizing the benefit of personal stories that can persuade consumers, which are much more real and authentic than normal advertising copy,'' he added.
Crystal's campaign is by Y&R: California, based in San Francisco. Y&R: California is part of Y&R, a unit of the WPP Group; it replaced the Los Angeles office of M & C Saatchi last year.
The centerpiece of the campaign is three print ads, each featuring an impressionistic watercolor depicting a different destination -- St. Mark's Square in Venice, an unidentified jungle with an elephant ridden by someone visible only from flip-flop-clad feet, and Saint Petersburg in Russia -- as well as a few, smaller snapshots of travelers and their mementos. These are running this spring, fall and winter in magazines like Departures, Elle Decor, National Geographic Traveler and the United States and British editions of Conde Nast Traveler, and on their Web sites.
In addition to the new photo app, which lets users create and share customized snapshots of their travels, the campaign will let owners of iPhones with the Aurasma-augmented reality app use the app to view videos that use the print ads as a jumping-off point. For example, in the Saint Petersburg video, the watercolor of Lenin's statue expands, and a real hand uses a real silver spoon to stir a watercolor cup of coffee. The Aurasma-enabled videos will be available starting in late July.
Crystal, which is a unit of NYK Line in Tokyo, will spend $10 million on its new advertising in its current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2013. According to Kantar Media, it spent $9.5 million on advertising in calendar year 2010 and $7.3 million in calendar year 2011.
Last month, Air France introduced a free iPhone app, developed by My Studio Factory in Paris, that lets passengers create personalized, location-based photo albums on their trips. These can be shared on Facebook with friends and also with a network of ''Travel Bookers'' Air France has developed on its own Facebook page; albums can be searched by region, country, or themes like nature, history and gastronomy.
Christian Herzog, senior vice president of marketing for Air France-KLM, said Air France had more than 800,000 friends on Facebook. He also said the airline would begin running contests next month in which its Facebook friends can choose the best photo albums; winners will receive free air travel. ''Our objective is to animate social media through content provided by customers, not only through corporate communication or commercial offers. We think it is original and interesting for other passengers,'' he said.
Air France, which already offers many apps to customers, will shortly add the Travel Book app to iPad and Android users, he said. He declined to quantify the carrier's budget for the app, although he said it was spending ''millions of euros'' on all technologies.
Sofitel's advertising, which began running in June issues of American and European magazines like Departures, Intelligent Life and Ultra Travel, is an extension of a campaign it introduced in 2008 whose tagline is ''Life is Magnifique.''
Geoffray Maugin, vice president of global marketing for Sofitel, said the ads by BETC-Euro RSCG are meant to promote the brand's new positioning; Sofitel reduced the number of its hotels to 120 from 200 from 2007 to 2010; remaining hotels are the most luxurious and in the most desirable locations.
Each ad depicts a specific hotel -- including new ones like the Sofitel Vienna Stephansdom -- next to a handwritten diary page of a guest describing his or her stay there. Mr. Maugin said the diary entries were inspired by comments from actual guests. He said the budget for the first wave of new ads was one million euros.
The campaigns were given mixed reviews by industry observers and experts. Michael Hraba, a hospitality industry consultant based in Tiburon, Calif., called Crystal's use of Aurasma ''very fresh. The idea of making a print ad come to life is very compelling. It's an innovative way to create a more immersive environment for a potential customer.''
Although Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst and co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, called the use of Aurasma ''cutting edge,'' he also said its use might not be relevant to the cruise line's target customers, many of whom are affluent baby boomers.
He also questioned the tone of the Sofitel campaign. ''With its two biggest markets, Europe and North America, not on the most solid economic footing, it seems disconnected from the way people are talking, acting and thinking,'' he said.
In addition, Mr. Hraba questioned social media users' interest in posting to the Facebook pages of Crystal or Air France. ''What incentive do they have when there are so many options to share that don't actually involve the brand?'' he asked.
He called Air France's plan to run contests for Travel Book makers ''a big, important point. People need an incentive to create content for a brand, and a contest will definitely compel them.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Gets Attention, but Planned Spending Cuts Range Far and Wide

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is no secret here that come January, barring Congressional action, huge spending cuts will hit the Pentagon. Congressional Republicans, President Obama's secretary of defense and military contractors have taken pains to denounce the planned reductions, which were scheduled as part of the resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis of last year.
But other government programs are facing equally large cuts, though they have received a scintilla of the attention and outrage that the planned Pentagon cuts have attracted. 
From cancer research to farm inspectors to grants to cities and states and law enforcement agencies, nearly every sector of government would be affected by the planned $1.2 trillion in cuts, especially in the first year of the nine-year reductions.
While many mandatory programs, like Medicare, Social Security and others, are exempt or virtually untouched under the scheduled cuts, known as sequestration, roughly $321 billion would be cut from the ''nondefense discretionary'' category, which represents scores of government spending areas outside of the military.
''There has been a great deal of attention to the defense side,'' said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. ''I think a lot of people simply aren't aware'' of the other cuts, she added.
Ms. Murray worked with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to pass an amendment to the farm bill that would compel the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense to deliver a report on the impact of all of the planned reductions. The fact that Congress might have to force the Obama administration to detail where budgets would be sliced underscores one of the main reasons that so little attention has been turned to the impending cuts to nonmilitary programs.
The White House -- along with some top Democrats -- has concluded that Republicans care so deeply about the roughly $492 billion in planned Pentagon cuts that the military budget will become a bargaining chip that Democrats can use at the end of the year to pursue new revenues and leverage in the debate over extending the Bush tax cuts.
While Democrats are no more fond of the cuts than Republicans are -- especially the roughly 8 percent cuts to various programs they cherish in the first year -- many believe the reductions are less painful than any agreement they could reach with Republicans toward deficit reduction in the current political climate.
''Congress should do its job and pass a balanced plan for deficit reduction,'' Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the administration budget office, said in an e-mail. He added: ''There is time for Congress to act, and we hope that it will. Should it get to a point where it appears that Congress will not do its job and the sequester may take effect, we will be prepared.''
The Pentagon and those who service it -- largely military contractors -- have been a loud, unified voice, pressuring members of Congress about the cuts and their potential impact on local economies.
This month, for example, a group of executives from the Northrop Grumman Corporation met with members of the Connecticut delegation to announce that they were closing a plant in Norwalk and laying off 315 workers in part because of the impending sequester, said a person who attended the meeting but could not be identified speaking publicly about it. (A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the meeting.)
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has come to Capitol Hill more than once to complain about the cuts, and Republicans have offered several bills, including one that has passed the House, to undo sequestration. Members hammer the issue daily; the House Armed Services Committee has devoted its entire Web home page to the issue.
In contrast, the cuts to nonmilitary programs would be spread across scores of industries and groups, few of which have coalesced in a similar manner. While some administration officials have testified that the cuts would be harmful to government programs, few lawmakers have seized on their remarks and run with them.
There is an effort under way to write a letter to members of Congress from leaders of various groups, and the Coalition for Health Funding is trying to build awareness of the cuts through town hall meetings and other gatherings. ''This is really a 'Hey, what about us?' effort,'' said Emily J. Holubowich, the group's executive director.
Further, because certain programs like Social Security and Veterans Affairs have been exempt from the cuts, there is a feeling among some Democrats that they have less at risk than Republicans defending Pentagon cuts. Republicans find that view baffling.
''I guess they think it's O.K.,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who said he believed cuts to both types of spending would be devastating.
''There is political pain and substantive pain'' in the cuts to nonmilitary spending, said Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group, who noted that roughly a quarter of those cuts would affect Americans at or below the poverty line.
''When people start saying, 'This means you're going to cut the National Cancer Institute or air traffic control or the F.B.I. or Border Patrol by 8.4 percent, those little phrases can ring bells with the American public.''
According to the groups' research, a portion of nonmilitary discretionary monies are in grants to states and local governments, including education programs, law enforcement and fire departments.
''I voted against the deal for those reasons,'' said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. ''I think those cuts would be devastating for New York.''
A recent report prepared by the Bipartisan Policy Center found that the sequester cuts in total could reduce the gross domestic product in the United States by roughly half a percentage point in 2013.
The end game for Democrats, according to half a dozen aides, is to wait for Republicans to become excessively nervous about large Pentagon cuts and start their bargaining to undo the entire package from there.
For example, Democrats would like to end the Bush-era tax cuts for high earners, close tax loopholes for some companies and other revenue measures.
''I imagine you will hear more about all of these things as we get closer,'' Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Putin Seeks To Reassure Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- After a series of hard-line moves and statements after his re-election this spring, President Vladimir V. Putin softened his approach during a speech to foreign investors on Thursday.
Mr. Putin, speaking at the government-sponsored St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, promised to continue business-friendly overhauls begun by his predecessor, Dmitri A. Medvedev.
The appeal to investors, whom Russia will need to balance a trade and budget deficit if oil prices fall further, included a rare admission that political opposition could play a role, as long as it was expressed legally. 
Mr. Putin said that ''the thirst for change is a natural, driving force of progress'' but dangerous when it threatened civil peace.
The speech to the audience of investors and executives -- which included Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil -- was a switch from statements by Mr. Putin and senior aides since his re-election in March.
Mr. Putin may have been trying to address signs of deterioration in relations between Russia and the United States, which pose a risk to foreign investment with potentially dire consequences for the economy.
Investors are jittery. The Russian stock market is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio that is 16 percent lower than Greece's -- a country with severe economic problems.
Investors have been pulling money out of Russia since March as oil prices slide and concerns mount that the European debt crisis will erode demand for oil and natural gas in Europe, harming Russia's balance of payments.
Even if oil prices remain high, Russia will need foreign investment to balance a projected trade deficit later this decade.
Russia has a ''P.R. problem,'' said Todd J. Berman, head of investment banking at Troika Dialog in Moscow.
In the months after Mr. Putin's re-election, a top Russian general threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack against Poland; Russian weapons dealers have sent air defense missiles to Syria; and a Kremlin spokesman suggested that the police should ''smear the livers'' of protesters on the sidewalks.
On Thursday, Mr. Putin emphasized the government's commitment to domestic economic changes.
''State capitalism is not our goal,'' Mr. Putin said.
The Kremlin, he said, intends to improve the investor climate in Russia by making it easier to do business. The Parliament recently passed a law making insider trading illegal, he said.
He also pointed out that the Russian economy was already more robust than others in Europe, with the government projecting a 4.3 percent increase in gross domestic product this year.
The unemployment rate is just 5 percent, and the inflation rate last year fell to a post-Soviet era low of 6.1 percent.
Russia is also in healthier financial shape than many Western countries. The country's national debt is equal to 9 percent of G.D.P., compared with 104 percent in the United States.
''Investors and businesses need to feel a government is behaving responsibly,'' Mr. Putin said.
He contrasted Russia, with its budget surpluses and high employment, with Europe. The Continent, he said, should better coordinate its response to the sovereign debt crisis.
''Egoistic and selfish deals are not the basis for stability,'' he said.
Mr. Putin also introduced some new economic proposals. A portion of the national pension fund, he said, could be invested in shares of infrastructure companies to ease volatility in the stock market.

HEADLINE: Partisan Confrontation That Not All Wanted

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Republican leaders in and out of Washington adopted a go-slow approach to the brewing confrontation between the House and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., worried that a blowup over the ''Fast and Furious'' scandal would detract from their central message of the 2012 campaign: jobs.
Ultimately, they were powerless to prevent the blowup, pressed by a handful of Republican lawmakers who have driven the issue and a conservative base that has followed it closely. 
Now a matter that has been a sideshow on the Republican right flank for months is moving center stage, giving once-reluctant Republicans a chance to portray the Obama White House as evasive, scandalous or even criminal -- and giving the Obama team its own opportunity to portray the president as focusing on the economy while a do-nothing Congress fixates on a witch hunt.
''We are talking about a program that gave Mexican drug dealers guns, and those guns killed an American border agent,'' Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters on Thursday, even as he tried to steer the conversation back to jobs. ''The American people deserve the truth.''
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, responded by accusing Republicans of engaging in ''a shameful display of abusive power'' in pushing the issue. The White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, said Mr. Boehner's colleagues ''have made the strategic choice to score political points by focusing their time and attention on a botched 2009 law enforcement operation rather than on jobs and the economy.''
For two years now, Representative Darrell Issa of California, the hard-charging chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and two deputies, Representatives Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, have pursued the details of a 2009 gunrunning investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that went awry.
Seeking to build a bigger case against high-ranking gunrunners, agents did not move quickly against weapons obtained by low-level smugglers in the gunrunning operation. The agents lost track of 2,000 guns, most of which probably reached Mexican drug cartels. Two were found near the scene of a shootout in which a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, was killed.
One of the Republicans pushing the investigation, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, conceded on Thursday that until this week, more Americans would have associated ''Fast and Furious'' with a movie about cars than a Washington controversy. But then on Wednesday the White House invoked executive privilege to protect documents related to Fast and Furious from Congressional oversight, the Issa committee voted to refer a contempt of Congress citation against Mr. Holder to the full House, and the issue was joined.
Mr. Boehner said the vote would be held next week unless the disputed documents are turned over.
While Republicans acknowledge that the dispute has diverted them from their jobs message, they believe it will play to their advantage. Base conservatives have been weaving conspiracy theories for months, accusing the administration of a complicated plot to increase support for gun control by proving that gun dealers, governed by weak gun laws, were funneling firearms to Mexican drug lords.
Mr. Issa, appearing at the National Rifle Association's April convention, raised the question himself, saying: ''Could it be that what they really were thinking of was in fact to use this walking of guns in order to promote an assault weapons ban? Many think so.''
Some conservative voters have their own contempt for Mr. Holder, linking him to supposed scandals around the New Black Panthers and holding him responsible for the Justice Department's efforts to overrule voter identification laws and to try some defendants charged in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in a civilian court near ground zero.
''Republicans are under pressure from home to vote for contempt,'' Mr. Cole said.
Independent voters seem unaware of those undercurrents, but the basic facts of the case are scandalous on their own, Republicans say, and such voters are only now learning about them.
''There was a concerted effort to keep us on message,'' Mr. Chaffetz said, referring to a Republican leadership marked by ''skepticism and hesitation.''
''But this is ridiculous,'' he added. ''You've got people dead here.''
The Romney campaign, for its part, is steering clear.
''There are folks where the issue of Fast and Furious is definitely cause for concern,'' said a Romney adviser who did not want to be identified as criticizing party leaders, ''but the No. 1 issue, whether you're looking at polls or talking to voters, is the economy. That's where the governor is focused right now.''
Republicans are open about the political sensitivities of their move. Mr. Chaffetz said he called Lanhee Chen, Mitt Romney's main policy adviser, to warn him of the contempt vote. Mr. Boehner stressed that he has ''been heavily involved in this now for months, making sure that the t's were crossed, the i's were dotted, and that what we were asking for was reasonable.''
But they believe that the White House made an unforced error when, just hours before the committee's contempt citation vote, the president invoked executive privilege. White House officials portray the move as routine. Privilege has been invoked 24 times since Ronald Reagan's presidency. But a controversy that was squarely on Mr. Holder's desk suddenly had a presidential component.
''The decision to invoke executive privilege is an admission that White House officials were involved in decisions that misled the Congress and have covered up the truth,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''So what is the Obama administration hiding?''
To Democrats, all of that is noise over an issue only the most partisan Republicans know or care about. And it allows Mr. Obama to portray himself as focused on what is important, like the student loan rates that are days away from doubling unless Congress acts. He pressed that point on Thursday in the East Room of the White House.

PERSON: Anna Schwartz 

HEADLINE: Anna Schwartz, Economist Peer of Friedman, Dies at 96

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Anna J. Schwartz, a research economist who wrote monumental works on American financial history in collaboration with the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman while remaining largely in his shadow, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.
Her death was confirmed by her daughter Naomi Pasachoff.
Mrs. Schwartz, who earned her Ph.D. in economics at the age of 48 and dispensed policy appraisals well into her 90s, was often called the ''high priestess of monetarism,'' upholding a school of thought that maintains that the size and turnover of the money supply largely determines the pace of inflation and economic activity.
The Friedman-Schwartz collaboration ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,'' a book of nearly 900 pages published in 1963, is considered a classic. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, called it ''the leading and most persuasive explanation of the worst economic disaster in American history.''
The authors concluded that policy failures by the Fed, which largely controls the money supply, were one of the root causes of the Depression. 
Mr. Bernanke acknowledged as much when he spoke at a 90th birthday celebration for Mr. Friedman in 2002. ''I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right, we did it,'' he said. ''We're very sorry, but thanks to you we won't do it again.''
Mrs. Schwartz was widely known in the profession as the co-author of much of the work that led to Mr. Friedman's Nobel in economic science in 1976. Her supporters thought the prize might have justly been awarded jointly.
''Anna did all of the work, and I got most of the recognition,'' Mr. Friedman said on one occasion.
After Mr. Friedman's death in 2006, Mrs. Schwartz ''became the standard-bearer'' of Friedman monetarism, said Michael D. Bordo, a professor of economics at Rutgers University and for decades a Schwartz collaborator himself.
Though ''not a deep theorist,'' he said, Mrs. Schwartz was ''probably the best woman economist of the 20th century.''
During the financial collapse that began in 2008, she was one of the few economists with a firsthand recollection of the Depression. After praising early moves by Mr. Bernanke, she wrote, at age 93, a bitingly critical Op-Ed article for The New York Times in July 2009 opposing the reappointment of the Fed chairman who had been so influenced by her work.
She contended that Mr. Bernanke had erred in producing ''extreme ease'' in monetary policy and in failing to warn investors that new financial instruments were difficult to price.
Mrs. Schwartz also held that the government had been a bigger contributor to the crisis than had been widely realized. By her measure, the government had oversold the benefits of homeownership, pushing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage finance giants, to lend increasingly to lower-income borrowers and fostering exceptionally low mortgage rates.
A leading financial historian, Mrs. Schwartz was also an expert on the monetary and banking statistics of Britain and the United States. Besides her collaborations, she had a large body of work in her own name.
Her most visible public role was in 1981, when she agreed to be executive director of the 17-member United States Gold Commission, a Washington panel that was charged with recommending the future role of gold in the nation's monetary system.
With little interest in a return to any form of gold standard, she and most other members of the panel, consisting mostly of political appointees, limited their recommendations to urging the government to mint gold coins.
Mrs. Schwartz was born Anna Jacobson on Nov. 11, 1915, in the Bronx, the third of five children of Hillel Jacobson and the former Pauline Shainmark, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
She was drawn to economics while still at Walton High School in the Bronx -- ''I found it more exciting than literature or foreign languages,'' she said -- and graduated from Barnard College at 18.
She worked for the Agriculture Department in 1936, the year she married Isaac Schwartz, whom she had met at a Hebrew summer camp. The couple raised four children. Mr. Schwartz, who was the financial officer for a Manhattan import company and had earned a master's degree in classics from Columbia, died in 1999.
Besides Ms. Pasachoff, Mrs. Schwartz is survived by another daughter, Paula Berggren; her sons, Jonathan and Joel; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
After five years at Columbia University's Social Science Research Council, Mrs. Schwartz joined the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York in 1941 and continued to work there for more than 70 years. But she maintained her ties to Columbia, earning a Ph.D. there in her middle years.
It was at the National Bureau, a private, nonpartisan research organization that has been the nation's semiofficial arbiter of business cycles, that Mrs. Schwartz met Mr. Friedman and his wife, Rose Director Friedman, who was also an economist. Rose Friedman had heard from mutual friends that the Schwartzes might have a baby carriage to lend.
Arthur F. Burns, the president of the National Bureau and a future chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that Mrs. Schwartz and Mr. Friedman work together.
The two of them -- she in New York and he at the University of Chicago -- formed a close relationship based on exchanges of drafts and ideas by mail. ''I'll write something and send it to him, and he'll criticize it, and he'll do the reverse,'' she told a reporter for The Times in 1970 on the publication of their second major work, ''Monetary Statistics of the United States: Estimates, Sources, Methods.'' ''The wonderful thing about this relationship is that neither of us takes offense if the other says it's no good.''
Mrs. Schwartz did take offense, however, when Paul Krugman, an economist and an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, attacked the Friedman legacy in an article in The New York Review of Books in 2007.
She responded angrily that Mr. Krugman had mischaracterized the work and made ''inaccurate forays into economic history'' by attributing the Depression to a liquidity trap, a situation in which monetary policy fails to stimulate the economy by either lowering interest rates or expanding the money supply.
''She went ballistic,'' Mr. Bordo said.
Even after breaking a hip in 2009 and having a stroke, Mrs. Schwartz, by then using a wheelchair, collaborated with Mr. Bordo and Owen Humpage, an economist at the Cleveland Fed, on a project tracing the history of governmental intervention in currency markets. ''Anna never stopped,'' Mr. Bordo said.
She often spoke about her successful collaboration with Mr. Friedman on their ''Monetary History of the United States,'' expressing elation that they had taken on an economic establishment with little regard for theories based on the importance of money.
Decades afterward, writing in The Cato Journal, a publication of the Cato Institute, the conservative public policy research organization, she quoted Wordsworth:
''Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,/But to be young was very heaven!''

HEADLINE: Romney Exhibits A Change In Tone On Immigration

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and TRIP GABRIEL; Ashley Parker reported from Lake Buena Vista, and Trip Gabriel from New York.

 BODY:
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney struck a more conciliatory tone toward illegal immigrants on Thursday than he took during the Republican primary season, but he backed only limited steps to address the concerns of many Hispanic voters as he confronted one of the trickiest issues in his efforts to build a broad general election coalition.
Speaking to a group of Hispanic officials in the heart of a swing state, Mr. Romney made his most extensive remarks on immigration since President Obama announced last week that he would use executive authority to allow many young people who are in the country illegally to avoid deportation. Mr. Romney reiterated his support for giving legal status to illegal immigrants who serve in the military, and said he would ''staple a green card'' to the diplomas of immigrants who receive advanced degrees. 
He did not repeat the language he used during the primary season about encouraging illegal immigrants to ''self-deport,'' and he did not address Arizona's controversial law, now before the Supreme Court, that requires law enforcement officers there to demand proof of immigration status when they suspect someone might be in the United States illegally. But he remained vague about whether he would leave in place the temporary measures taken by Mr. Obama to allow young people to remain in the United States.
''We can find common ground here, and we've got to,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We owe it to ourselves as Americans to ensure that our country remains a land of opportunity -- both for those who were born here and for those who share our values, respect our laws, and want to come to our shores.''
Mr. Romney's nearly 20-minute speech here was met with tepid applause and moments of pointed silence. He seemed to hit his stride near the middle of his remarks, when he talked about balancing the budget, giving parents a choice of where to send their children to school, and providing a path to legal status for immigrants who have served in the military. At the end, about half the room stood up to applaud.
On Friday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to address the same group -- the annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials -- making the gathering a high-profile campaign forum that further highlights the philosophical divide over the issue and the political stakes. Mr. Obama's campaign dismissed Mr. Romney's remarks, saying he had shown his true colors during the primaries.
Mr. Romney angered many Latinos during his battle to win the Republican nomination against challenges from his right. In particular, Mr. Romney said then that as president he would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought into the country at a young age and went on to attend college. But his remarks Thursday reflected a softening in pitch on Hispanic and immigration issues, as Mr. Romney tries to woo Hispanic voters, who are crucial in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia.
Mr. Romney's challenge is to appeal to those voters, whose growing numbers in important swing states could make the difference in November, while not seeming to shift from the immigration positions he took during the early nominating contests in a way that could open him to charges of flip-flopping and alienate his conservative base. The topic is a sensitive one for the Romney campaign, which cut short a conference call with the press on Wednesday when reporters began asking questions about the issue.
Advisers to the Romney campaign say that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic, and that they believe they can win over at least some of it by focusing on the economy -- Mr. Romney's professed reason for running -- rather than appealing to them solely on immigration issues.
''I am asking you to join me because, while we may not agree on everything, we share the same goal, the same vision, and the same belief in American greatness that draws so many people to our shores,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Liberty's torch can burn just as brightly for future generations of immigrants as it has burned for immigrants of the past.''
He added later: ''Immigration reform is not just a moral imperative. It's also an economic necessity.''
Aside from tone, Mr. Romney's policy positions were as notable for what he did not say as for what he did. He did not go as far as he seemed to last week when he expressed support for a proposal by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that would have addressed the status of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Instead, Mr. Romney repeated a position he took earlier this year that he would embrace ''a path to legal status'' for undocumented young people who serve in the military. (Mr. Rubio would grant a visa to those pursuing higher education.)
Mr. Romney's most concrete proposal -- and one he had not made before -- was to expand the number of permanent resident visas, or green cards, to spouses and children of green-card holders living abroad. Currently, there is a cap, with a backlog of two and a half years to receive a visa, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. Conservative groups oppose lifting the quotas, which they call ''chain migration.''
Mr. Romney also called for updating the system of temporary worker visas ''so that it meets our economic needs.'' Temporary visas are given to workers in fields as diverse as agriculture, crab picking and computer programming, with almost all industries complaining of excessive bureaucracy and low quotas. Updating the system has been held hostage by both parties in Congress in failed efforts to achieve immigration reform.
Reactions to Mr. Romney's proposals from groups that favor reform were largely that he had offered only small-bore ideas.
''American voters want -- and the Republican Party needs -- visionary plans to fix the immigration system, not tweaks around the margin where the only path to legal status for grandmothers is to enlist in the military,'' said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum Action Fund.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Farm Bill With Bipartisan Support

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a sweeping new farm bill on Thursday that would cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years, financing dozens of price support and crop insurance programs for farmers and food assistance for low-income families.
The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 64 to 35. It now goes to the House, where it faces a much tougher road because conservative lawmakers want to make deeper cuts in the food stamp program, which serves about 45 million Americans. ''This bill represents significant reform,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ''It cuts subsidies, it cuts the deficit and it creates jobs.'' 
Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas and the ranking member on the committee, called the legislation the best bill possible. ''It shows what can happen if we break the logjam of partisanship and work together to get something done,'' Mr. Roberts said.
Although the bill is known as the farm bill, the majority of the spending, about $80 billion a year, goes to the food stamp program. The Senate bill would cut a total of $23.6 billion from current spending levels, including about $4.5 billion from food stamps, but senators rejected several proposals that would have made even deeper cuts.
Ms. Stabenow said savings from the food stamp program would come mainly from changes including banning lottery winners from getting assistance.
The House Republican budget introduced earlier this year by Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would reduce food stamp spending by about $134 billion over the next decade and turn the program into block grants for the states.
In the House, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, said work on the bill would begin on July 11. He said committee members would work on a spending bill next week. Congress will recess for the July 4 holiday week.
''Although there will be differences between the Senate approach and our own, I hope my colleagues are encouraged by this success when we meet on the 11th to consider our own legislation,'' Mr. Lucas said.
Although the Senate bill makes significant changes to some farm programs and eliminates or consolidates others, it leaves in place several Depression-era programs like supports for American sugar growers that set prices and limit imports.
The bill eliminates about $5 billion a year in direct payments that have been given to farmers and farmland owners, whether or not they grew crops. It makes the highly subsidized crop insurance program the primary safety net when crop prices drop. Currently, the government subsidizes about 62 percent of the crop insurance premiums, and the policies typically guarantee 75 percent to 85 percent of a farmer's revenue. The crop insurance subsidy would cost about $9 billion a year.
But for the first time crop insurance would be subject to payment limits, and recipients of the subsidy would have to follow soil and water conservation requirements, as they do in other farm programs. The bill reduces the premium subsidy for farmers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000. The measure would affect only 1,500 out of the 1.5 million farmers and save $1 billion over 10 years.
Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research organization, said the bill failed to achieve real savings because it expanded crop insurance. Still, he said, ''We applaud the provisions that require farmers who receive crop insurance subsidies to carry out basic environmental protections on their farms and to reduce insurance subsidies for the largest and most successful agribusinesses.''
While most agriculture groups support the Senate bill, many Southern farmers, especially rice and peanut farmers, say it provides an inadequate safety net because it eliminates direct payments.
''Crop insurance does not provide adequate coverage for peanut farmers when there are fluctuations in the market,'' said Armond Morris, chairman of the Georgia Peanut Commission in Tifton, Ga.
Food and nutrition groups said they were disappointed by the food stamp cuts. While they said the bill provided incentives for low-income families to buy more fruits and vegetables, they argue that the cuts will have a devastating effect on low-income families during a time of high unemployment.
Feeding America, an antihunger group based in Chicago, said the cuts would reduce benefits by about $90 per family and affect 500,000 households in 15 states.
''Now is the time to protect and strengthen food nutrition assistance, not cut it,'' said Eric Olsen, the group's senior vice president of government relations and public policy.

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Resigns, Citing Medical Reasons

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
8:54 p.m. Updated WASHINGTON - John E. Bryson announced his resignation as President Obama's commerce secretary on Thursday, citing medical reasons after an episode in which he had a seizure and was involved in a sequence of car crashes.
Mr. Bryson, a longtime California electricity conglomerate executive, served in the cabinet for just eight months and had kept a low profile in Washington during his short tenure. But that changed when he was found unconscious behind the wheel of his car in California earlier this month after reportedly hitting two other vehicles. 
Although tests for Mr. Bryson are continuing, a Commerce Department official said a neurologist has diagnosed a complex partial seizure, which can affect brain function and leave a person in a state of confusion. He had never had a seizure before and did not have any known health ailments, the official said, and he had limited recollection of the episode.
After initially taking a medical leave, Mr. Bryson decided on Wednesday to step down from his job and talked with Mr. Obama by telephone that night. He then sent the president a letter making his decision formal, and announced it on Thursday morning to department employees.
''The work that you do to help America's entrepreneurs and businesses build our economy and create jobs is more important now than ever and I have come to the conclusion that I need to step down to prevent distractions from this critical mission,'' Mr. Bryson wrote to his staff.
Mr. Obama released a statement in which he thanked Mr. Bryson and invited him to the Oval Office to pose for pictures, but neither man made any comments or took questions. ''As secretary, John fought tirelessly for our nation's businesses and workers, helping to bolster our exports and promote American manufacturing and products at home and abroad,'' Mr. Obama said in the written statement.
Rebecca M. Blank, the deputy commerce secretary who has been serving as acting secretary since Mr. Bryson took a leave, will continue to run the department, with its $7.5 billion budget and 47,000 employees worldwide. Given the short time left before Congress leaves town for the fall election campaign, it may be difficult for the president to recruit, vet, nominate and confirm a permanent replacement.
The White House heaped praise on Ms. Blank, and Mr. Obama could leave her in place until after the election, when he will know whether he has a second term. Given the political attention on the economy, however, he may feel pressed to name a nominee before then.
Mr. Bryson, 68, the former chief executive of Edison International in Southern California and a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, was nominated in May 2011 and, after a brief struggle in the Senate, was confirmed last October.
While in office, he summarized his priority with the phrase ''build it here and sell it everywhere,'' focusing on supporting manufacturing, increasing exports and encouraging more companies to locate or expand operations in the United States. He eschewed the Washington scene, spending much of his time visiting businesses across the country.
Democrats praised him on Thursday and Republicans, in deference to his health, generally remained quiet.
''I have great respect for John and his desire to resign in an effort to make sure there are no distractions toward job growth and advancing America's businesses and entrepreneurs for a full economic recovery,'' Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the commerce committee, said in a statement.
Mr. Bryson, who has a home in San Marino, Calif., was there to deliver a commencement address at the private school his four daughters had attended when he experienced the seizure. Driving a Lexus in suburban San Gabriel on June 9, Mr. Bryson rolled into the back of a Buick waiting at a train crossing, according to authorities. After talking briefly with the other driver, he got back into his car and hit the Buick again as he was driving off, the police said. Minutes later, he crashed into the rear of another car about two miles away.
Mr. Bryson was cited for a hit-and-run accident. Authorities reported no indications of illegal drugs or alcohol, although they were waiting for final tests. No one was seriously hurt, and damage to the cars was minor.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rio+20: The View from Manhattan

BYLINE: KELLY SLIVKA AND KATE YANDELL


HIGHLIGHT: Passersby share their thoughts on the environmental conference in Rio and whether such meetings can lead to meaningful policy changes. 

 BODY:
This week we hit the streets of Manhattan to talk to the public about Rio+20, the three-day environmental conference that opened on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro. We wanted to gauge public awareness of the event and solicit views on whether developing nations should pursue economic growth in an environmentally sustainable way. 
More broadly, we wondered whether people believed that international conferences like Rio+20 can bring about change.
We hailed down passersby at the corner of Third Avenue and 43rd Street, a few blocks from United Nations headquarters. It was hardly a statistical sampling of American public opinion, but people from various cities across the country as well as Australia, Colombia, Honduras, France and Ukraine did stop to share their thoughts.
Some people knew about the conference,and some not at all. The biggest surprise was that we encountered very little cynicism. Whether they were aware of Rio+20 or not, most who agreed to chat with us had something to say about environmentally responsible development and whether global conferences can make a difference.

HEADLINE: How to Escape a Lowly Socioeconomic Class: Go to College

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: How much economic mobility do Americans really have? Are they stuck in the income class they were born to? The answers to these questions depend largely on whether they went to college. 

 BODY:
The latest installment in our Is College Worth It? series comes courtesy of the Treasury Department, which on Thursday released a report titled "The Economic Case for Higher Education."
The report included this nifty chart:
It shows how likely you are to end up in any given income quintile, based on the income quintile your parents were in. In other words, how much mobility do Americans really have? Are they stuck in the income class they were born to?
The answer depends largely on whether you went to college.
As the report notes:
Without a degree, children born to parents in the bottom income quintile have a 45 percent chance of remaining there as adults. With a degree, they have less than a 20 percent chance of staying in the bottom quintile of the income distribution.
Higher education appears important for those born into relative wealth, too.
Look at the fifth (and highest) parents' income quintile. The children of this group who didn't go to college are just barely more likely to stay at the top than they are to end up in each of the other income groups. That's basically what you would expect if your economic fate were not influenced at all by your parents': that you'd have an equally likely chance of ending up anywhere in the income distribution when you grow up.
But of the children who were born to upper-income parents and who have college degrees, more than half held onto the top income status they inherited. You can argue about why that's the case -- surely networking at college matters as much as signaling, skills or anything else -- but clearly, there is a strong correlation here, too.

HEADLINE: The Euro Is Flat

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Greece isn't that poor. 

 BODY:
Still limited blogging. But I thought I'd post about something that sort of surprised me.
As we contemplate the euro mess, there's a strong tendency to think of it as having a lot to do with the fundamental inequalities in overall productivity and economic development between euro members -- backward, semi-developed countries like Greece or Portugal (not my view, but what you often hear) awkwardly tied to powerhouses like Germany.
So it comes as something of a shock to look at Eurostat data (pdf) on real GDP per capita (or productivity, which look similar). Sure, Greece and Portugal are relatively poor, with GDP per capita of 82 and 77 percent, respectively, of the EU average; this means roughly 76 and 71 percent of the eurozone average, since the euro countries are a bit richer than the EU as a whole. Meanwhile, Germany is at 120 percent of the EU, or 112 percent of the EZ.
But it's no different, really, than the US situation (look under per capita GDP). Alabama is at 74 percent of the US average, Mississippi at 67, with New England and the Middle Atlantic states at 118 and 116.
In other words, as far as underlying economic inequalities are concerned, the EZ is no worse than the US.
The difference, mainly, is that we think of ourselves as a nation, and blithely accept fiscal measures that routinely transfer large sums to the poorer states without even thinking of it as a regional issue -- in fact, the states that are effectively on the dole tend to vote Republican and imagine themselves deeply self-reliant.
The thing is, we didn't always think of ourselves as a nation, either. Before the Civil War, people talked about "these United States"; it was only after the war that "these" became "the".
So the key to the success of the dollar zone may be summed up in three words: William Tecumseh Sherman.

HEADLINE: How Is the Monthly Jobs Report Actually Calculated?

BYLINE: DAN KEDMEY


HIGHLIGHT: Census Bureau field representatives knock on thousands of doors each month - and sometimes even fly to remote villages - to encourage people to participate in the government's monthly survey on job growth. But like many studies, it's not as precise as people think. 

 BODY:
In this week's magazine, Adam Davidson writes about the jobs report, the government's monthly estimate of the employment situation in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the report on the first Friday of every month, at exactly 8:30 in the morning. In an instant, reporters and analysts decide whether it spells doom or salvation for the economy. But how are the numbers calculated in the first place?
To get the unemployment rate, the United States Census Bureau starts with a computer program which selects a representative sample of 60,000 households. The Census Bureau then sends letters to the selected addresses, informing the people who live there that they have been chosen to participate in the survey. A few weeks later, a Census Bureau staff member shows up at the door of all would-be participants. If no one is home, he or she returns again and again, for as many times as it takes to meet someone in person. (Census Bureau field representatives can be surprisingly persistent; they have been known to fly planes to remote villages in Alaska just to make face-to-face contact.) 
Next come the phone calls. Field representatives and interviewers in three separate call centers across the country contact the household participants with a set list of questions along the lines of: 
It takes a total of 2,000 field representatives to collect the household data. The Census Bureau sends that to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which then has about a week to crunch the numbers. A parallel survey conducted by the B.L.S. of 500,000 businesses provides the number of jobs that were created or lost during the previous month. The final result is the government's best estimate of the nation's employment situation - "truly a marvel of modern statistical science," Davidson writes. But as with any estimate, it's not as precise as people think. Read the full column to find out why these numbers should be considered with caution.

HEADLINE: A Hybrid Approach to Solar Power

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A company comes up with a solar installation that produces hot water as well as electricity for apartment buildings, wineries and now a dairy. 

 BODY:
When photovoltaic cells make electricity from sunlight, they collect a lot of heat along the way. And they don't work as well warm as they do cold.
 Four years ago that was intended both to make electricity and gather usable heat on residential rooftops. That company, now calledEcho Solar, is offering its product around the country.
 But the market for such hybrids goes beyond homes, especially if the second product is hot water, which can make steam and then electricity. Now another company, Cogenra, is supplying a hybrid solar electricity and hot-water system for big apartment buildings, dormitories, retirement homes, wineries, food processing plants and, most recently, a dairy, all of which use large amounts of hot water. It has 40 installations worldwide.
The basic problem, according to Gilad Almogy, the chief executive of Cogenra, is that a photovoltaic cell captures only about 15 percent of the sun's energy. Another 5 percent or so reflects back off the solar cell. "Where's the rest? It's heat,'' he said. On a 100-degree day in a sunny location, the cell, which is black, can reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit, he explained. 
 So his company mounts the cells on water pipes in the center of trough-shaped mirrors. The mirrors concentrate the sun's energy by a factor of 10. The result is electricity and water that is warmed to as much as 158 degrees. The temperature can be varied, according to the application; water for sterilizing a food processing tank is hotter than water for a shower.

The trough design is not new; it is similar to the one , which boil water into steam to spin a turbine, turn a generator and make electricity. But in Cogenra's installations, the water does not reach the boiling point. If it did, the solar cells would not work very well.
As measured by heat content, the bulk of the production is hot water, but the electricity sells at a higher price. The economics vary by location; in most parts of the United States, the value of the hot water is set by the value of the natural gas that did not have to be burned because the solar system did the work instead. 
Since natural gas is currently very cheap, the small electricity production may be more valuable. But in Hawaii or India, where fuel to heat the water has to be shipped in, the value of the hot water would be higher, Mr. Almogy said. 
If a quantity of electricity is worth four times as much as the equivalent amount of natural gas, then the hot water and the electricity produced by his system have about equal value, he said. At the moment, though, the electricity is worth far more than four times as much, because the price of natural gas is depressed by a surplus brought on by fracking. 
The economics of his system works well in California because that state offers a rebate for the installation of renewable systems for heating hot water, he said. The rebate is equal to $12.82 per therm of gas saved in the first year, which is well above what a therm actually costs most consumers at the moment.
While Cogenra's system starts with the same concept as Echo Solar's, they are not quite competitors. They are both backed by the same alternative energy investor, Vinod Khosla.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: To Settle Lawsuit, Facebook Changes Policy for Its Like Button

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook has agreed to make it clear to users that when they click to like a product on Facebook, their names and photos can be used to plug the product, reports Somini Sengupta in Friday's New York Times. They will also be given a chance to decline the opportunity to be unpaid endorsers. 

 BODY:
Facebook has agreed to make it clear to users that when they click to like a product on Facebook, their names and photos can be used to plug the product, reports Somini Sengupta in Friday's New York Times. They will also be given a chance to decline the opportunity to be unpaid endorsers.
The changes are part of a settlement for a class-action lawsuit against Facebook in Federal District Court in California. The agreement compels the company to change one of its most effective advertising tools, known as Sponsored Stories, and complicates the company's efforts to accelerate advertising revenue.
Facebook users will be able to control and see which of their actions on Facebook are used to generate advertisements seen by their Facebook friends. For Facebook users under 18, there is an additional requirement: The company must give parents the opportunity to keep their children out of advertisements.
The settlement does not inhibit the company from using Sponsored Stories, which Facebook executives have repeatedly described as the most effective form of advertising in part because they do not seem like traditional advertisements. Both on the Web and on a mobile device, a Sponsored Story features the name and picture of a Facebook friend who has clicked on the like button for a product or organization.
The changes are to be made within the next six months. How many Facebook users will decline to participate in the ads remains to be seen. An economist hired by the plaintiffs' lawyers, Fernando Torres, testified that giving users such a choice could cost Facebook $103 million in advertising revenue.

HEADLINE: Dueling Economic Messages From Romney and Republican Governors

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is on a collision course - not just with President Obama, but also with Republican governors in several key swing states with improving economies. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is on a collision course - not just with President Obama, but also with Republican governors in several important swing states.
Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, repeatedly highlights the grim economic situation in places like Virginia, Ohio and Iowa. He said Thursday in Orlando, Fla., that "home values have plunged, our national debt is at record levels and families are buried under higher prices for food and gasoline."
But the political imperative is very different for the governors in those states, whose improving economies are a source of pride and offer valuable talking points to help build lasting legacies.
For those governors, trumpeting the lower unemployment rates, better job growth and higher wages is a path toward higher approval ratings in an environment where voters are primed to be grumpy and skeptical of incumbents.
That can make for some awkward moments when the dour Mr. Romney comes to town.
On Thursday, aides to Mr. Romney and Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, pushed back against a Bloomberg News reportthat the presidential candidate's advisers wanted Mr. Scott's team to play down rosy descriptions of the Florida economy.
"Many governors have brought new ideas and fresh approaches to their states, and Governor Romney frequently praises them for their ability to overcome the job-stifling policies of the Obama administration," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. "Any statement to the contrary is not in line with Governor Romney's thoughts or his message."
A spokesman for Mr. Scott also denied the Bloomberg report, saying: "Nobody has asked us. Nobody has talked to the governor."
But the denials are not likely to erase the difficult optics for Mr. Romney and his Republican governors as the campaign unfolds during the next five months.
The line he has to walk? Praise the local and state economic improvements when he sees them, but make it clear they have happened in spite of - and definitely not because of - Mr. Obama's leadership.
And the Democrats are not going to make it easy. Mr. Obama's campaign released a mock letter on Thursday in which Mr. Romney writes Mr. Scott: "Your facts are undermining my contention that Barack Obama is stifling the recovery, which is my whole platform." 
Here are three states to watch for that dynamic.
VIRGINIA The Web site for Gov. Robert F. McDonnell's political action committee opens with a headline that says, "5.6% Lowest Unemployment in 3 years." A second headline quickly appears: "Yes, Virginia. There is a surplus!" 
Mr. McDonnell, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has become the No. 1 cheerleader for his state. And for good reason: fueled in part by federal contracting, it has one of the best economies in the country.
"Unemployment down. Job creation, exports, corporate expansions and quality of life up," Mr. McDonnell says on the Web site. "That's the result of a bipartisan commitment to getting results for Virginia."
Virginia's economic success complicates what could be Mr. Romney's most important state. Political advisers on both sides say Virginia is a bellwether, and essential for both candidates to win.
One strategy that Mr. Romney uses: talk about the national economy, not the local one.
Speaking in Chantilly, Va., last month, Mr. Romney chastised Mr. Obama for having failed to create jobs - not mentioning the fact that Virginia's unemployment rate is significantly lower than the nation's.
"Incomes have not gone up, in part because jobs have not gone up," Mr. Romney said. "In fact, the median income in America has dropped 10 percent in the last four years. It's down $3,000 during President Obama's term. Americans are hurting, and they want a very different course to be taken."
OHIO When John R. Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" a couple of months ago, he eagerly promoted his state's improving economy.
"When I took office, we were 48th in the country in job creation," Mr. Kasich, who was elected in 2010, said on the program. "And in February, working with my partners in the Legislature, we were the No. 1 job creator in America, and we're No. 4 today."
The unemployment rate in Ohio is 7.5 percent, which is not as good as Virginia's rate but well below where it was a few years ago. That improvement - helped along by the nearby, booming auto industry - is not exactly in line with Mr. Romney's national spin.
At a speech in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Romney urged residents to "look around Ohio" to see the impact of Mr. Obama's policies.
"Don't forget, he's been president for three and a half years. And talk is cheap. Actions speak very loud," Mr. Romney said.
IOWA The Hawkeye State may be the best example of the challenge for Mr. Romney as he works to rob Mr. Obama of a state the Democrat won in 2008.
Iowa's 5.2 percent unemployment rate is among the best in the nation, driven by a farm economy that has exploded in the last few years. It is also the state where Mr. Obama's presidential hopes took off four years ago.
Terry E. Branstad, the state's Republican governor, is proud. His state Web sitetrumpets "200,000+ new jobs; a 15% reduction in the cost of government; a 25% increase in family incomes; and the best schools in the nation."
During Mr. Romney's last visit to Iowa, he went out of his way to praise Mr. Branstad for "tough choices to hold down spending" even as he blasted Mr. Obama for slowing the economic recovery.
"Last time, his slogan was hope and change; now he's hoping to change the subject," Mr. Romney said at a rally in Davenport as part of a six-state bus tour.
And that, in a nutshell, is the fine line Mr. Romney must draw the next five months - finding ways to praise the governors of the economically improving states, while still finding ways to attack Mr. Obama for his handling of the nation's fiscal fortunes.
The challenge has already begun.

Moody's Cuts Credit Ratings of 15 Big Banks | Already grappling with weak profits and global economic turmoil, 15 major banks were hit with credit downgrades on Thursday that could do more damage to their bottom lines and further unsettle equity markets.
The credit agency, Moody's Investors Service, which warned banks in February that a downgrade was possible, cut the credit scores of banks to new lows to reflect new risks that the industry has encountered since the financial crisis.
"The risks of this industry became apparent in the financial crisis," said Robert Young, a managing director at Moody's. "These new ratings capture those risks."
Citigroup and Bank of America, which have struggled to fully recover from the financial crisis, were among the hardest hit. After the downgrades, the banks stand barely above the minimum for an investment grade rating, a level also known as junk and a sign of the difficult business conditions they face.

Regulators are examining whether Nasdaq failed to properly test its trading systems, which broke down during the I.P.O., and whether the exchange violated rules when it rewrote computer code to jump-start trading.
The Facebook investigation comes after a broader inquiry into trading breakdowns and other problems at the nation's largest exchanges, including two previously undisclosed cases involving Nasdaq's archrival, the New York Stock Exchange, the people said.
The agency's enforcement unit, which has opened more than a dozen related cases, is examining whether exchanges lack adequate controls and favor select investors.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Obama Assails Republicans Over Immigration Policy

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: In what amounted to the general election campaign's first immigration debate, President Obama told a Latino audience that had heard from Mitt Romney that they should not trust Mr. Romney's shifting rhetoric. 

 BODY:
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - President Obama assailed Republicans on Friday as obstacles to fixing the nation's immigration system and said his opponent would block efforts to let young immigrants stay if they were brought into the United States illegally by their parents.
In what amounted to the general election campaign's first debate on immigration policy, Mr. Obama appeared before the same Latino audience that heard from his challenger, Mitt Romney, a day earlier and told them they should not trust Mr. Romney's shifting rhetoric.
Mr. Obama touted his own decision last week to stop kicking many young immigrants out of the country, saying he was "lifting the shadow of deportation" from those who deserved to stay in the United States. By contrast, he pointed to Mr. Romney's opposition to legislation known as the Dream Act intended to offer a path to legal status for many of the same young people. 
"It's long past time we gave them a sense of hope," Mr. Obama said of those spared by his action. "Now, your speaker from yesterday has a different view. In his speech, he said when he makes a promise he'll keep it. Well, he's promised to veto the Dream Act and we should taken him at his word. I'm just saying. I believe that would be a tragic mistake."
Mr. Obama noted that Republican opposition blocked passage of the Dream Act in 2010 and lamented that Republicans who supported more expansive legislation just a few years ago have now abandoned the issue. "Those same Republicans have been driven away from the table by a small faction in their own party," he said.
Mr. Romney's camp focused on economic issues in their response on Friday. "No election year speech can cover up the president's job-killing policies that have led to 11 percent Hispanic unemployment and millions of Hispanics living in poverty," Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman, said in a statement. "On Day 1, Mitt Romney will take our country in a new direction and get our economy back on the right track."
Mr. Obama's speech to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials was framed to capitalize on last week's decision, bolstering support from a critical constituency that leans strongly in his direction but has been disappointed that he has not taken stronger action to liberalize immigration rules. Mr. Obama has deported more illegal immigrants than any other president, while in the face of Republican resistance he has done relatively little to push broader legislation providing a path to legal status for millions more in the country without permission.
"Congress still needs to come up with a comprehensive immigration solution, rather than argue that we did this the wrong way or for the wrong reasons," he said. "To those who say Congress should be the one to fix this, absolutely. To those who say we should do this in a bipartisan way, absolutely. My door's been open for 3 1/2 years. They know where to find me."
Mr. Obama received a warmer response from the audience than Mr. Romney did on Thursday, with those in attendance at times standing to give him ovations. But a conservative Hispanic leader said the president's words rang hollow to him given the lack of progress in forging a bipartisan solution.
"Where is the leadership?" asked Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. He said that President George W. Bush did a better job of working across the aisle on immigration and argued that Mr. Romney would be more likely to find a solution with a Republican Congress next year.
"We have a better chance of getting something constructive done in immigration with Romney than Obama," Mr. Aguilar said.
After his remarks, Mr. Obama left for Tampa, where he planned to make a campaign speech.

HEADLINE: Republican Budget Plan Comes Under Fire From Unlikely Source: G.O.P. Candidates

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans wishing to assert their political independence in tough races have picked up Democratic talking points against the House-passed budget plan written by Representative Paul D. Ryan. 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in Congress had hoped to lay out big plans for 2013, then run for election in November united around that vision. But the vision itself is coming under attack from an unlikely and possibly potent source: Republican candidates.
Republicans wishing to assert their political independence in tough races have picked up Democratic talking points against the House-passed budget plan written by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, especially the budget's plan for Medicare.
This week, the Montana Republican Party began broadcasting advertisements on behalf of Representative Denny Rehberg, who is running for the Senate, touting his independence: "Rehberg refused to support a Republican budget plan that could harm the Medicare programs so many of Montana's seniors rely on." 
The National Republican Senatorial Committee transferred $50,000 to the Montana state party in April and May, according to campaign finance documents.
Mr. Rehberg did indeed vote against the Republican budget in March, one of only 10 Republicans to do so. Another no vote belonged to Representative David McKinley, a freshman who justified his vote to his constituents in explicit terms. A glossy mailer explained to West Virginians that "the plan would privatize Medicare for future retirees, raise the retirement age and keep in place the Medicare cuts included in last year's health care bill. The Congressional Budget Office determined the plan would nearly double out-of-pocket healthcare costs for future retirees."
That amounts to a double-whammy for other Republicans who voted for the Ryan plan. It picks up Democratic language on privatization, a word Republican leaders reject, and it makes a point that Republicans and their supporters fail to note when they attack Democrats for Medicare spending cuts in the 2010 health care law. The same cuts they are blasting in some of their most potent attack ads are retained in the Ryan plan they voted on, but are used for deficit reduction, not health insurance subsidies.
Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, stays away from the word "privatization," instead calling his Medicare plan "premium support." Under it, federal spending on Medicare would be capped. Future retirees would be offered a menu of private insurance plans and traditional Medicare, and would be offered an annual subsidy to help pay for the insurance they choose.
Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, another Republican asserting his political independence as he runs for re-election, wrote an opinion piece for Politico.com to explain why that was unacceptable to him: "I fear that as health inflation rises, the cost of private plans will outgrow the government premium support - and the elderly will be forced to pay ever higher deductibles and co-pays," he wrote. "Protecting those who have been counting on the current system their entire adult lives should be the key principle of reform." 
Such attacks could complicate Mr. Ryan's vision of a united Republican Party running on his transformative vision for federal entitlements, claiming a mandate, then carrying out his plan with a Republican in the White House. It also raises questions about the future of the Ryan plan. 
Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, made it clear the party has another issue to run on: health care.
"Democrats should be more concerned with the unanimous opinion of House Republicans and a vast majority of Americans who believe Obamacare is raising health care costs and hurting the ability of small businesses to hire," he said.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a recent interview that much of the Republican budget plan could be done if the party takes control of the White House and the Senate through "reconciliation," a parliamentary process that would thwart a Democratic filibuster and give the party the chance to pass its plans with a simple Senate majority.
But that simple majority counts on victories this fall by Mr. Rehberg in Montana and Mr. Brown in Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls Romney 'an Outsourcing Pioneer'

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: The president was citing an article in The Washington Post reporting that Bain Capital invested in companies that specialized in the practice of relocating American jobs to low-wage nations. 

 BODY:
6:02 p.m. | Updated LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - President Obama and his team gleefully went after Mitt Romney on Friday for helping companies move jobs overseas, declaring that "we do not need an outsourcing pioneer in the Oval Office."
The president was citing an article in The Washington Post reporting that Mr. Romney's old firm, Bain Capital, invested in companies that specialized in the practice of relocating American jobs to low-wage nations like China and India.
The Obama campaign, long on the defensive because of the anemic economy, instantly jumped on the report to fuel its portrayal of Mr. Romney as a heartless capitalist more interested in making money than in creating jobs. The campaign sent out its first statement on the Post article late Thursday night soon after it was posted, and Democrats piled on throughout the day Friday.
The president's strategists saw the report as such a boon that they quickly inserted it into remarks for a previously scheduled campaign rally in Tampa, Fla., on Friday afternoon. 
"My plan will stop giving tax breaks to businesses that ship jobs and factories overseas," Mr. Obama said, "and start rewarding companies that create jobs and manufacturing right here in the United States of America."
"Now, Mr. Romney disagrees with this," the president continued. "Today, it was reported in The Washington Post that the companies his firm owned were 'pioneers' in the outsourcing of American jobs to places like China and India. Pioneers! Let me tell you, Tampa, we do not need an outsourcing pioneer in the Oval Office. We need a president who will fight for American jobs and fight for American manufacturing."
The Romney camp fired back with a broad critique of the president's handling of the economy.
"President Obama continues to use false and discredited attacks to divert attention from his abysmal economic record," Andrea Saul, a campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement.
Without addressing the outsourcing issue directly, Ms. Saul cited former President Bill Clinton's assessment of Mr. Romney's business experience as "sterling" and said her candidate "had a decades-long record of job creation, both in the private sector and as governor."
The Romney campaign also distributed a rebuttal to the Post story by a writer for the American Enterprise Institute. In some cases, according to the writer, James Pethokoukis, The Post was referring to companies that already had international employees when Bain bought them or expanded overseas call centers to service overseas customers.

HEADLINE: A Debate Goes Behind Closed Doors

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A proposal takes aim at sending derivatives trading overseas to escape the eyes of American regulators, but at the C.F.T.C. commissioners are said to be planning to cast their votes in private. 

 BODY:
In the long war over Wall Street regulation, a little-noticed clash erupted this week over a plan to rein in risky trading overseas.
Signs that a clash was brewing behind the scenes came after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission abruptly canceled a meeting to vote on the overseas trading proposal with just hours to spare. The agency provided no explanation, sending out only a short e-mail that it would "no longer hold a scheduled meeting on June 21, 2012."
Interviews with regulators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, show that the agency canceled the meeting after closed-door talks yielded a more flexible proposal that gives Wall Street additional time to comply. Now, rather than debating the issue in public, the commissioners plan to cast their votes in private over the next several days, according to people briefed on the matter.
While such wrangling is business as usual in Washington, and the changes debated this week are relatively modest, the trading commission's new overseas proposal has become a focal point in the debate over Wall Street regulation. The proposal, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, takes aim at firms that ship derivatives trading overseas to escape the eyes of American regulators. Roughly four years ago, foreign derivatives trading by American International Group in London nearly brought American firms to their knees.
Gary Gensler, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., has trumpeted such regulation for weeks, pointing to JPMorgan Chase's recent multibillion-dollar trading loss that took place at a London-based unit.
"Recent events at JPMorgan Chase are a stark reminder of how swaps traded overseas can quickly reverberate with losses coming back into the United States," Mr. Gensler said in a recent speech to bankers. "The risk can come crashing back here pretty quickly."
The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this front echo battles over rules passed in the run-up to the financial crisis, when Wall Street won major concessions from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, in 2004 loosened an obscure provision that allowed banks to ratchet up their risk-taking.
The events this week also highlight the challenge facing independent regulators with five-member commissions. The agencies are tasked with writing hundreds of new rules under Dodd-Frank to police Wall Street. At the trading commission, every time a rule comes to vote, Mr. Gensler must secure the blessing of at least two colleagues.
"At the end of the day, democracy is a messy process," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which supports tougher regulation of banks. "You get less-than-perfect outcomes from independent agencies."
The trading commission's roster features two Republicans, two Democrats and Mr. Gensler, a Democratic presidential appointee. Mr. Gensler's push to rein in Wall Street has met some opposition from the Republican commissioners, who argue that the agency occasionally oversteps its bounds. And while he has loyal support from Bart Chilton, one of the agency's Democratic commissioners, he has found the deciding third vote somewhat elusive.
"The five-member commission structure means that we have to find consensus, and I think our rules and the American public benefit from reaching a consensus," Mr. Gensler said on Friday. Others note that about 90 percent of the agency's votes received support from at least one Republican.
Mark Wetjen is the third Democratic vote. A former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, he is the newest member of the agency. In his first several months, Mr. Wetjen has voted with Mr. Gensler on every proposal. But behind the scenes, people close to the agency say, he has emerged as a more independent voice.
In the case of the overseas proposal, Mr. Wetjen sought several significant changes last week. Mr. Gensler, who adopted some tweaks and rejected others, thought they had a deal.
But Mr. Wetjen raised concerns again a day before the scheduled vote. While he never threatened to vote against the rule, neither did he promise to vote for it.
Mr. Gensler briefly considered proceeding, even without assurances, to force Mr. Wetjen's hand. The chairman still had support from Mr. Chilton, who supported the earlier plan.
"I think there are times on some of these key issues, like the cross-border issue, that we need to be very strong even if a vote doesn't go our way," Mr. Chilton said on Friday. "Compromise is one thing; tossing out your beliefs is another."
The plan would apply new derivatives rules not only to banks in the United States, but also to American banks that have foreign units. The proposal would also apply to foreign banks that conduct significant derivatives trading in the United States.
Mr. Wetjen, concerned that some American banks would face a competitive disadvantage, pushed for more flexibility. He urged Mr. Gensler to give American banks more time to comply, suggesting that the rules not fully take effect until nine months after the proposal was completed, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Proponents of regulation argue that Wall Street has had plenty of time to comply.
"How long do taxpayers have to wait to be protected from the risky activities of these too-big-to-fail banks?" Mr. Kelleher asked.
Ultimately, Mr. Gensler proposed a compromise, putting the proposal back on track. A deal was struck that provided the foreign arms of American banks with a reprieve so that they need not comply with certain provisions for 12 months after the plan is first proposed.
Mr. Wetjen also persuaded Mr. Gensler to give banks based solely in the United States until Dec. 31, roughly a three-month reprieve, to comply with other provisions. In another compromise, the agency is now planning to allow branches of American banks based overseas to apply for so-called substituted compliance, in which the banks will face similar rules from foreign regulators rather than from the C.F.T.C. Some regulators say that the substituted plan would level the playing field and discourage regulatory arbitrage.
Mr. Wetjen declined to comment.
The changes were surprising to some outsiders. People traveling to the meeting learned it was canceled only after arriving in Washington.
Some supporters of the effort questioned the changes, given the recent losses at JPMorgan.
"It's unbelievable to me that this would be a problem in this day and age, especially because of the JPMorgan loss," said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland law school and a former regulator at the trading commission.

HEADLINE: Awaiting the Supreme Court's Health Care Ruling

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The lack of a clear legal consensus on the underlying issues of the health care act may pave the way for the Supreme Court to rule based on ideology, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Anticipation has reached a fever pitch this week as the nation awaits the Supreme Court's decision on the fate of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. 
The core question before the court is whether the Commerce Clause in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution grants the federal government the authority to mandate individual Americans to purchase specified, minimally adequate health insurance coverage from private health insurers. 
For an economist, whose profession is routinely mocked with the adage "two economists, three opinions," the spectacle has been heartwarming. 
Evidently American legal theory is in even greater disarray than is economic theory. In this instance, the best legal minds in the nation cannot agree on what the Commerce Clause means. So we look to nine justices to tell us what they think the clause might mean. With legal theory in such disarray, ideological predilection among the justices may triumph. 
I recently posted a commentary on the options before the Supreme Court. Expanding upon that post a bit, I would describe the options before the Court thusly:
1. The Affordable Care Act is upheld as constitutional in all of its provisions.
2. Only the individual mandate is struck down, and it is deemed severable from the rest of the act.
3. Title 1 (Insurance Reform) of the act is struck down, but the rest of the act is upheld.
4. Both Titles 1 and 2 (Public Programs, including the expansion of Medicaid) are struck down, but the rest of the act is upheld.
5. The entire Affordable Care Act is struck down, on the grounds that the clause covering the individual mandate, deemed by the justices to be not authorized by the Commerce Clause, is deemed not severable from the rest of the bill.
Before the oral arguments at the court in March, the first option was widely given a good chance, especially among lawyers. The justices' many hostile questions on the mandate during oral arguments gave many observers second thoughts.
If I had to bet, I would put my marker on the second option, the striking down of the individual mandate only. The majority of the justices may sincerely believe that the Commerce Clause does not authorize the mandate. In addition, some may not be averse to giving the president a little slap in the face. In any event, striking the mandate would not do much damage to the rest of the bill. 
That is because the penalties for disobeying the mandate now written into the statute are relatively low, which invites evasion by anyone whose premiums payable would exceed the penalty. Furthermore, it is easy to think of legislative fixes that could substitute for the mandate and, indeed, might even have more bite. 
The administration has argued that three important provisions in Title 1 of the act - community rating, guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability - depend on the individual mandate for sound actuarial functioning of the act.
To be "actuarially correct," so to speak, the court might therefore strike these three provisions of Title 1 as well, along with the individual mandate.
The administration's reasoning has encouraged a number of the act's opponents to submit to the court an amici curiae brief recommending that the entire Title 1 be struck down, along with the mandate. 
Title 1 covers all the provisions for the reforms of the individual and small group market for health insurance, including the minimum medical loss ratios to be attained by insurers and the subsidies toward insurance premiums for low-income individuals not qualifying for Medicaid.
The amici's argument is that without the individual mandate Congress would not have enacted the rest of Title 1. In other words, the amici ask the court to divine what Congress might or might not have done. It would require the justices to assume, inter alia, that Congress always acts rationally - a very tall assumption, indeed. I would be surprised if the justices were persuaded by the specious argument of these amici.
Striking Title 1 would be a blow not only to millions of uninsured Americans whose health insurance coverage was to be subsidized by the federal government. It would also be a blow to the providers of health care who would lose a sizable net new revenue flow and would continue to be besieged by the millions of uninsured, should they fall ill.
For the health insurance industry it would be a mixed blessing or blow. On the one hand, it would free the industry from a good number of new regulations. On the other, it would take away millions of potential new customers and, moreover, expose the industry to the highly negative publicity over medical underwriting and premiums based on the individual's health status. 
The justices' questioning during oral arguments suggests to me that they are not likely to strike down Title 2 of the act - Public Programs, including Medicaid expansion - should they strike down Title 1. The justices did not seem convinced that a deal offered the states by the federal government could be so generous as to be coercive and, thus, unconstitutional.
Finally, the justices could defend repeal of the entire Affordable Care Act by the absence of a severability clause in the act, although it strikes me as even less likely than striking just Titles 1 and 2. That would not be a slap in the president's face, but a hefty whack with a two-by-four. Would the chief justice want this as part of his legacy?
Furthermore, the rest of the bill contains numerous provisions for enhancing the quality of American health care and providing greater transparency on both quality and prices. In less partisan times, both parties have favored most of these measures.
So, of course, have they favored the individual mandate in years past. It is fascinating, for example, to behold the list of co-sponsors of Senate bill S.1770 introduced in 1993 by the late Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. That bill included the individual mandate. Among the co-sponsors was Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, now a vocal opponent of the mandate. 
It would be instructive for the historical record to learn what epiphany caused this distinguished legislator, long a member and a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to make a 180-degree turn on the mandate.

HEADLINE: Gazprom and EDF Agree to Invest in Gas-Fired Plants

BYLINE: By ANDREW KRAMER and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG -- Gazprom, the Russian natural gas company, reached a deal Friday with EDF of France to jointly invest in gas-fired power plants in Europe, gaining an important toehold for its exports at a time when competition from shale gas and liquefied natural gas is disrupting its main business.
Under the agreement, the power plants would use natural gas supplied exclusively by Gazprom. The company is under intense pressure to develop a new business model as prices for gas and competing energy sources decline. 
Gas for sale on the European spot market costs less than the oil-linked prices under the Russian company's long-term contracts. At the same time, global economic stagnation and a boom in shale gas in the United States are driving down the price of coal, a competitor to gas.
Aleksei B. Miller, chief executive of Gazprom, called the agreement with EDF a ''strategically important sphere'' for the Russian company, which would help secure smooth relations with Europe on pipeline politics and energy trade.
''This is very important in the larger strategic perspective,'' said Thane Gustafson, an energy analyst with IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''It's something the Russians have been working to do for the last 20 years.''
The announcement Friday did not specify any purchases of electricity plants. It offered only that the two companies would explore options for building or acquiring gas-fired facilities that would be owned on an equal basis, and that any plants would burn Gazprom's fuel.
The Russian company, more than half of which is owned by the state, had been in talks with RWE, a big German utility, to build and operate power stations in Germany, Britain and the Netherlands. But the discussions petered out last year with no tangible results.
Gazprom already provides the European Union with about a quarter of its natural gas. It wants to get into power generation because it ''seems to believe that there's a margin that they're just not getting by selling gas at the border,'' said Howard V. Rogers, director of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. That might not be the case, he said, as the electricity market opens up further and prices fall.
EDF, 85 percent of which is owned by the French state, is the world's largest operator of nuclear power plants, but it is seeking to keep its long-term energy options open. The EDF chief executive, Henri Proglio, who signed the deal with Mr. Miller at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, said the agreement fulfilled a goal of forming a tight partnership with an important energy supplier.
EDF is also a partner with Gazprom in a proposed pipeline in the Black Sea, called South Stream, that would provide an alternative for the pipeline system in Ukraine, a key conduit to Western Europe. Gazprom has yet to make a final decision on building the exceptionally expensive bypass. One concern for banks and partner companies is that demand in Europe for Russian gas may not justify the cost.
The statement Friday provided no indication of how large an investment Gazprom might make, or at what price it might provide gas to a partially owned subsidiary.
In Germany, Gazprom operates a distribution network with BASF, the German chemical giant. BASF is also a partner in the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic Sea, which has already been completed. German utilities are locked into long-term contracts with Gazprom that are used in part to pay for the cost of the pipeline's construction, a project supported by the former German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin.
Because Gazprom gas is now more expensive than competing sources, German utilities are losing money and passing on higher electricity costs to consumers.
Mr. Rogers said Gazprom had ''a huge disconnect in its strategy,'' because the price at which it currently supplies gas to Europe is more than double the price at which gas-fired plants would be competitive with current coal-fired plants.
To make money, he said, the company would need to set an internal transfer price for gas-fired plants at ''about half of what they're selling to third parties now.''
Further, once-expected growth is now uncertain because of the effects of the shale gas boom and the economic crisis. European countries have taken different approaches to shale gas so far, with some, like Poland, moving aggressively ahead, and others, like France, advancing more cautiously.
Maria van der Hoeven, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, who was also attending the forum, said Russian energy company executives were publicly dismissive of shale gas, underlining its environmental drawbacks. ''They don't like shale gas because it's a competitor,'' Ms. Van der Hoeven said.
David Jolly reported from Paris.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Oregon Study Shows Benefits, and Price Tag, for Newly Insured

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- When Wendy Parris shattered her ankle, the emergency room put it in an air cast and sent her on her way. Because she had no insurance, doctors did not operate to fix it. A mother of six, Ms. Parris hobbled around for four years, pained by the foot, becoming less mobile and gaining weight.
But in 2008, Oregon opened its Medicaid rolls to some working-age adults living in poverty, like Ms. Parris. Lacking the money to cover everyone, the state established a lottery, and Ms. Parris was one of the 89,824 residents who entered in the hope of winning insurance.
With that lottery, Oregon became a laboratory for studying the effects of extending health insurance to people who previously did not have it. Health economists say the state has become the single best place to study a question at the center of debate in Washington as the Supreme Court prepares to rule, likely next week, on the constitutionality of President Obama's health care law: What are the costs and benefits of coverage? 
In a continuing study, an all-star group of researchers following Ms. Parris and tens of thousands of other Oregonians has found that gaining insurance makes people feel healthier, happier and more financially stable. The insured also spend more on health care, dashing some hopes of preventive-medicine advocates who have argued that coverage can save money -- by keeping people out of emergency rooms, for instance. In Oregon, the newly insured spent an average of $778 a year, or 25 percent, more on health care than those who did not win insurance.
For the nation, the lesson appears to be mixed. Expanded coverage brings large benefits to many people, but it is also more likely to increase a stretched federal government's long-term budget responsibilities.
The newly insured were more likely to describe their health as good, and to say that their health was getting better, according to self-reported data that researchers are now combining with objective measurements for a deeper follow-up study. The uninsured reported being in worse physical and mental shape and were less likely to describe themselves as happy.
Getting insurance also had powerful financial effects, the study showed. The insured were 25 percent less likely to have an unpaid medical bill sent to a collection agency and 40 percent less likely to borrow money or skip paying other bills in order to cover their medical costs.
''I feel like a different person,'' said John Bell, a stay-at-home father who won the insurance lottery. ''I was pretty grumpy all the time before.''
Before winning the lottery, Mr. Bell filed for bankruptcy after emergency surgery to remove kidney stones left him with a $6,000 bill that he and his wife could not pay, he said. Today, Mr. Bell has a primary care physician who has encouraged him to lose weight and improve his diet to help control his diabetes.
The Oregon Health Study has won academic attention both because of the pedigree of the researchers -- including Joseph P. Newhouse, who designed the renowned RAND Health Insurance Experiment in the 1970s, and Amy Finkelstein, the most recent winner of the John Bates Clark Medal, an economic prize considered second only to the Nobel -- and the distinct nature of the state's health-insurance lottery. By assigning coverage randomly, Oregon gave researchers more confidence that they had teased out the true effects of insurance, and had not been fooled by other differences between the insured and the uninsured.
''The study put to rest two incorrect arguments that persisted because of an absence of evidence,'' said Katherine Baicker, a Harvard economist who worked on the study and served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush.
''The first is that Medicaid doesn't do anything for people, because it's bad insurance or because the uninsured have other ways of getting care,'' Ms. Baicker said. ''The second is that Medicaid coverage saves money'' by increasing preventive care, for instance.
''It's up to society to determine whether it's worth the cost,'' she added.
Discussions with 17 insured and uninsured participants in the Oregon Health Study illuminated how coverage changed and did not change their lives. Many described poverty and its attending problems, not health care, as their major challenge. (The Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care law, requires states, in 2014, to extend Medicaid eligibility to all adults within 133 percent of the poverty line, which is currently $11,170 for a household of one and $23,050 for a household of four.) A handful said that they were not overly bothered by their lack of coverage, or that winning Medicaid had not had much of an effect.
But many, including Ms. Parris and Mr. Bell, said that Medicaid had made a significant -- even transformative -- difference in their lives.
Ms. Parris got surgery for her foot, and additional care. She is also getting spinal surgery. Doctors have helped her address her depression, triggered by the death of one of her children. Her weight has come back down, and her mobility is far better. ''It saved my life,'' she said.
Most of the uninsured described their lack of coverage as a profound problem.
For instance, a year ago, Samantha Kious, a hair stylist, went to Planned Parenthood to seek birth control medication to manage her polycystic ovary syndrome, a common hormonal imbalance.
Ms. Kious, 24, who also has depression and Crohn's disease, a bowel condition, makes only $1,000 to $1,200 a month and cannot afford insurance. The clinic performed some tests and prescribed Ms. Kious the pills. But they also told her that she had Stage 2 cervical cancer. As of now, the condition remains untreated. She and her boyfriend even considered getting pregnant so that she would automatically qualify for Medicaid.
''It's scary for me, having cancer and knowing I can't do anything about it,'' said Ms. Kious, her hair in an elaborate plait. ''It's an I-don't-know-when-my-next-meal-will-be sort of thing. It's really difficult because health problems make you scared and emotional.''
Interviews with study participants showed that the insured and the uninsured got health care in significantly different ways. Lottery winners tended to have a primary care physician who saw them regularly and helped them navigate the health care system. In contrast, few of the uninsured saw doctors regularly, and none said that they had regular health examinations.
Some sought care from free clinics or charity hospital programs. But they said it was difficult to know when and where such programs were available and sometimes how to use them. You might have to bring certain paperwork to prove your poverty, for instance. Child care could be a problem. You might show up on the wrong day.
''You've got to be clearheaded'' to find free care, said Cynthia Robbins, 57, who is unemployed and won insurance. When she was uninsured she neglected the effects of her diabetes -- including problems with circulation in her feet that resulted in the amputation of a toe. ''When you're in the middle of a crisis, you're not going to be filling out forms.''
The uninsured described borrowing medication from family members and friends, taking it every other day, and asking doctors to diagnose multiple conditions and write multiple prescriptions on a single visit. The insured said they had largely abandoned such strategies.
Nearly all of the uninsured also described how avoiding doctors to save money resulted in trips to the emergency room. (Unnecessary or preventable emergency room use costs some $38 billion a year, researchers estimate.)
''I think the E.R. doctors now know me by name,'' said Ms. Kious, the hairdresser. ''But that's the only thing you can do. You wait until you can't bear it anymore.''
Study participants also described coverage as no magic bullet for a person living under or near the poverty line, but as something that tended to make life easier.
''It's a weight off your shoulders, when you feel like you can go to the doctor like everybody else,'' said Robin Baros, 51, who won insurance. ''And when you have insurance, you feel healthier. You want to take care of yourself. You've got your regular visits that you can go to.''
Not having insurance ''affects your whole life,'' said Christine Toman, 61, who has a chronic pulmonary condition and hepatitis C and did not win coverage. ''I went to work. I paid my bills. And now I feel like a hopeless, hopeless old woman that's in the way, and it's sad to feel like that. I'd like to die with some pride.''
Ms. Toman, in a husky voice and a soft wheeze as she labored to breathe, said that she occasionally goes to the emergency room when her conditions became acute. But she generally just forgoes care.

HEADLINE: Why Vincent Chin Matters

BYLINE: By FRANK H. WU. 
Frank H. Wu, chancellor and dean of the Hastings College of the Law, University of California, is the author of ''Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White.'' He is writing a book on the Vincent Chin case.

 BODY:
San Francisco
ON June 23, 1982, in Detroit, a young man named Vincent Chin died. Four nights earlier, he had been enjoying his bachelor party with friends at a local bar when they were accosted by two white men, who blamed them for the success of Japan's auto industry. ''It's because of you we're out of work,'' they were said to have shouted, adding a word that can't be printed here. The men bludgeoned Mr. Chin, 27, with a baseball bat until his head cracked open.
The men -- a Chrysler plant supervisor named Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz -- never denied the acts, but they insisted that the matter was simply a bar brawl that had ended badly for one of the parties. In an agreement with prosecutors, they pleaded to manslaughter (down from second-degree murder) and were sentenced to three years of probation and fined $3,000. 
I was a Chinese-American teenager growing up near Detroit then. I remember the haunting photograph of a smiling, fresh-faced Mr. Chin, shown repeatedly in newspapers and on TV, and the tears of his mother, Lily Chin, who lamented that his killers had escaped justice. Mr. Chin was buried on the day he was to have been married.
The killing catalyzed political activity among Asian-Americans -- whose numbers had steadily increased since the 1965 overhaul of immigration laws but who then represented only about 1.5 percent of the population -- as never before. ''Remember Vincent Chin'' turned into a rallying cry; for the first time, Asian-Americans of every background angrily protested in cities across the country. For all that Asians had been through -- racial exclusion, starting with a ban on Chinese migrant labor in 1882; the unconstitutional detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II; the legacy of America's wars in the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam -- no single episode involving an individual Asian-American had ever had such an effect before. And none has since.
The circumstances of the Chin case were no accident. The early 1980s were, like now, a time of malaise. The unemployment rate was at its highest since World War II; inflation was stuck in the double digits; ''Japan Inc.'' threatened to devour not only Detroit manufacturing but also New York real estate. White flight had emptied a great metropolis that once stood for industrial progress. Imported cars became a hated symbol of foreign encroachment.
Spurred by Asian-American activists, federal prosecutors brought civil rights charges against the two assailants in 1983. (The men denied using racial epithets, as some witnesses had reported.) The stepfather, Mr. Ebens, was convicted of violating Mr. Chin's civil rights and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.
The Chin case showed the power of the saying ''You all look the same.'' An assimilated son of Chinese immigrants somehow came to be identified with Japanese automakers. (That Asian-Americans made up much of the engineering force at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler seems not to have occurred to the attackers.)
''Asian-Americans'' -- a term that many Asian-Americans themselves do not use -- are, of course, more a demographic category than a community arising from shared language, religion, history or culture. Yet for all our diversity, we share an experience of otherness. The fifth-generation Japanese-American from California, the Hmong refugee in Wisconsin, the Indian engineer in Texas, the Korean adoptee in Chicago and the Pakistani taxi driver in New York -- all have at times been made to feel alien, sometimes immutably so.
Thirty years after Mr. Chin's death, hate crimes seem to be a remote threat for Asian-Americans. But it is premature, if tempting, to celebrate progress.
On Tuesday, a Pew Research Center study, ''The Rise of Asian-Americans,'' reported that Asians overtook Hispanics in 2009 as the country's fastest-growing ethnic group and now represent 5.8 percent of the population. It reported that Asian-Americans, on the whole, have higher incomes and better educations than whites, blacks or Latinos.
Though the study noted that discrimination, poverty and language barriers still confront refugees, undocumented immigrants and other vulnerable groups, Asian-American advocates for social justice winced. Despite decades of debunking by social scientists and historians, the model minority myth -- Asian-Americans as overachieving nerds -- persists. The study was based on a rigorous survey, though relying on self-reported attitudes and behaviors is not a fireproof methodology.
But the more important criticism is this: When it comes to race, nuance matters. The Pew findings encourage us to consider how positive attitudes may contribute to socioeconomic success. But history also teaches us that before Asian-Americans were seen as model minorities, we were also perpetual foreigners. Taken together, these perceptions can lead to resentment. And resentment can lead to hate.
Vincent Chin has lived longer in memory than reality. Today China, not Japan, is on the rise. Another recession has come to an uneasy close. Detroit limps along. Asian-Americans, through increasing civic participation, have asserted themselves as members of the body politic and reached some of the highest offices in government, academia and business.
Asian-Americans who have achieved success owe a debt to the agitators who followed the Chin case, often defying their own cultural backgrounds as well as the stereotype of passivity and quiescence. Everyone who cares about the promise of our increasingly diverse nation ought to see in this case the possibility of social change arising from tragic violence.

DETROIT -- General Motors said on Friday that it was recalling 475,000 of its popular Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in the United States and Canada to modify parts that could cause fires in the engine compartment. 
The safety recall was one of two announced by G.M. on the Cruze, the automaker's second-best-selling car in the United States and a symbol of the company's comeback from its government-backed bankruptcy in 2009. The second recall affects about 61,000 Cruzes that may have problems with welds in the rear of the vehicles.
G.M. said about 30 fires had been reported in 2011 and 2012 Cruzes because of oil spilling on a plastic engine shield on the underside of the vehicles.
The company said it knew of no crashes, injuries or deaths as a result of the fires.
In April, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a safety investigation after receiving two reports of Cruzes that had been destroyed by engine fires.
G.M. said the Cruze fires had primarily been caused by improper oil changes. When oil drips onto the plastic shields, the parts can ignite and spread fire through the engine compartment.
''The most important thing for our customers to know is that we are proactively working to assure the Cruze is the safe and durable car they purchased,'' said Alicia Boler-Davis, G.M.'s head of global quality.
The purpose of the second, separate recall is to inspect for faulty welds on fuel-tank brackets. G.M. said it believed that 249 cars of the 61,000 in the recall could have weld problems.
G.M. has informed federal regulators of both the fire-related recall and the weld inspection.
Owners of Cruzes will be sent letters explaining the recalls beginning on July 11. The engine shield will be modified by cutting back portions that could be exposed to dripping oil. No new parts or fees will be required, and the work can be completed within 30 minutes at a Chevrolet dealership.
All of the affected cars were built from September 2010 to May of this year at the company's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Cars built since May have been equipped with modified engine shields, Alan Adler, a G.M. spokesman, said.
The recalls come just as G.M. is rebuilding its reputation for quality after its financial collapse and $50 billion government bailout.
This week, the company posted its best scores in years in the influential J. D. Power & Associates survey of new vehicle quality. The Chevrolet brand beat the industrywide average of 102 problems reported per 100 vehicles, with a score of 100.
The Cruze has also been a strong competitor in the crowded compact-car market.
G.M. sold 94,000 Cruzes in the first five months of this year, ranking it behind only the midsize Malibu in its car lineup. But Cruze sales have fallen 3 percent from the same period last year, as Toyota and Honda have rebuilt the inventories of their small cars after shortages in 2011 caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

HEADLINE: An Increase In Barriers To Trade Is Reported

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Argentina tweaked import regulations on bottle caps and water balloons. India banned exports of cotton. South Africa instituted a tariff on artificial turf. Those recent policy changes sound minute. But they, and scores more like them, have stoked fears about trade protectionism rising as the global economy cools.
The World Trade Organization and other independent analysts are sounding the alarm. In a report released at the end of April, the W.T.O. said that since mid-October the Group of 20 economies -- the world's biggest, which account for a vast majority of the world's economic output and trade -- had added 124 new restrictive measures affecting about 1 percent of world imports. 
Global Trade Alert, a respected independent survey, titled a June update on trade protections ''Debacle.'' It bumped up its estimate of the number of protectionist measures enacted in 2010 and 2011, by 36 percent, and warned that countries had many more coming.
The European Union also issued a report finding a ''staggering increase in protectionism'' in recent months. Group of 20 members ''need to seriously step up their efforts to fight protectionism,'' Karel De Gucht, the European Union trade commissioner, said in a statement. ''It sends the wrong signal to global trading partners, it sends the wrong signal to investors and it sends the wrong signal to the business community.''
The wave of protectionism comes as growth has slowed or stalled in nearly every region of the world. Trade experts say that governments -- particularly in developing and emerging economies that rely heavily on exports to fuel their growth -- have felt pressure to protect their domestic industries and started inhibiting foreign competition to compensate.
''Governments are facing particularly difficult economic conditions domestically,'' the World Trade Organization, based in Geneva, said in its report. ''They must resist the temptation to move toward more nationalistic and inward-looking policies. This kind of policy will not solve their problems and they risk generating tit-for-tat reactions by their trading partners.''
Rising tensions over trade flared on Friday, when the United States sharply criticized Argentina and Indonesia for enacting new import restrictions.
''Our question for Argentina again today is: When will the government put an end to the nontransparent and restrictive measures and practices that have been the source of such longstanding irritation and growing frustration?'' said an American attache at the W.T.O., Rachel Bae, according to a Reuters report.
In light of the creeping protectionism and the testier global climate, trade became a prominent topic at the Group of 20 leaders summit meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico, this week.
The Group of 20 countries upheld their promise not to protect their own businesses by restricting trade -- the so-called standstill clause. But talks over how long to extend the pledge were tense. Some countries wanted the pledge to expire at the end of 2013. The negotiators representing the Group of 20 countries failed to work out a deal, and the presidents and prime ministers had to step in to reach an agreement to extend the pledge through 2014.
Analysts argue that the countries in the Group of 20 are already breaking their pledge by enacting new measures.
''The more recent wave of trade restrictions seems no longer to be aimed at combating the temporary effects of the global crisis, but rather at trying to stimulate recovery,'' said the W.T.O., adding that protectionism is ''now a matter of concern.''
According to the Global Trade Alert, the share of protectionist measures put in place by Group of 20 economies has climbed to 79 percent today from 60 percent in 2009.
Experts said that while the increase in trade restrictions was worrisome, the overall number of new measures and the percentage of exports and imports hit by them was not. In past recessions, countries have hastily thrown up much more significant trade barriers.
''The record is actually rather good,'' said Michael Froman, assistant to the president for international economic affairs, who served as the United States' representative at the summit meeting. ''The fact that major countries have taken actions that only affect such a small amount of trade in this environment -- I think that's quite positive.''
Still, analysts said the trend did not look good. ''The Group of 20 countries are saying, 'There's no repeat of the Great Depression! We should probably get a star of honor!' '' said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization in Washington. ''It's true it's not a rerun of the Great Depression. But there's a lot of it. And it's not slowing down. That's the alarming part of the story.''
Moreover, trade experts said that countries were adopting subtle new trade-restricting measures that were harder for watchdogs to pinpoint and count. For instance, some countries had issued guidelines asking government offices to procure goods or services from domestic companies.
''The W.T.O. rule book has a lot of space in it,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''Countries figure out the loopholes, and that's how you get all this gimcrack coming in at the margins of the W.T.O. rules or outside of them.''

HEADLINE: Fame Without a Legacy

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
When I was in graduate school in the mid-'70s, trying to learn how to paint, a useful, shorthand criticism for a certain kind of creation was, ''It looks like a LeRoy Neiman.'' A reasonably sophisticated art student knew what that meant, and it was not a compliment. It referred to the splashy, garish, instantly recognizable style of illustration, a formulaic mix of impressionism, expressionism and realism, that Mr. Neiman used to make himself one of the most famous artists in America.
To compare a student's work to Mr. Neiman's meant, ''You are trying to distract the viewer from noticing your wooden draftsmanship and your ineptitude with matters of form and structure by larding your canvas with loud color and patchy accretions of paint.'' Or, ''What you are making is all frosting, no cake.'' 
Mr. Neiman, who died this week at 91, was not an artist whom anyone in what I will here call the serious art world ever cared about. The world that I identified with, and aspired to be a part of, was the one whose orbit included New York Times critics, Artforum and Art in America magazines, institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art and galleries like those lining the streets of Chelsea.
From that exclusive vantage point, Mr. Neiman was the archetypal hack, his immense popularity explicable only by his ambitiously opportunistic personality and his position as Hugh Hefner's court artist, which gave him monthly visibility to millions in the pages of Playboy. With his ever-present cigar and enormous mustache, he was a cliche of the bon vivant and a bad artist in every way.
I suppose that what Mr. Neiman's fans found in his painting was a sense of engagement with the kind of subjects regularly proffered by network television: professional sports and its heroes, like Muhammad Ali and Joe Namath. He was, after all, a modern artist, as concerned as any with synergies of form and content. He made infectiously frothy paintings about exciting subjects. But there was nothing in his work to upset the couch potato's televisual worldview.
It is one of the big lies of the serious art world that anything goes. That may be the case in regard to form, material and techniques, but when it comes to cultural politics, my art world leans decidedly leftward. In Chelsea galleries you are not going to find art made in the service of family values, patriotism or orthodox religion. Republican presidents may be satirically skewered, those who are Democrats hardly ever. You are unlikely ever to see anything condemning abortion or advocating looser gun control laws in a Whitney Biennial.
The serious art world expects, ostensibly at least, that Modern and contemporary art should be in some way critical of mainstream culture, as the avant-garde, from Manet to Pollock, is supposed to have been. Pop Art of the 1960s seemed to view the circus of American mass entertainment and consumerism with a mordantly amused eye. Warhol cranked out portraits of celebrities, but in a way that left you uncertain what he really thought of them. Mr. Neiman's shamelessly fawning portraiture and uncritical view of big-time athletics left no room for doubt.
But his enthusiastic embrace of the wide world of sports points up by comparison a troubling insularity and crabbed vision in the serious art world. Unlike, say, movies and books that expansively meditate on topics of urgent interest to lots of people and at the same time earn the respect of smart critics -- the novels of Richard Ford and the films of Wes Anderson, for example -- the contemporary art scene tends to favor either navel-gazing or promotion of certain agendas. The movement known as Institutional Critique, which obsessively parses the system by which art is circulated and consumed and has been, paradoxically, much favored by museum curators, is only the most conspicuous instance of this blinkered view of real, multidimensional life in the world at large.
Mr. Neiman started out in the late 1950s and early '60s near the cutting edge of cultural change in his association with the swinging yet literate, unapologetically hedonistic lifestyle promoted by Playboy. His single, most memorable creation was the Playboy Femlin, his deft cartoon figure of a curvy sprite in thigh-high stockings and big hair. She was an extraordinarily economical condensation of mid-20th-century heterosexual male desire and a muse for the sexual revolution in the new era of the Pill.
But Mr. Neiman did not evolve in ensuing decades, and his public profile faded, like that of the magazine he worked for. I suspect that few artists now under 30 have any idea who he was or what he represented.
Mr. Neiman is not the only celebrated artist to be marginalized by the cognoscenti. Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, Norman Rockwell and Andrew Wyeth all incurred suspicion for the taint of kitsch attached to their work. But it is hard to deny the aesthetic and moral interest of what they did, so they have their high-minded apologists.
Is the serious art world wrong to exclude and disdain Mr. Neiman and his art? I don't think so. But the artist who could galvanize both popular imagination and mandarin intellect and in so doing expand the serious art world's spiritual horizons and tell us something true about real life in the real world -- that is something to wish for.

HEADLINE: Filling Up on a Midday Bite of New York History

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The evening restaurant meal is an elaborate ritual in which exquisitely prepared foods are eaten in a particular order, using fine utensils in select company.
And then there's lunch hour.
''Everybody talks at once; everybody orders at once; everybody eats at once; and everybody seems anxious to pay at once'' is how a New York observer described the scene in 1868.
In 1901 Munsey's Magazine observed, ''Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker.''
All of which means that lunch hour is probably not the ideal time to see the new exhibition ''Lunch Hour NYC'' at the New York Public Library, because time will be too short, the galleries too crowded and the need to grab a bite too great. 
This show should ideally be seen at a more leisurely pace, to savor the repast prepared by its curators -- the culinary historian Laura Shapiro and the library's Rebecca Federman, who has worked with the culinary collections -- and to leave room to digest their offerings.
Really? Can an exhibition about the history of lunchtime in the city have that much to say? Yes: Going to this show is a bit like heading out to a street cart or a food truck and finding that there is much more to choose from than you thought possible.
And so it is here. There are sections on street foods, on Horn & Hardart Automats, on home lunches, school lunches, charity lunches and power lunches. There are selections from the library's 45,000-strong collection of menus, a manuscript by Jack Kerouac written at a cafeteria and W. H. Auden's piquant 1947 poem ''In Schrafft's,'' perhaps drafted on site.
It is all playfully and elegantly designed. The Web resources are rich as well, including detailed links to images and invitations to help transcribe menus from the library's collection.
Even after a quick visit, you might echo the young Parisians who have become fans of the American-inspired gourmet-food trucks in Paris: ''Tres Brooklyn,'' they say -- a term ''that signifies a particularly cool combination of informality, creativity and quality,'' The New York Times reported recently.
You begin at the library with the mundane: New York's street scenes. The central gallery is almost a stage set in which carts and storefronts present their offerings: pretzels (which we learn once had a disreputable reputation because of their association with saloons); hot dogs (''before the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906,'' they were ''the sort of food that mothers warned their children never to eat''); pizza (the Pizza Principle: ''Since 1960, the cost of a subway ride and a slice of pizza has been nearly the same'').
You see a 1932 menu from a Japanese restaurant on West 47th Street, and learn how Japanese restaurateurs have packaged their immigrant tastes for New York customers. (A ''Suki-Yaki Dinner'' includes ''beef tenderloin,'' olives and celery hearts, for $1.25.) A display about ''Chinese takeout'' has a delivery bicycle with plastic bags wrapped over the seat that looks as if it had just pulled up on the sidewalk. And there is a video interview with Ed Beller, who invented the Admar stainless-steel hot dog cart, which became the standard.
But all of this is something of an appetizer; street foods are a small slice of a larger phenomenon. The New York lunch is far more complicated and unusual.
Historically, we learn, lunch had negligible importance. In English rural life the main meal during the day was known as ''dinner.'' And you still can find a leisurely approach to the midday meal in Mediterranean climes.
In his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language, Samuel Johnson suggested that ''lunch'' was derived from foreign words referring to ''a small piece'' or ''clutch.'' ''Lunch'' means ''as much food as one's hand can hold.'' An 1841 version of Noah Webster's dictionary is here too, in which lunch is defined as ''a portion of food taken at any time, except at a regular meal.''
Lunch, in other words, was traditionally unconnected to the rituals of dining; it was unscheduled, informal, eaten using the hands rather than utensils. Lunch is perhaps the perfect description for the food offered on street carts.
But while this informality still thrives, lunch was transformed with the growth of New York as a trading, manufacturing and finance center. The midday meal could no longer be treated as a dinner. Nor could lunches be grabbed haphazardly. Eating schedules were codified. As the city expanded, and workers downtown could no longer return home to eat during the day, the lunch hour took off.
The exhibition even suggests that New York gave the lunch hour a modern identity. The city ''reinvented lunch in its own image.'' Even 150 years ago, the ''crowds, the rush and the dizzying range of foods'' during lunchtime in New York were startling to visitors.
Was New York unique in this? That is uncertain here, but the evidence is compelling. We know that in industrialized towns, both in the United States and England, lunch scheduling was standardized. But educated Parisian civil servants in the novels of Zola, for example, seem to have inordinate flexibility in their midday schedules.
And in late-19th-century New York? The exhibition quotes the journalist George G. Foster, who wrote in the book ''New York in Slices'' in 1849: ''Everything is done differently in New York from anywhere else -- but in eating the difference is more striking than in any other branch of human economy.'' The schedule was firm, and haste was the rule.
An industry developed out of the lunch hour. One wall-size 1888 etching here, ''A Down-Town Lunch-Room in New York,'' shows waiters and top-hatted diners pressed together in a tumult of food and conversation.
The automat, a few decades later, was almost the opposite: Tumult was replaced by metallic compartments and magically sleek mechanisms. Drop a coin, turn a knob, and a glass door would open, revealing individual servings seemingly untouched by human hands. The automated office was answered by the automated cafeteria.
The library has a collection of Horn & Hardart papers, and if you recall those marble emporiums only in their decades of decline, you can get a sense here of the impact they once had. In the early 1930s there were 41 automats in New York. Press a button here on a Horn & Hardart coffee spout (it was the Starbucks of its day), and you hear tributes to the automat in Moss Hart and Irving Berlin's 1932 musical, ''Face the Music.'' By the 1950s, though, automats were struggling. Soon they were all facing the music.
There is much more here, as the history unfolds: samplings of luncheonette slang from 1940, in which a waitress might call out for some ''nervous pudding'' (gelatin) or a bowl of ''belly wash'' (soup).
There is a too brief account of company lunchrooms that suggests a rich and unexplored subject. We see here a lunchroom at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's main office on Madison Avenue, which opened in 1909 and served more than 4,000 clerks a day. Each had filled out cards listing menu preferences: ''Men and women ate in separate lunchrooms, and everyone had an assigned seat so that waitresses could quickly deliver the right meal to each person. The clerks were allowed 35 minutes for lunch, and the meal was free.''
And there is a survey of the home lunch as well. Immigrant families might mix cooking traditions at lunch in ways they would not at dinner. Families with different economic status might end up eating similar lunches.
We learn too of sandwiches and of the ''quintessential American sandwich filling,'' peanut butter, once considered ''an elegant treat.'' And the quintessential American bread? Wonder Bread, whose sliced uniformity eliminated ''a century's worth of social distinctions among sandwiches.''
People will always find ways of reinventing differences. But despite power lunches and charity lunches, despite lunchrooms for clerks and executive dining halls for top brass, a strong tradition can be seen here right through the final gallery, with its photographs of contemporary lunch sites. Lunch is the democratic meal, the great leveler, a break in the rituals of social and economic life. Anybody could be standing next to you, grabbing as much food as the hand can hold.
Tres Brooklyn!
''Lunch Hour NYC'' is on view through Feb. 17 at the New York Public Library; nypl.org.

HEADLINE: A Debate Goes Behind Doors

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
In the long war over Wall Street regulation, a little-noticed clash erupted this week over a plan to rein in risky trading overseas.
Signs that a clash was brewing behind the scenes came after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission abruptly canceled a meeting to vote on the overseas trading proposal with just hours to spare. The agency provided no explanation, sending out only a short e-mail that it would ''no longer hold a scheduled meeting on June 21, 2012.''
Interviews with regulators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, show that the agency canceled the meeting after closed-door talks yielded a more flexible proposal that gives Wall Street additional time to comply. Now, rather than debating the issue in public, the commissioners plan to cast their votes in private over the next several days, according to people briefed on the matter. 
While such wrangling is business as usual in Washington, and the changes debated this week are relatively modest, the trading commission's new overseas proposal has become a focal point in the debate over Wall Street regulation. The proposal, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, takes aim at firms that ship derivatives trading overseas to escape the eyes of American regulators. Roughly four years ago, foreign derivatives trading by American International Group in London nearly brought American firms to their knees.
Gary Gensler, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., has trumpeted such regulation for weeks, pointing to JPMorgan Chase's recent multibillion-dollar trading loss that took place at a London-based unit.
''Recent events at JPMorgan Chase are a stark reminder of how swaps traded overseas can quickly reverberate with losses coming back into the United States,'' Mr. Gensler said in a recent speech to bankers. ''The risk can come crashing back here pretty quickly.''
The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this front echo battles over rules passed in the run-up to the financial crisis, when Wall Street won major concessions from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, in 2004 loosened an obscure provision that allowed banks to ratchet up their risk-taking.
The events this week also highlight the challenge facing independent regulators with five-member commissions. The agencies are tasked with writing hundreds of new rules under Dodd-Frank to police Wall Street. At the trading commission, every time a rule comes to vote, Mr. Gensler must secure the blessing of at least two colleagues.
''At the end of the day, democracy is a messy process,'' said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which supports tougher regulation of banks. ''You get less-than-perfect outcomes from independent agencies.''
The trading commission's roster features two Republicans, two Democrats and Mr. Gensler, a Democratic presidential appointee. Mr. Gensler's push to rein in Wall Street has met some opposition from the Republican commissioners, who argue that the agency occasionally oversteps its bounds. And while he has loyal support from Bart Chilton, one of the agency's Democratic commissioners, he has found the deciding third vote somewhat elusive.
''The five-member commission structure means that we have to find consensus, and I think our rules and the American public benefit from reaching a consensus,'' Mr. Gensler said on Friday. Others note that about 90 percent of the agency's votes received support from at least one Republican.
Mark Wetjen is the third Democratic vote. A former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, he is the newest member of the agency. In his first several months, Mr. Wetjen has voted with Mr. Gensler on every proposal. But behind the scenes, people close to the agency say, he has emerged as a more independent voice.
In the case of the overseas proposal, Mr. Wetjen sought several significant changes last week. Mr. Gensler, who adopted some tweaks and rejected others, thought they had a deal.
But Mr. Wetjen raised additional concerns a day before the scheduled vote. While he never threatened to vote against the rule, neither did he promise to vote for it.
Mr. Gensler briefly considered proceeding, even without assurances, to force Mr. Wetjen's hand. The chairman still had support from Mr. Chilton, who supported the earlier plan.
''I think there are times on some of these key issues, like the cross-border issue, that we need to be very strong even if a vote doesn't go our way,'' Mr. Chilton said on Friday. ''Compromise is one thing; tossing out your beliefs is another.''
The plan would apply new derivatives rules not only to banks in the United States, but also to American banks that have foreign units. The proposal would also apply to foreign banks that conduct significant derivatives trading in the United States.
Mr. Wetjen, concerned that some American banks would face a competitive disadvantage, pushed for more flexibility. He urged Mr. Gensler to give American banks more time to comply, suggesting that the rules not fully take effect until nine months after the proposal was completed, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Proponents of regulation argue that Wall Street has had plenty of time to comply.
''How long do taxpayers have to wait to be protected from the risky activities of these too-big-to-fail banks?'' Mr. Kelleher asked.
Ultimately, Mr. Gensler proposed a compromise, putting the proposal back on track. A deal was struck that provided the foreign arms of American banks with a reprieve so that they need not comply with certain provisions for 12 months after the plan is first proposed.
Mr. Wetjen also persuaded Mr. Gensler to give banks based solely in the United States until Dec. 31, roughly a three-month reprieve, to comply with other provisions. In another compromise, the agency is now planning to allow branches of American banks based overseas to apply for so-called substituted compliance, in which the banks will face similar rules from foreign regulators rather than from the C.F.T.C. Some regulators say that the substituted plan would level the playing field and discourage regulatory arbitrage.
Mr. Wetjen declined to comment.
The changes were surprising to some outsiders. People traveling to the meeting learned it was canceled only after arriving in Washington.
Some supporters of the effort questioned the changes, given the recent losses at JPMorgan.
''It's unbelievable to me that this would be a problem in this day and age, especially because of the JPMorgan loss,'' said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland law school and a former regulator at the trading commission.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: College Plan: Where to Start

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at BAM Advisor Services. His book, ''The Behavior Gap,'' was published earlier this year. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog.
When I suggested a couple weeks ago that we need to talk about and plan for college sooner, one question kept coming up: how? 
While the specifics of your plan will depend on you and your children, there are some basics that make sense for most everyone.
1. Where are you today?
Perhaps this one is obvious, but you need to be super clear about your current financials. It's really hard to plan a trip if you have no idea where you're starting. A good place to begin is to create a family balance sheet. It may seem a simple thing, but you'd be surprised how few people have one.
2. Where do you want to go?
Normally, when you decide to go on a trip, it helps to know where you want to go. But with financial goals, like saving for college, it's rarely a straight line. Since the future is uncertain when we try to plan, and especially when we pretend we can be precise with planning, it can end in frustration.
Think of all the guesses that go into a plan for reaching financial goals.
What will it actually cost?
What about inflation?
What rate of return will we earn?
How much can we save?
Then, there's maybe the biggest unknown: where will your children want to go AND will they get accepted?
But if that seems too complicated, there's always the approach taken by my friend Brad.
One time I asked him if he knew if he was saving enough for his daughter's education. Did he have a plan? He said: ''Hey Carl, how about this plan? I'm saving as much as I reasonably can.''
With that in mind, let's walk through the two options.
If you need motivation to save, then it may be helpful for you to take the time to forecast (really, guess) what it will cost you to pay for college. I've seen motivated people suddenly find ways to save more, either by spending a bit less or earning a bit more. If you need help, there are plenty of tools. Try this total cost calculator, or if you want to get more specific in your guess, you can compare public andprivate colleges by state.
But maybe you're more like my friend Brad: just save as much as you reasonably can. Since saving is one of the few things that may be in our control, I like this plan. Saving as much as you reasonably can may be all we can do anyway. Ultimately, it really doesn't matter how much it will cost to send my daughter to Stanford. I can only save as much as I can, and I may not enjoy the idea of constantly reminding myself that I'm not doing enough.
What if I focused instead on the other things that matter? Things like having real conversations with my daughter about her goals and what it will take to get there. And there's definitely value in helping her explore all the available scholarships and financial aid and what she can do to improve her chances with grades, sports and other activities.
After all, as Felix Salmon pointed out, we often don't even know the cost until the acceptance letter arrives. In some cases, the colleges we assumed would be beyond our financial reach could end up costing slightly more than other colleges because of financial aid.
3. Where do I save the money?
It's hard to argue against using a 529 account for at least some portion of the money you're saving for college. There are two options available: prepaid tuition and college saving plans. Such plans can offer tax benefits. But remember that if you withdraw money from these accounts for something other than education, there may be penalties and fees. To get a sense of what's available, here's a tool for helping you evaluate the different 529 plans.
No matter what path you select, one of the most important and valuable parts of the process might be the conversations you have with your children. Besides helping prepare them for college, you're helping them learn how to set and achieve their financial goals. And that's an education they can always use.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Switzerland's Battle to Suppress the Franc Exacts a Price

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
IN the middle of the chaos and fear that is Europe today sits a country seemingly apart from it all.
Switzerland is surrounded by countries that use the embattled euro currency -- France, Germany, Austria and Italy -- but it has kept its own Swiss franc. To many in Europe, that currency has become an oasis of security, something that will remain stable whether or not the euro zone survives and prospers. 
And therein lies the problem for Switzerland. All that foreign money coursing into Switzerland drove the value of the franc to record highs against the euro.
During the first 10 years of the euro's existence, its value was always above 1.4 Swiss francs. But in 2010, amid turmoil over Greece's problems, the euro fell to below 1.3 francs. Last summer, the euro fell almost to par with the franc.
That plunge was good news for Swiss consumers, who faced declining prices for many things, but horrible news for the country's manufacturers, whose products were in danger of being priced out of world markets.
Slashing interest rates to zero did not keep the currency from gaining value, so in September the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, announced that it would not allow the euro to trade for less than 1.2 francs.
The accompanying charts show the results. At first, the euro bounced above the level, but it has remained at the floor for most of this year as foreigners bought francs. The central bank has accumulated euros at a rapid rate as it sought to support that currency. At the end of May it had accumulated 303 billion francs ($320 billion) in foreign currency reserves. But exports, after rising initially, have begun to weaken, suggesting that the franc is still too strong for many of its exporters.
Just what to do with all those foreign currency reserves has become an issue. Some Swiss have suggested the creation of a Swiss sovereign wealth fund. The central bank has rejected that idea, but has expanded its range of investments to include such currencies as the Australian dollar and the South Korean won. It has put about a tenth of the reserves into foreign stock markets.
At the same time, superlow interest rates have helped to send home prices up in Switzerland. The chart on the right shows how indexes of American, Spanish and Swiss home prices have changed since the first quarter of 2004. American and Spanish prices rose more rapidly, but have since fallen back. Swiss prices have risen more than American ones ever did.
The central bank is worried. ''Residential real estate prices have reached levels that, in some cases, exceed those that can be justified by fundamental factors, such as demographics or per capita income,'' Jean-Pierre Danthine, the central bank's vice chairman, said last week. He said the bank was considering steps to raise reserve requirements on mortgage loans as a way of slowing the boom, and expressed concern over whether bank capital would be adequate if home prices fell sharply.
But the Swiss show no willingness to abandon their support of the euro. ''The Swiss National Bank will maintain the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 francs per euro,'' Thomas Jordan, the bank's chairman, said at a news conference last week. It will, he said, ''buy foreign currencies in unlimited quantities for this purpose.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: The Swiss Dilemma: Fearing that a strong Swiss franc would be disastrous for its exporters, Switzerland said last summer that it would not allow the euro to be worth less than 1.20 francs. That meant keeping Swiss interest rates at just above zero while buying euros to keep the franc from falling. That caused the country's foreign exchange reserves to soar, but its exports are still declining. Meanwhile, low interest rates have led to increases in home values that alarm the Swiss central bank.

HEADLINE: Florida Struggles to Overcome Threats to Freshwater Springs

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
SILVER SPRINGS, Fla. -- Of Florida's 700 artesian springs, Silver Springs shimmered the brightest. Its fresh water was so translucent that the white sand and tiny shells at the bottom glistened, giving the river and springs a beautiful blue tint from above.
Glass-bottomed boats grew famous here as did underwater photography. Even Tarzan was lured to the springs; six of the movies in the 1930s and '40s were filmed here. Tourists arrived in droves to these springs, just outside Ocala.
The riverscape -- with anhingas drying their wings in the sun, alligators lolling near the banks and native hibiscus in bloom -- is beautiful. But its fragility is plain to see. Except for a few patches, the bottom of Silver Springs and Silver River are no longer visible, covered by invasive weeds coated with algae.
The springs scarcely bubble up. Its flow rate has dropped by a third over 10 years. The current moves as slowly as the red-bellied turtles that sun themselves on logs, allowing toxic nitrates to choke the water. 
The culprits, environmental experts say, are a recent drought in north-central Florida and decades of pumping groundwater out of the aquifer to meet the demands of Florida's population boom, its sprinklers and its agricultural industry. To what degree the overconsumption of groundwater is to blame for the changes is being batted back and forth between environmentalists and the state's water keepers. But, for the first time, a state with so much rain -- the vast majority of it uncaptured -- is beginning to seriously fret about water.
''It's a very dramatic drop-off in flow; it raises the hair on the back of your neck if you are concerned about springs,'' said Robert L. Knight, the director of the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute who has spent decades studying Florida springs. ''Springs are a very good canary in a coal mine because they pull water off the top of the aquifer.''
But Silver Springs is not alone in its distress. In the last 10 years, many of the famous freshwater springs and rivers in the central and northern parts of the state have seen a sharp drop-off in flows and a steady rise in algae. Nearby Rainbow Springs and River are also suffering, although not as much. The declines have accelerated rapidly in the past five years, so much so that they have galvanized Florida environmentalists to launch a broad campaign to bring attention to the problem and spur Gov. Rick Scott to act.
''Florida is a state that has historically had an abundance of water,'' said Bob Graham, a former Democratic governor and United States senator who assembled the Florida Conservation Coalition last year to help safeguard the state's water. ''We have learned that we can degrade our water supplies to the point that water becomes a limitation on the quality of life in Florida. We don't think that is necessary. But we think it is possible, if not probable, unless there are strong policies and enforcement at the state and local level for sound water practices.''
In a letter last week, the coalition called on Mr. Scott to direct a state agency to assess the decline in Silver and Rainbow Springs and Rivers and come up with a plan to help them. The plan could then benefit the state's other ailing springs.
Lane Wright, a spokesman for Mr. Scott, said the governor understands how important water is to Florida. ''The adequate supply of water resources is obviously something that is vital if we want to have people living here in our state,'' Mr. Wright said.
The sudden attention on Silver Springs is the result of an application for a permit from the St. Johns River Water Management District to use 13 million gallons of water a day, about the same amount used by the city of Ocala. The permit is being sought by Frank Stronach, a Canadian auto parts magnate and horse breeder who is building Adena Springs Ranch nearby, a 25,000-acre cattle ranch and slaughterhouse that will produce organic grass-fed beef.
Mr. Stronach's ranch is expected to provide about 150 jobs in the slaughterhouse and perhaps more as the operation grows. According to its Web site, the ranch plans to carefully monitor fertilizer use, which can dump nitrate into the springs and rivers, and will only use the amount of water necessary.
Scientists commissioned by Adena Springs Ranch to study the issue have concluded that the property's water use will have an ''immeasurable impact'' on the surrounding area.
''The experts we have hired say that the impact on the springs and river will be insignificant,'' said Ed de la Parte, a lawyer who is representing Adena Springs Ranch in its permit application.
But other experts, including Dr. Knight, disagree, saying the freshwater springs are in such a precarious state that they will be adversely affected even if the flows drop a tiny amount.
''If they get a permit for that amount it adds insult to injury because we already know it's not sustainable,'' Dr. Knight said. ''It certainly has become a lighting rod for public attention.''
The application for so much water -- Mr. Stronach initially wanted 25 million gallons -- has brought the battle between water conservation and economic development in Florida into sharp relief.
Just a few years ago, a request for 13 million gallons would not have turned many heads.
But water experts and environmentalists say the effects are cumulative. Although water use has recently decreased, the amounts over all have been set too high for too long and the consequences are only now becoming obvious, they say.
Florida's population boom led to an increase in the number of people and businesses demanding sprinklers (more water is used outside the home than inside). All of it is groundwater from the Floridan Aquifer. The decrease in rainfall in central and northern Florida has worsened the situation.
''We are either in or headed for a water crisis,'' said Estus Whitfield, a former principal environmental adviser to five Florida governors.
Ann Shortelle, the former director of water policy for the Department of Environmental Protection and now the director of the Suwannee River Water Management District, one of five districts to oversee water quality and quantity, said it is fair to say that both drought and water use permits affect the state's groundwater supply.
She said the state and two water management districts are conducting a joint review of the data to see why the Silver Springs flow has dropped and what is causing it. The state also has launched projects to reuse water and capture rainwater, although the water management districts saw their budgets decrease sharply this year.
The five districts are also working more collaboratively since groundwater does not adhere to boundaries.
''We do not want to lose our springs,'' Dr. Shortelle said.
Leaning into the still, murky Silver River, Karen Ahlers, a local environmentalist, grabbed a clutch of slimy hydrilla that is now clogging the waters.
''It's scary how fast this is happening,'' she said. ''It seems as if we have reached some type of a tipping point.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 04, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on June 23 about threats to the artesian springs in Silver Springs, Fla., included several errors and also omitted the amount of time during which the springs' flow rate has declined. The state's main acquifer is known as the Floridan Acquifer, not the Florida Acquifer. The number of gallons sought by Frank Stronach, a rancher near the springs, was 13 million gallons a day -- not 23 million, as noted in some editions. The agency involved in a review of the groundwater supply is the Suwannee River Water Management District (not Suwanee). The director of that agency is Ann Shortelle, not Shortell. And the flow rate of the springs has declined over 10 years.

HEADLINE: To Give or Not to Give, Up to $5.12 Million

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
TIME may -- or may not -- be running out for one of the biggest tax breaks for wealthy Americans: the chance to give up to $5.12 million to heirs tax-free and then pay a comparatively low 35 percent rate on any gift above that. The break is scheduled to expire in six months, but no one will hazard a guess about its fate because it is just one of many tax and spending measures expiring at the same time.
When this break was agreed upon by President Obama and the Republican Congress at the end of 2010, I expected it would spur the wealthiest to give away huge amounts of their estate to take advantage of the break. (The original $5 million limit was increased this year for inflation; it is separate from the $13,000 annual exclusion gift.) But the rush that I expected was initially just a trickle. While the tax break was enticing, the fear of what lay ahead in the economy and financial markets made people cautious. 
Now, some of the wealthy are faced with a choice that seems designed by a behavioral economist to test rational decision-making: Do they give their heirs the full amount of the exemption, happy that the money will help the heirs now and reduce their eventual estate tax bill? Or do they give less, or none at all, for fear that they could be left with not enough to live on?
''I've gone through this with lots of people, and based on the reactions, no one whose net worth is in the nine figures has worried about having enough,'' said Edward F. Koren, chairman of private wealth services at the Holland & Knight law firm. ''Below that, it depends on their spending levels and their values. That's so personal to the client.''
The deadline for making a decision is fast approaching because advisers say it takes at least three months to do everything that needs to be done to set up a gift of this size.
All advisers agree that every financial decision is about more than saving on taxes. But in this instance, the math on both taxes and compound interest is compelling, particularly for younger people with wealth who have decades to live.
While none of the advisers would make a prediction on what might happen, no one thought the exemption would remain this high or the tax this low in 2013. After years of a $1 million gift exemption, the advisers agreed that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Adding to the benefit of the large tax exemption is the amount the gifted money can grow. For a child who received $5 million today in a trust that was invested broadly, that gift could grow in 30 years to nearly $29 million, at a 6 percent return every year, according to calculations by Jonathan Blattmachr, a principal of Eagle River Advisors, which consults on estate planning. Meanwhile, the parents' estate would have been reduced by $29 million, cutting the tax due on the estate.
And that is why some wealthy people -- those who could run out of money in their lifetime -- have been seduced by this opportunity but are, at the same time, trying to work out how to do it. (The exemption for the estate tax is also $5.12 million until the end of the year, but, obviously, only those who die in 2012 can take advantage of it.)
Some people are also questioning the effect such a large gift will have on their heirs. Their main concern is that it will it rob their children of motivation, said Catherine McDermott, senior wealth planning strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank.
But she said that fear may be misplaced. ''A lot of the education around stewardship of wealth occurs during a lifetime as you're raising children,'' she said. ''Many of those questions parents face as they're raising children.''
In other words, by the time you have made enough money to think about leaving a lot of it to your heirs, you have either set them on the right path in life or led them to believe that your money will be their cushion.
For those who do decide to make a substantial gift, there are many different ways to do it. Writing a check is the simplest way, but advisers would tell you that would leave the money unprotected against creditors. It would also waste an opportunity to use various strategies to multiply the gift.
Putting appreciated securities in a trust would seem to be a good idea, but that could lock up liquid assets that might be needed.
Another option for people worried about having enough liquid assets is to put real estate or a share in a private business into a trust.
''Transferring a home doesn't feel the same as transferring $5 million in stocks or bonds,'' said Diane E. Lederman, president and chief executive of the Neuberger Berman Trust Company.
She cautioned that anyone doing this should make sure that all the paperwork was perfect because the people making the gift would essentially be renting their home back from a trust in their heirs' names. ''When you're giving an asset away and you're continuing to reside there, it's going to attract I.R.S. scrutiny,'' she said.
But those who worry that they may need the money back should understand that a gift that satisfies the Internal Revenue Service has to be irrevocable, and the person making that gift can no longer have control over the assets.
That would seem to be straightforward, but the world of tax planning is anything but. Mr. Blattmachr, who built his own wealth interpreting tax law for his clients at the law firm Milbank Tweed, where he was a partner for 35 years, has structured trusts with his wife, Betsy, that are so complex they boggle the mind. They enable the Blattmachrs to take advantage of the current exemptions and gift money today to reduce future estate taxes. But he has structured the trusts, which each hold about $4 million, in such a way that they have a built-in safety valve if something goes wrong: they can get the money back.
One risk to trusts like these is that they mirror each other and could then get disallowed by the I.R.S.
Another risk would be if the Blattmachrs divorced, but after 42 years of marriage, he said he was not worried about that. Many estate planners are wary of these trusts. ''There is very little out there from the I.R.S. on this,'' said Paige Ben-Yaakov, a partner in the tax section at the law firm Baker Botts. ''It's not as easy as taking the assets and giving them away because you know that works.''
Mr. Blattmachr has put great effort into making sure his trusts will be allowed. At the beginning of 2011, he began setting up his trust, naming his children, grandchild and his wife as beneficiaries. Earlier this year, he set up a trust for his wife that named their children, grandchild and him as beneficiaries. Setting up trusts at different times is one way to counter any future allegations by the I.R.S. that the gifts were not real and the trusts were reciprocal.
But Mr. Blattmachr went further. He put their two homes in his trust -- and now lives in them as a guest of his wife -- and put securities in her trust. He made sure the trusts had different sets of trustees, giving her the right to replace hers but denying himself that ability. Her trustees can convert her trust to pay her 4 percent a year regardless of the principal; his can make distributions only for health, maintenance and support.
''The I.R.S. always wants the low-hanging fruit,'' Mr. Blattmachr said. ''You want to get yourself way, way up in the tree.''
He added, ''I don't think any one can tell you that this absolutely works or this absolutely doesn't work. But what they're going to tell you is the I.R.S. will go after others before you.''

PERSON: Edward Costikyan 

HEADLINE: Edward Costikyan, 87; Advised Top New York Officials

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Edward N. Costikyan, a former adviser to New York governors and mayors who as a Democratic Party insurgent in the early 1960s took over the leadership of the party as it rooted out a century of Tammany Hall bossism, died on Friday at his home in Mount Pleasant, S.C. He was 87.
His daughter, Emilie, confirmed the death.
It was in March 1962, four months after the ouster of the imperious party boss Carmine G. De Sapio, that Mr. Costikyan was elected leader of a party organization tainted since the 1860s by the prodigious corruption of Boss William Tweed. 
After Mr. Costikyan's two years as leader, many Manhattan Democrats, including Mr. Costikyan, said that Tammany Hall was no more. All that remained, they said, was simply the New York County Democratic Party.
''He was a transitional link from the collapse of Tammany Hall to the modern-day Manhattan party structure,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. ''It went from warlord to a series of would-be bosses.''
In 1964, Mr. Costikyan resigned from his party post. But over the next three decades, he was repeatedly pulled back into the political fray.
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, chose him as chairman of a commission that in 1972 called for the decentralization of New York City's government. In 1986, at the height of the city's Parking Violations Bureau scandal -- involving a bribery and kickback scheme that brought down powerful Democratic politicians and raised the profile of Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a Republican prosecutor -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Edward I. Koch, both Democrats, appointed Mr. Costikyan to a special panel investigating ways to prevent corruption.
In 1994, Mr. Guiliani, by then the mayor, asked Mr. Costikyan to draft a plan to eliminate the city's central Board of Education and place the school system under mayoral control -- a reorganization realized under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
''He was the go-to guy for politicians of both parties,'' Professor Moss said. ''Throughout his career, he was a forceful advocate for modernizing government and the decentralization of urban services, though he wasn't always successful.''
Edward Nazar Costikyan was born on Sept. 14, 1924, in Weehawken, N.J. His father, Mihran, an Armenian immigrant from Turkey, was a rug merchant. Mr. Costikyan's mother, Berthe, was a teacher at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Mr. Costikyan graduated from that school in 1941.
In World War II, as an Army first lieutenant, he saw action on Okinawa, then served as the military governor for a small district in Korea. He graduated from Columbia University in 1947 and earned his law degree there two years later. Within a year he had become law secretary to Judge Harold R. Medina of the United States District Court in Manhattan.
In 1951, he joined the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and he became a partner in 1960.
In 1950, Mr. Costikyan married Frances Holmgren, and the couple moved to East 53rd Street. He waded into clubhouse politics and in 1955 was elected Democratic leader of the Assembly district in his East Side neighborhood, placing him on the party's executive committee.
Stirrings of reform were being heard. Mr. Costikyan joined other reformers in 1960 to circulate a petition calling for Mr. De Sapio's ouster, saying that his ''bossism'' -- overseeing a strict precinct-based structure with patronage based on party loyalty -- would give the Republicans a powerful issue in the next election. The reformers were supported by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, a Democrat.
In fall 1961, Mr. De Sapio was deposed. On March 2, 1962, Mr. Costikyan was elected Democratic leader and began a balancing act of trying to democratize the party while still dealing with its old guard. Indeed, reform Democrats criticized him for being too willing to compromise with the party regulars.
Municipal reform remained a concern after he resigned from his party post and went into private law practice. As chairman of Governor Rockefeller's 1972 task force on city government, Mr. Costikyan recommended that the city be carved into 25 to 40 districts, each with its own ''locality mayor'' and council administering services like street cleaning, schools and even police patrols. (Some said the governor created the task force because of his rivalry with Mayor John V. Lindsay, a Republican turned Democrat who had campaigned as a reformer.)
Mr. Costikyan acknowledged that decentralization was no cure-all for inaccessible government agencies. But political clubs no longer held sway in the television era, he said, and that left a vacuum: nothing to mediate between neighborhoods and the bureaucracies downtown. Criticism of his report, Mr. Costikyan said, was based on fear among the ''liberal-intellectual middle class'' that poor people were incapable of self-government.
After his first marriage ended in divorce, Mr. Costikyan married Barbara Heine, a freelance writer, on March 6, 1977. Four days later, he announced he was running for mayor.
''I know what a long shot my campaign is,'' he said at a news conference.
He joined a Democratic field that would grow to include Mr. Koch and Bella Abzug; Representative Herman Badillo; Percy Sutton, the Manhattan borough president; Mr. Cuomo, then New York's secretary of state; and Mayor Abraham D. Beame, who was seeking re-election in the face of rising crime and a worsening economy.
Two months later, short of money and support, he pulled out of the race to become co-chairman of Mr. Koch's campaign. Mr. Koch went on to win the mayoral election.
The Parking Violations Bureau scandal, in which officials accepted hidden partnerships and bribes in exchange for granting contracts to fine-collection agencies, drew Mr. Costikyan back into public service as a member of the special commission on corruption formed by Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch. Its report called for changes in campaign financing, ethics rules, judicial selection and contracting practices.
In spring 1994, Mayor Giuliani asked Mr. Costikyan to come up with a plan for replacing the city's schools chancellor with an education commissioner. The mayor had engaged in a long feud with the central board and several chancellors. Then, on July 10, 1995, in a sharp escalation of the tension, Mr. Giuliani formed a commission -- with Mr. Costikyan as chairman -- to investigate criminal activity in the system and the effectiveness of the central board in maintaining school safety. The next day, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines resigned.
Mr. Costikyan's second marriage also ended in divorce. Besides his daughter, he is survived by a son, Gregory; his brother, Andrew; and five grandchildren.
Mr. Costikyan also made a mark, though a lesser one, in music. For more than 30 years, up to 80 lawyers, relatives and friends of lawyers -- all amateur musicians and singers -- would gather for the Christmas concert of the Occasional Oratorio and Orchestral Society, a group founded by Mr. Costikyan and a fellow Columbia Law School graduate, William M. Kahn, in 1950.
On the conductor's podium, at not quite 5-foot-5, Mr. Costikyan would bob and weave to the strains of Stravinsky and Handel. During the society's 1982 concert at the City Bar Association building in Manhattan, Mr. Costikyan was heard urging, ''O.K., cellists and bassists, plenty of schmaltz.''
Online Correction: June 26, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Saturday about Edward N. Costikyan, a former adviser to New York governors and mayors, misstated the year he joined the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He joined the firm in 1951 and became a partner in 1960; he did not join the firm as a partner in 1964 after resigning from a Democratic Party post. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the candidates for mayor of New York in the 1977 Democratic primary. While the field indeed included two members of Congress, those representatives were Edward I. Koch and Herman Badillo -- not Mr. Koch and Bella Abzug. (Ms. Abzug had left Congress in 1976.)
Correction: July 21, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on June 23 about Edward N. Costikyan, a former adviser to New York governors and mayors, referred incorrectly to Mr. Costikyan's connection to Tammany Hall, a private organization that was for many years closely linked with the New York County Democratic Party. While the news media frequently used the term ''Tammany Hall'' to refer to the party and its members, Mr. Costikyan was an official only of the party; he was never ''on Tammany Hall's executive committee'' or ''elected leader of Tammany Hall.''

HEADLINE: Obama Draws Contrast With Romney in His Turn Before Hispanics

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- President Obama on Friday sought to capitalize on his newly announced reprieve for young illegal immigrants with a broad attack on Mitt Romney and Congressional Republicans as obstacles to a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration system.
In what amounted to the general election campaign's first debate on immigration policy, Mr. Obama appeared before the same Latino audience that heard from Mr. Romney, his Republican challenger, a day earlier. Mr. Obama used the opportunity to tell Latinos not to trust Mr. Romney's softening language about immigration. 
The president cited his decision last week to stop forcing out many young immigrants illegally brought into the country as children by relatives, saying he was ''lifting the shadow of deportation'' from people who deserved to stay. By contrast, he pointed to Mr. Romney's opposition to legislation known as the Dream Act, intended to offer legal status to many of the same young people.
''It's long past time that we gave them a sense of hope,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now, your speaker from yesterday has a different view. In his speech, he said that when he makes a promise to you, he'll keep it. Well, he has promised to veto the Dream Act, and we should take him at his word. I'm just saying. And I believe that would be a tragic mistake.''
In its response on Friday, Mr. Romney's camp focused on economic issues. ''No election-year speech can cover up the president's job-killing policies that have led to 11 percent Hispanic unemployment and millions of Hispanics living in poverty,'' said Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman. ''On Day 1, Mitt Romney will take our country in a new direction and get our economy back on the right track.''
The back-to-back appearances before the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials cast a sharp light on a topic that has divided the country in recent years, particularly as jobs have grown scarcer since the financial crisis of 2008. Each candidate faced a delicate balancing act in appealing to a growing segment of the electorate while papering over aspects of his record that are less appealing to this audience.
For Mr. Romney on Thursday, the challenge was to shift away from the harsher talk, of the Republican primary season, if not the party's policies, when he was competing for conservative votes. For Mr. Obama a day later, the test was bolstering support from a critical part of his electoral coalition while managing disappointment over his failure to enact more sweeping immigration changes and over a deportation policy that has sent home more immigrants than in any other administration.
Mr. Obama offered no new policies or ideas for how he would accomplish in a second term what he did not in his first. Instead, he focused on blaming Republicans for blocking the passage of the Dream Act in 2010 and lamented that even those Republicans who once supported more expansive changes had now, he said, abandoned the issue.
''Congress still needs to come up with a long-term immigration solution, rather than argue that we did this the wrong way or for the wrong reasons,'' he added. ''So to those who are saying Congress should be the one to fix this, absolutely. For those who say we should do this in a bipartisan fashion, absolutely.
''My door has been open for three and a half years. They know where to find me.''
Mr. Obama received a warmer response here than Mr. Romney did. ''He hit all the high notes,'' said Rafael Anchia, a Democratic state representative from Texas.
But another Hispanic leader said Mr. Obama's words rang hollow, given the lack of progress in forging a bipartisan solution. ''Where is the leadership?'' asked Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.
Mr. Romney on Friday disassociated himself from an adviser who predicted that he would reverse Mr. Obama's decision to allow young immigrants to stay. Ray Walser, co-chairman of Mr. Romney's Latin America policy group, told The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, that ''he would probably rescind this directive were he to be elected in November.''
The Romney campaign noted that Mr. Walser advises on foreign policy, not immigration. ''Governor Romney has been clear that he will put in place a long-term solution that will supersede President Obama's stopgap measure,'' said Andrea Saul, a campaign spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: European Leaders' Vow to Defend Euro Is Undercut by Discord Over Means

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and STEVEN ERLANGER; Elisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome, and Steven Erlanger from Paris. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, and James Kanter from Luxembourg.

 BODY:
ROME -- The leaders of the euro zone's four largest economies vowed Friday to defend the common currency with all means necessary, trying to reassure jittery financial markets before yet another summit meeting of the European Union next week in Brussels. But clear disagreements remained on what those mechanisms ought to be.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gave little indication of heeding calls for pooling the region's debt or using European bailout funds to prop up the government bonds of Spain and Italy, despite increasing pressure from the European leaders and the International Monetary Fund. 
She said that she and the leaders of Spain, France and Italy had agreed on a $160 billion growth plan, but that is a modest effort that largely redirects existing money, adding so-called project bonds through which the euro zone will provide credit to private companies for infrastructure projects and job creation.
''There was an agreement among all of us to use any necessary mechanism to obtain financial stability in the euro zone,'' Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said at a joint news conference with Ms. Merkel; Mario Monti, his Italian counterpart; and President Francois Hollande of France.
''The euro is here to stay, and we all mean it,'' Mr. Monti broke into English to say. But he added that although much had been done to stem the euro crisis, the measures were still insufficient. Markets are sure to agree.
And so the impasse remains, even after a sharp public rebuke Thursday evening by the monetary fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, who urged European leaders to get on with fixing the euro zone's economic problems. The Obama administration has likewise made clear its fears that the slow pace of rectifying the crisis is dragging down the global economy and hampering the American recovery, with the fallout including damage to Mr. Obama's re-election campaign.
The next chance for a major change will be the larger meeting in Brussels next Thursday and Friday, with the leaders of all 27 European Union members present and an agenda that is supposed to concentrate on ''growth,'' as opposed to simply the fiscal discipline Germany insists on.
Also on the Brussels agenda will be measures to support European banks and their supervision, including ideas for a European-wide federal deposit insurance program, to try to eliminate bank runs in troubled countries like Greece and Spain.
Ms. Merkel opposes the idea of using the European Union's bailout funds as a bank, to buy the bonds of strained countries to rein in their soaring borrowing costs. And she has opposed letting the European Central Bank lend directly to the bailout funds or to individual governments. She argues that the rules as written allow neither, and risk making Germany, the union's largest and most creditworthy country, liable for the uncontrollable debts of others.
Mr. Hollande, recently elected, and Mr. Monti have been pressing for a method to collectivize debt and reduce borrowing costs for weakened countries. But Ms. Merkel insists that mutualized debt can work only on the basis of mutualized responsibility, sovereignty and oversight.
On Friday, Mr. Hollande put the emphasis differently, saying that there could be ''no transfer of sovereignty without an improvement in solidarity'' and that he would continue to push for euro bonds. Ms. Merkel answered that solidarity was possible only with serious controls and collective oversight and that ''we have existing treaties and they must be respected.''
The bailout funds are ''instruments of solidarity,'' but ''you cannot have guarantees without control,'' Ms. Merkel said tersely. ''If I simply gave money to a Spanish bank, or other bank, I can't say what that bank should change because I'm not responsible. I'm the German chancellor; I can only say that to my banks.''
At a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday, Ms. Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund urged the euro area to move swiftly toward a fiscal union that would include the issuance of some form of collective euro zone debt, arguing that the currency's viability was being put into question. The monetary fund would like bailout money to be lent directly to struggling banks rather than through national governments, to avoid adding to their sovereign debt. That distinction is at issue in the $126 billion bailout package for Spain: the European lenders are so far insisting that the payback obligation be on Madrid's books.
Ms. Lagarde also appealed to the European Central Bank to take more aggressive measures to quell volatile financial markets, whether by increasing the money supply or by resuming the purchase of the bonds of troubled countries like Spain and Italy.
''Christine Lagarde is throwing down the gauntlet,'' said one euro zone official, requesting anonymity because of the political sensitivities involved.
The markets want reassurance, Mr. Monti said in comments published Friday in a joint interview with five European newspapers. After the Brussels meeting next week, he said, ''there may not be -- indeed, there will not be -- a fully fledged, detailed blueprint, but there will be some strong elements and a short road -- I hope short, a few months -- to get from there to the overall project'' of tighter integration in the euro zone. Mr. Monti has pushed to use the European bailout funds to buy sovereign debt without conditions on the recipients' budgets or spending. Germany regards that as a blank check, while others think the funds are too small unless they are guaranteed by the European Central Bank itself.
Both leaders are constrained by domestic political considerations. Ms. Merkel faces more dissent in her governing coalition and a softening of the exports that drive Germany's economy. Mr. Monti, considered a technocrat, was charged last fall with solving the economic problems that worsened under Silvio Berlusconi, his predecessor, but Italian parties have watered down his efforts. The chief measures he has carried out -- a significant pension overhaul, increases in property and other taxes, and a crackdown on tax evasion -- have been alienating Italians.
In Rome on Friday, there was one other point of agreement: a new tax on financial transactions, which might be used to pay for future bank rescues. Ms. Merkel said she and the other three leaders would pursue it.
Britain has adamantly opposed such a tax, given that London is Europe's financial center. But London alone cannot block it. Under European Union rules, the tax could be adopted within a subgroup of countries.
On Friday, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said that 10 of the relevant countries were prepared to move forward with the tax.

HEADLINE: Fees Flowed to Romney's Firm As Companies It Owned Failed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and JULIE CRESWELL; Mike McIntire contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Cambridge Industries, an automotive plastics supplier whose losses had been building for three consecutive years, finally filed for bankruptcy in May 2000 under a mountain of debt that had ballooned to more than $300 million.
Yet Bain Capital, the private equity firm that controlled the Michigan-based company, continued to religiously collect its $950,000-a-year ''advisory fee'' in quarterly installments, even to the very end, according to court documents.
In all, Bain garnered more than $10 million in fees from Cambridge over five years, including a $2.25 million payment just for buying the company, according to bankruptcy records and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Bain's investors saw their $16 million investment in Cambridge wiped out.
That Bain was able to reap revenue from Cambridge, even as it foundered, was hardly unusual. 
The private equity firm, co-founded and run by Mitt Romney, held a majority stake in more than 40 United States-based companies from its inception in 1984 to early 1999, when Mr. Romney left Bain to lead the Salt Lake City Olympics. Of those companies, at least seven eventually filed for bankruptcy while Bain remained involved, or shortly afterward, according to a review by The New York Times. In some instances, hundreds of employees lost their jobs. In most of those cases, however, records and interviews suggest that Bain and its executives still found a way to make money.
Mr. Romney's experience at Bain is at the heart of his case for the presidency. He has repeatedly promoted his years working in the ''real economy,'' arguing that his success turning around troubled companies and helping to start new ones, producing jobs in the process, has prepared him to revive the country's economy. He has fended off attacks about job losses at companies Bain owned, saying, ''Sometimes investments don't work and you're not successful.'' But an examination of what happened when companies Bain controlled wound up in bankruptcy highlights just how different Bain and other private equity firms are from typical denizens of the real economy, from mom-and-pop stores to bootstrapping entrepreneurial ventures.
Bain structured deals so that it was difficult for the firm and its executives to ever really lose, even if practically everyone else involved with the company that Bain owned did, including its employees, creditors and even, at times, investors in Bain's funds.
Bain officials vigorously disputed any notion that the firm had profited when its investors lost, arguing that a full accounting of their costs across their business would show otherwise. They also pointed out that Bain employees put their own money at risk in all of the firm's deals.
''Bain Capital does not make money on investments when our investors lose money,'' the company said in a statement. ''Any suggestion to the contrary is based on a misleading analysis that examines the income of a business without taking account of expenses.''
To a large extent, however, this is simply the way private equity works, offering its practitioners myriad ways to extract income and limit their risk. Mr. Romney's candidacy has helped cast a spotlight on an often-opaque industry.
In four of the seven Bain-owned companies that went bankrupt, Bain investors also profited, amassing more than $400 million in gains before the companies ran aground, The Times found. All four, however, later became mired in debt incurred, at least in part, to repay Bain investors or to carry out a Bain-led acquisition strategy.
Perhaps most revealing are the few occasions, like with Cambridge Industries, when Bain's investors lost. Lucrative fees helped insulate Bain and its executives, records and interviews showed.
Piling On Debt
Having spun off from a management consulting firm, Bain has always been known for its data-driven, analytical approach. Under Mr. Romney, the firm scored some remarkable successes, enabling its investors -- wealthy individuals and institutions like pension funds -- to collect stellar returns.
The companies that fell into bankruptcy were clearly the exception, and the causes were also often multilayered. Some companies proved too troubled to rescue, and others were hit by broader economic or industrywide downturns.
In at least three of the seven bankruptcies, however, companies appear to have been made more vulnerable by debt taken on to return money to Bain and its investors in the form of dividends or share redemptions.
That was arguably the case with GS Industries, a troubled Midwest steel manufacturer that Bain acquired in 1993, investing $8.3 million. The private equity firm took steps to modernize the steelmaker. A year later, the company issued $125 million in debt, some of which was used to pay a $33.9 million dividend to Bain, securities filings show.
The private equity firm plowed an additional $16.2 million into the steelmaker, but when the industry experienced a downturn in the late 1990s, the company could not manage its heavy debt. It filed for bankruptcy in 2001, but Bain's investors still earned at least $9 million.
Debt from acquisitions, usually part of a ''roll-up'' strategy of buying competitors, played a role in at least five of the seven bankruptcies The Times examined. In most of these cases, Bain investors garnered some initial gains before the companies faltered.
For example, after Bain acquired Ampad, a paper products company, in 1992, the company grew through a series of acquisitions. Sales jumped, but its debt climbed to nearly $400 million, and it found itself squeezed by ''big box'' office retailers. It filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Bain and its investors walked away with a profit of more than $100 million on their $5 million investment, on top of at least $17 million in fees for Bain itself, according to securities filings and investor prospectuses.
A similar phenomenon unfolded with DDi, a Bain-owned circuit board maker that expanded aggressively in the late 1990s. Sales soared, but so did its debt. The bursting of the tech bubble forced it to scale back. It filed for bankruptcy in 2003. The gains for Bain's investors easily exceeded $100 million. Bain also collected more than $10 million in fees.
Substantial Fees
The numerous fees collected by private equity firms have been a frequent lightning rod for the industry. First, the firms charge their investors a percentage of the fund as a management fee, meant to cover its overhead. During Mr. Romney's tenure, this was initially 2.5 percent and then dropped to 2 percent. Private equity firms also collect transaction or deal fees, ostensibly for advisory work, from companies they buy. These fees are generally collected for major transactions, like the purchase of another company, a public stock offering or even the initial acquisition of the company. A third fee stream comes from annual monitoring or advisory fees that portfolio companies typically pay to their owners, the buyout firms.
These fees can be substantial. In the case of Dade International, a medical supply company in which Bain acquired a stake in 1994, Bain and other investment firms piled up nearly $90 million in fees over seven years. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2003 but not before it had borrowed heavily to pay $420 million to Bain and other investors several years earlier.
In 1998 alone, Mr. Romney's final full year at Bain, The Times was able to identify roughly $90 million in fees collected by the firm across its various funds, a figure that is probably low because most companies in Bain's portfolio did not have to file financial disclosures.
These fees covered Bain's expenses -- like rent, salaries and lawyers -- and the bulk of the remaining money was awarded to Bain employees as annual bonuses.
Bonuses were relatively small some years, like from 1989 to 1991, when the savings and loan crisis and other events slowed business. In that period, Bain managing directors made roughly $300,000 to $400,000 a year, mainly from their salaries, excluding gains from investments, according to an executive familiar with Bain's compensation. By the mid-1990s, as Bain grew, managing directors' annual incomes, again excluding investment returns, had swollen to $3 million to $5 million, mainly thanks to bonuses derived from fees.
Bonuses were not the main drivers of the immense wealth accumulated by Mr. Romney and other Bain executives. That came from their share of Bain's ''carried interest,'' the firm's cut of its funds' investment profits, as well as the returns from personal investments in Bain deals.
Bain officials insist that fees were never a way for the company to garner much in the way of profits and pointed out fee structures for every fund are agreed-upon in advance by investors. They said fees supported the firm's staff-intensive approach to managing companies. Totaling up the hours Bain employees put into deals at standard consulting rates, they said, would far exceed what the firm actually collected. They said fees also covered the costs of hundreds of deals researched every year and not pursued or completed.
Investors have succeeded in the past decade in pressing private equity firms for a greater share of these fees. In 2009, a trade group representing institutional investors issued guidelines it believed firms should follow, including turning over all advisory and deal fees to investors, also known as limited partners. ''The battle over fees is right now going in the limited partners' direction,'' said Steven N. Kaplan, a University of Chicago finance professor.
Bain began splitting some fees with its investors in 2000. In the firm's newest fund, Bain officials said they would funnel all deal fees to their limited partners.
Bain prides itself on the personal money its employees put into deals, saying its co-investment rate is among the highest in the industry. The percentage during Mr. Romney's tenure sometimes ran to nearly 30 percent but was usually less, according to records and interviews.
''We are collectively the single largest investor in every portfolio company and every fund,'' the company's statement said. ''When our portfolio companies grow and perform, investors and Bain Capital do well. In rare instances when a business fails, Bain Capital employees share in the negative economic consequences of those losses.''
Offsetting Losses
When deals sour, however, fees can provide a hedge.
Toward the end of Mr. Romney's tenure, Bain bought Anthony Crane, a crane rental company, which then acquired a slew of smaller competitors, financed by debt. But a building slowdown hit the company hard, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2004, wiping out $25.6 million from Bain's investors, along with $9.5 million from Bain employees. The firm, however, collected $12 million in fees over the life of the deal.
Bain officials maintained they still lost money on Crane because it also cost them $5.1 million in carried interest that they otherwise would have garnered from gains in the rest of the fund.
When Bain bought a troubled chain of maternity stores called Mothercare in 1991, its investors put $1.24 million into the deal. Bain repositioned the company and upgraded its merchandise, but the stores still struggled. Bain offloaded the chain in 1993 at a total loss, and the new owners put it into bankruptcy. Bain still collected $1.5 million in fees while it owned the company, bankruptcy records show.
In the case of Cambridge Industries, Bain first acquired a stake in the manufacturer of plastic automotive parts in 1995. Bain employees personally invested $2.2 million, according to bankruptcy records, alongside $15.7 million from outside investors.
Bain immediately collected $2.25 million from Cambridge as a transaction fee for investing in the company. Cambridge then acquired several companies in rapid succession, and each time, Bain earned 0.75 percent of the purchase price as a transaction fee. The rest of Bain's $10 million in fees came through advisory fees and payments for a debt refinancing completed by Cambridge in 1997.
By then, interest payments from the company's expansion were outstripping operating income. As part of the refinancing, aimed at lowering interest payments, Cambridge repaid $17 million it owed to a debt fund run by Bain. This involved paying it a $2 million prepayment penalty.
Cambridge was finally forced into bankruptcy in 2000, when Bain declined to provide the company with an infusion of capital needed to fulfill a major new order, according to former company officials. During bankruptcy proceedings, lawyers for some of Cambridge's creditors leveled scathing criticism at Bain, zeroing in on the fees extracted while they said Cambridge was insolvent, as well as the prepayment to Bain's debt fund.
Eventually, Bain settled the dispute by paying $1.5 million to the bankruptcy trustee.
''We have been unable to identify what, if any, 'reasonably equivalent value' the Company received in exchanges for these exorbitant fees,'' Michael Stamer, a lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee, wrote to Bain's lawyers.

HEADLINE: The (Sort of) New Mitt

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Today: Mitt Romney and immigration.
As you know, American Hispanics are an important and fast-growing voting bloc. Romney has long had a strategy for winning them over. The key, he explained last year, is to tell them ''what they know in their heart, which is they or their ancestors did not come here for a handout.''
Hard to get more appealing than that. 
This was Primary Mitt, who had a long history of whacking his Republican opponents with soft-on-illegal-immigrants charges. In the 2008 campaign, he accused Rudy Giuliani of making New York a ''sanctuary city'' and Mike Huckabee of supporting ''in-state benefits for illegal immigrants.'' One of his ads called John McCain a champion of ''amnesty for illegals.'' The Romney news release that accompanied the ad's debut mentioned ''amnesty'' 17 times.
It didn't work. McCain won the nomination anyway. That was the earlier version of John McCain, before he lost the presidential race and was abducted by space aliens who took him off to a distant planet and substituted a cranky android with an obsession about border fences.
Last year, Romney tried the same tactics on Rick Perry. ''I got to be honest with you. I don't see how it is that a state like Texas -- you go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount,'' he complained during one of the debates.
Perry suggested that when it came to undocumented students who had been brought to the country as children, Romney had no heart. Also, he tried to get some mileage out of the fact that Mitt had once employed illegal immigrants to tend his yard. But it was, you know, Rick Perry, so, of course, nothing worked.
Now Romney is the inevitable Republican nominee, and this week there he was, speaking to a large group of prominent Hispanics. It was his first chance to try out his strategy, but astonishingly, Romney did not tell the audience what they knew in their hearts about in-state tuition and other handouts.
In fact, the word ''handout'' never came up. Romney did tell the inspiring story of his father's emigration from Mexico at the age of 5, although not the part about how the family had gone down there in the first place to avoid American laws against polygamy.
And there was quite a bit about the economy. You certainly can't blame Romney for mentioning it every chance he gets. But not everybody would choose to follow ''liberty's torch can burn just as brightly for future generations of immigrants'' with a call to lower the corporate tax rate.
Plus, standard Mittspeak. We are going to have a lot of this in the coming months, people. Let's pause for a minute while you test your ability to be a Mitt Romney speechwriter:
''Though each of us walks a different path in life, we are united by one great, overwhelming passion. We love ...
A) heavily sugared soft drinks.''
B) attractive young women who marry into the British royal family.''
C) cat videos.''
D) America.''
''This isn't an election about two people. This isn't an election about being a Republican, Democrat or an independent. This is an election about ...
A) lowering the corporate tax rate.''
B) lowering the individual marginal tax rates.''
C) keeping dogs off the car roof.''
D) the future of America.''
O.K., the Ds. And not the most stirring speech in the history of the world. Obama, who followed up on Friday, got a warmer reception. But let's try to figure out what Romney actually said. Except when it came to certain lawn-mowing episodes, he's always talked very tough on illegal immigration. Now that he's sniffing around for Hispanic voters, is he going to change his tune?
Answer: Romney vowed to address the problem ''in a civil and resolute manner.'' That was a surprise. I really thought he'd go for ''impolite yet wishy-washy.''
Like many of our big policy debates, immigration reform has dwindled away to an argument about something less than sweeping. In this case, it's the Dream Act, the popular plan to let people who were brought here illegally as kids become citizens if they get a college degree or serve in the military.
Primary Mitt was going to veto it.
General Election Mitt will take the military service part, ''and if you get an advanced degree here, we want you to stay here.'' (Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses bearing Ph.D.'s and master's degrees in civil engineering or computer science. ...)
As for the mere college graduates, whom Obama has now announced he will protect from deportation under an executive order, Romney was, um, vague. But whatever he does will be ''long-term.''
Also, he seems to have banished ''self-deportation'' and ''amnesty'' from his vocabulary. Unless it looks as if they'll come in handy somewhere down the line.

HEADLINE: A Small Stimulus for Europe

 BODY:
At the conclusion of the meeting of leaders from the Group of 20 largest economies early this week, participants said they were united in their efforts to promote growth and jobs. But no one was sure whether Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor and a champion of budget austerity, was ready to drop her opposition to more government spending to ease Europe's debt crisis. Her agreement on Friday to a stimulus package worth up to 130 billion euros is a welcome sign that she might come around after all. 
And not a moment too soon. With Spain tottering, Italy is viewed as the next domino. On Thursday, Moody's Investor Service downgraded 15 banks, including the five biggest ones in the United States and several in Europe. On Friday, new data indicated slippage in business confidence in Germany, presaging a slowdown or contraction there, if the euro crisis is not resolved soon.
The new pact, forged at a meeting in Rome with Ms. Merkel and the leaders of France, Italy and Spain, mainly redirects existing funds into new projects. The package will not by itself alleviate deep downturns in Europe. It will, however, create ''project bonds,'' an idea promoted by the French president, Francois Hollande, in which the euro zone would provide credit to private contractors for job-creating infrastructure projects. Jointly backed project bonds could be a step toward commonly issued Eurobonds, a bold move that would ease borrowing costs for vulnerable European economies, which Germany has opposed.
After the Rome meeting, Ms. Merkel also said the four leaders had agreed to seek a euro-zone financial transaction tax, which could be used to pay for bank rescues without more government borrowing. The tax is a sound idea and a challenge to Britain and the United States, which have balked at such taxes, even as bailed-out banks have reported profits and government budgets have deteriorated for lack of revenue.
Still, the really difficult decisions lie ahead. Austerity agreements need to be softened to allow for growth measures to address high joblessness. Leaders must also accelerate the process of European institutional integration, including banking and fiscal union.
There is no guarantee of success. But a change of tone and a few compromise gestures are as good a foundation as any for tackling the larger issues, beginning next week at the European Union summit meeting.

HEADLINE: Obama On the Attack: Romney as 'Outsourcing Pioneer'

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
President Obama and his team gleefully went after Mitt Romney on Friday for helping companies move jobs overseas, declaring that ''we do not need an outsourcing pioneer in the Oval Office.'' 
The president was citing an article in The Washington Post reporting that Mr. Romney's old firm, Bain Capital, invested in companies that specialized in relocating jobs to low-wage nations like China and India.
The Obama campaign jumped on the report to fuel its portrayal of Mr. Romney as a heartless capitalist more interested in making money than in creating jobs. The president's strategists saw the report as such a boon that they quickly inserted it into remarks for a rally in Tampa, Fla., on Friday.
''My plan will stop giving tax breaks to businesses that ship jobs and factories overseas,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and start rewarding companies that create jobs and manufacturing right here in the United States of America.''
He added: ''Now, Mr. Romney disagrees with this. Today, it was reported in The Washington Post that the companies his firm owned were 'pioneers' in the outsourcing of American jobs to places like China and India. Pioneers!''
The Romney camp fired back with a critique of the president's handling of the economy. ''President Obama continues to use false and discredited attacks to divert attention from his abysmal economic record,'' said Andrea Saul, a campaign spokeswoman. PETER BAKER

HEADLINE: Rangers Keeping Core Intact

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The Rangers will try to improve via free agency rather than by a trade that will cost key young players, General Manager Glen Sather said. 

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH - The Rangers will try to improve via free agency rather than by a trade that will cost them key young players, General Manager Glen Sather said at the conclusion of the N.H.L. entry draft Saturday afternoon.
"I think we're going to be fairly aggressive in the free-agent market," Sather said. "What we really don't want to do is dismantle the core of our organization. We've got a lot of good young kids, and we want to let them grow and develop."
Sather's remarks seemed to quash speculation that the Rangers would deal away such key players as forwards Derek Stepan, Carl Hagelin or Artem Anisimov, defenseman Michel Del Zotto or other young players in an effort to land a big-name player on the trade market. 
Columbus Blue Jackets wing Rick Nash, Anaheim Ducks wing Bobby Ryan and Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Keith Yandle are the most attractive players known to be on the trade market.
Instead, Sather's emphasis on free agency suggests that the Rangers will seek to sign Nashville defenseman Ryan Suter, one of the two jewels of the free-agency market that opens next Sunday. The other, Devils forward Zach Parise, has already said he would not play for the Rangers.
Sather would not identify any players he was interested in signing. Team officials are prohibited by league rules from naming which free agents they would like to pursue until the arrival of next Sunday's deadline.
Sather added that a trade was not out of the question, saying that the Rangers are "not married" to their players. The Rangers finished first in the Eastern Conference last season and reached the conference finals before falling to the Devils.
Sather said he "had some conversations in several deals that went down" Friday, when five trades were made involving current N.H.L. players, including the blockbuster that sent center Jordan Staal from the Pittsburgh Penguins to the Carolina Hurricanes. But, he said, "it's complicated when you play in the same division to make a trade that works for both sides."
Sather said that in the Rangers' position, free agency was the most likely avenue to improvement. 
"The organization is still developing," Sather said. "We still have the opportunity of free agency. We're going to be as aggressive as possible. As you get up into the top tier of the league, you have to get a little more aggressive in the free-agent market to get better."
He pointed out that the Rangers, drafting 28th this year, did not have "such a great shot at some of the great players who come up" among the first 10 picks.
"If you don't have low draft picks in the draft, your other option is to be aggressive in the trade market or free agency," Sather said. "If you're going to get into the trading market, you have to give up assets to get something back. In the free-agent market, you're giving away money more than anything."
The Rangers are about $21 million below next season's projected salary cap of about $70 million - a speculative number that is likely to change after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 15 and, potentially, a subsequent lockout by owners. 
The Rangers, however, have several players who will become free agents next Sunday: the important role-playing forwards Ruslan Fedotenko and Brandon Prust; the backup goalie Martin Biron; and others of varying importance, including defensemen Steve Eminger, Stu Bickel and Jeff Woywitka, and forwards John Mitchell and John Scott. 
"We'd like to sign everyone who was with our team last year," Sather said. "There isn't anybody that I wouldn't sign."
Sather referred to Biron as someone "we like," and called Fedotenko "a great citizen for us" who "worked hard - I like him a lot."
On Friday, Sather said Prust was seeking a big raise from his salary last season of $800,000. "I don't think we're going to get that one done," Sather said Friday. 
But on Saturday, Sather said that Prust and Fedotenko "have an opportunity to see what their value is" on the free-agent market. "Let's see how that works out," he said. 
Sather also said that defenseman Michael Sauer, who has been out with a concussion he sustained in December, has seen a couple of new doctors and "feels a little bit better" but is still "coming along slowly."
The Rangers had only four picks at this year's draft.
Their first choice was Brady Skjei, a 6-foot-2, quick-skating defenseman with the United States under-18 team. Their second pick was Cristoval Nieves, a center from the Syracuse area who played for Kent School in Connecticut and is committed to the University of Michigan next season. 
Their No. 3 selection was Calle Andersson, a defenseman from Farjestad's junior team in Sweden, and No. 4 was Thomas Spelling, a winger who played last season for Herning Blue Fox, traditionally the best team in Denmark.

HEADLINE: Money or Your Life

BYLINE: THERESA BROWN


HIGHLIGHT: Health insurance isn't just about costs. It's about being able to afford to live. 

 BODY:
He was one of those salt-of-the-earth guys from the rural part of Pennsylvania. Middle-aged, married with adult kids, he'd worked his whole life running his own small business, a local restaurant that he jokingly called a bordello. His wife worked, too, and she had health insurance, but he wasn't on her policy. Maybe he couldn't afford it, or he was saving money by playing the odds. After all, he'd always been healthy. And then one day he had leukemia.
I was his nurse, and he surprised me one afternoon by bringing up "death panels." Usually I avoid having political conversations in the hospital, but he was preoccupied with something that wasn't real. I didn't want him worrying about a chimera when he was adjusting to a diagnosis of cancer and an inpatient hospital stay that would last six weeks or more.
I told him there was no such thing as death panels.
"Really?" he said, in his raspy voice. "Because I hoped there were."
Since he lacked insurance, he feared treatment would bankrupt his family. Trading his life for their livelihood wasn't an exchange he could make. A death panel, he reasoned, would spare him that cruel choice.
This was not suicidal ideation, but the worries of a kind and caring man. Hospitals are filled with people like him, patients who will need thousands of dollars of medical care just to have a chance at staying alive. At the top of the list are those with a fatal cancer. But there are many other less obvious ones: a patient who got kidney failure from strep throat, a healthy 22-year-old who needed a stay in the intensive-care unit to survive the H1N1 virus, a flight attendant far from home and desperately short of breath because of a blood clot in the lungs.
As a result of the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, patients needing immediate care cannot be turned away from an emergency department because of an inability to pay. But who picks up the cost of that visit and any later care that's required? Either uninsured patients get huge bills from the hospital, or the rest of us pay for their care indirectly, through higher insurance premiums and increased out-of-pocket costs and deductibles.
The problem is, this robbing-Peter-to-pay-Paul system is quickly becoming economically unsustainable. The uninsured are not paying into the system up front, but one way or another the costs of their care are still being covered.
To address this cost-benefit disparity, the Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to buy health insurance - the idea being that if most of us pay regular insurance premiums, then we as a nation will have enough money in the insurance pot to cover everyone needing care at any one time. Additionally, requirements for getting insurance will become more uniform, and costs will drop.
If the Affordable Care Act is overturned - either legislatively or by the Supreme Court, which might announce a decision on its constitutionality this week - the insured will continue to subsidize the uninsured. Costs of coverage and care will rise, in turn making insurance affordable for fewer and fewer people.
Critics of the Affordable Care Act argue that many Americans neither want nor need health insurance, and that it forces them to pay for coverage against their will. But just as the government collects taxes to pay police officers and firefighters, the individual mandate compels Americans to pay for a service they may not immediately want but could at any time desperately require.
Much of the debate has focused on the role of government in everyday life. I don't discount the value of that question, but my focus is on real needs. I treat patients with $20,000 chemotherapy injections or monthly doses of IV immunotherapy that cost $10,000 a bag. If they don't receive these drugs my patients will die, so to me, the most pressing issue here is compassion. Without change, the patients will resemble the man with leukemia, human beings without insurance terrified that their lives aren't worth what it will cost to save them, all because of a broken but fixable system.
Crowds at conservative rallies have, astoundingly, cheered the idea that uninsured people should, if they become ill or badly hurt, be left for dead. It's easy to imagine such a thing in the heat of a rhetorical moment. But the reality is, I hope, harder to embrace. Because reality means a real person - you, me, someone we know - condemned to a possibly preventable death because, for whatever reason, they don't have insurance.
My patient with leukemia is dead. He got the best care money could buy, but his disease only briefly went into remission and he went home on hospice care. Should he, because he did not buy insurance, have been denied this chance for a cure?
The Affordable Care Act is not the health care solution everyone wants, but when patients wish for death panels as a response to leukemia, something needs to be done, and soon. This plan would help any patient facing a tough diagnosis not view treatment as a choice between his money or his life.

HIGHLIGHT: Here's a proposal to let well-off older Americans transfer some of their government benefits to children. 

 BODY:
Philadelphia
WE'RE always saying that "children are our nation's most valuable resource." Unfortunately, we don't behave as if we believe it. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of children living in poverty in America increased by 41 percent, and now includes nearly one-quarter of our kids. Growing up in poverty is bad. It leads to lower graduation rates (a third of these children will not graduate from high school); lower incomes (nearly half will still be living in poverty at age 35); and lower life expectancy (by about eight years).
The story of older Americans is completely different. In 1959, over a third of those over age 65 were poor; today, only 9 percent are. Contrary to campaign rhetoric about old ladies on fixed incomes, many Social Security recipients are quite well-to-do: the median income of married couples between the ages of 65 and 69 is $61,000, and a quarter of these households bring in more than $100,000 each year.
The rising standard of living among older Americans is largely a result of the tens of thousands of dollars each collects from Social Security and Medicare. And this huge transfer of wealth is harming our children.
Older Americans aren't selfish. Many would be willing to forgo some of their government benefits, if only they could be sure the money would go to a worthy cause. However, in the current system, giving up a Social Security check or Medicare benefits seems completely irrational. The money disappears into a bureaucratic black hole. No one will ever know if it reduced the budget deficit or allowed the government to invest in something else, like education.
But what if an older person could forgo their benefits for something specific, to help America's youth in a tangible and personally meaningful way - by, for instance, paying for their grandchildren's child care or education? Policy makers just need to find a way to tap into the willingness of these people to make sacrifices. Here is an idea that might be a solution: create the Children's Opportunity Bequest and Fund.
In the Children's Opportunity Bequest, older Americans could agree to forgo Social Security or Medicare benefits for one to three years - to start getting benefits at 66, 67 or 68 instead of 65. (They would then begin receiving Social Security benefits at the normal retirement age level, that is, without delayed retirement credits.) They could designate that the money saved - amounting on average to tens of thousands of dollars a year - be targeted for use by their very own grandchildren or any specific child identified by their Social Security number.
We know that early childhood education and high-quality day care are the best ways to improve the chances of poor children. They produce extraordinary returns in the form of reduced crime rates, higher educational attainment, higher incomes, more stable families and better health - benefits that will be passed on to following generations. So perhaps the money could be devoted to the education of children under age 5, to pay for pre-kindergarten, nursery school or day care.
Another option would be to use the money to pay for parental leave, allowing a parent to stop working - or work only part time - to spend a year or more raising his or her child, without burdening employers.
It is essential that these bequests don't exacerbate inequality by just further enriching well-off children. To that end, we could also establish a Children's Opportunity Fund, the proceeds of which would support the early childhood education of a randomly chosen newborn from a family below the poverty line. Older people with lifetime earnings in the top quarter could still pass their benefits to their own grandchildren or a child of their choice, but they would have to match every dollar they donate with a dollar to the fund. Those without grandchildren under age 5 could also choose to contribute to this fund. We could arrange for the donors to be paired with children in their ZIP code or a neighboring one. This way the benefits would enhance the opportunity of children within the senior's own community. The government could even connect the donor with the child's parents. Who knows where such personal connections might lead?
We would have to be certain that the bequests were free of waste and abuse, and so there would need to be stringent quality standards for the various education and child care programs. Similarly, we might allow a maximum of two grandparents to donate to the children in any particular family. And finally, we would limit the donations to three years, to make sure the older people themselves aren't abused or taken advantage of by younger generations.
We are unlikely to know how many older Americans would volunteer to help "our nation's most valuable resource" by donating their Social Security or Medicare benefits until we try it. But because the Children's Opportunity Bequest and Fund is budget neutral - it would help children without adding to the federal debt or consuming limited state dollars - there is little risk in establishing it. Only then might we actually start practicing what we preach about our children and grandchildren.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at the weekly addresses and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
In 2008, Oregon established a health insurance lottery for some working-age adults living in poverty, making the state a laboratory for studying the effects on extending health insurance to people who previously did not have it, Annie Lowrey writes. A continuing study of Oregonians by an all-star group of researchers appears to have produced a mixed lesson for the nation: expanded coverage brings large benefits to many people, but it is also more likely to increase a stretched federal government's long-term budget responsibilities.

        
Bain Capital, the private equity firm in which Mitt Romney used to hold a majority stake, structured deals so that it was difficult for the firm and its executives to ever really lose, Michael Luo and Julie Creswell report. The same did not apply to practically everyone else involved with the companies that Bain owned, including its employees, creditors and even, at times, investors in Bain's funds. To a large extent, this is simply the way private equity works, and Mr. Romney's candidacy for president has helped to cast a spotlighton an often-opaque industry.

        
In what amounted to the general election campaign's first debate on immigration policy, President Obama sought to capitalize on his newly announced reprieve for young illegal immigrants with a broad attack on his opponents before the same Latino audience that heard from Mitt Romney a day earlier, Peter Baker reports. Mr. Obama warned the crowd not to trust Mr. Romney's softening language about immigration.

        
Though the Citizens United decision is often cited as a major factor in the rising tide of money into elections, the demise of the public financing system for elections was hastened by President Obama's decision to abandon it four years ago, John Harwood writes.
 Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to discuss the steps he hopes Congress will take to recover more of the economy's lost jobs. He wants it to pass "common-sense policies" like a tax cut for the middle class, a transportation bill and legislation to stop student loan rates from doubling in July. "Congress has refused to act on most of the other ideas in my jobs plan that economists say could put a million more Americans back to work," Mr. Obama said. "This makes no sense." He argued that his administration has done its part to keep the recovery moving forward, including announcing a $500 million competitive grant that would help create construction jobs on projects like road repair and port renovation. "It's not lost on any of us that this is an election year," he said. "But we've got responsibilities that are bigger than an election." 

        
Representative Bill Cassidy of Louisiana delivered his party's weekly address, trying to convince listeners that the Affordable Care Act is not working. "It makes things worse by driving up health care costs, making it harder for small businesses to hire workers," he said. "So, unless the court throws out the entire law, we should repeal what is left and implement common-sense, step-by-step reforms that protect Americans' access to the care they need, from the doctor they choose, at the lowest cost." "It's important to know that Republicans will not repeat Democrats' mistakes," he said. "We will not rush through a massive bill the American people don't support or won't even have time to read to figure out whether they do support it. And we won't take our focus off jobs and the economy."

HEADLINE: Do Democrats Have a Shot at the House?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans are reasonably clear favorites to maintain their majority, but Democrats do retain something of an upside case. 

 BODY:
So far this election season we have written very little about the race for the House of Representatives. In part this is because this looks to be less dramatic than the presidential race - where Barack Obama has only a slight edge, in my view - or the race for the Senate, which looksincreasingly like a tossup.
In the House, by contrast, Republicans are reasonably clear favorites to maintain their majority.
Still, the House is probably more difficult to analyze than the battle for the Senate or the presidential race. Democrats, in my view, do retain something of an upside case that revolves around the possibility that anti-incumbent sentiment could manifest itself in a large amount of Congressional turnover.
A macro-level view of the House of Representatives usually begins with the generic Congressional ballot. Right now, that shows Democrats and Republicans roughly tied; about as many people say they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress as the Republican one.
It might be thought that if the generic ballot is tied, the seats in the House would be split about evenly, therefore implying that Democrats had about even odds of retaking the chamber. But that probably is not the case. Generally, the incumbent party in the House over-performs its vote share in terms of the number of seats it carries because of the way the vote is distributed from district to district, and therefore has a little slack in its numbers. A crude estimate we made last year is that Democrats might need to have a 3 or 4 point edge on the generic ballot - not a mere tie - to have even odds of winning the House.
It is plausible that the seat-by-seat breakdown of the House vote will be different this year if the incumbency advantage is smaller than normal. 
However, Republicans have a very nice hedge against this contingency: redistricting. Republicans, who were in control of the redistricting process in far more places than Democrats, were able to shore up some of their vulnerable incumbents. In a true wave election, these defenses might prove feeble or even counterproductive, but in an election where there were merely a slight edge to Democrats, they could make the Republicans' majority considerably more robust.
Indeed, there are few signs of a wave breaking, in the generic ballot or elsewhere. Republican candidates for the United States House have raised about $360 million so far, compared with about $250 million for Democrats. It is typical for the incumbent party to have an advantage in fund-raising, but when there is a true wave coming, the challenging party can sometimes overcome it. Republicans, for instance, slightly out-raised Democrats in 2010. And these figures do not include independent expenditures, which are also likely to favor Republicans.
The results of special elections for House seats can also be indicators, but they should be employed carefully. However, the special-elections scorecard was mixed. Things look a little more respectable for Democrats now that they retained Gabrielle Giffords's seat in Arizona in a special election earlier this month. But they had an awful day in September, when they lost Anthony Weiner's seat in New York and were blown out in what had looked like a competitive race in Nevada. On the other hand, Democrats did flip a Republican seat in upstate New York earlier last year, when their candidate Kathy Hochul campaigned on a platform that hit her Republican opponent on the cuts the Republican budget proposed to entitlement programs.
Taken as a whole, the set of special elections might suggest that races for the House could be more localized and idiosyncratic than in 2006, 2008 or 2010, rather than there being a wave in either direction. The Democrats need to gain a net of 25 seats to take control of the House, probably more than they could realize just by happening to win a lot of coin flips at the district-by-district level.
So where does the Democrats' upside case come from? There is always the statistical probability that the economy will grow by a faster-than-expected rate in the second half of the year. Economists expect the economy to grow by about 2.3 percent over the next two quarters. But economic forecasting is an extremely rough science and "surprising" results occur more often (and both to the upside and the downside) than forecasters might like to acknowledge. We could be back in a recession by the end of the year, or we could be creating 200,000 jobs per month.
Even the economic upside case, however, would not be an unambiguous good for Democratic Congressional candidates. It would likely help President Obama, and in presidential election years, a large number of people do not pay much attention to House races, enabling the winning presidential candidate to have some coattails down the ballot. Apart from these coattail effects, though, the impact of economic performance is rather ambiguous in races for the Congress when control of government is divided. 
There is an entirely credible theory that if voters are happier, they may be more inclined to retain the status quo, which in this case means a Democratic president and a Republican House. It may be noteworthy that at the same time that Barack Obama's approval ratings were improving somewhat in the first three months of this year, mostly as a result of slightly improved economic confidence, the generic Congressional ballot seemed to be getting more favorable for Republicans rather than Democrats. I would certainly think Democratic candidates for the House would prefer a better economy on balance, but it is not a slam dunk.
Instead, the numbers that would leave me at least a little bit worried if I were a Republican incumbent are the extremely low Congressional approval ratings, which are hovering at about 18 percent and which are improved only slightly from their lows after the debt-ceiling debate. Historically, these numbers have seemed to have some predictive power: when Congressional approval has been lower, the amount of turnover in Congress has been higher.
Higher turnover could cut for incumbents of both parties. However, since Republicans have more incumbents in the House - and far more incumbents in competitive districts because they won almost all of them in 2010 - this could work to their disadvantage on balance. (The same would not necessarily be true, importantly, in the Senate, where Democrats are defending more incumbent seats). House campaigns have not really begun yet - and voters do not tune into them until quite late in the cycle. It seems plausible that challenging candidates will find that they have the wind at their backs once these voters do begin to tune in.
In short, the signs so far are that Republican incumbents are holding up well enough in the House, and that there is not much of a wave breaking in either direction. But, it is quite early, and I do not think we have a keen sense yet of how anti-Congressional sentiment might translate into individual races. Betting markets give Democrats about 4-to-1 odds against re-claiming the House. This is not completely out of line, but I might take Democrats' side of the bet just on the general principle of long uncertainty early in a political cycle.
A brief housekeeping note: You may have noticed that the pace of posts here at FiveThirtyEight has quickened. This is how it should be from now through November. For the next week or two, we are going to be alternating between posts like Friday morning's that explain how the forecasting model works in more detail and those like this one that constitute our regular news coverage.
At some point, probably in mid-July, we will resume the

HEADLINE: A Law That Lets the State Decide Who Can File Suit Against It

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
After December 2009, you have to assume that lawyers for every coach thinking about taking a job at a Texas college -- or anyone looking at any contract with the state -- would have boned up on sovereign immunity law.
They would be stupid not to. With only a few exceptions, the law prevents anyone from collecting on a lawsuit against the state government, or even from successfully suing the state, without the state's permission. 
It is the shoelace that tripped Mike Leach, the former head football coach at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, when he claimed that the school violated his contract when it fired him and didn't pay him what he believes he was owed. He was fired in late 2009 after being accused of mistreating Adam James, an injured player. (Mr. James is the son of Craig James, a former United States Senate candidate and onetime ESPN analyst.)
Mr. Leach, who is now coaching at Washington State, can sue Texas and Texas Tech only if he can get permission from the Legislature. He tried and failed to do that in 2011, but he could try again during next year's legislative session. He challenged Tech's immunity in the Texas Supreme Court, which denied his appeal, agreeing with a lower court that sided with the university. The courts didn't rule on the facts of the case -- whether the firing was righteous or the contract was breached -- but on whether Mr. Leach could sue the state without its permission.
Here is how the appellate court in Amarillo described the state's advantage in its 2009 decision that the Supreme Court declined to reconsider: ''So, while it must perform and, like any other party to a contract, is responsible for its failure to do so, it cannot be sued for damages without its permission if it opts to forgo performance. In other situations, the converse is also true; the State may grant someone permission to sue it but retain its insulation from being forced to pay. The logic behind that circumstance is not ours to debate for that is the law as declared by our Supreme Court.''
Mr. Leach isn't the most sympathetic poster child. He once appeared on the cover of Texas Monthly wearing a pirate's eye patch. He is renowned for playing by his own rules. For those who didn't go to school in Lubbock, Mr. Leach's Red Raiders were the enemy.
But this raises a question for people who contract with the state, whether they're selling their skills as coach, doctor, researcher or economist, or their products and services, from pencils and staplers for state workers to school buildings and roads for the rest of us.
Texas isn't in the habit of stiffing its vendors, but it happens from time to time.
''The short answer is that people going into business with the state need to go in with their eyes open,'' said Sean Jordan, an Austin lawyer. Now in private practice, he was the deputy solicitor general who defended the state in the Leach case.
Sovereign immunity has its benefits: the state is a fat target if you're hungry for money -- that's why so many outfits hire so many lobbyists and consultants to work on procurements and privatization and all that. Just think what opportunities might occur to an entrepreneurial lawyer without that restraint.
But it sets up the state as a bully. Vendors can get some relief without going to court; there's a substantial section of state law that gives them administrative -- nonjudicial -- remedies when state agencies do them wrong. It's sketchier when it comes to employment contracts, but the same law applies: you can't sue the state unless the state says you can.
Lawyers say the people who regularly contract with the state know the risks, even if it's news to the public -- and, perhaps, to some contract employees.
The state doesn't automatically turn down lawsuits, but it's unusual for lawmakers to vote to allow people to haul the state into court. For one thing, they're politicians: who wants to vote to allow a football coach to grab $10 million in the same session in which they're voting to cut back public education and other programs to save money?
They don't have to, and so they usually don't. From English monarchs, where modern sovereign immunity got its start, to now, the state is insulated, mostly, from these kinds of lawsuits and financial claims -- and from the political fallout.
It's good to be king.

HEADLINE: How To Mend Trust In the U.S. Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Broken Trust Takes Time to Mend'' (Economic View, June 17): 
Tyler Cowen argues that the ''slow cure'' for our economic malaise is to allow asset prices, wealth, trust, etc. to slowly rise. He states that the textbook cure of significant ''Keynesian'' government stimulus spending will not quickly restore prosperity because fiscal stimulus does not ''rebuild confidence.''
Unfortunately, Professor Cowen seems not to understand that if the government were to let contracts for, say, $1 trillion to private enterprise to rebuild our failing highways, bridges, and municipal water and sewage systems, and provide resources for our shrinking public and higher education systems, this would quickly restore companies' confidence in the profit opportunities that are available if they hire workers and buy materials from other United States companies. When these newly hired workers go out and spend their wages, the confidence of United States retailers would immediately surge as these additional customers break down the doors to get at the merchandise on the shelves.
Nothing will build the confidence and trust of business and workers quicker than the continuous ringing of cash registers. Paul Davidson
Morton Grove, Ill., June 17

HEADLINE: Savoring Human Nature In Random Flux

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
ANDRE TECHINE, who turns 70 next year, makes impossibly elegant movies about very messy lives. All the people in his films are in one way or another wanderers, existential transients drifting from relationship to relationship, identity to identity, unable somehow to settle into themselves, and that's just the way Mr. Techine likes them. Movies like ''Wild Reeds'' (1994), ''Thieves'' (1996), ''The Girl on the Train'' (2009) and the new ''Unforgivable'' -- his 19th feature, opening Friday -- are filled with characters who seem not to have been created but simply found, strays picked up off the street. He offers them a place to rest while they, and he, try to figure out who they are and where they're going: the house is rambling but beautifully appointed, and the host is gracious, tolerant, tactful. At this point Mr. Techine has been putting up lost souls for nearly 40 years; he knows what he's doing. 
The invited guests in ''Unforgivable'' include a goatish old French writer, Francis (Andre Dussollier); his new wife, Judith (Carole Bouquet), a bisexual former model; her ex-lover, Anna Maria (Adriana Asti), a private detective whose son, Jeremie (Mauro Conte), has just been released from prison; and Francis's flighty daughter, Alice (Melanie Thierry), who abandons her husband and daughter to run off with Alvise (Andrea Pergolesi), a handsome heroin-dealing aristocrat. The action takes place in the world's most ravishing decaying city, Venice, and the surface of the movie is as smooth as the placid canals. The scenes flow, one to the next, serenely, no matter what crazy things these people are doing. Mr. Techine always attends to his viewers' senses, and little by little the characters' eccentricities come to seem less strange, as if beauty itself forgave everything.
Mr. Techine's style is perilous -- he risks both preciousness and narrative incoherence with every movie -- and it took him a while to master it. He is of the generation of French filmmakers that followed the New Wave. In the mid-1960s, when Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette were in full swing as directors, Mr. Techine was doing what they had done in their previous lives: writing film criticism for Cahiers du Cinema. After that de rigueur rite of passage he made his first film, ''Pauline S'en Va'' (''Paulina Is Leaving''), in 1969; it didn't make much of a stir and never opened in the United States. He waited six years before attempting another feature: that movie, a multigenerational family saga that opened here under the title ''French Provincial'' (1975), was more successful, both commercially and artistically, but he never did anything quite like it again. His next two films were a moody, florid noir called ''Barocco'' (1976) and a biopic, ''The Bronte Sisters'' (1979).
His mature style first steals into view in ''Hotel des Ameriques'' (1981), which was also the first of six remarkable collaborations with Catherine Deneuve. It's an odd love story, set in Biarritz, about the relationship between a mysteriously reserved anesthesiologist, played by Ms. Deneuve, and an impulsive, rather neurotic man played by Patrick Dewaere. Everything about their on-again, off-again affair feels tentative, provisional, and nothing much is resolved in the end, but the movie has an imaginative freedom that was new for Mr. Techine, a willingness to surprise himself.
And he has continued to make movies in that spirit: the surprises keep coming. He's now refined the exploratory manner of ''Hotel des Ameriques'' to the point where it seems capable of refreshing even the most conventional movie forms. ''Scene of the Crime'' (1986) and ''Thieves'' are thrillers, of a sort -- there are murders, at least, in both -- but their suspense has almost nothing to do with the usual questions of who did what and whether they'll get away with it; they are about how crime affects the relationships of the people involved. A bourgeois family drama like ''My Favorite Season'' (1993), in which Ms. Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil play a brother and sister whose mother is dying, becomes a meditation on memory's power to destabilize the present, to unsettle everything that had seemed firmly settled.
Mr. Techine likes to keep things fluid, unstable, which is perhaps why his movies are so sympathetic to the dire confusions of youth. All his pictures feature troubled adolescents and twentysomethings, trying to find a way to be themselves, their faces serious, clouded with uncertainty. Jeremie, in ''Unforgivable,'' has that look. So does Jeanne (Emilie Dequenne), the young protagonist of ''The Girl on the Train,'' who glides on her Rollerblades around Paris, searching for a job in a desultory way and falling into an affair in more or less the same manner, and eventually, for no apparent reason, telling a big, public lie just to announce that she exists. Mr. Techine doesn't presume to justify her, or even to explain her, but the movie leaves little doubt that he's on her side.
His best film, ''Wild Reeds,'' is, not surprisingly, a coming-of-age story, set in a provincial boarding school in the early '60s, when France's colonial domination of Algeria was, after long struggle, coming to its agonizing end. It's a Techine kind of moment in history, when a relationship is in flux, on its way to becoming something else. The kids in ''Wild Reeds'' -- one of them a French Algerian -- are trying to sort out their political feelings, their hopes for the future and their sexuality, all at the same time, and although the film has a sunlit grace and ease, Mr. Techine gives their problems the weight they deserve.
And he respects the weird randomness of teenage moods. There's a lovely scene in a cafe in which a boy who has just discovered that he's gay tells his consequential secret to his best friend, a serious girl who loves him. For a minute or so she ponders, glumly, the import of this revelation; and then ''Barbara Ann,'' by the Beach Boys, starts up on the jukebox, and they begin, spontaneously, to dance. Her smile, as she bops around, is huge, unforced, radiant; just like that, she's been possessed by pure joy.
A few years ago Mr. Techine made a lovely romantic comedy called ''Changing Times,'' a title that could serve for any of his films. Its hero and heroine, Gerard Depardieu and (inevitably) Ms. Deneuve, are old flames who meet again, years later, in Morocco and wonder if they can reconnect in the new world around them. They're as puzzled and awkward as teenagers, and that makes them, in Mr. Techine's view, alive in the best way.
It's not 1962, but the changing times we live in now are his kind of moment too. Everything's up in the air, all the old ideas about race, gender, sexuality, political and economic alignments. And that disorder, his movies suggest, is really a more natural order, nothing to be afraid of: if you can improvise a little, go with the flow of history, there are pleasures to be had. That's why he's been inviting us in, one by one, for all these years. He has always been a wonderful director; he now seems an invaluable one. His time has come -- out of the blue, like a good song on the jukebox.

HEADLINE: Update: New Yorker Wins Post In France

BYLINE: By EMILY BRENNAN

 BODY:
Updated, 10:40 p.m., June 22 WHEN France's National Assembly reconvenes on Tuesday, its new Socialist majority will include a longtime New Yorker.
This year, for the first time, French citizens living abroad will be directly represented in the country's legislature. And on June 16, French foreign nationals in the United States and Canada elected Corinne Narassiguin, a 13-year resident of New York City, to the lower house of Parliament. 
Ms. Narassiguin, 37, is a member of PresidentFrancois Hollande's Socialist Party and a newcomer to politics. She defeated Frederic Lefebvre, 48, a former junior minister in the economic ministry under PresidentNicolas Sarkozy, who was the candidate of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party.
The campaigns in New York City, an important battlefield in the election, were the subject of a feature in the Metropolitan section this month.
Ms. Narassiguin won the election handily, with 54 percent of the overall vote. New Yorkers did not rally behind their hometown candidate, though; the conservative Mr. Lefebvre won 53 percent of the votes among those registered with the consulate in New York City.
Ms. Narassiguin learned of her victory on June 17 at Murphy & Gonzalez, an Irish-Mexican restaurant in Greenwich Village, where she watched the election returns with 50 campaign volunteers.
At 5 p.m., a team member in France relayed the news in a conference call as supporters in Boston, Montreal, Ottawa and elsewhere listened in.
A few minutes later, French news programs announced the results on two of the restaurant's three wide-screen televisions. (The third was showing the Portugal-Holland Euro 2012 soccer game.) Applause and shouting filled the restaurant.
With no time for a bon voyage party, Ms. Narassiguin left for Paris on Tuesday night to settle into her new office. In addition to getting her badge and filling out paperwork, like any new employee, she has met with party members from the other constituencies abroad to discuss how to reform the system of subsidies for schooling. This week, she plans to sort through a pile of impressive resumes to hire a staff.
Ms. Narassiguin, who is originally from Reunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, said she was caught off guard by the French news media's interest in her ethnicity. She is of mixed race, mostly Indian on her father's side and Chinese on her mother's. The subject did not come up much during her campaign across North America, and when it did, it was only as one part of her identity as a young woman working in the private sector - a rare combination in French politics.
''My professional background was maybe more important to North American voters than the fact that I was a minority,'' she said by phone from Paris on Friday. ''Here, that's really what people are talking about.''
Though she will make trips to her North American constituents every month, her new position in France is a full-time job.
''I'm excited about everything that is happening,'' she said on Monday, ''but that's the saddest part, leaving my daily life as a New Yorker.''
But Ms. Narassiguin said she planned to keep a pied-a-terre in the city.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Speak Up, But Don't Shout

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
AROUND 11 p.m. on a Friday this past spring, Ted Leo, a singer and songwriter considered something of a legend in New York punk and indie-rock, opened a raucous late set at the Black Cat club in Washington with a curious greeting to his followers.
''I know how hard it is to be here,'' he joked to a crowd of about 750, a Gibson hollow-body drooping from his shoulder, ''because you all have to be up at 8 a.m. tomorrow to watch 'Up With Chris Hayes.' ''
Mr. Hayes, the host of MSNBC's new morning weekend political talk show, was padding around his apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, early the next day when e-mails started popping up from excited friends who had been at the concert. He was getting used to surging ratings and frequent mentions on The Huffington Post. But a shout-out from Ted Leo?
He had arrived. 
''It meant the show is known,'' said Mr. Hayes, 33, who says he has never met the singer. ''He was confident enough to make the joke and think he'd get a laugh.''
Word of ''Up w/Chris Hayes'' has spread beyond a few hundred punk fans. In less than a year on television (and with a chirpy voice, a weakness for gesticulation and a tendency to drop honors-thesis words like ''signifier'' into casual conversation), Mr. Hayes has established himself as Generation Y's wonk prince of the morning political talk-show circuit.
But even with his grad-student sensibility and a program that resembles a dorm-room bull session, Mr. Hayes has attracted a cult following, particularly among frustrated hyper-educated members of the Occupy Wall Street generation who are seemingly fed up with the partisan bickering that prevails in Washington and passes as political discourse on the airwaves.
''He is never doctrinaire,'' Mr. Leo said in an interview. Both punk fans and ''Up'' fans are ''suspicious of any authority,'' he said, and appreciate that Mr. Hayes ''is always willing to challenge his own assumptions, and the received wisdom on both sides of the aisle.''
Like Deadheads or Trekkies, fans of the program cluster under a common nickname: Uppers.
Credit for the nickname goes to Wyeth Ruthven, a public relations consultant in Washington, who coined the #uppers Twitter hashtag as a joke about the program's early broadcast time last October, a couple of weeks after it began. The term quickly went viral after Mr. Hayes (who monitors his Twitter feed on a MacBook Pro beside him as cameras roll, and often invokes viewer tweets on air) retweeted Mr. Ruthven. Within weeks, hundreds were joining the spirited #uppers debates on issues like gay marriage and industrial farming. Viewers now post more than 6,000 comments every weekend.
Social media, in fact, have played an unusually important role in driving traffic to the program, an MSNBC spokeswoman said. About 45 percent of the visitors to the program's Web site, which contains complete episodes, linked through sites like Facebook and Twitter. In April, those users spent an average of 51 minutes on the site each visit.
But Twitter is still the hotbed of ''Up'' fandom. Even so, the program's feed is not just an online clubhouse for New York media types like Lizz Winstead, a creator of ''The Daily Show,'' and members of Le Tigre, the too-cool electro-pop band. Cher and Chad Ochocinco have chimed in, too.
Whatever their political leanings, fans are responding out of frustration with the status quo, said Jim Rosenberg, a recruiting consultant in Greensboro, N.C., and frequent tweeter. ''It's the pent-up demand for voices other than the well-rehearsed and seasoned insider professionals who have dominated television delivering practiced meaninglessness for years,'' he said.
''Up'' comes off as a rebuke to traditional cable shout-fests like CNN's late ''Crossfire.'' Thanks to its early weekend time slot, the program has the freedom to unwind over two hours each Saturday and Sunday. Guests are encouraged to go deep into the issues of the week, and not try to score cheap-shot points to win the debate.
It is a point that Mr. Hayes hammered home at 7:15 a.m. on a recent Saturday, when he strode into the green room off Studio 3A at 30 Rockefeller Center to fill in two guests, both college professors, on the ground rules.
''The first and foremost important rule of the show: we're not on television -- no talking points, no sound bites,'' he said, his hair still a bed-head tangle and his suit collar askew. ''We have a lot of time for actual conversation. So actually listen, actually respond.''
An hour later, as the cameras rolled, Mr. Hayes and his guests waded thigh-deep into an analysis of private equity and whether it is bad for the economy. At a table of wonks, Mr. Hayes, who studied the philosophy of mathematics at Brown, came off as the wonkiest as he deconstructed the budgetary implications of tax arbitrage. Opinions were varied and passionate, but there was no sniping, no partisan grandstanding.
''I like the fact that it's dialogic, small-d 'democratic,' '' Mr. Hayes said of his show. ''We're all sitting at the same table, we're creating the public sphere in miniature. I was going to say, 'We're going to model Habermasian communicative action,' but that's excessively pretentious.''
While MSNBC's overall ratings dipped in May along with those of other news channels, Mr. Hayes's program was one of the few to surge, rising about 15 percent in total viewers over MSNBC's programming in the time slot from the previous year. Since Dec. 26, it has been No. 1 on average in its Sunday time slot on cable news channels among viewers ages 18 to 34, according to Nielsen figures provided by the network. Despite much of the country being in bed when it is on, ''Up'' has occasionally flirted with the ratings of prime-time programs like ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' (hosted by Mr. Hayes's mentor) among those 18-to-34 viewers.
Ms. Maddow said on her program that ''Up'' was ''the best news show on TV, including this one.''
''Chris is the antidote to the anti-intellectual posing that has characterized the last decade in cable news,'' she wrote in an e-mail. She added: ''No one else in cable is even trying long-form, off-the-news-cycle dives like him -- let alone succeeding at them as he is. He's giving the network Sunday shows a run for their money.''
His influence goes beyond ratings. Rolling Stone listed him in a recent Hot issue. On Esquire's Web site, Charles P. Pierce called him ''the fastest rising star in your cable teevee firmament.''
So far, success does not seem to be going to his head.
''It is genuinely shocking to me that I'm on a television show,'' Mr. Hayes, a Bronx-reared son of a civil servant and educator, said from his office on the eighth floor of 30 Rock on a recent Tuesday. As a student at Hunter College High School in Manhattan, he aspired to write. ''My dream when I was 14,'' he said, ''was someday I could have a David Levine caricature of me in The New York Review of Books.''
A life of reflection in the ivory tower now seems a long way off. In the last year, he started his first TV talk show, had his first child (a daughter, Ryan, by his wife, Kate Shaw, a law professor) and published his first book (''Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy,'' released June 12).
His professional life has been a sprint since he vaulted from a staff job at In These Times, a socialist-leaning newspaper in Chicago, to the Nation, where was named Washington bureau chief at 28. From that perch, he became a regular guest on Ms. Maddow's program and eventually started substituting for her as a guest host. Phil Griffin, the MSNBC president, offered him his own program in the spring of 2011.
So far, their decision to go live and deep without a teleprompter every weekend has paid dividends, but it also carries risks.
Over Memorial Day weekend, for example, Mr. Hayes took his first banana-cream pie in the food fight that is contemporary American political discourse. Dissecting the political rhetoric used in regard to American veterans, he explained that he was ''uncomfortable'' with the word ''hero'' as it is tossed around by politicians. ''It seems to me it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war,'' he said.
FoxNews.com assailed him for ''stupidity.'' The commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Richard DeNoyer, called the remarks ''reprehensible and disgusting.''
Mr. Hayes issued a lengthy apology before the next week's program (''I fell short in a crucial moment''). But in the broadcast that followed, nothing changed.
''I talk off-script for four hours a week, about very sensitive, complex matters,'' he said two weeks later. ''That comes with the territory.''

HEADLINE: Offspring Who Cling To the Nest

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Not too long ago, I asked a friend, the mother of two daughters who are 9 and 13, whether she had ever taken her children to Disney World -- a contractual obligation of parenthood, I assumed. The girls attend a progressive school in New York, and their tastes and proclivities run accordingly. The older might be found on a Saturday cooking ground ostrich in spices, in deference to ancient Roman cuisine. The younger can solve elaborate cubic puzzles in the time it takes to turn on a faucet.
They like France, rare steak, Charlie Chaplin, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' They hold McDonald's in disdain. Neither, apparently, had ever expressed an interest in standing in long lines to see fake princesses. 
My friend, in fact, could think of no one in her circle who had been forced to succumb to a Disney trip. Nor could she think of any of her children's friends who had gone. If there were any social pressure around Disney World at all, she said, it would be a pressure not to go.
''If you did go,'' she continued, ''you would probably have to lie and say you went somewhere else.''
The precocious, knowing child -- the kind who might arrive on the set of a Wes Anderson movie to play herself -- is, of course, one of the city's best-known commodities.
And yet the premiums we place on youthful urbanity, the pride so many seem to take in children who might distinguish Clara Bow from Louise Brooks, seems at odds with a world that cannot easily support (or in some cases, does not even encourage) their future independence or expressions of maturity.
We are now at the end of the season when college graduates move out of their dorms and on to their new lives. But it seems as if many of them end up back in their old rooms at home. To support that observation, the past week saw the release of new census data pointing to the toll the recession has taken on certain kinds of domestic arrangements. Across the country, from 2007 to 2010, the number of adult children living with their parents increased by 1.2 million. Despite constrictions of space, and despite the sense that the economy has rebounded more successfully here than it has in many other parts of the country, the trend is very much in evidence in New York. According to an analysis of census data by the Queens College sociologist Andrew A. Beveridge last week, 45 percent of the city's 22- to 24-year-olds live at home. Among those ages 22 to 39, nearly a quarter -- 22 percent -- do. These numbers have increased since 2000 and went up more during the recession.
A shortage of jobs is obviously to blame, in large part. So, too, is the oppressive cost of housing in the city. We might also consider that New York is a Mecca for that agent of extended adolescence, the internship. As Anne Kreamer, a writer specializing in workplace issues, told me: ''Post-recession, businesses are fueling growth through permanent interns. There's an unwillingness of companies to actually put the real numbers of employees on their balance sheets, which means kids into their late 20s are working for zip and have no health insurance either.''
As grim as these realities are, it seems worth remarking that the current phenomenon unfolds at a time when parents and children -- because of technology and the shared cultural affinities that are the product of hyper-attentive parenting -- seem more connected than they had been before in this country. A Pew Research Center study, released this spring, revealed that 68 percent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 who were living with parents reported being ''very satisfied'' with their family life.
As Lena Dunham, the creator of ''Girls,'' told The New York Times Magazine this month, she was only just moving out of her parents' Manhattan apartment, even though she had already managed to have her own television series.
At issue here, too, arguably, is that recent decades have witnessed an ever-more-pronounced blur between the phases of childhood and adulthood. This perhaps receives greater visual expression in New York, where hipster fashion embeds a continued wistfulness for early life. I was reminded of this one afternoon recently, when, near the Bergen Street subway stop in Brooklyn, I noticed a young mother in knee socks looking only a few years older than her toddler. (And certainly the reverse is true, with 15-year-olds going to school in Balenciaga.)
The paradox of the affluent New York upbringing, in some sense, is that it is subject to conflicted parental desire for both heightened sophistication and advanced attachment. Deborah Romano, the mother of three grown children, had her 24-year-old daughter, Julia, move out recently after living with her in her brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for a year and a half.
After her daughter moved out, her son, Mike, 26, who is starting an Internet business along the lines of an Etsy for small-scale artisanal food purveyors, moved in -- for the second time since he graduated from college. Ms. Romano has bees from which she makes honey. Mike is raising chickens. In another universe, if they were not related, you could imagine them being roommates. In September, he plans to move out. His mother isn't looking forward.

HEADLINE: Money or Your Life

BYLINE: By THERESA BROWN. 
Theresa Brown is an oncology nurse and the author of ''Critical Care: A New Nurse Faces Death, Life, and Everything in Between.''

 BODY:
He was one of those salt-of-the-earth guys from the rural part of Pennsylvania. Middle-aged, married with adult kids, he'd worked his whole life running his own small business, a local restaurant that he jokingly called a bordello. His wife worked, too, and she had health insurance, but he wasn't on her policy. Maybe he couldn't afford it, or he was saving money by playing the odds. After all, he'd always been healthy. And then one day he had leukemia.
I was his nurse, and he surprised me one afternoon by bringing up ''death panels.'' Usually I avoid having political conversations in the hospital, but he was preoccupied with something that wasn't real. I didn't want him worrying about a chimera when he was adjusting to a diagnosis of cancer and an inpatient hospital stay that would last six weeks or more. 
I told him there was no such thing as death panels.
''Really?'' he said, in his raspy voice. ''Because I hoped there were.''
Since he lacked insurance, he feared treatment would bankrupt his family. Trading his life for their livelihood wasn't an exchange he could make. A death panel, he reasoned, would spare him that cruel choice.
This was not suicidal ideation, but the worries of a kind and caring man. Hospitals are filled with people like him, patients who will need thousands of dollars of medical care just to have a chance at staying alive. At the top of the list are those with a fatal cancer. But there are many other less obvious ones: a patient who got kidney failure from strep throat, a healthy 22-year-old who needed a stay in the intensive-care unit to survive the H1N1 virus, a flight attendant far from home and desperately short of breath because of a blood clot in the lungs.
As a result of the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, patients needing immediate care cannot be turned away from an emergency department because of an inability to pay. But who picks up the cost of that visit and any later care that's required? Either uninsured patients get huge bills from the hospital, or the rest of us pay for their care indirectly, through higher insurance premiums and increased out-of-pocket costs and deductibles.
The problem is, this robbing-Peter-to-pay-Paul system is quickly becoming economically unsustainable. The uninsured are not paying into the system up front, but one way or another the costs of their care are still being covered.
To address this cost-benefit disparity, the Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to buy health insurance -- the idea being that if most of us pay regular insurance premiums, then we as a nation will have enough money in the insurance pot to cover everyone needing care at any one time. Additionally, requirements for getting insurance will become more uniform, and costs will drop.
If the Affordable Care Act is overturned -- either legislatively or by the Supreme Court, which might announce a decision on its constitutionality this week -- the insured will continue to subsidize the uninsured. Costs of coverage and care will rise, in turn making insurance affordable for fewer and fewer people.
Critics of the Affordable Care Act argue that many Americans neither want nor need health insurance, and that it forces them to pay for coverage against their will. But just as the government collects taxes to pay police officers and firefighters, the individual mandate compels Americans to pay for a service they may not immediately want but could at any time desperately require.
Much of the debate has focused on the role of government in everyday life. I don't discount the value of that question, but my focus is on real needs. I treat patients with $20,000 chemotherapy injections or monthly doses of IV immunotherapy that cost $10,000 a bag. If they don't receive these drugs my patients will die, so to me, the most pressing issue here is compassion. Without change, the patients will resemble the man with leukemia, human beings without insurance terrified that their lives aren't worth what it will cost to save them, all because of a broken but fixable system.
Crowds at conservative rallies have, astoundingly, cheered the idea that uninsured people should, if they become ill or badly hurt, be left for dead. It's easy to imagine such a thing in the heat of a rhetorical moment. But the reality is, I hope, harder to embrace. Because reality means a real person -- you, me, someone we know -- condemned to a possibly preventable death because, for whatever reason, they don't have insurance.
My patient with leukemia is dead. He got the best care money could buy, but his disease only briefly went into remission and he went home on hospice care. Should he, because he did not buy insurance, have been denied this chance for a cure?
The Affordable Care Act is not the health care solution everyone wants, but when patients wish for death panels as a response to leukemia, something needs to be done, and soon. This plan would help any patient facing a tough diagnosis not view treatment as a choice between his money or his life.

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
MADISON, Ga. -- When a black person dies in one of the rural counties around here, chances are the body will end up in the hands of Charles Menendez.
First, he offers a little prayer and asks the person on the table to help him make the job go smoothly. Then he gets down to work, embalming the body like an old-school craftsman.
''You don't want the family to touch Grandmama and feel it cold and hard,'' he said. ''You want flexibility in the skin. The idea is to leave a good memory picture for them.'' 
All of his cases are black. They always have been. If Sunday remains the most segregated day in the South, funerals remain the most segregated business. In the same way that generations of tradition dictate the churches people attend, the races tend to bury their own.
''That's the way it has always been here in the rural areas,'' Mr. Menendez said. ''White funeral homes employ white embalmers, and black funeral homes employ black embalmers. That's the South.''
Mr. Menendez, 59, handled his first body when he was a junior in high school. Now he runs a 94-year-old funeral home about an hour's drive east of Atlanta.
But with another black-owned funeral home in town competing for business and only about 60 deaths among blacks a year, it is not really possible to make a living. So he also works as a contract embalmer, traveling the back roads of Georgia to funeral homes in places like Union Point and Social Circle that are too small to afford a full-time employee to prepare the dead.
He charges $225 a body. For autopsy cases, he adds $50. A body with certain blood-borne infectious diseases costs $350.
His base of operations is the Mapp-Gilmore funeral home in Madison, a town of antebellum homes built with cotton riches and slave labor that was spared from the fires set by Union troops during Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's famous March to the Sea.
The funeral home was the first black-owned business in town. Two sisters inherited it from their father and then passed it down to other family members.
Mr. Menendez, who went to embalming school in Atlanta, began working there in 1986. He bought the business in 2001 with help from the Rev. Hoke Smith, the pastor at Calvary Baptist Church.
''He is the best embalmer in the state,'' Mr. Smith said. ''When he gets the person, he looks better than when he was alive. That's the art of what he does.''
Their small funeral home used to be the place where men sat outside and gossiped over checkers. But the neighborhood changed. In an effort at urban renewal, the city recently added a park across the street where people gather.
Mr. Menendez's embalming room is in the back, past the old sofas and the dusty silk flowers and the long, low table where the coffins are placed and the wide stairs the bereaved trudge to select one of nine coffins on display.
The least expensive is a cloth-covered box that sells for $650. Even that is getting too costly for some.
''The black families come in here over all on average with about $5,000 or a little more in insurance,'' Mr. Menendez said. ''But everyone's getting poorer since the economy fell. For some, cremation is all they can afford.''
The embalming room is old, tidy and startling in its simplicity. It looks like a beauty shop someone might run from home.
''This is what I call my little kitchen,'' he said.
The embalming table was state of the art maybe 50 or 75 years ago. No one really knows when it was set up. But it is sturdy and serves the purpose.
A tall wooden cabinet holds the fluid that is at the heart of his craft. The bottles have names like Frigid Rigid. And there are newer formulations on the market, chemical mixes that promise softer results, better tinting and fewer noxious fumes.
He prefers products from Dodge, which has been making embalming fluid since 1893. But, he says, ''I can do it with whatever's on the shelf.''
The art of embalming, he said, is about the embalmer, not the tools.
It takes about an hour to embalm a body and another hour to dress it. The trick, Mr. Menendez said, is to release the tension in a face, fill in sunken spots and make sure clothes drape naturally.
But that is just half the game. Mr. Menendez has also become practiced in the art of handling grief. The moment people walk in the door, he can tell how prepared they are and how difficult his job will be.
''Each individual takes grief differently,'' he said. ''You have people who hold things in, others who are out of control. Some have gone through it and prepared themselves.''
Whatever the state of the family, he runs a funeral old school. Quiet processionals. Dark suits. Somber viewings.
Mr. Menendez is not a man prone to criticism, but he is not fond of the ways younger, flashier funeral directors in Atlanta -- where prices can be four times as much as his -- conduct themselves.
''They think the dress-up part is what it's about,'' he said. ''You got guys going down the aisles strutting like it's a line dance.''
For him, embalming the dead and preparing a funeral is simply about making it as easy as possible to put someone to rest.
''Look,'' he said, ''funeral service is something you either love or you don't love. It's a service. You have to have a feel for it.''

VICTORY
The Triumphant Gay Revolution
By Linda Hirshman
Illustrated. 443 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99.
His dashing ascot billowing, his flat cap perched just so (to hide his bald spot), the cleft-chinned Harry Hay had some impressive head shots. As a student at Stanford in the early 1930s, he had come out to his classmates as ''temperamental,'' code for ''homosexual.'' In 1934, having dropped out of Stanford and moved to Los Angeles to try a career in pictures -- and having already begun to hone his identity as sensualist and agitator -- he joined the Communist Party. Around 1936, he turned up at a Halloween party dressed as ''the demise of fascism.'' The other homosexual bons vivants were stumped: none were terribly turned on to politics, so none knew what Harry's costume meant. These men, and others like them across America, had no core ideology, no political groups to join, no leaders. Hay changed that. In 1950, he helped create the Mattachine Society, the country's first gay rights organization, and demanded that the people it represented ''be respected for our differences, not for our sameness to heterosexuals.'' 
This year, the Human Rights Campaign, America's largest advocacy and lobbying organization for gay, bisexual and transgender rights, appointed Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, as the first national corporate spokesman for its same-sex marriage campaign. ''Ameri/ca's corporations learned long ago that equality is just good business and is the right thing to do,'' Blankfein says in a Web video. The organization also bestowed on Goldman Sachs its 2012 ''corporate equality award.''
How does a movement get from there to here -- from Hay to Blankfein? Linda Hirshman's ''Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution'' sets out to explain, tracing the history of gay rights from the early 20th century to the present.
Ever since the Enlightenment, when intellectuals articulated the crucial promises of the modern liberal state -- security, liberty and self-governance -- society's dispossessed have struggled to claim these rights as their own. The gay and lesbian movement, like the black civil rights and women's movements, has from its earliest days sought security (protection from violence and discrimination), freedom (inalienable human and group rights) and self-governance (the ability to participate effectively in political and economic life).
Hirshman's book, drawing from an arsenal of archival records, firsthand interviews, court documents and previous histories, is a sprawling account of juicy trysts, hushed political meetings, internecine movement skirmishes, sudden mutinies and activists turning personal humiliation into rocket fuel. The emerging facts are not new to scholars, but as popular history, ''Victory'' excels. Hirshman is a nimble storyteller with an agile curatorial eye for what matters: witness her recounting of the zany founding of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund and her contrasting of San Francisco's disciplined, well-oiled political machine of the 1970s with New York City's angry, anarchic community pre-Stonewall. See too her expose of the rivalries between movement factions, like the pro-Black Panther gays versus the get-along gays -- and, of course, the lesbian feminists versus the chauvinist gays, who didn't want expansive rights, just a place at the straight white men's table.
A lawyer and feminist scholar and the author of several previous books, Hirshman writes with knowing finesse. Harvey Milk, ''at 40-something, was almost twice as old as the other cool gays walking down the newly colonized gay Castro neighborhood in their tight jeans,'' she explains. ''But he did bring his current lover, the perennially younger man of the moment, Scott Smith. Scotty and Harvey opened a camera store in an old Castro storefront, just to do something, not that they knew anything about cameras.'' She introduces another historical figure: a ''lady/like'' Dianne Feinstein, ''Jewish, conventional, daughter of a doctor and wife (serially) of several wealthy men.'' Hirshman's observations land with that tart humor and piquant irony beloved by gay men. Some call it camp, others call it dish. Hirshman is heterosexual, but this book isn't straight.
''Victory'' transports readers to receding gay worlds, with companionable aplomb. On March 24, 1987, hundreds of Act Up activists, stomping, shouting, chanting -- and hanging an effigy of the F.D.A. chairman -- put a chokehold on Manhattan traffic and Wall Street. Their aim: to push ''a coordinated, comprehensive and compassionate national policy on AIDS.'' Two years later, Act Up members logjammed trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange; they chained themselves to the V.I.P. balcony, blew miniature foghorns to drown out the opening bell and unfurled a banner: ''sell wellcome.'' Days later, Burroughs Wellcome cut its AZT drug prices by 20 percent. For years, Act Up blanketed major cities with its beguiling anticorporate logo, a fuchsia triangle and the phrase ''Silence = Death.'' Act Up set the gold standard for effective guerrilla activism.
''We're middle-class white guys, and we're not used to being ignored,'' one early AIDS activist recalls. And in 1986, Jim Pepper, a blue-blooded Southern money manager who had supported the black civil rights movement in the 1960s, agreed to sponsor the first New York AIDS Walk, effectively outing himself to his straight peers. AIDS outed many rich, successful gay men to their powerful circles, loosening the oppressive vise exerted by potent institutions.
The AIDS crisis and a ferocious revival of the religious right during the Reagan years provoked the gay movement to step up its game. During the 1980s and '90s, the revolution's critical turn, gay men and lesbians decided: Don't challenge power; buy and become it. Disciplined, top-down, media-savvy, Ivy League-staffed organizations started mobilizing -- the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal. Emphasizing their constituents' similarities to their heterosexual allies, these organizations swept aside the gay community's more ''radical'' elements (trannies, sexual libertines, socialists). The new gay organizations co-opted conventional political weapons: self-selected candidates, political action committees, black-tie fund-raisers, research institutes and lobbyists. The Gay Establishment was born. As any marginalized person in this country comes to learn, aping the mainstream conjoins political and economic benefits. Assimilation pays.
As more gay people came out and were seen in the quotidian roles of citizenship -- as respected voters, workers, neighbors and patrons -- the more their heterosexual friends and colleagues began to acknowledge the illogic of policies blocking their open access to two conservative redoubts: the military and marriage. Hirshman provides a standout analysis of the military-service and marriage battlefronts. The challenge for the movement was how to square private acts with public identities. To what extent should it pursue libertarian-style privacy-rights appeals over egalitarian social-/acceptance ones? More crudely, it was ''Get out of my sex life'' versus ''Codify equal protection for what I do and who I am.'' Hirshman offers a crystal-/clear legal and philosophical explanation of the constitutional doctrine at stake, particularly in Romer v. Evans, the 1996 Supreme Court decision striking down Colorado's ''Amendment 2'' (which had banned state protection for gay men, lesbians and bisexuals), and in a string of state-level legal decisions affecting same-sex marriage rights.
Chief among Hirshman's strengths is her understanding of power. She gets how mainstream authority in America impels markets, the state, the elite, the media and religious groups to consolidate influence and keep the opposition in check. It follows that she also understands shrewdly how power can be undone.
At times I was unsettled by this exemplary book, which describes a transformation I do remember, but took cover from, sequestered in my psychic closet. I remember, as a high school student, visiting my brother at Yale in 1989 and spotting an acne-faced Yalie sporting Birkenstocks, stringy orange hair and a pin on his satchel: ''Homosexual Marriage Now.'' I remember seeing on the news gay activists visiting the Clinton White House ''welcomed'' by Marines wearing surgical gloves. I remember attending the first run of ''Angels in America'' on Broadway and, even as a dilettante, recognizing that Tony Kushner's play was a cultural game changer. I remember shouting down a shrugging Amtrak agent after the railroad lost my luggage and, with it, my auto/graphed copy of Paul Monette's AIDS memoir, ''Borrowed Time''; six months later, Monette was dead. I remember studying queer theory under the tutelage of Judith Butler, for intellectual calisthenics, not political conditioning. I remember straight friends and colleagues looking me in the face to declare their support for ''civil unions,'' not ''gay marriage,'' smug in their ''tolerance'' yet blithely indifferent that their nonmarital alternative offered less than full equality. Like many gay men who've divorced themselves from gay activism, I've lived our history as an out-of-body experience, at a remove from its real-/time impact on my people and country. For most of my life, I was a parasite to the movement, what Hirshman calls a ''free rider,'' someone ''passing as heterosexual while the out activists labored to make the world a better place.'' Having hidden from, or sleepwalked through, the slipstream of gay history, I find ''Victory'' to be an astute jolt, as remarkable for its emotional punch as for its historical insight.
In the book's epilogue, Hirshman, sounding pre-emptive and defensive, insists on the title's accuracy. No one should be fooled. True, were Harry Hay living today, the pearl-clutching Communist would applaud his movement's success. But ''Victory''? There are no federal protections against anti-gay employment discrimination. Same-sex marriage is explicitly forbidden in 38 states. Most Southern states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Gay families face codified and implicit discrimination when adopting children. Gay youth across the country are stigmatized by their peers. ''Triumphant''?
Barnumesque title aside, Hirshman must surely understand that social movements are not ''won,'' any more than most social wars (against ''terror,'' ''drugs'' and so forth) are ''won.'' Social progress proceeds in a push-pull ebb and flow of advancement and backlash. America's women have made enormous strides in political representation, even as their reproductive rights remain vulnerable to the regulatory fiat of the state and the moralism of political paternalists. The labor movement, the immigrant movement, the antiwar movement, the environmental movement, the poor people's movement: can any say they've won? Gay men and lesbians may be winning the culture war at the moment. But they're nowhere near ''victory.''

HEADLINE: Alabama's White Elephant

 BODY:
Federal taxpayers have spent almost $250 million on a new federal prison for women in Aliceville, Ala., that should never have been built. The prison is almost completed and, within a year or so, is scheduled to house around 1,500 secure prisoners as well as 250 minimum-security inmates -- or about one of every eight women in federal prison. 
But for many of the prisoners, the rural isolation of this expensive facility will hurt their chances of returning permanently to their families and communities after doing their time. Though it is the newest federal prison for women, Aliceville does not reflect the latest thinking about criminal justice policy for incarceration of women.
Experts have long argued that prisoners should be located within a reasonable distance of their families so they can keep connections with their children. Encouraging those connections benefits the criminal justice system by reducing the odds that a prisoner will end up back in prison after she is released. The location of the Aliceville prison works against these goals.
While women make up only 6.5 percent of the inmates in federal prison, the war on drugs and reduced community services for the mentally ill have led to faster growth in the population of female inmates compared with males in the past decade. The 14,100 women in federal facilities are mostly in for nonviolent crimes, like drug and property offenses. In 2009, more than half had minor children, according to a report by the National Women's Law Center.
The federal Bureau of Prisons says the Aliceville prison is needed because federal secure prisons for women, holding around 5,800 prisoners, are 55 percent over capacity. The new facility, it says, will reduce overcrowding by almost half, putting the secure prisons at 31 percent over capacity -- still twice as high as the bureau's target.
But from what experts know, many female prisoners do not need to be incarcerated to protect public safety. It would be more sensible to place more of them in community-based facilities near their families and provide treatment for drug abuse and mental health problems for those who need it, as well as education and job training.
The Bureau of Prisons decided the new federal prison for women should be located in the Southeast, and the isolated location of Aliceville is typical of recent federal prisons. Because there are few facilities for women, the bureau says, imprisoning them within 500 miles of home is an acceptable range. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama pushed hard for Aliceville, promoting the prison as a boon to economic development and a source of jobs for a needy part of the state. For a generation, that rationale has helped justify expanding America's prison system.
Now, however, some states, faced with crushing costs, are moving to scale back incarceration. It is time to find better, more cost-effective ways to deal with most female offenders than by isolating them in places like Aliceville.

HEADLINE: Apple's Retail Army, Long on Loyalty but Short on Pay

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Last year, during his best three-month stretch, Jordan Golson sold about $750,000 worth of computers and gadgets at the Apple Store in Salem, N.H. It was a performance that might have called for a bottle of Champagne -- if that were a luxury Mr. Golson could have afforded.
''I was earning $11.25 an hour,'' he said. ''Part of me was thinking, 'This is great. I'm an Apple fan, the store is doing really well.' But when you look at the amount of money the company is making and then you look at your paycheck, it's kind of tough.''
America's love affair with the smartphone has helped create tens of thousands of jobs at places like Best Buy and Verizon Wireless and will this year pump billions into the economy. 
Within this world, the Apple Store is the undisputed king, a retail phenomenon renowned for impeccable design, deft service and spectacular revenues. Last year, the company's 327 global stores took in more money per square foot than any other United States retailer -- wireless or otherwise -- and almost double that of Tiffany, which was No. 2 on the list, according to the research firm RetailSails.
Worldwide, its stores sold $16 billion in merchandise.
But most of Apple's employees enjoyed little of that wealth. While consumers tend to think of Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., as the company's heart and soul, a majority of its workers in the United States are not engineers or executives with hefty salaries and bonuses but rather hourly wage earners selling iPhones and MacBooks.
About 30,000 of the 43,000 Apple employees in this country work in Apple Stores, as members of the service economy, and many of them earn about $25,000 a year. They work inside the world's fastest growing industry, for the most valuable company, run by one of the country's most richly compensated chief executives, Tim Cook. Last year, he received stock grants, which vest over a 10-year period, that at today's share price would be worth more than $570 million.
And though Apple is unparalleled as a retailer, when it comes to its lowliest workers, the company is a reflection of the technology industry as a whole.
The Internet and advances in computing have created untold millionaires, but most of the jobs created by technology giants are service sector positions -- sales employees and customer service representatives, repairmen and delivery drivers -- that offer little of Silicon Valley's riches or glamour.
Much of the debate about American unemployment has focused on why companies have moved factories overseas, but only 8 percent of the American work force is in manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job growth has for decades been led by service-related work, and any recovery with real legs, labor experts say, will be powered and sustained by this segment of the economy.
And as the service sector has grown, the definition of a career has been reframed for millions of American workers.
''In the service sector, companies provide a little bit of training and hope their employees leave after a few years,'' says Arne L. Kalleberg, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina. ''Especially now, given the number of college kids willing to work for low wages.''
By the standards of retailing, Apple offers above average pay -- well above the minimum wage of $7.25 and better than the Gap, though slightly less than Lululemon, the yoga and athletic apparel chain, where sales staff earn about $12 an hour. The company also offers very good benefits for a retailer, including health care, 401(k) contributions and the chance to buy company stock, as well as Apple products, at a discount.
But Apple is not selling polo shirts or yoga pants. Divide revenue by total number of employees and you find that last year, each Apple store employee -- that includes non-sales staff like technicians and people stocking shelves -- brought in $473,000.
''These are sales rates for a consulting company,'' said Horace Dediu, an analyst who blogged about the calculation on the site Asymco. Electronics and appliance stores typically post $206,000 in revenue per employee, according to the latest figures from the National Retail Federation.
Even Apple, it seems, has recently decided it needs to pay its workers more. Last week, four months after The New York Times first began inquiring about the wages of its store employees, the company started to inform some staff members that they would receive substantial raises. An Apple spokesman confirmed the raises but would not discuss their size, timing or impetus, nor who would earn them.
But Cory Moll, a salesman in the San Francisco flagship store and a vocal labor activist, said that on Tuesday he was given a raise of $2.82 an hour, to $17.31, an increase of 19.5 percent and a big jump compared with the 49-cent raise he was given last year.
''My manager called me into his office and said, 'Apple wants to show that it cares about its workers, and show that it knows how much value you add to the company, by offering a bigger raise than in previous years,' '' Mr. Moll recalled.
Though a significant increase, Mr. Moll's new salary of about $36,000 puts him on the low side of the wage scale at the other large sellers of Apple products, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, both of which offer commissions to sales staff at their stores.
In other areas, Apple has been a leader. Stores in a variety of fields have adopted the company's retail techniques, like the use of roving credit-card swipers to minimize checkout lines, as well as the petting-zoo layout that encourages customers to test-drive products.
But Apple's success, it turns out, rests on a set of intangibles; foremost among them is a built-in fan base that ensures a steady supply of eager applicants and an employee culture that tries to turn every job into an exalted mission.
This is why Apple can do something unique in the annals of retailing: pay a modest hourly wage, and no commission, to employees who typically have college degrees and who at the highest performing levels can move as much as $3 million in goods a year.
''When you're working for Apple you feel like you're working for this greater good,'' says a former salesman who asked for anonymity because he didn't want to draw attention to himself. ''That's why they don't have a revolution on their hands.''
These true believers skew young, as anyone who has ever set foot in an Apple Store knows. And the relative youth of this work force helps explain why people are likely to judge the company by a different set of standards when it comes to wages, says Paul Osterman, a professor at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management.
''It's interesting to ask why we find it offensive that Wal-Mart pays a single mother $9 an hour, but we don't find it offensive that Apple pays a young man $12 an hour,'' Mr. Osterman said. ''For each company, the logic is the same -- there is a line of people eager to take the job. In effect, we're saying that our value judgments depend on the circumstances of the employee, not just supply and demand of the labor market.''
Twenty-two-year-olds also tend to be more tolerant of the Apple Store's noise and bustle, yet these days some former employees describe a work environment that was too hectic and stressful, thanks in large part to the runaway popularity of the iPhone and iPad.
Managers often tell new workers that they hope to get six years of service, former employees say. ''That was what we heard all the time,'' says Shane Garcia, a former Apple Store manager in Chicago. ''Six years.'' But the average tenure is two and a half years, says a person familiar with the company's retention numbers, and as foot traffic has increased, turnover rates in many stores have increased, too. Internal surveys at stores have also found surprising dissatisfaction levels, particularly among technicians, or ''geniuses'' in Apple's parlance, who work at what is called the Genius Bar. Apple declined requests for interviews for this article. Instead, the company issued a statement:
''Thousands of incredibly talented professionals work behind the Genius Bar and deliver the best customer service in the world. The annual retention rate for Geniuses is almost 90%, which is unheard-of in the retail industry, and shows how passionate they are about their customers and their careers at Apple.''
That 90 percent figure sounds accurate to Mr. Garcia, who quit last July after four years with the company, overwhelmed by the work and unable to mollify employees and customers alike. Plenty of technicians do, in fact, like their jobs, which vary around the country, and which pay in the range of $40,000 a year in the Chicago area. Many technicians, though, wanted to leave but were unable to find equivalent work, according to Mr. Garcia and other former managers, in part because of the weak economy.
The problem for Apple Store employees, they said, wasn't just the pace. It was the lack of upward mobility. There are only a handful of different jobs at Apple Stores and the most prestigious are invariably sought after by dozens of candidates. And a leap to the company headquarters is highly unusual.
Apple prohibits its staff from talking to the media, but several former employees who spoke for this article said they had fond memories of their jobs, and regarded them as ideal for people in their early 20s who aren't ready for a full-on dive into the white-collar world.
And ''Apple'' can be a strong credential to have on a resume, these people said. Technicians often move on to higher-paying jobs in information technology, they said, and sales staff have a leg up on the competition if they stay in retailing because ''people know how grueling the job is,'' as one former manager put it.
But other former employees have struggled to find work, or have moved into lateral jobs at other companies. And even those who used Apple as a launching pad described a gradual evolution, from team player to skeptic, as they discovered that there was a gap between what the job appeared to be (kind of hip) and what it was (frenetic and in many cases a dead end).
Kelly Jackson, who was a technician at an Apple Store in Chicago, was thrilled when she was hired two years ago. But she said she was even happier when she quit a year later, having found the work too relentless and the satisfactions too elusive.
''When somebody left, you'd be really excited for them,'' says Ms. Jackson, who now works at Groupon. ''It was sort of like, 'Congratulations. You've done what everyone here wants to do.' ''
Recruiting the Devoted
Skeptics outnumbered believers when Steven P. Jobs, then Apple's chief, pitched the Apple Store concept to his board in 2000. Ultimately, approval was given for just four stores.
Mr. Jobs hired a Target executive named Ron Johnson to help design and oversee the stores. He in turn hired eight people, one of whom was Denyelle Bruno, then an executive at Macy's West. When she was first approached, she said, she was told next to nothing about the work.
That did not daunt Ms. Bruno, now an executive at Peet's Coffee.
''I had grown up using Macs, and if it involved Apple and I could be involved,'' she said, ''it made me feel important.''
Ms. Bruno was one of the first hard-core Apple fans hired for the nascent chain. Many others would follow, and part of her job was to help recruit them. Initially, that involved walking into stores, including those operated by Sprint and AT&T, and scouting out promising employees.
Such solicitations were unnecessary after the first two stores opened, on May 19, 2001, in McLean, Va., and Glendale, Calif. Soon, so many people wanted to work at the stores that Mr. Johnson would compare applicants-to-openings ratios and boast that it was harder to land a job at an Apple Store than to get into Stanford, his alma mater.
Those applicants have for years submitted resumes through the company's site. The time-intensive part, former managers say, is finding the right people amid the pile, and the candidates of choice are affable and self-directed rather than tech-savvy. (The latter can be taught, is the theory, while the former is innate.) The vetting has not changed much. It often starts with an invitation to a seminar, held in a conference room at a hotel.
The culling begins before the seminar starts.
''They turn away people who are three minutes late,'' says Graham Marley, who attended his seminar in a hotel in Dedham, Mass., in 2009. ''My dream my whole life was to work for Apple and suddenly, you can,'' he said. ''You've always been an evangelist for Apple and now you can get paid for it.''
One manager said it was common for people offered jobs to burst into tears. But if the newly hired arrive as devotees, Apple's training course, which can range from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the job and locale, turns them into disciples.
Training commences with what is known as a ''warm welcome.'' As new employees enter the room, Apple managers and trainers give them a standing ovation. The clapping often bewilders the trainees, at least at first, but when the applause goes on for several lengthy minutes they eventually join in.
''My hands would sting from all the clapping,'' says Michael Dow, who trained Apple employees for years in Providence, R.I.
There is more role-playing at Core training, as it's known, this time with pointers on the elaborate etiquette of interacting with customers. One rule: ask for permission before touching anyone's iPhone.
''And we told trainees that the first thing they needed to do was acknowledge the problem, though don't promise you can fix the problem,'' said Shane Garcia, the one-time Chicago manager. ''If you can, let them know that you have felt some of the emotions they are feeling. But you have to be careful because you don't want to lie about that.''
The phrase that trainees hear time and again, which echoes once they arrive at the stores, is ''enriching people's lives.'' The idea is to instill in employees the notion that they are doing something far grander than just selling or fixing products. If there is a secret to Apple's sauce, this is it: the company ennobles employees. It understands that a lot of people will forgo money if they have a sense of higher purpose.
That empowerment is important because aspiring sales employees would clearly be better off working at one of the country's other big sellers of Apple products, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, if they were searching for a hefty paycheck. Both offer sales commissions.
''It's not at all common but there are sales agents at Verizon who earn six figures,'' says Jonathan Jarboe, who managed Verizon Wireless stores in Oklahoma until last summer. Several former Verizon Wireless managers said that annual pay ran from $35,000 up to $100,000 in rare cases, with the sweet spot in the $50,000 to $60,000 range.
At Apple, the decision not to offer commissions was made, Ms. Bruno said, before a store had opened. The idea was that such incentives would work against the company's primary goals -- finding customers the right products, rather than the most expensive ones, and establishing long-term rapport with the brand. Commissions, it was also thought, would foster employee competition, which would undermine camaraderie.
Tellingly, Apple doesn't use the word ''sales'' to describe members of its sales team. They're called ''specialists.''
By minimizing the profit motive among employees, Apple does more than just filter out people interested primarily in money. It also reduces the number of middle-aged and older people on the payroll, said former managers. This isn't about age discrimination, they said, so much as self-selection. Generally, an Apple employee is someone who can afford to live cheaply, is not bothered by the nonstop commotion of an Apple Store and is comfortable with technology.
People who fit that bill tend to be in their early or mid-20s, the former managers said. They typically don't have children and many don't have spouses, which means they are relatively inexpensive to cover with health insurance.
There is no shortage of college graduates eager to dedicate themselves to Apple's vision, on Apple's terms. That includes people like Asher Perlman, another former technician from a store in Chicago, who joined Apple three years ago, when he was 22.
''I'm happy with my time at Apple and where it landed me,'' says Mr. Perlman, who now works in information technology. ''I wouldn't recommend it for my 35-year-old friend with a kid, but it works for someone who is 22 years old and doesn't want to enter the business world yet.''
When Work Piles Up
The iPhone, which arrived in 2007, brought unprecedented crowds to Apple Stores. The company tried to hang on to its culture, but naturally it changed, and in many ways, say some former employees, for the worse.
Arthur Zarate, who joined Apple in 2004 and later worked as a technician at the store in Mission Viejo, Calif., says his training left him with a sense of ownership and pride. For a while, he loved the job, in large part because it delivered the simple and gratifying sense that he was helping people. There were time constraints on technicians -- 20 minutes per customer -- but because the store was rarely swamped, he usually had more time than that.
''My customers knew me by name,'' he said. ''That was a big deal.''
He had already begun to sour on the job when in 2007, he said, his store began an attendance system whereby employees accumulated a point for every day they did not come to work; anyone with four points in a 90-day period was at risk of termination.
''It was a perfectly good idea, but the thing that was terrible is that it didn't matter why you couldn't come to work,'' Mr. Zarate said. ''Even if you had a doctor document some medical condition, if you didn't come to work, you got a point.''
Mr. Zarate, a former heavy smoker, said he was once out for two and a half weeks with severe bronchitis and was on the verge of dismissal when he e-mailed Ron Johnson, then the retail chief, who intervened on his behalf.
''I just wrote and said, 'This isn't fair. They don't look at why you were out,' '' he recalls. ''And he saved my job.''
To meet the growing demand for the technicians, several former employees said their stores imposed new rules limiting on-the-spot repairs to 15 minutes for a computer-related problem, and 10 minutes for Apple's assortment of devices. If a solution took longer to find, which it frequently did, a pileup ensued and a scrum of customers would hover. It wasn't unusual for a genius to help three customers at once.
Because of the constant backlog, technicians often worked nonstop through their shift, instead of taking two allotted 15-minute breaks. In 2009, Matthew Bainer, a lawyer, filed a class action alleging that Apple was breaking California labor laws.
''State law mandates two 10-minute breaks a day,'' Mr. Bainer said. ''But geniuses had these lengthy queues of customers that made it all but impossible for them to stop even for a few minutes.''
The lawsuit was denied class certification in June of last year. Mr. Bainer pursued the matter in separate lawsuits and achieved what he described as ''very favorable settlements'' for 10 plaintiffs.
Not long after the class-action lawsuit was filed, a technician named Kevin Timmer who worked at the Woodland Mall store in Grand Rapids, Mich., noticed an added step when he logged onto a computer to punch out of work.
''This window popped up and it said something like, 'By clicking this box I acknowledge that I received all my breaks,' '' Mr. Timmer recalled. ''The rumor was that was because some guy in California had sued.''
Mr. Timmer said he and other technicians in the store clicked the box even when they didn't take any breaks. It wasn't because management insisted they stick around. It was that any down time would slam already overburdened colleagues with even more work.
''We were all in the trenches together,'' he said. ''Nobody wanted to leave.''
With time limits, several former employees said, came another change at their stores. Technicians had always been able to spend a few hours of their shift in the repair room, providing a little away-from-customers time. In many stores, that ended. Walk-in demand for tech help was so great that when the bar was open, management at these stores decreed, it was to be staffed by any technician in the building. Repairs that could not be done at the bar would wait. As a result, the late shift in the repair room at these stores ended not at 10 p.m., but at midnight.
The pressure didn't faze everyone. Multitasking, for instance, did not bother Asher Perlman.
''I'm a low stress kind of person to begin with and I didn't find it unmanageable,'' he said. ''I know others did.''
As the crowds grew, the company's ''thank you'' gestures started to seem a little tin-eared. Jordan Golson, who now blogs at MacRumors, a site that keeps tabs on all things Apple, said that for Christmas 2010, he and others at the store were given a fleece blanket and an insulated coffee thermos.
Mr. Zarate fared no better at one quarterly meeting for employees. Mr. Johnson made a videotaped appearance and referred to a wonderful surprise that managers were about to spring on everyone in the room. Free iPads for everyone was the expectation.''Then the lights went down, and we had a party in the store, with games and dancing,'' Mr. Zarate said. ''And we all got two tacos from a taco truck. That was our surprise. Two tacos.''
Rising to the Top
Like many who spoke for this article, Shane Garcia, the former Chicago manager, talked about Apple with a bittersweet mix of admiration and sadness. When he joined the company in 2007, he considered it a place, as he said, that ''wanted you to be the best you could be in life, not just in sales.''
Three years later, his work life seemed tense and thankless. He had little expectation that upper management would praise or even notice his efforts.
Sales employees, Mr. Garcia and others noted, deal with stresses all their own. Though commissions are not offered, many managers keep close tabs on sales of warranties, known as Apple Care, and One to One, which is personal tutoring for a fee. Employees often had goals for ''attachments'' as these add-ons are called -- 40 percent of certain products should include One to One, and 65 percent should include Apple Care.
For a sales employee who wanted to climb Apple's in-store ladder -- to technician or manager, for instance -- those numbers were important. And in terms of keeping employees invested and striving, so were the rungs on that ladder, something that is true across retailing.
''There was always something being dangled in terms of different positions,'' says Danielle Draper, a former manager at a store in Hingham, Mass. '''You'll need to do this if you want to become a creative,' that kind of thing. There was never perfection. You could always tell someone they needed to work on something.''
At some point, employees either realize they won't rise, or rise as high as they can.
''The disillusionment settles in not because of pay,'' says Graham Marley, the former part-time salesman, ''though pay is part of it. What happens is you realize that they want you to spend years there, but there is no actual career path.''
An exception is the job of manager, and Apple is often diligent about elevating from within its ranks of high achievers. Though not always. After the great influx that started with the iPhone, the company started plucking managers from stores like the Gap and Banana Republic. From employees who were around in the pre-2007 era, you can hear occasional laments about the gradual ''Gapification of Apple.''
In recent years, the level of unhappiness at some stores was captured by an employee satisfaction survey known in the company as NetPromoter for Our People. It's a variation of a questionnaire that Apple has long given to customers, and the key question asks employees to rate, on a scale of one to 10, ''How likely are you to recommend working at your Apple Retail Store to an interested friend or family member?'' Anyone who offers a nine or 10 is considered a ''promoter.'' Anyone who offers a seven or below is considered a ''detractor.''
Kevin Timmer said the internal survey results last year at the Grand Rapids store were loaded with fives and sixes.
''We discussed it in a monthly meeting and our manager had tears in her eyes,'' Mr. Timmer recalled. ''She said something about how humbling these results were, that they want to fix any problems, that her door is always open, and so on.''
Similar figures were found in Chicago.
''By then,'' Mr. Garcia said, ''it wasn't a surprise to upper management because it was clear that many geniuses wanted to leave. There was a ceiling. It wasn't a glass ceiling because everyone could see it.''
Mr. Garcia would eventually quit Apple, and walk away from a job that paid a little more than $40,000 a year, when stress-related health issues sidelined him long enough to put his job at risk. He had no doubts that the company would easily find a replacement.
''There was never a shortage of resumes,'' he said. ''People will always want to work for Apple.''

HEADLINE: Political Scientists Are Lousy Forecasters

BYLINE: By JACQUELINE STEVENS. 
A professor of political science at Northwestern University and the author, most recently, of ''States Without Nations: Citizenship for Mortals.''

 BODY:
DESPERATE ''Action Alerts'' land in my in-box. They're from the American Political Science Association and colleagues, many of whom fear grave ''threats'' to our discipline. As a defense, they've supplied ''talking points'' we can use to tell Congressional representatives that political science is a ''critical part of our national science agenda.''
Political scientists are defensive these days because in May the House passed an amendment to a bill eliminating National Science Foundation grants for political scientists. Soon the Senate may vote on similar legislation. Colleagues, especially those who have received N.S.F. grants, will loathe me for saying this, but just this once I'm sympathetic with the anti-intellectual Republicans behind this amendment. Why? The bill incited a national conversation about a subject that has troubled me for decades: the government -- disproportionately -- supports research that is amenable to statistical analyses and models even though everyone knows the clean equations mask messy realities that contrived data sets and assumptions don't, and can't, capture. 
It's an open secret in my discipline: in terms of accurate political predictions (the field's benchmark for what counts as science), my colleagues have failed spectacularly and wasted colossal amounts of time and money. The most obvious example may be political scientists' insistence, during the cold war, that the Soviet Union would persist as a nuclear threat to the United States. In 1993, in the journal International Security, for example, the cold war historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote that the demise of the Soviet Union was ''of such importance that no approach to the study of international relations claiming both foresight and competence should have failed to see it coming.'' And yet, he noted, ''None actually did so.'' Careers were made, prizes awarded and millions of research dollars distributed to international relations experts, even though Nancy Reagan's astrologer may have had superior forecasting skills.
Political prognosticators fare just as poorly on domestic politics. In a peer-reviewed journal, the political scientist Morris P. Fiorina wrote that ''we seem to have settled into a persistent pattern of divided government'' -- of Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses. Professor Fiorina's ideas, which synced nicely with the conventional wisdom at the time, appeared in an article in 1992 -- just before the Democrat Bill Clinton's presidential victory and the Republican 1994 takeover of the House.
Alas, little has changed. Did any prominent N.S.F.-financed researchers predict that an organization like Al Qaeda would change global and domestic politics for at least a generation? Nope. Or that the Arab Spring would overthrow leaders in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia? No, again. What about proposals for research into questions that might favor Democratic politics and that political scientists seeking N.S.F. financing do not ask -- perhaps, one colleague suggests, because N.S.F. program officers discourage them? Why are my colleagues kowtowing to Congress for research money that comes with ideological strings attached?
The political scientist Ted Hopf wrote in a 1993 article that experts failed to anticipate the Soviet Union's collapse largely because the military establishment played such a big role in setting the government's financing priorities. ''Directed by this logic of the cold war, research dollars flowed from private foundations, government agencies and military individual bureaucracies.'' Now, nearly 20 years later, the A.P.S.A. Web site trumpets my colleagues' collaboration with the government, ''most notably in the area of defense,'' as a reason to retain political science N.S.F. financing.
Many of today's peer-reviewed studies offer trivial confirmations of the obvious and policy documents filled with egregious, dangerous errors. My colleagues now point to research by the political scientists and N.S.F. grant recipients James D. Fearon and David D. Laitin that claims that civil wars result from weak states, and are not caused by ethnic grievances. Numerous scholars have, however, convincingly criticized Professors Fearon and Laitin's work. In 2011 Lars-Erik Cederman, Nils B. Weidmann and Kristian Skrede Gleditsch wrote in the American Political Science Review that ''rejecting 'messy' factors, like grievances and inequalities,'' which are hard to quantify, ''may lead to more elegant models that can be more easily tested, but the fact remains that some of the most intractable and damaging conflict processes in the contemporary world, including Sudan and the former Yugoslavia, are largely about political and economic injustice,'' an observation that policy makers could glean from a subscription to this newspaper and that nonetheless is more astute than the insights offered by Professors Fearon and Laitin.
How do we know that these examples aren't atypical cherries picked by a political theorist munching sour grapes? Because in the 1980s, the political psychologist Philip E. Tetlock began systematically quizzing 284 political experts -- most of whom were political science Ph.D.'s -- on dozens of basic questions, like whether a country would go to war, leave NATO or change its boundaries or a political leader would remain in office. His book ''Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?'' won the A.P.S.A.'s prize for the best book published on government, politics or international affairs.
Professor Tetlock's main finding? Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes would have done almost as well as the experts.
These results wouldn't surprise the guru of the scientific method, Karl Popper, whose 1934 book ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' remains the cornerstone of the scientific method. Yet Mr. Popper himself scoffed at the pretensions of the social sciences: ''Long-term prophecies can be derived from scientific conditional predictions only if they apply to systems which can be described as well-isolated, stationary, and recurrent. These systems are very rare in nature; and modern society is not one of them.''
Government can -- and should -- assist political scientists, especially those who use history and theory to explain shifting political contexts, challenge our intuitions and help us see beyond daily newspaper headlines. Research aimed at political prediction is doomed to fail. At least if the idea is to predict more accurately than a dart-throwing chimp.
To shield research from disciplinary biases of the moment, the government should finance scholars through a lottery: anyone with a political science Ph.D. and a defensible budget could apply for grants at different financing levels. And of course government needs to finance graduate student studies and thorough demographic, political and economic data collection. I look forward to seeing what happens to my discipline and politics more generally once we stop mistaking probability studies and statistical significance for knowledge.

HEADLINE: In Paraguay, Democracy's All-Too-Speedy Trial

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Horta Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Emily Schmall from Buenos Aires.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- In the span of a few hours on Friday, Paraguay's Senate convened its members, read a list of accusations and put President Fernando Lugo on trial. Dismissing his request for more time to mount his defense, the senators abruptly voted to oust him from office, spurring a fierce debate across Latin America over the fragility of democratic institutions in a region with a long history of dictatorships.
And late Saturday, both Brazil and Argentina, which wield considerable economic influence in Paraguay, said they were withdrawing their ambassadors to Asuncion because of the action against Mr. Lugo. 
The Senate's rush to remove Mr. Lugo, who accepted the vote's outcome and was quickly replaced by Vice President Federico Franco, was even more confounding since the next presidential elections in Paraguay are just nine months away. Various regional leaders, including Presidents Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, denounced the ouster as a coup d'etat.
Various takes on that assertion quickly surfaced around the region, including descriptions of the ouster as a ''parliamentary coup,'' a ''constitutional coup,'' even a ''golpeachment,'' merging the Portuguese terms for ''coup'' and ''impeachment,'' which spread throughout social networks in Brazil.
''In this era of globalization, it appears that even impeachment proceedings, which should be measured and deliberate given what is at stake, have become accelerated,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research institute. ''The Congress may have acted in accordance with the Constitution, but this is a setback for democracy nonetheless.''
In some ways, the way in which Mr. Lugo, 61, was ousted says a great deal about Paraguay itself. His election in 2008 ended six decades of one-party rule, the first time in the country's history that a president from one party peacefully transferred power to another. Allowing him to finish a five-year term, however, proved to be a bridge too far.
Mr. Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop who won initial popularity as an advocate for Paraguay's peasants, always faced resistance from the country's deeply conservative political establishment. Moreover, Paraguay's Constitution incorporates vigorous checks on executive power, reflecting distrust of strong leaders after the long dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner.
The president needs cooperation from Congress for key decisions, including naming members of the Supreme Court and directors of the big hydroelectric dams, Itaipu and Yacyreta. For practical purposes, Mr. Lugo was hobbled throughout much of his presidency, emasculated by legislators and eviscerated in the country's media.
His inability to resolve Paraguay's disparity in landholdings, among the nation's most pressing social issues, was exemplified in a clash this month between the police and squatters that left 17 dead. Mr. Lugo's opponents in Congress used that violence as a pretext to accuse him of malfeasance, leading to an impeachment vote in the Chamber of Deputies and his trial in the Senate.
''The process in which Lugo was removed may not have looked fair, but it was entirely legal,'' said Alberto Poletti, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia University in Paraguay.
It was the appearance of unfairness, however, that drew attention abroad. The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, a legal entity of the Organization on American States, summarized regionwide sentiment, describing the ouster in a statement as a ''parody of justice.''
''The institutions have been used exactly for something which they were not designed,'' said Adolfo Salgueiro, a professor of international law in Venezuela and an opponent of Mr. Chavez.
In Paraguay, Mr. Lugo eased tension by accepting the Senate vote and quickly moving out of Mburuvicha Roga, as the presidential residence is called. And the way in which he was ousted stood in contrast to the 2009 removal in Honduras of President Manuel Zelaya, who was detained by the armed forces and flown to exile in Costa Rica.
Still, Mr. Franco, Paraguay's new president, acknowledged in comments to reporters in Asuncion that Mr. Lugo's ouster was a ''little fast.'' He also recognized that landlocked Paraguay risked political isolation in the region, and perhaps even expulsion from regional blocs like Mercosur and Unasur, and asked leaders to ''understand'' the ouster.
While condemnations of the move have been vociferous from leftist countries like Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela, much of Paraguay's engagement with the region will depend on how Brazil proceeds. Brazil, at the urging of President Dilma Rousseff, organized a diplomatic mission of Unasur last week to Asuncion, where foreign ministers met with Mr. Lugo and Mr. Franco. Once there, the group issued a statement contending that it viewed the move to oust Mr. Lugo as a threat to ''democratic order.''
The stamp of legitimacy for Mr. Lugo's ouster may prove elusive for Paraguay's new leaders, a reminder that the consolidation of democracy in parts of Latin America has a long way to go, especially in Paraguay, where a drought and falling demand for commodities are expected to result in a sharp economic contraction this year.
And while Mr. Lugo's opponents may feel like they are putting the country on more stable footing by ousting him in such an expedited fashion, the country's social problems, especially its unequal land distribution and poverty, continue to fester.
Then there is the precedent that this ouster creates. ''Any change of government that's not done through an election creates uncertainty,'' said Pablo Lavigne, a risk analyst at Datarisk, a consulting firm in Argentina.

HEADLINE: Taking a Stand

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
A SUCCESSFUL condominium depends, in large part, on owners' paying their monthly fees promptly and in full. Delinquencies can mean less money for maintenance and amenities -- and draw the ill will of fellow residents. While the sheer size of larger buildings can often blunt their impact on the budget, small buildings with a high number of delinquencies can be toxic for buyers and a millstone for sellers.
Now, with New York's economy seemingly recovering, condominium boards are growing more aggressive in cracking down on delinquent owners, according to brokers, lawyers and board members.
Some are publicly shaming deadbeats by posting their names on hallway bulletin boards or barring them from facilities like health clubs and concierge services. Others are reflexively filing liens against owners who are more than 60 days in arrears. And boards are writing requirements into their bylaws to provide additional protections. 
According to data from PropertyShark, in the first quarter of 2011 through the first quarter of 2012, condo boards in Manhattan started 111 foreclosure proceedings against owners for common-charge delinquencies, the most since January 2007, when the company first began tracking the information. The median lien amount in the first quarter of this year was more than $16,500, also the highest figure since 2007.
Alexandro Padres has sat on the board of his building, 184 Thompson Street in Greenwich Village, for five years. Since it was converted to condominiums in 2007, the building has battled owners who fell behind with their monthly common charges and has even navigated the labyrinthine process of a bank foreclosure.
''We have had a lot of experience with this,'' said Mr. Padres, 38, a corporate lawyer who became president of the board in 2010, ''and we are adopting a zero-tolerance policy. You can't have situations where an owner is delinquent for six or seven months and just says that they forgot to pay, even though they were being sent monthly notifications. It just isn't believable.''
To ensure payment, the building uses a number of strategies, including a 10-day grace period, after which a letter is sent to the owner. If there is no response, the property manager sends a second letter and refers the matter to the building's lawyer. If there is still no response, the building files a lien against the unit.
Boards are becoming more proactive for a number of reasons: an improving real estate market means there is a greater likelihood that delinquent owners can sell their units for enough to repay the condominium; a proactive approach fits with condominiums' increasing stringency on buyers' financials; and finally, after enduring the downturn for several years, boards are growing impatient with owners who are in arrears.
''When the market was soft and there were serious problems,'' said Stuart M. Saft, a chairman of the New York real estate practice at the law firm Holland & Knight, ''no one wanted to go through the foreclosure process because it was expensive, time-consuming, and at the end, they might not be able to sell the apartment.''
Most buildings would still rather file a lien, a relatively quick and inexpensive process. When a lien is placed on an apartment, it makes it difficult for the owner to sell, since the buyer will want the lien satisfied before closing. Also, banks are often unwilling to refinance a mortgage or provide a new loan to the owner until the lien is removed.
At the same time, condominiums have begun employing other, nonlitigious tactics to persuade the delinquent owner to pay up. This can include barring the owner -- or the owner's tenant, if the unit is being rented -- from using nonessential services in the building like the health club or the pool. Doormen may be required to stop accepting packages and deliveries. Some buildings even resort to public humiliation by posting names in common areas.
''A number of our buildings, especially those with high-level amenities, are now passing house rules that revoke the privileges of owners or their tenants who are in default for more than 60 or 90 days,'' said Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages more than 500 buildings in New York City.
One complex, Zeckendorf Towers at 1 Irving Place, recently instituted a rule that prohibits a tenant from paying the unit owner advance rent, so that if the owner becomes delinquent it will be able to collect directly from the tenant.
''Now, in the event the owner doesn't keep up with the common charges, this gives the board the ability to go directly to the tenant and have them pay us,'' said Lynda Deppe, a senior vice president of City Connections Realty and a resident broker at Zeckendorf Towers. ''If they had already paid their rent, we wouldn't have that leverage.''
Other options include working with the owner to create a payment plan, or persuading the owner to sell the unit and use the proceeds to pay outstanding common charges. Even if there is not enough money left to repay the condominium, a sale frees up the apartment for another buyer, who will pay common charges.
If all else fails, boards can pursue foreclosure. But the process can take a year or more, during which the unit is still not generating the common-charge payment. In addition, the owner may also have defaulted on his mortgage, so the bank may be pursuing its own foreclosure action. When there are competing claims, the bank takes precedence. Back taxes, too, take precedence over claims from a condominium.
''Unless a foreclosure sale brings in far more than the mortgage, our claims are wiped out,'' said Jesse Krasnow, a member of the condominium board at the Ansonia at 2109 Broadway. Mr. Krasnow is also a partner of the building's sponsor and the president of Sirius, the Ansonia's building manager. ''Add to this the fact that bank foreclosures drag on for years, and at the end of it all, the condominium can be out a tremendous amount of money.''
At 184 Thompson Street last year, a unit sold at a foreclosure auction for $610,000, which did not cover its $780,000-plus mortgage. ''We saw no proceeds from the sale,'' Mr. Padres said.
A second option is to sue the unit owner for a money judgment. But, said Richard Sharan, a partner at the law firm Pollack & Sharan, ''if a unit owner is in arrears on his common charges, he probably doesn't have much money to collect.''
Money judgments are good for 20 years in New York, however, and can negatively affect an owner's credit. They can result in eventual payment to the condo if the owner's other properties are sold or refinanced, said Steven R. Wagner, a partner at the law firm Wagner Davis.
It is easier for boards in co-op buildings to recoup maintenance fees, because they can terminate a shareholder's proprietary lease and force the sale of the unit. Also, the co-op takes precedence over a bank in the case of a bank loan default, and is paid back first.
Yet while a co-op has a greater chance of collecting, ''it still requires hiring a lawyer and commencing legal proceedings, which can cost money and take time,'' said Eva Talel, a partner in the real estate group at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. ''The building ends up not getting maintenance for the unit over a long period of time and has to spend money it probably hasn't budgeted for.''
When Jack Cassaro, an information technology director at a Wall Street firm, was trying to buy a one-bedroom co-op at 160 East 26th Street in Kips Bay, the board refused to interview him until the seller, who was thousands of dollars in arrears, sent a letter stating that all back maintenance, late fees and legal expenses would be paid in full at the closing.
''It was a nightmare,'' Mr. Cassaro said.
In addition, the board required that Mr. Cassaro put six months of maintenance payments in an escrow account until he moved into the unit.
His broker, Elizabeth Kee of CORE, said, ''This was supposed to be a cash deal that closed in 10 days, but it turned into a seven-month-plus process.''
But although co-ops and condominiums can face an uphill battle in collecting monthly fees that have gone into arrears, the overall impact on the building often depends on its size. At large buildings where hundreds of apartments share the burden of paying the fees, a handful of delinquencies can have a muted effect.
Not surprisingly, the buildings in Manhattan that have started the most foreclosure proceedings since the start of 2007, when PropertyShark began tracking them, generally have hundreds of units. They include Worldwide Plaza at 350 West 50th Street, with 14 filings; Trump World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza, 12 filings; and the Ansonia at 2109 Broadway, 8 filings. Trump Tower at 721 Fifth Avenue rounded out the Top 10, with 6 filings over the past 5 years, according to PropertyShark.
At Trump World Tower, for instance, the building is contending with a unit in a bank foreclosure; over the past five years, it has initiated its own foreclosure filings against a dozen others. But with 370 apartments, ''it is still less than 2 percent of the building that is in trouble,'' said Michael Cohen, the treasurer of the condominium board and a special counsel to Donald J. Trump.
''We build in a 5 percent cushion annually into our budget that allows us to handle these unfortunate situations,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding the building had $2 million in its reserve account.
Still, while size can often cushion the effects of a delinquency on a building's overall health, the issue is becoming more urgent for buildings across the board. ''I am increasingly seeing apartments in better buildings that are issuing notices or instituting foreclosure proceedings,'' said Mr. Wagner, the lawyer. ''It is something that is on everyone's mind.''
PAY UP
CONDO boards have a few options when an owner stops paying his monthly charges. Unfortunately, the most effective remedies are often the most expensive and time-consuming -- and while a legal procedure like a foreclosure drags on, the unpaid bills continue to pile up. Legal experts recommend the following steps:
POLITE BUT FIRM Start off with a letter requesting payment if it is 30 days past due. Then follow up, if the money is not forthcoming, with a more strongly worded letter, perhaps from the building's lawyer. The board could offer to work out a payment plan.
THIS IS SERIOUS If the bill still isn't paid, the board can file a common-charge lien on the unit. At this point, the owner's access to amenities or doorman services could be suspended. In rare cases, the board could offer to buy the unit.
THE GLOVES ARE OFF If all else fails, the board can sue for monetary damages or start a foreclosure filing. (Of course, the owner's bank may already have done this.)

HEADLINE: The Road to the Ironman

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG. 
Jacques Steinberg is the author of ''You Are an Ironman: How Six Weekend Warriors Chased Their Dream of Finishing the World's Toughest Triathlon.''

 BODY:
GUY ADAMI has experienced the thrill of trading millions of dollars in precious metals in a matter of seconds on Wall Street in the 1990s, and analyzing the financial crisis each afternoon as a panelist on the live CNBC program ''Fast Money.''
But he says none of those experiences compare with the rush he felt on a sun-dappled Sunday morning in late May in Red Bank, N.J., when he crossed the finish line of his first triathlon. It was at a so-called sprint distance -- a half-mile swim, followed by a 13-mile bike ride and then a 3.2-mile run -- which Mr. Adami, 48, completed in just under two hours, finishing 116th in a field of 160.
Just signing up for that race was no small accomplishment for Mr. Adami, who, not six months earlier, had been leading the sedentary existence of a trader and carrying a flabby 235 pounds on his 6-foot-3 frame. But as a volunteer placed a medal around his neck, Mr. Adami had little time to celebrate. A far more daunting challenge loomed: on Aug. 11, he will join nearly 3,000 other weekend warriors as they seek to endure, and complete, the first Ironman-distance triathlon to be staged in the New York metropolitan region. 
To put the magnitude of that 140.6-mile race in perspective, consider this. It will begin at 7 a.m. with a 2.4-mile swim in the Hudson River -- the open-water equivalent of about 170 lengths in a 25-yard swimming pool, or nearly five times the distance Mr. Adami completed in that New Jersey sprint.
Those participants who manage to complete that swim in 2 hours 20 minutes or less will move on to the bicycle portion -- 112 miles in two loops along the deceptively hilly Palisades Interstate Parkway, or the rough equivalent of pedaling from Manhattan to Hartford.
Riders who finish the bike ride before 5:30 p.m. -- or 10 1/2 hours after their odyssey begins -- will embark on a 26.2-mile marathon, which will begin in Palisades Interstate Park on the New Jersey side of the Hudson and continue for several loops before concluding with a brisk run (or perhaps a staggering walk, which the rules permit) across the George Washington Bridge and into Riverside Park on the West Side of Manhattan.
Participants will have until midnight -- 17 hours after their journey begins -- to cross the finish line, or face disqualification. If they manage to prevail, they will hear Mike Reilly, the Vin Scully of the Ironman world, who has called more than 100 such races around the world, announce their name and hometown, followed by four precious words: ''YOU are an Ironman!'' (Women hear the same thing.)
''People say it's one of the best moments of your life,'' Mr. Adami said, ''and I'm hoping to experience it.''
Full-distance Ironman races -- all modeled on the original Ironman race in Hawaii, in which 15 men competed in 1978 -- have become a franchise of sorts over the past two decades.
More than 140,000 people will compete in an Ironman-branded race this year, including international competitions and races known as ''Ironman 70.3,'' at half the full distance. The number of participants has nearly doubled in the past six years, according to the Ironman organization, the World Triathlon Corporation, which was bought from its previous owner, a Florida eye doctor, in 2008 by Providence Equity Partners, a firm that manages more than $20 billion. (The purchase price was not disclosed.)
The New York-area race, officially known as the Ironman U.S. Championship, will be one of 11 such races in the United States this year. The competition's debut in the nation's biggest media market is akin to a musical's opening on Broadway after carefully honing its act on the road. The American cities that Ironman typically plays each year include much smaller sites, like Lake Placid, N.Y.; Tempe, Ariz.; Louisville, Ky.; Panama City, Fla., and St. George, Utah.
Little wonder, then, that when it was announced, all 3,000 spots sold out in less than 10 minutes, more than a year before the starter's cannon would sound. Each entrant paid a fee of at least $895, nonrefundable.
Why would a seemingly reasonable man like Mr. Adami want to spend the better part of six months training, and then as many as 17 continuous hours swimming, biking and running, all in a race so grueling that it has killed at least five participants in the past decade?
While no two people race for precisely the same reasons, Mr. Adami shares many of the characteristics of his fellow would-be Ironmen, nearly half of whom are women.
He is, for example, squarely in the age spectrum for a midlife crisis -- or, at the least, a midlife challenge. Most men and women who embark on an Ironman for the first time are in their 30s or 40s. Like many would-be Ironmen, Mr. Adami once considered himself an athlete -- in the mid-1970s, he played tight end and wide receiver on a state high school championship football team in Croton, N.Y. -- only to watch his level of physical fitness recede and the waistband on his suit pants steadily tighten.
A veteran of Wall Street, he is also fiercely competitive. ''Our industry attracts people that are always looking for challenges, and who always embrace risk,'' said Mr. Adami, whose off-camera job is as a managing director of Option Monster, an electronic brokerage firm. ''So much of being a trader is learning to deal with a level of suffering. Positions don't always go the right away. You have to endure a different kind of pain.''
He is also, admittedly, a little crazy, an armchair diagnosis that almost any Ironman aspirant who is being honest will acknowledge.
''The most interesting people I've ever met are people who society would deem a wee bit off,'' he said. ''I'm sure I get lumped into that category.''
WHILE some people have dreamed for years of doing an Ironman, Mr. Adami said he had never given the race much thought. For him, the seed was planted when John Korff, the founder of the New York-New Jersey Ironman, appeared last summer on ''Fast Money'' to talk about the August race and the excitement it was generating among those working on Wall Street.
Mr. Korff, an ultradistance runner who has raced up the 86 flights of the Empire State Building in less than 13 minutes and who founded the New York City Triathlon -- an Olympic-distance race -- in 2001, said he had been closely tracking Ironman's explosion in popularity. (The Olympic distance is about one-quarter of an Ironman's.)
He said it took him seven years to persuade the Ironman organization to bring its race to a city as big -- and as complicated and expensive -- as New York. He then had to wrangle the consent of a crazy-quilt of municipalities and agencies along the race's route, which is one reason it is being staged on a Saturday in August, when car traffic, if not the air temperature, is at a minimum.
''My own Ironman has been seven years,'' said Mr. Korff, who has never tried a triathlon at the 140.6-mile Ironman distance. ''Every step of the way was a challenge. Every challenge had subchallenges.''
Because of the costs involved, the entry fee here was nearly double that in any other American race. Not surprisingly, Mr. Korff estimates, perhaps one of every three of the participants in the coming race work on Wall Street or in related businesses.
Two days after Mr. Korff was on his program, Mr. Adami attended a meeting of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of New Jersey, whose board he had joined several months earlier at the request of a friend, John Hyland, the managing partner of a financial services firm in Morristown.
Mr. Adami knew that Mr. Hyland had done eight Ironman races since 2000, the most recent in Hawaii in 2008. Not long after that race, Mr. Hyland was given a diagnosis of a rare form of leukemia. He has been in remission for two years.
As Mr. Adami sat in his board meeting, Mr. Hyland at the table, he asked for the floor.
''For what it's worth, I just met the guys putting together the Ironman in New York City,'' he said. ''I bet they would furnish us with a few slots for Team in Training.'' Team in Training is the arm of the national Leukemia and Lymphoma Society that has raised over $1.2 billion for cancer research, specifically through endurance events.
At many Ironman races, as many as 10 percent of the entry slots are set aside for participants who are raising money for charity. They pay a higher entry fee, which at Ironman NY/NJ was $1,500.
Ironman triathletes raised over $50 million for charity through a matching gift program from 2000 to 2010. But that figure accounts for only the roughly 2 percent of participants who registered their efforts officially. Many others have done so quietly, often on behalf of a friend or family member with an illness.
At Mr. Adami's request, Mr. Korff awarded the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of New Jersey 10 slots.
Mr. Adami made clear that he had no intention of doing the race himself, especially since his exercise at the time consisted mostly of walking from his parking space to the front door of the CNBC studios in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
''I was not doing any cardio work whatsoever,'' he said. ''The gym? At best periodically. My wife works. I work. We have three kids we chase around.''
But then the leukemia society began to prod Mr. Adami not just to assemble a team, but also to compete himself. The sweetener? Mr. Hyland said that he would set forth a training plan for Mr. Adami, and race alongside him, his first Ironman since his cancer diagnosis. Also on their team: a highly decorated member of the Navy SEALs, a professional lacrosse player and the president of a commercial vacuuming service.
By early fall, the group's roster was set, as was its fund-raising target: $500,000 for blood-cancer research.
Now all Mr. Adami had to do was to get in Ironman shape.
THE path to every Ironman begins with an initial stroke, pedal or stride, each then laid atop the other many thousands of times. ''Left, right, repeat,'' as Bryan Reece, a financial services manager and three-time Ironman finisher from Dallas, likes to say.
And so it was that in early 2012, Mr. Adami began training in earnest. He started modestly, alternately swimming, biking or running on consecutive days, following a regimen fed to him by Mr. Hyland in daily phone calls and e-mails.
At least at the outset, that might entail a simple 15-minute jog on a treadmill or a 45-minute indoor ride on a road bicycle he had borrowed from Mr. Hyland, its frame immobilized in a stationary trainer. Mr. Adami would move the gears up and down, to simulate hills and flats.
While the cycling and running came relatively naturally to Mr. Adami, the swimming most certainly did not. For that training, he hired a coach, who helped him work on his endurance and his form in sessions several times a week in the pool at Drew University.
''I needed to get longer, if that makes sense, to slow it down and take fewer strokes,'' he said.
''So much of the swim comes down to being able to relax in the water,'' he added. ''I don't have panic attacks -- but I am anxious.''
By mid-May, Mr. Adami was swimming 72 lengths comfortably -- about a mile -- in a little over an hour. A month later, he had shaved at least 15 minutes off that time. At that pace, he would probably meet the Ironman cutoff of 2 hours 20 minutes on the 2.4-mile swim.
But an endurance swim in the Hudson River is far more perilous than leisurely laps in a university pool, where Mr. Adami is unlikely to be inadvertently punched, kicked or pushed under by the arms and legs that will be swirling around him at New York-New Jersey Ironman.
He has made similarly steady progress on the bike, which he has been riding in and around Morristown for nearly 50 miles on Sunday mornings, at an Ironman-worthy 16 miles an hour. At that rate, he would cover the 112-mile Ironman bike ride in seven hours, though he will be allowed as many as eight or more hours, depending on when he finishes the swim.
Several times a week, Mr. Adami has been running as many as 12 miles at a stretch, at a pace of about nine minutes a mile. Even allowing for the substantial amount of walking he plans to do on the Ironman marathon, he would seem to be in striking distance of finishing it, considering that he will have at least 6 1/2 hours for the marathon, allowing him an average pace of about 15 minutes each mile.
''It's a daily process,'' said Mr. Hyland, 45. ''He is thinking of it every day, Aug. 11, and what he has to do today.''
Led by Mr. Hyland and Mr. Adami, the Iron team is also closing in on its fund-raising goal. By June 20, its members had collectively raised more than $332,000 in donations, according to its Web site, Iron-team.com, including almost $65,000 at a cocktail party in Morristown in early June where Mr. Adami was the master of ceremonies.
Mr. Adami, meanwhile, has watched his waistline shrink to a 32 from a 38 over the past few months as his weight has dropped from 235 to 197, about what it was in high school.
''I am having trouble keeping my suit pants on,'' he confessed.
But Mr. Adami has still covered only about half the Ironman distance in a single pool session. He also has to build up his distance on the bike, to rides of about 100 miles by the end of July. He faces similar challenges increasing his run to the roughly 20 miles called for in Mr. Hyland's training plan, 6 miles shy of a marathon.
Every would-be Ironman knows to expect the unexpected in the weeks leading up to a race, usually in the form of a torn ligament or a blown tire on a training ride that might result in a scrape across the pavement. It is not unusual for as many as 20 percent of those who signed up for a competition to miss race day, whether as a result of injury or a middle-of-the-night realization of the magnitude of the task at hand.
Mr. Adami had his big scare on June 13, when he suddenly experienced excruciating back pain, which required a nighttime trip to the emergency room. The cause was kidney stones, which threatened to interrupt his training at a moment when he could little afford it.
By June 21, Mr. Adami was soldiering through the occasional stabs of pain, unwilling to veer from his steadily escalating training. He said that his doctors were unsure whether his exercise regimen had helped cause his condition, but that a failure to drink enough fluids might have contributed.
And yet, as he has been from the outset of his Ironman pursuit, Mr. Adami was undaunted.
''I have the utmost respect for this race, but I expect to finish,'' he said. ''I'm not going to not finish.''
And then, momentarily setting aside the rat-a-tat bravado familiar to his viewers on CNBC, he allowed: ''But I am terrified.''

HEADLINE: Reviving Real Estate Requires Collective Action

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
IMAGINE that you are watching an outdoor theater production while sitting on the grass. You have difficulty seeing, so you prop yourself up on your knees. Soon everyone behind you does the same. Eventually, most people are kneeling or standing, yet they are less comfortable than they were before and have no better view. Everyone should sit down, and everyone knows it, but no one does.
This is a collective action problem, a phenomenon that is, unfortunately, all too common. At the moment, the trouble in our real estate markets and the drag these markets are placing on our entire economy may be understood as a collective action problem. In a nutshell, mortgage lenders need to write down the amounts owed by individual homeowners -- that is, let everyone sit down and relax -- but the different stakeholders have been unable to reach an agreement, even if it is in their common interest. 
In the 1971 book ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups,'' the economist Mancur Olson argued that collective action problems are pervasive, plaguing nations and economic groups alike. ''Most groups cannot provide themselves with optimal amounts of a collective good,'' he said, because they cannot manage a ''selective incentive'' or arrange ''coercion or some reward.''
In the current real estate market, the relevant group is enormous and complex. It includes those who own first and second mortgages or home equity lines of credit or residential mortgage-backed securities or the various tranches of mortgage collateralized debt obligations or shares in banks and finance companies that in turn own mortgages. These people live all over the world and have no way of communicating with each other, let alone coming to an agreement to give homeowners a break.
My colleague Karl Case and I showed in 1996 that when the value of a home falls below the value of the mortgage debt -- when it is underwater -- a person is much more likely to default on the mortgage. And it is well known that in foreclosures, lenders lose so much on the legal costs and depressed market values of the homes that it would be in their interest to lower mortgage balances so the homeowners stay in place and don't default.
If such mortgage principal reductions could be applied on a large scale, there could be large neighborhood effects, raising a sense of optimism among homeowners and bolstering the value of all homes and, ultimately, the whole economy. But mortgage lenders in all their different forms lack a group strategy.
John Geanakoplos, a Yale economist, and Susan P. Koniak, a Boston University law professor, have proposed legislation that gives community-based, government-appointed trustees a central role. The trustees would have the authority to impose a write-down of mortgage principal that served the interests of mortgage issuers as a group, without having to prove that each and every one would be better off. But Congress has not acted on their idea. And so we are still lacking the authority to make everyone sit down.
ROBERT C. HOCKETT, a Cornell University law professor, has outlined another approach, which uses the principle of eminent domain, to solve this collective action problem. Eminent domain has been part of Western legal tradition for centuries. The principle allows governments to seize property, with fair compensation to owners, when a case can be made that such seizure serves the public interest.
Traditionally, we think of eminent domain law as applying to land and buildings. For example, a government can use eminent domain to seize real estate along a proposed new highway route so the highway can be built in a nice straight line. It would be absurd to expect the government to bargain with each property owner to buy a strip of land along the proposed highway route and to have to redirect the highway around a farm whose owner refused to sell. That is common sense.
But eminent domain law needn't be restricted to real estate. It could be applied to mortgages as well. Governments could seize underwater mortgages, paying investors fair market value for them. This is common sense too. The true fair market value for these mortgages is arguably far below their face value, given the likelihood of default, with its attendant costs.
Professor Hockett argues that a government, whether federal, state or local, can start doing just this right now, using large databases of information about mortgage pools and homeowner credit scores. After a market analysis, it seizes the mortgages. Then it can pay them off at fair value, or a little over that, with money from new investors, issuing new mortgages with smaller balances to the homeowners. Taxpayers are not involved, and no government deficit is incurred. Since homeowners are no longer underwater and have good credit, they are unlikely to default, so the new investors can expect to be repaid.
The original mortgage holders, the investors in the new mortgages, the homeowners and the nation as a whole will generally be better off. There will surely be some who may not agree, like the holdout farmer opposing the highway, but eminent domain ought to be able to push ahead anyway.
San Bernardino County in California is working with a private company, Mortgage Resolution Partners, on the possibility of putting such a plan into action. We must hope this effort succeeds. If it works, it can be replicated all over the country.
But first we have to realize that much of our economic suffering takes the form of a collective action problem. We have to stop the wishful thinking that the problem will solve itself through a spontaneous rally in home prices. We need to summon our resources to exercise the authority that allows collective action.
Professor Koniak says the solution to this problem has been so slow in coming for a simple reason: ''It's the will that's lacking! The will!''

HEADLINE: Lessons of Early Hardship

BYLINE: By STUART K. MATHIS. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Hattiesburg, Miss. When I was 5 years old my parents moved to Georgia, to begin new teaching jobs.
About five years later, my parents divorced; my mother struggled to raise my three siblings and me. We lived in public housing, and there wasn't much to go around. As soon as I could, I started baby-sitting for neighbors. I also raked leaves, cut grass and sold a newspaper called Grit door to door.
In high school I worked as a bag boy in a grocery store, and then took a job with a wholesale grocer. I went to the farmers market around 3 a.m. to buy produce. 
For college, I enrolled in the Air Force Academy in 1973. But I lost interest when I learned that my burst eardrum, from a childhood bicycle accident, ruled out becoming a fighter pilot. When I came home in 1974, I got a job at an office supply company, and started classes at Kennesaw Junior College (now a university) nearby.
I also worked at the Six Flags Corporation amusement park near Atlanta. One of my early jobs there was frying bacon all day -- and smelling like it afterward. I was making $1.80 an hour. To save money, I would drive my Econoline van the 50 miles from home to the park once a week and sleep in the van overnight. I worked my way up to assistant manager at age 19.
I received my associate's degree in 1976, then earned a bachelor's in business administration from the University of Georgia. Six Flags hired me in their finance department, where I worked while studying for a master's of business administration from Georgia State University, in Atlanta. A year after I graduated in 1982, I became the controller for the Six Flags park. Three years later, I was recruited by Domino's Pizza, whose founder, Tom Monaghan, turned out to be a great mentor.
I set up a new regional office in Baltimore, then moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., then to Dallas, then Los Angeles, then back to Ann Arbor. In 1992, I became executive vice president of franchise operations. While we were in Ann Arbor, my wife and I adopted two girls, 8 and 10. They are now 25 and 27, and part of a blended family with my current wife and her two children.
Domino's Pizza was sold to Bain Capital in 1998, and I stayed about eight months. It was clear that there were going to be changes in operational support to the franchisees, so I left and we moved to San Diego, where we had relatives. We decided to remodel, then sell, a house in the affluent Rancho Santa Fe community. Renovating was more difficult than I anticipated, and I wouldn't do it again.
When a former colleague called to say that Mail Boxes Etc., which the United Parcel Service would soon acquire, was recruiting, I was very interested. I began work in October 2001, heading a network of 70 area franchise owners with some 3,400 stores. The following October, I was promoted to president, overseeing the rebranding of our domestic stores from the name Mail Boxes Etc. to the U.P.S. Store.
To focus on the U.P.S. Store brand, we sold our international network of about 1,200 locations to an Italian company in 2009. We have grown to more than 4,700 franchise locations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, which offer shipping, packaging, online printing and other business services. We are also helping military veterans establish store franchises.
Giving people a chance is one of the lessons my mother instilled in me. We were on welfare, which in those days meant flour, sugar and dry milk handouts. Mom emphasized working hard and getting an education. She set the example by going to school at night and on the weekends to earn her advanced teaching degree -- to qualify for a raise to help support us.

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
TRAIN DREAMS, by Denis Johnson. (Picador, $12.) The taming of the American West is encompassed in Johnson's novella. Sent by train into the woods of the Idaho panhandle in the 1890s, his orphaned hero, Robert Grainier, works on logging gangs, falls in love and loses his wife and daughter to a devastating wildfire. ''What Johnson builds from the ashes of Grainier's life is a tender, lonesome and riveting story,'' Anthony Doerr wrote here.
MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD: ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and the Battle for America, by David S. Reynolds. (Norton, $17.95.) A decade after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1852) appeared, Abraham Lincoln is said to have received Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-96) at the White House with the greeting ''Is this the little woman who made this great war?'' Reynolds's account of the writing, reception and modern reputation of the novel celebrates its author as a writer who mobilized public opinion against slavery, widening the rift that led to the Civil War. 
THE LEFTOVERS, by Tom Perrotta. (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) The Leftovers in this absorbing novel are the survivors of a Rapture-like event that has whisked millions of people -- believers and nonbelievers alike -- off the face of the earth. Three years later, Perrotta's put-upon hero, the mayor of a suburban town, wants to help the healing process, even as his own family languishes in disarray. Our reviewer, Stephen King, called ''The Leftovers'' ''the best 'Twilight Zone' episode you never saw.''
THIS LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Family's Heartbreak, by Melissa Coleman. (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) In 1968, Coleman's parents moved to a 60-acre wood in coastal Maine, inspired by dreams of back-to-the-land self-sufficiency. Coleman spent her early years there, and this memoir presents her family's bucolic existence along with a sobering truth: their pursuit of a purer, simpler life came at a terrible price.
BRIGHT'S PASSAGE, by Josh Ritter. (Dial, $14.) In the songwriter's first novel, a darkly hilarious parable with sadness at its center, a West Virginia farm boy heeds voices he began hearing in the trenches of World War I.
IN THE GARDEN OF BEASTS: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin, by Erik Larson. (Broadway, $16.) Larson's vivid portrait of Berlin during the rise of the Third Reich centers on the trials of William E. Dodd, an academic historian appointed United States ambassador to Germany in 1933, and his flamboyant daughter, Martha, initially enthralled by the Nazi movement, then recruited by the Soviet secret police.
REAMDE, by Neal Stephenson. (Morrow/ HarperCollins, $18.99.) The heroes stalk their prey in a virtual online world, while they in turn are being stalked in real life in Stephenson's big, careening novel, filled with Russian gangsters, Chinese hackers, the F.B.I., the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and MI6.
AFGHANISTAN: A Cultural and Political History, by Thomas Barfield. (Princeton University, $16.95.) Weaving geography, economics and tribal structure, Barfield traces the struggles and the changing nature of political authority in Afghanistan, from the Mughal Empire in the 16th century to the resurgence of the Taliban today.

HEADLINE: Investors Muddle Through Mire of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IN Europe, the obsessive concern of policy makers shifted from Greece to Spain, with its ailing banks and brutally high bond yields. In China and in the United States, there were signs of economic slowdowns. And for investors nearly everywhere, it was difficult to muster much confidence.
So it seemed fitting that when two major banks last week appeared to settle on a single word that captured the prevailing mood, it was ''muddle'' -- as in ''A Colossal Muddle,'' the title of a new HSBC Global Research report that pays explicit homage to the economist John Maynard Keynes. 
As HSBC noted, in 1930, in words that seem strangely appropriate today, Keynes wrote: ''We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand. The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time -- perhaps a long time.' ''
Barclays used a similarly gloomy trope to describe the current situation in a report of its own, ''Global Outlook: A Stressful Muddling Through.''
Like HSBC, Barclays warned that while governments and central banks have been managing to stave off utter disaster, the prospects for a robust global economic recovery keep receding beyond the horizon.
As HSBC declared: ''European and U.S. debt problems are unresolved, and now emerging giants are slowing. The world's savers would rather buy Treasuries than goods, which is making matters worse.''
In the Barclays report, Larry Kantor, the firm's head of research, who is based in New York, said, ''Stress around the euro area has returned with a vengeance, and it has dominated financial markets.'' While policy makers will probably manage to avoid an outright catastrophe in the euro zone, he wrote, establishing a ''new, more robust euro framework''will take years. In the meantime, faced with problems in Europe and elsewhere around the world, investors are stuck. They must figure out ways of ''muddling through.''
To the consternation of some investors, Federal Reserve policy makers seem to be barely muddling through themselves. They decided last week to extend through the end of the year an unorthodox program of asset purchases that had been scheduled to end this month. The markets were underwhelmed.
Widely known as ''Operation Twist'' (the Fed, more prosaically, calls it ''the maturity extension program''), it involves exchanging shorter-term securities in the Fed's portfolio for longer-term ones purchased on the open market. The purpose is to bring down long-term rates even further, encouraging borrowing and helping to bolster the dormant housing market and other markets.
The $267 billion extension would preserve the Fed's dominant role in the bond market. It would maintain the approximately $44.5 billion monthly rate of purchases of longer-term securities in effect since Operation Twist started last September.
In itself, however, extending Operation Twist is not likely to have a major effect. Thomas Lam, an economist at the OSK-DMG Group in Singapore, estimated the extension would reduce yields on longer-term Treasuries by a small amount -- five to eight basis points, or 0.05 to 0.08 percent, compared with a net reduction of eight to 12 basis points for the original version of Operation Twist. With Treasuries already priced at extraordinarily high levels, resulting in historically low yields, this latest move is likely to have a marginal impact.
The markets had anticipated at least this level of Fed intervention -- some traders were betting on much more -- so the central bank's most important moves may have been symbolic. It issued a series of signals indicating that it stood ready to provide much more assistance if the current muddle worsened significantly. Perhaps most important, Mr. Lam noted, was the Fed's promise in a formal statement that it was ''prepared to take further action as appropriate'' if labor conditions in the United States deteriorated further.
With the unemployment rate at 8.2 percent, with more Americans than forecast filing claims for jobless benefits, and with soft economic data pouring in from many quarters, the Fed is monitoring conditions very closely, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said on Thursday.
The Fed downgraded its economic forecasts sharply, projecting the economy to grow 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent this year, a half-percentage point less than it had forecast only two months ago. Unemployment is likely to remain elevated for many months, it said.
With elections little more than four months away, these were grim projections for the Obama administration. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was ready to engage in a third round of large-scale asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, if needed.
Meanwhile, the election-year impasse over fiscal policy continues. Mr. Bernanke reiterated his warning that spending cuts and tax increases that are now scheduled to go into effect early next year create a ''fiscal cliff'' that could seriously damage the American economy. That issue is likely to loom much larger as the election nears.
THERE is little to cheer about overseas. Economic growth in China and India has been slowing, much of Europe is in a recession, and European leaders are struggling to contain the crisis in Spain -- and somehow repair the widening fractures in the European Union.
What are investors to do in this environment? In its report, HSBC counseled caution. ''From an asset allocation perspective we are currently shying away from risk,'' it said, and added: ''Right now we prefer U.S. Treasuries and gold. With governments, in Europe at least, focused on 'muddling-through,' any policy response is likely to avoid downside risks, rather than generate material growth.''
Barclays also acknowledged the need for caution. In the current environment, Mr. Kantor said, ''It is tempting to simply run for cover and avoid risk altogether.'' But because so many investors have already done that, seemingly safe assets, like Treasuries and German bonds, are richly priced. ''For investors who can tolerate the short-term volatility and who focus on medium- to long-term returns, it is wise not to veer too far from a neutral risk allocation,'' he wrote.
One way or another, investors need to find a way to muddle through.

HEADLINE: Old vs. Young

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
IN a partisan country locked in a polarizing campaign, there is no shortage of much discussed divisions: religious and secular, the 99 percent and the 1 percent, red America and blue America.
But you can make a strong case that one dividing line has actually received too little attention. It's the line between young and old.
Draw it at the age of 65, 50 or 40. Wherever the line is, the people on either side of it end up looking very different, both economically and politically. The generation gap may not be a pop culture staple, as it was in the 1960s, but it is probably wider than it has been at any time since then.
Throughout the 1980s and '90s, younger and older adults voted in largely similar ways, with a majority of each supporting the winner in every presidential election. Sometime around 2004, though, older voters began moving right, while younger voters shifted left. This year, polls suggest that Mitt Romneywill win a landslide among the over-65 crowd and that President Obama will do likewise among those under 40. 
Beyond political parties, the two have different views on many of the biggest questions before the country. The young not only favor gay marriage and school funding more strongly; they are also notably less religious, more positive toward immigrants, less hostile to Social Security cuts and military cuts and more optimistic about the country's future. They are both more open to change and more confident that life in the United States will remain good.
Their optimism is especially striking in the context of their economic troubles. Older Americans have obviously suffered in recent years, with many now fearing a significantly diminished retirement. But the economic slump of the last decade -- a mediocre expansion, followed by a terrible downturn -- has still taken a much higher toll on the young. Less established in their working lives, they have struggled to get hired and to hold on to jobs.
The wealth gap between households headed by someone over 65 and those headed by someone under 35 is wider than at any point since the Federal Reserve Board began keeping consistent data in 1989. The gap in homeownership is the largest since Census Bureau data began in 1982. The income gap is also at a recorded high; median inflation-adjusted income for households headed by people between 25 and 34 has dropped 11 percent in the last decade while remaining essentially unchanged for the 55-to-64 age group.
If there is a theme unifying these economic and political trends, in fact, it is that the young are generally losing out to the old. On a different subject, Warren E. Buffett, 81, has joked that there really is a class war in this country -- and that his class is winning it. He could say the same about a generational war.
Younger adults are faring worse in the private sector and, in large part because they have less political power, have a less generous safety net beneath them. Older Americans vote at higher rates and are better organized. There is no American Association of Non-Retired Persons. ''Pell grants,'' notes the political scientist Kay Lehman Schlozman, ''have never been called the third rail of American politics.''
Over all, more than 50 percent of federal benefits flow to the 13 percent of the population over 65. Some of these benefits come from Social Security, which many people pay for over the course of their working lives. But a large chunk comes through Medicare, and contrary to widespread perception, most Americans do not come close to paying for their own Medicare benefits through payroll taxes. Medicare, in addition to being the largest source of the country's projected budget deficits, is a transfer program from young to old.
Meanwhile, education spending -- the area that the young say should be cut the least, polls show -- is taking deep cuts. The young also want the government to take action to slow global warming; Congress shows no signs of doing so. Even on same-sex marriage, where public opinion is moving toward youthful opinion, all 31 states that have held referendums on the matter have voted against same-sex marriage.
Over the long term, obviously, the young have a distinct advantage: they're not going away. So one of the central questions for the future of American politics is whether today's 20- and 30-year-olds will hold on to many of the opinions they have today, a pattern that would be less surprising than glib cliches about aging and conservatism suggest. Until recently, as the presidential results from the 1970s through the 1990s make clear, Americans did not grow much more conservative as they aged.
And while today's young are not down-the-line liberal -- they favor private accounts for Social Security and have reservations about government actions to protect online privacy -- they certainly lean left.
No one knows exactly why, but there are some suspects. Having grown up surrounded by diversity, they are socially liberal, almost unconsciously so. Many of them also came of age in the (ultimately unpopular) George W. Bush presidency, or the (ultimately popular) Bill Clinton presidency, and pollsters at the Pew Research Center argue that the president during a generation's formative years casts a long shadow, for better or worse. Hammered by the economic downturn, young voters say they want government to play a significant role in the economy.
These attitudes create a challenge for the Republican Party that is arguably as big as its better known struggles for the votes of Latinos. ''We've got a generation of young people who are more socially liberal and more open to activist government,'' says Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew center, which has done some of the most extensive generational polling. ''They are quite distinct.''
Shortly after Mr. Bush won re-election in 2004, just when the age gap was emerging, his chief campaign strategist, Matthew Dowd, wrote a memo to other top Bush aides urging them not to assume that a new Republican majority was emerging. The exit polls, he wrote to Karl Rove and others, showed that younger voters had voted strongly Democratic, and those voters would be in the electorate for a long time to come.
''They don't think the Republican Party thinks like them,'' much as older voters feel alienated by what they see as today's immigrant-embracing, gay-friendly, activist-government Democratic Party, Mr. Dowd said last week. ''I don't expect these younger voters to wake up all of a sudden when they're 38 years old and say, 'I was for gay marriage before, but now I'm against it.' ''
Still, it would be mistake to assume that today's young are going to be Democrats for life. Many children of the 1960s, after all, grew up to be Ronald Reagan voters. The political landscape shifts over time. Frustrated by a weak economy and a government that disproportionately benefits the old, younger adults could become ever more reluctant to send tax dollars to Washington. The Republican Party could grow more libertarian and thus more in line with the social views of the young.
What seems clear is that the marketing gurus are finally right: today's young really are different. They view a boisterously diverse United States as a fact of life, and they view life as clearly better than it used to be. But they are also products of the longest economic slump in 70 years, and they would like a little help. They wish the country would devote more attention to its future, especially on education and the climate. They, of course, will have to live with that future.

 BODY:
SANDY SPRINGS, Ga.
IF your image of a city hall involves a venerable building, some Roman pillars and lots of public employees, the version offered by this Atlanta suburb of 94,000 residents is a bit of a shocker.
The entire operation is housed in a generic, one-story industrial park, along with a restaurant and a gym. And though the place has a large staff, none are on the public payroll. O.K., seven are, including the city manager. But unless you chance into one of them, the people you meet here work for private companies through a variety of contracts.
Applying for a business license? Speak to a woman with Severn Trent, a multinational company based in Coventry, England. Want to build a new deck on your house? Chat with an employee of the Collaborative, a consulting firm based in Boston. Need a word with people who oversee trash collection? That would be the URS Corporation, based in San Francisco.
Even the city's court, which is in session on this May afternoon, next to the revenue division, is handled by a private company, the Jacobs Engineering Group of Pasadena, Calif. The company's staff is in charge of all administrative work, though the judge, Lawrence Young, is essentially a legal temp, paid a flat rate of $100 an hour. 
''I think of it as being a baby judge,'' says Mr. Young, who spends most of his time drafting trusts as a lawyer in a private practice, ''because we don't have to deal with the terrible things that you find in Superior Court.''
With public employee unions under attack in states like Wisconsin, and with cities across the country looking to trim budgets, behold a town built almost entirely on a series of public-private partnerships -- a system that leaders around here refer to, simply, as ''the model.''
Cities have dabbled for years with privatization, but few have taken the idea as far as Sandy Springs. Since the day it incorporated, Dec. 1, 2005, it has handed off to private enterprise just about every service that can be evaluated through metrics and inked into a contract.
To grasp how unusual this is, consider what Sandy Springs does not have. It does not have a fleet of vehicles for road repair, or a yard where the fleet is parked. It does not have long-term debt. It has no pension obligations. It does not have a city hall, for that matter, if your idea of a city hall is a building owned by the city. Sandy Springs rents.
The town does have a conventional police force and fire department, in part because the insurance premiums for a private company providing those services were deemed prohibitively high. But its 911 dispatch center is operated by a private company, iXP, with headquarters in Cranbury, N.J.
''When it comes to public safety, outsourcing has always been viewed with a kind of suspicion,'' says Joseph Estey, who manages the Sandy Springs 911 service in a hushed gray room a few miles from city hall. ''What I think really tipped the balance here is that they were outsourcing just about everything else.''
Does the Sandy Springs approach work? It does for Sandy Springs, says the city manager, John F. McDonough, who points not only to the town's healthy balance sheet but also to high marks from residents on surveys about quality of life and quality of government services.
But that doesn't mean ''the model'' can be easily exported -- Sandy Springs has the built-in advantage that comes from wealth -- or that its widespread adoption would enhance the commonweal. Critics contend that the town is a white-flight suburb that has essentially seceded from Fulton County, a 70-mile-long stretch that includes many poor and largely African-American areas, most of them in Atlanta and points south.
The prospect of more Sandy Springs-style incorporations concerns people like Evan McKenzie, author of ''Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Government.'' He worries that rich enclaves may decide to become gated communities writ large, walling themselves off from areas that are economically distressed.
''You could get into a 'two Americas' scenario here,'' he says. ''If we allow the more affluent to institutionally isolate themselves, then the poor are supposed to do -- what? They're supposed to have all the poverty and all the social problems and deal with them?''
The champions of Sandy Springs counter that they still send plenty of tax dollars to the county and that race had nothing to do with the decision to incorporate. (The town's minority population is now 30 percent and growing, they note.) Leaders here say they had simply grown tired of the municipal service offered by Fulton County.
''We make no apologies for being more affluent than other parts of the metro area,'' says Eva Galambos, the mayor of Sandy Springs. And what does she make of the attitude of the town's detractors? ''Pure envy,'' she says.
NOTHING about Sandy Springs hints that it is one of the country's purest examples of a contract city. Even those city hall employees betray no sign that they work for a jumble of corporations. Drive around and you'll see a nondescript upscale suburb, where the most notable features are traffic lights that seem to take five minutes to turn green. There is no downtown, or at least anything that looks like a main street. Instead, there are strip malls with plenty of usual-suspect franchises -- although one strip mall, oddly enough, includes a small museum that tells the story of Anne Frank.
The town is home to offices of United Parcel Service, Hardee's and other corporations, and it also serves as a bedroom community for Atlanta. Residents include Herman Cain, members of the Atlanta Braves and the Atlanta Falcons, and executives at Delta Air Lines, CNN and other companies. This is also home to the rapper and producer Akon, whose opulent tastes were featured in an episode of ''Cribs'' on MTV.
''A few years ago, I got a call from his head of security,'' says Kenneth DeSimone, the deputy chief of police, who is giving a tour of the town one May afternoon. It turned out that somebody had stolen a pistol and a laptop from Akon's home.
''He seemed really focused on the laptop and I was looking around this guy's house thinking, 'What is the big deal with this laptop? He can afford another one.' Turns out, there was a bunch of new Lady Gaga demos on it. Worth millions.''
That crime was solved when an informant helped lead the police to some young people who, Mr. DeSimone said, had no idea whose home they had entered and what was stored on the computer.
The car driven by Mr. DeSimone says ''Sandy Springs'' on the side, which is one reason that this town can't claim to be the most outsourced city in the United States. That distinction probably belongs to Maywood, Calif., eight miles southeast of Los Angeles, which in 2010 fired all but one employee, its city manager. Maywood is now operated, from top to bottom, through contracts. The police officers are members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, paid a combined $3.5 million a year to patrol the streets, according to Felipe Aguirre, a council member.
But Maywood was pushed to extreme measures after it flirted with bankruptcy and lost insurance coverage for its public work force. Sandy Springs went the public-private partnership route by choice, and it evangelizes about its success.
Few have more zeal than Oliver W. Porter, a founding father and architect in chief.
With his gray beard and thick gray hair, Mr. Porter is a beatnik version of John Updike with a Southern drawl and a pipe. He is sitting one morning in a tiny room in his basement, which has a small desk, a chair and a psychiatrist's couch. A parachute is spread out along the ceiling, like a canopy, and a mural of an ancient Roman landscape -- Mr. Porter's handiwork -- adorns one wall.
This unassuming nook is where every element of Sandy Springs was conceived and designed. With the title of interim city manager, Mr. Porter drafted requests for proposals and fielded calls here, often from people who imagined him in charge of a small battalion of employees.
''One day a lady called and said: 'Oh, Mr. Porter, I didn't mean to interrupt you. May I speak to your staff?' '' he recalls. Reliving the moment, he picks up the phone, puts it to one ear and then switches to the other.
''Staff speaking,'' he told the caller, in a slightly deeper voice.
Mr. Porter, a retired AT&T engineer, was an advocate of the town when it was a hopeless cause, during the many years when Democrats blocked efforts to let a largely Republican and white suburb cleave itself from Fulton County. One Democratic legislator vowed that Sandy Springs would incorporate ''when pigs fly,'' a phrase that Mayor Galambos has since adopted as the name of her blog.
After an election in 2004, both houses of Georgia's legislature were controlled by Republicans for the first time since Reconstruction.
''It was like a dog that's been chasing a train for years and finally catches it,'' Mr. Porter says. ''The question was, What do I do with it now?''
As a fan of Ronald Reagan and the economist Friedrich Hayek, Mr. Porter came naturally to the notion that Sandy Springs could push ''the model'' to its nth degree. His philosophical inclinations were formed by a life spent in private enterprise, and cemented by a visit to Weston, Fla., a town that had begun as a series of gated communities.
Mr. Porter tells this and other stories in ''Creating the New City of Sandy Springs,'' a book that will leave readers with one indelible lesson: incorporating a city is dull. Superduper dull. The book is composed mostly of the codicils, requests for proposals and definitions of duties that were required to jolt Sandy Springs to life. Without a love of minutiae and a very long attention span, forget it. But this is intended as a blueprint, not a gripping narrative. Mr. Porter regards the success of Sandy Springs as a way out of the financial morass that has engulfed so many cities in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
''Many are on the verge of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Porter says. ''They have significant unfunded liabilities, like pensions and other benefits. It's almost like a poison that a lot of people are unaware of, and this model could be an answer.''
HOVERING around the debate about privatization is a basic question: What is local government for? For years, one answer, at least implicitly, was ''to provide steady jobs with good wages.'' But that answer is losing its political tenability, says John D. Donahue of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''A lot of jobs in government are middle-class jobs that in the private sector are not middle-class jobs,'' he says. ''People aren't willing to support conditions for public workers that they themselves no longer enjoy.''
In a way, what Sandy Springs and other newly incorporated towns have done harks back to a 19th-century notion of taxation, which was much less about cross-subsidies and much more about fee for service.
''It was normal from around 1830 through the end of the Civil War for cities to be run like businesses,'' says Mr. McKenzie, the ''Privatopia'' author. ''When people paid property taxes, it was to get something that benefited them directly -- like butchers wanting a certain area cleaned up.''
Sandy Springs residents still send roughly $190 million a year to Fulton County through property taxes, about half of which goes to schools, including those in Sandy Springs. But by incorporating, the town gets to keep $90 million in taxes a year to spend as it pleases.
Has this financially hurt the rest of Fulton County? It has, says the county manager, Zachary Williams, who calculates that the incorporation of Sandy Springs, and neighboring towns that incorporated after it, cost the county about $38 million a year. Mr. Williams described the figure as ''significant,'' especially given the strains imposed by the economic downturn.
''I would bet that Atlanta is top five in the country in terms of foreclosures,'' he says. ''I think our vacancy rate is 14 to 18 percent.''
Some Georgia politicians outside Sandy Springs regard it and other breakaway towns as ''the first shot in the battle to destroy Fulton County,'' as State Senator Vincent Fort, a Democrat whose district includes part of Atlanta, put it.
''What you have is the northern section of the county,'' he went on, ''which is mostly white, seeking to leave the rest of Fulton County, and doing so with what I think are racially tinged arguments about the corruption and inefficiency of local government.''
Town leaders say race had nothing to do with it. Mayor Galambos said, ''A 94 percent vote in favor of incorporation speaks to the broad community support for self-government and a desire to have local dollars remain local.''
BUT leave aside questions of fairness and race. Many cities that have dipped a toe or two into the privatization pool, and others that have plunged in, have had awful results. Recently, the company that has a contract to manage Chicago's parking meters sent the city a series of bills, totaling nearly $50 million, to make up for revenue lost from people with disability parking placards and from street closings. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has refused to pay.
New York City's comptroller released a report in late May that said that Hewlett-Packard, a major contractor in the city's emergency dispatch service, was paid $113 million for work considered subpar.
In Maywood, Calif., going private has driven up the cost of running the town, says Mr. Aguirre, the council member, and the quality of municipal service has gone down.
''Let's say a tree falls on a car,'' Mr. Aguirre says. ''Previously, we had an employee who would deal with it. Now, you have to make an appointment and they'll come out when they can. They're not our people to control any more.''
Mr. McDonough, the Sandy Springs city manager, says the town has sidestepped such problems. The key, he explains, lay in the fine art of drafting contracts.
Initially, and for the first five and a half years of its life, Sandy Springs used just one company, CH2M Hill, based in Englewood, Colo., to handle every service it delivered. Mr. McDonough says CH2M saved the town millions compared with the cost of hiring a conventional public work force, but last year Sandy Springs sliced the work into pieces and solicited competitive bids.
When the competition was over, the town had spread duties to a handful of corporations and total annual outlays dropped by $7 million. (Representatives of CH2M, which still has a call-center contract, said at the time that they were ''deeply disappointed'' by the results, but wished the city well, according to a local news report.)
To dissuade companies from raising prices or reducing the quality of service, the town awarded contracts to a couple of losing bidders for every winner it hired. The contracts do not come with any pay or any work -- unless the winning bidder that prevailed fails to deliver. It's a bit like the Miss America pageant anointing the runner-up as the one who will fulfill the winner's duties if, for some reason, Miss America cannot.
''In most cases, Miss America serves her whole term,'' Mr. McDonough says, warming to the analogy. ''But every once in a while something happens and they don't have to run a whole new competition.''
The privatized approach saves money, he continues, because corporations hire superior workers and give them better training. Work handled by 15 public employees can be done by 12 privately employed workers, he says: ''It's all about the caliber of employee and the customer focus that comes out of the private sector.''
During a tour of city hall, Mr. McDonough bumps into Kevin Walter, the deputy director of public works. Mr. Walker has good news. Currently, Sandy Springs pays for two people to operate two road maintenance trucks five days a week -- in effect, 10 days of work every two weeks. Well, Mr. Walker has just figured out a way to reduce the number to nine days every two weeks, saving $50,000 a year.
Does Mr. Walker, or rather his company, URS, get to keep a portion of that $50,000?
''No,'' Mr. Walker says. ''But I get to keep my job. Our job is to run all these projects and programs very efficiently.''
And your contract?
''It is renewed every year,'' Mr. Walker says.
''It can be renewed every year,'' Mr. McDonough clarifies.
''It can be renewed every year,'' says Mr. Walker, correcting himself.
Any anxiety that you will not be renewed?
''No,'' Mr. Walker says. He quickly reconsiders. ''A little bit,'' he says. ''Enough so that we do an excellent job. We know we can do an excellent job and we have faith in the city. And we know it would not be easy for them to change so we'd have to really mess up for them to change. But we're not going to mess up.''

HEADLINE: Up Close, but Doing No Harm

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WHITE-WATER rafting in Costa Rica. Riding an elephant in Thailand. Communing with indigenous people in Ecuador. Tour operators are marketing activities like these to travelers in search of ''authentic'' experiences, often using buzzwords like ''eco-friendly'' or ''sustainable.'' But how do you know which tour operators are truly responsible or simply exploitive?
''While tourism is a vital source of income for many developing countries, it can also result in pollution, deforestation, inefficient energy use and cultural exploitation,'' said Ronald Sanabria, vice president of sustainable tourism at the Rainforest Alliance, an environmental group based in New York. The best sustainable tourism businesses not only recycle, conserve water and energy, and use locally produced goods, they also hire local employees, support community projects and preserve cultural heritage.
If you are in the market for a sustainable vacation, look for operators, like the ones mentioned below, that have been certified or recommended by reputable organizations like the Rainforest Alliance, Sustainable Travel International or other third-party entities. 
And don't choose an outfitter based on price alone. ''Companies that focus on supporting environmental conservation, cultural heritage preservation and localized economic development typically have a higher overhead than those that don't support sustainable tourism outcomes,'' said Brian Mullis, chief executive of Sustainable Travel.
What follows is a list of travel experiences, their potential consequences, and outfitters that offer ways to enjoy the same or similar activities in a responsible fashion.
Riding Elephants in Thailand
CAUSES FOR CONCERN Camps, which typically offer elephant rides through the jungle, can be excellent places for visitors to learn about elephant conservation. But some elephants are mistreated, and training methods may be abusive. Elephants that look lethargic or repeatedly swing their heads can be indicators of mistreatment. And performing certain tricks, like balancing on two legs, is often a sign of cruel training, according to ElefantAsia, a nonprofit organization in Southeast Asia dedicated to the conservation and protection of the Asian elephant.
LOW-IMPACT OPTIONS The Elephant Camp at Anantara Golden Triangle Resort & Spa at the convergence of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos hosts the northern extension of the Thai Elephant Conservation Center, set up by the Thai government, under royal patronage. For two weeks each month, it lends its veterinarians to the government veterinary hospital in Lampang to offer free care to Thailand's captive elephants, which are mainly used in tourism. The resort also has a separate charity, the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, for abused elephants or those that cannot work. Guests can learn to ride and drive an elephant (included in the $950 starting rate) but don't expect the animals to perform tricks.
Intrepid Travel, an Australian-based tour operator, is offering a new Short Break itinerary in northern Thailand ($425 a person) that includes a visit to an elephant sanctuary where travelers can feed, bathe and learn about protecting the animals. ''We are also encouraging travelers to carefully consider whether taking an elephant ride is the best way to experience these amazing animals,'' said Darrell Wade, the company's chief executive. ''I'm not sure I'd be happy lugging around tourists on my back all day.''
Visiting Ecuadorean Communities
CAUSES FOR CONCERN Many visitors to Ecuador want to interact with indigenous people who have rich cultural traditions involving food, crafts and costumes. But tourism revenue and other benefits can easily elude local economies. Patronizing foreign-owned resorts and other hotels and tourism businesses that are importing goods, services and labor can also lead to loss of income for locals.
LOW-IMPACT OPTIONS Kapawi Ecolodge & Reserve in the southern Ecuadorean Amazon basin opened in 1996 as a partnership between Canodros, an Ecuadorean tourism company, and the Achuar people to develop an economically sustainable project that would help preserve the cultural and environmental riches of Ecuador's Amazon region. Canodros transferred the ownership of Kapawi to the Achuar in 2008. Rates start at $1,240 a person for three nights, including a contribution to the Achuar community.
The Napo Wildlife Center, where tourists can see monkeys, macaws and other jungle creatures while staying in eco-friendly cabanas (from $820 a person for a three nights), is owned and operated by the Kichwa Indians of the Anangu territory. Their land lies inside the Yasuni National Park.
Adventure Travel in Costa Rica
CAUSES FOR CONCERN Last year Costa Rica welcomed more than two million visitors, up about 30 percent from 2005. All those visitors leave a mark on the environment, whether from the growth in tourism infrastructure or something as seemingly benign as the repeated use of the same trails. Over time, these cumulative impacts may result in eroded landscapes and animal habitats, polluted waterways and less wildlife, notes the Rainforest Alliance in its ''Practical Guide to Good Practice for Tropical Forest-Based Tours.''
LOW-IMPACT OPTIONS On the Osa Peninsula near Corcovado National Park, Luna Lodge (from $195 a person a night), which hires locally and uses hydroelectric energy, participates in several conservation projects, including purchasing forested lands for wildlife protection. Wild Planet Adventures, which uses Luna Lodge and other eco-friendly bases for its 14-day, $4,398 Costa Rica Ultimate Wildlife Eco-tour, says it weighs every detail of the trip, from seeking out less-trodden rivers and trails to using refillable jugs of water so guests don't leave behind plastic bottles.
On its nine-day, $2,495 Adventures in Costa Rica trip, Mountain Travel Sobek uses local operators like Rios Tropicales, which is involved in several preservation projects. Power at its eco-lodge is generated by a small hydroelectric plant and waste is recycled or composted.
Philanthropic Travel in Africa
CAUSES FOR CONCERN Tours that include elements of volunteering or charity work have become popular in Africa and elsewhere, but misguided contributions can perpetuate dependency, according to the Center for the Responsible Travel, in Washington.
LOW-IMPACT OPTIONSAmericaShare, the nonprofit arm of Micato Safaris, has been working with the people of the Mukuru slum in Nairobi for 25 years, offering educational, medical and other programs. For every safari it sells (from $7,040 a person) Micato pays school fees for a child who would otherwise stay home. Guests may participate in AmericaShare projects during their safaris.
The San Francisco-based tour operator Geographic Expeditions works with Campi ya Kanzi, an ecolodge built in partnership with the local Maasai community of Kuku Group Ranch in Kenya. A $100-a-day conservation fee, paid by guests, helps compensate herders for livestock lost to predators and pays the salaries of local wildlife rangers who enforce anti-poaching regulations.

BYLINE: By JENEEN INTERLANDI

 BODY:
We were on something like the 15th round of rummy, and my father was winning decisively. He cracked a wide, toothy grin as he laid his cards on the table. ''That's 321 for BaBa, and 227 for String Bean,'' he said, tallying the ledger we were keeping on a piece of scrap paper.
Before he finished writing the numbers, he began a rapid succession of anecdotes about his first car. And his second. And his third. He reached for a magazine to show me the vintage Mustang he said he was planning to buy my mother for their 45th wedding anniversary, which, he reminded me, was just six months away. Then he began speaking Sicilian, instructing me to repeat after him: ''Napeladan mangia pane!'' (''People from Naples eat bread.'') ''Calabrese testa dura!'' (''People from Calabria have thick heads.'') My father has the most amazing blue eyes, and right then they were wide and eager, like an overexcited child's. He was rambling, and the inflections of his voice betrayed sheer manic joy. It was a mood completely incongruous with our setting. 
We were playing our card game at the Psychiatric Emergency Screening Services, or PESS, a small locked-down unit in the community hospital near my parents' apartment in Somerville, N.J. Harsh fluorescent lighting fell on cracked and faded yellow walls. A disheveled, rail-thin woman paced and wept in the room across the way. Down the hall, a police officer guarded locked double doors.
It was early December 2010. That August, my father, who was 69, became abruptly and deeply paranoid. Convinced that nameless people were trying to kill him, he slept no more than an hour or two a night and started drinking after five years of sobriety. When his suspicions grew to include his immediate family, he became violent and threatened suicide. At one point, he tried to jump out of the car as my mother was driving down the highway on the way to the doctor's office. On another day, he poured motor oil over her windshield as she was pulling out of the garage. More than once, he hit her. More than once, he threatened to burn the house down.
In rare moments of lucidity, he would cry and apologize, confessing that he was terrified. He didn't know what was happening to him. But we did. He was given a diagnosis of bipolar syndrome in 2005, during a similarly disturbing period. He rode out much of that episode in a state psychiatric hospital, and having him admitted again seemed the best way to keep him and my mother safe. His lucid moments would pass quickly. Once his switch flipped back to manic, he would refuse to even discuss the possibility that something was wrong, let alone consent to seeing a psychiatrist.
The police had been to the house a couple of times, but there was not much they could do. In order for them to take him to PESS, or for the psychiatric screeners at PESS to commit him involuntarily, he had to be an imminent danger to himself or others. Domestic violence and verbal threats met that standard, in theory. But in practice, it seemed to mean that he had to be standing on the ledge of a building, or holding a knife to someone's throat at the very moment the police arrived.
And so for weeks, we had been locked in a game of chicken: waiting for my father to do something clearly dangerous; praying like hell that it would not be his suicide or accidental death or the death of someone else. In the meantime, my mother had all but stopped sleeping and had started hiding the car keys and the checkbook. She would tiptoe around their one-bedroom apartment at night, waiting for him to doze off, then call my sister or me to unload her despair in a flurry of whispers.
Finally one December afternoon, he fell down in a neighborhood convenience store. The medics saw that he was disoriented. He thought the store owner was his son. He did not recognize my mother, who had rushed to the store when the owner called her at home. He said that he hurt all over and that people were trying to kill him. In the emergency room, he grew belligerent, shoving a doctor and nearly punching an orderly. That's when he was injected with Haldol and sent to PESS.
As dismal as the place was, I felt relieved to be there. Finally he would be forced to talk to a psychiatrist, who I was sure would see right away that he was manic and dangerous and needed help.
While we waited for the doctor to evaluate him, my father did what mental health professionals refer to as double-bookkeeping. He remembered most of what transpired earlier in the day but still believed he was in the hospital to have his pacemaker checked. Even as we laughed together, I knew what would come: the psychiatrist would ask him about his behavior, and my father would deny all the paranoia, delusions and violence. He would curse and yell and try to walk out of the room. When the police officer stopped him, he would become enraged. And when I confirmed for the doctor that he had indeed done these things, and that we, his family, were asking that he be hospitalized, he would stop calling me String Bean. He would stop speaking to me at all.
Until the late 19th century, mentally ill people were locked in prisons or left to wander the streets. Reformers, seeking a more humane response, created a vast system of state-run psychiatric hospitals. By the 1960s, however, the overcrowded, often disturbing conditions in those facilities had come to light. At the same time, new psychiatric medicines were being developed, all of which gave rise to a new reform effort. Deinstitutionalization, the systematic closure of state psychiatric hospitals, was codified by the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 and supported by patients' rights laws secured state by state. Chief among those laws were strict new standards: only people who posed an imminent danger to themselves or someone else could be committed to a psychiatric hospital or treated against their will. By treating the rest in the least-restrictive settings possible, the thinking went, we would protect the civil liberties of the mentally ill and hasten their recoveries. Surely community life was better for mental health than a cold, unfeeling institution.
But in the decades since, the sickest patients have begun turning up in jails and homeless shelters with a frequency that mirrors that of the late 1800s. ''We're protecting civil liberties at the expense of health and safety,'' says Doris A. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit group that lobbies for broader involuntary commitment standards. ''Deinstitutionalization has gone way too far.'' According to Fuller's group, there was one public psychiatric bed for every 300 Americans in 1955; by 2012, that number was one for every 7,000. That's less than a third of what is needed, the organization asserts. The recession has made matters worse: since late 2008, more than $1.5 billion has been cut from state mental health budgets across the country. In the past two years alone, 12 state hospitals with a total of nearly 4,000 beds have either closed or are in danger of closing.
Already patients in crisis can spend several days in an emergency room waiting for a psychiatric bed to become available. In New Jersey, it can take as long as five days; in Vermont -- where, as Bloomberg News recently reported, there are virtually no state psychiatric beds left -- severely mentally ill patients have been handcuffed to emergency-room beds. For lack of other options, many patients who clearly meet the imminent-danger standard are released. ''The lack of resources has triggered a devolution of the standard,'' says Robert Davison, executive director of the Mental Health Association of Essex County, a nonprofit group that connects patients to services in northern New Jersey. ''Twenty years ago, 'imminent danger' meant what most people think it means. But now there's this systemic push to divert people away from inpatient care, no matter how sick they are, because we know there's no place to send them.''
When I asked Davison for specific examples, he rattled several off the top of his head. A man who was convinced that aliens were on the roof and that bugs were coming out of the walls and who would not sit on furniture but only lie on the floor was not committable. Neither was the man who refused medication and mutilated his own testicles. Nor the woman who wouldn't eat because she believed the C.I.A. was trying to poison her. ''It is unbelievable the condition of people who are found not to meet the standard,'' Davison says.
Despite agreement that more services are urgently needed, families, doctors and policy makers are divided over what kind of services. Those concerned about civil liberties and state budgets want to close state psychiatric hospitals and divert more patients to community-based programs and short-term-care facilities. But others argue that not every patient can thrive in a community setting or recover in just a few weeks' time. Meanwhile, outpatient commitment laws -- which would enable some patients to live in the community, provided they adhere to a treatment plan -- confront the same opposition as inpatient commitment: namely the concern that they violate civil liberties or are too expensive to implement or both. ''We say a better system would cost too much,'' says Marvin Swartz, a researcher at Duke University who has studied mental health systems for the past two decades. ''But we're spending more money ignoring the problem than we would have to spend to address it.''
During the three months in which my father cycled through the system, he racked up five emergency room visits, four arrests, four court appearances, three trips to PESS and too many police confrontations to remember. He spent 25 (nonconsecutive) days in a psychiatric hospital and 40 in a county jail. The medical expenses alone -- not including the police hours, jail time or court costs -- ran upward of $250,000. These were costly months indeed -- to the institutions forced to deal with him and, in more ways than one, to our family.
The first thing my father, Joseph Frank Interlandi Sr., would tell you about himself is that he was born and raised in Brooklyn. Not today's gentrified Brooklyn, but Bensonhurst of the 1940s and '50s. His neighborhood was a backdrop to Jackie Gleason in ''The Honeymooners'' and later to John Travolta in ''Saturday Night Fever.'' As a younger man, my father even looked a bit like Travolta's character: he was six feet tall and lanky, with black, pomaded hair. He is a first-generation American, a full-blooded Sicilian, the youngest of 10 children and the son and sibling of garment workers. He met and married my mother, Patricia, a half-Sicilian hairdresser from New Jersey, when he was 25 and she was 22.
My mother lost nine pregnancies (including twins) before my parents went all the way to Colombia to adopt my siblings and me from an orphanage there. My twin brother and I were born significantly premature, and my parents spent four months in Medellin, nursing us to health and praying over our incubators.
They raised my sister, brother and me on fantastic, over-the-top stories about their courtship (he proposed on the first date!), their honeymoon in Italy (they stayed for two months!) and the elaborate parties they gave before we were born. (They once converted an aboveground pool into an in-ground one by digging a huge pit in the backyard; they roasted a pig and the men put on my mother's wigs and gowns and danced the cancan.) It was not enough that they survived a fire, a flood and a robbery in their first years of marriage: the flood was Noah's second coming, the fire nothing short of apocalyptic and the robbery so malicious that the cops worried the perpetrators might belong to some sort of cult and called in the F.B.I.
My father, a self-described man's man, spent 35 years cutting fabric in a factory in Jersey City. When he was past 50, the work went overseas and the factory closed. My siblings and I were still teenagers; my father took any job he could find -- stocking produce at A.&P., painting kitchens for cash, baking pies at Costco -- so that we could at least finish high school before the bank took the house.
I once wondered if those indignities are what triggered his first bouts of mania. But for as long as I can remember, he was bubbling over or oozing out, as if his own skin could not quite contain him. In winter, he would cover every last edge of our two-story home in blinking, multicolored and musical Christmas decorations. In summer, he kept a large vegetable garden and carried baskets of tomatoes and zucchini to our neighbors. He was never still. On the Fourth of July, he would sometimes fill a trash can with fireworks, drag it into the middle of our street and set them off in a quickening crescendo, trying to dare our neighbors into a friendly competition, while my mother fumed in the kitchen.
Occasionally his excess of personality would tip over into something darker. For decades before his diagnosis, we ascribed those turbulent moods to ''too much Scotch.'' Psychiatric medications were becoming commonplace; indeed, a new way of thinking about mental illness -- one based more on biology and less on individual blame -- was gaining prominence. But that growing awareness had not penetrated his circle. Men like my father were expected to drink and to be voluble and volatile. They did not see psychiatrists. They did not necessarily believe in a thing like bipolar disorder.
During his previous manic episode, in 2005, my father was committed to Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital, a state facility, where he stayed for more than a month. But five years later, that hospital was closing, and the others seemed to be overflowing. The state would replace that 310-bed hospital with 71 short-term-care beds. Short-term-care facilities were smaller and cheaper to run than state hospitals. But as their name suggested, they offered only temporary care. And by many accounts, the net loss of beds was already creating congestion.
It took five days for my father to be transferred from the PESS unit to a psychiatric facility that would hold him for only two or three weeks. That, in our experience, would not be long enough to stabilize him.
We wanted him to go to a state hospital, where he could be cared for until he came around to taking his medication or until his mania subsided on its own (which is not uncommon in people with bipolar syndrome). But getting him committed to one would be difficult. We would have to persuade a civil court that he met the imminent-danger standard, and there was no telling which information the judge would weigh most heavily -- the doctors' assessments, our description of his recent conduct or merely the way my father presented himself in court. Our best bet would be to make sure the staff at the psychiatric facility knew about his bipolar diagnosis and his previous commitment so that they could work with us to keep him hospitalized.
It took a week just to get the social worker assigned to his case on the phone. Although I had been sitting right next to my father at PESS when he was told where he would be transferred, privacy laws prohibited the nurses at the new facility from even confirming, without his written consent, that he had been admitted. I asked if someone could tell him we called and have him sign a consent form so that we could speak with his doctor or social worker.
Yes, I was told, he would be given a consent form -- if he was there, which again they would not confirm or deny.
Eventually one nurse took pity and told us that he had indeed filled out the form but had granted access only to Barack Obama and Duke Ellington. The staff took this as proof of his illness. But I saw it differently. When my father was manic, I felt as if an evil alien had invaded his mind and taken over his body. I blamed the alien for hitting my mother; my actual father would never do that. But mocking an important medical document? That was definitely Joe Interlandi. He was in there somewhere, I told myself, trying to make jokes.
With the nurse serving as mediator, we brokered a deal: we brought him notebooks, playing cards and cigarettes, in exchange for permission to talk to his doctors. But as we soon discovered, there was not much to communicate about. The psychiatrist assigned to his case did not see him at all during the first week (nor did he return our calls). The social worker told us that his treatment consisted mostly of group therapy sessions, which my father would either try to lead (by talking over the staff member in charge) or refuse to participate in at all. He spent most of his time drawing pictures for his grandchildren, playing cards with the other patients and writing hundreds of pages in his journal about the indignity of being told what to do and the certainty that he had been betrayed and abandoned by the people he loved most.
He wanted to go home. But he was unwilling to take any of the steps that we were laying out for him to get there. He insisted that nothing was wrong with him and refused to take mood-stabilizing medication. He agreed to a family meeting, but when we arrived, he would not speak to us. He called home periodically to scream and threaten us. He was obstinate and unreasonable, and my siblings and I had to keep reminding one another that he wasn't deliberately tormenting us, that he was sick.
The social worker advised us that telephone threats would be enough to secure a restraining order. That order would help the doctor and the social worker to persuade a judge that he was a danger and should be sent to a state hospital. On this logic, and with my prodding, my mother went to the police station three days after Christmas.
It was not an easy decision. Barring our father from his own home at a time when he seemed to most need our help felt cruel, and we didn't all agree on it. My brother hated the idea, but he deferred to my mother and sister, who seemed genuinely frightened at the prospect of his homecoming. They would have to deal with the brunt of his unpredictable behavior. I lived an hour's train ride from Somerville and didn't feel personally threatened. But I wanted the order for its strategic value: if he wasn't committed to a psychiatric hospital, he would surely violate the restraining order, and the police would be able to take him to jail. That meant if all else failed, he would still be warm, dry and supervised -- and my mother would be safe.
We quickly found ourselves navigating an entirely different system, one created for victims of domestic violence. There was a court hearing, where my mom had to recount every remotely menacing thing my father had done or said in the past several months. There was talk of safe houses and emergency hot lines and free do-it-yourself divorce workshops. And there were lots of brochures and plenty of unsolicited advice. Most of it seemed beside the point. My father was not really violent, I wanted to explain. He was just having a bipolar episode, and we wanted to keep him from wandering the streets.
My parents' journals reveal that throughout this separation they remained united, if only by a shared sense of abandonment. Both kept a precise tally of days that passed since they had seen or spoken to each other; both noted that in 45 years, they had never spent Christmas -- or New Year's or Valentine's Day -- apart. My father wrote winding recollections of their early years. My mother carried a framed photo of him around the house, from the kitchen to the living room to the bedroom. She called me once at 2 a.m. to ask if I knew who was washing his clothes. Did I think he had enough underwear? When her doctor suggested she leave him, she found a new doctor. Divorce was not something she considered, even for a second. They would swim or sink together, as they always had.
The commitment hearing, which took place on Dec. 30, 2010, in Union County Superior Court, was a tragedy of errors. His doctor did not show up. The substitute doctor maintained that my father was not ready to go home, but when pressed by the judge, she could not explain why. ''This patient is not really mine,'' she said. ''So I'm covering now.''
My father yelled at the social worker, who was present, and talked over the judge and lied about his psychiatric history. He presented his journals as documentation of the injustices he had suffered. He asked to read from them, a request the judge denied. ''I came from Brooklyn, New York,'' he said. ''I fell off a bike, and now I'm in prison.'' And then, ''This is nuts.''
I didn't witness any of this. I read it in the court transcript. I could not screw up the nerve to go to the hearing myself. Talking to his social worker on the phone, or to my mother and siblings in private, about the urgent need for longer-term hospitalization was one thing. But speaking against him in court would feel like a betrayal. I couldn't bear to see his face as I told the judge that we were afraid of him and wanted him put away in a state facility. Nor could I bear to hear the evil alien's vicious retorts. So I told myself it was better to let the doctors handle the situation.
It was a decision I came to regret. Without his doctor or immediate family present, there was no one to describe the events leading up to his hospitalization or to explain the nature of his diagnosis. Instead, the argument hinged on a single line in a letter that my father wrote my mother from the hospital: ''I will haunt you for all the rest of your life.''
'' 'Haunt' is a bad word?'' my father asked. ''It's on the television every day.''
Noting his annoyance at the doctor's absence, and declaring the entire session a ''circus,'' the judge said that a single threatening letter did not meet the standard of imminent danger. ''He's an extreme, somewhat combative'' man, the judge said, and ''his credibility is not of the highest, in my opinion. However, I have to tell you that with the standard involved . . . in spite of everything I've heard, and those things that I have not heard, in terms of having the case prepared properly through the hospital. . . .'' He would have to be released.
The social worker called us after the hearing. My father would be discharged in the next day or so, she said. He would need someone to pick him up or at least give him money for a cab.
We considered our options. We could lift the restraining order and bring him home. But if he spun out of control, we would have no way to protect our mother. Friends and relatives suggested that we offer no assistance and let him ''hit rock bottom.'' But it was now early January, and we could not bring ourselves to leave him with nothing in the biting cold. So we fashioned something of a compromise. We kept the restraining order but dropped off some money and a suitcase full of clean clothes at the front desk of the short-term facility. We crossed our fingers and waited.
Of all the stories my parents tell, this is my favorite: My brother and I were just shy of 4 months old and finally well enough to make the flight from Colombia to New Jersey. But the night before we were supposed to leave, I fell violently ill: diarrhea, vomiting, fever. It was late; the ground was still reverberating with aftershocks from an earthquake earlier in the day. And our doctor was tending to some other sick baby in some other neighborhood. As my mother tells it, my father ran through the darkened streets, knocking on strangers' doors, speaking a frantic blend of Italian and Spanish, asking everyone whose path he crossed for help for a baby he barely knew but already loved, fiercely, as his own.
''Por favor! Mi bambina esta enferma!''
Eventually he found a woman who spoke English and had antibiotics. By morning, I was fine.
In the week that followed his release, my father wandered. He hopped a bus to North Carolina to visit his brother. He came back to New Jersey and spent a few nights at a hotel near my parents' apartment. Eventually he made his way back to the emergency room complaining of chest pains. His heart was fine, but a doctor noticed that he was ''scattered'' and ''delusional'' and referred him to PESS. Before they could transfer him to the locked unit, he fled the building with an IV sticking out of his arm. When the police found him and brought him back, he threatened to ''blow up the hospital like the World Trade Center.'' This unlikely threat landed him back in the same psychiatric facility that released him just seven days earlier.
The absurdity of the situation wore on us. How was anyone with a diagnosed mental illness supposed to recover through a revolving door of emergency rooms, short-term psych wards and jail?
In reporting this article, I found scores of families trapped in the same fractured system, crawling through whatever loopholes they could find in an effort to prevent what seemed like certain tragedy. They described programs that were underfinanced and overcrowded, not to mention involuntary commitment laws that were only haphazardly enforced. Most of them seemed as lost as we were.
When a judge told Jennay Ghowrwal that her mother -- who was convinced that the C.I.A. was plotting to destroy her and had once tried to set the house on fire -- would have to be in danger of starving or freezing to death on the street to meet Maryland's commitment standard, members of her support group suggested that Ghowrwal and her brother withdraw financial support. ''The idea was that if we stopped paying her mortgage and buying her food, she might become homeless, and then maybe the courts would hospitalize her,'' Ghowrwal told me. ''But she's in her mid-60s. We just couldn't.''
Teresa Clark, who lived in Flagstaff, Ariz., was told that her son, who had schizophrenia, could be committed only if he threatened or hurt someone. Not until after he killed a police officer (who he believed was an alien in disguise) did she find out that in Arizona anyone can file an application to detain someone for 72 hours of psychiatric observation. She could have done it. The police could have done it. But none of the hospitals she called or officers she spoke to told her that.
A California law requires mental health professionals to consider information supplied by family members during a commitment evaluation, but Candy DeWitt, who lives in Alameda, told me that some screeners would consider only her son's behavior at the time of evaluation. ''I'd fill out the form, listing all the dangerous things he'd done, and my husband would bring it down to the hospital,'' she said. ''One lady would completely ignore it and go just by what she saw in her 15-minute evaluation. And he'd be released. The next week he'd end up back in, and a different lady would look at the same form, with the same information, and send him to a hospital.'' DeWitt saw her son, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, through five years' worth of hospitalizations. This past February, he was charged with killing a man, just weeks after being released from a short-term-care facility against his parents' pleading. In March, he was deemed unfit to stand trial and sent to a state hospital, where he is now being medicated. ''It's one of the most upsetting parts,'' DeWitt said. ''They wouldn't treat him against his will before this happened, even though we begged them to. But now they will. Now that it's too late.''
Joe Bruce's story is particularly haunting. In 2005, his son William, who had schizophrenia, was discharged from a mental health facility, even though he had recently threatened two people with a gun. Bruce remembers begging the facility to reconsider. ''I said: 'In all likelihood, he is going to kill someone. And in all likelihood, that someone is going to be her.' And I pointed to my wife and asked them: 'Do you understand? Do. You. Understand?' And they let him out anyway.'' One year later, William killed his mother with a hatchet.
In most of the stories I heard, hospitalizations and incarcerations quickly became indistinguishable. Neither offered a path to recovery, each only a brief respite from constant worry. ''You spend all your time thinking about where they are and if they're O.K., and what's going to happen next,'' Candy DeWitt said. ''And when you get the call that they've been arrested or that they've been sentenced to jail, that terror that you felt is replaced with this overwhelming sadness.''
My father's second stay at the short-term hospital, in mid-January 2011, was a bust. The doctor discharged him after a week, without even requesting another commitment hearing. The social worker said that he was really no better than when he was first admitted in December. But he was refusing all treatment, she said. And based on how the previous commitment hearing had gone, it seemed highly unlikely that we would get him into a state hospital anyway.
It felt pointless to bring him more cash and clean clothes knowing that he would only repeat the same cycle. But bringing him home, where he could possibly hurt our mother, felt equally unacceptable. So we called the police again and reported another restraining-order violation: a single phone call he made from the hospital to the apartment. The police took him back to jail.
Ten days passed. Our resolve waned. While jail was probably safer than the streets, it hardly seemed like the right place for a 69-year-old man with a pacemaker and a mood disorder. Besides, it had been nearly two months since his first visit to PESS. Maybe his mania was subsiding; maybe we could rehabilitate him ourselves. We decided to bail him out. He would stay with my brother, who lives just one town over. We would set clear and strict rules: he would have to take his medicine and see a psychiatrist weekly. If he complied and got better, he could go home to our mother. If he became even remotely violent, we would send him back to PESS.
My brother went to the jail to present him with our conditions, while my sister and I tried to weave some sort of fast safety net. We needed a social worker, I thought, and maybe a home health aide who, if needed, could restrain a 250-pound man without hurting him. I called the Office on Aging, which referred me to Adult Protective Services. Upon hearing the words ''alcohol'' and ''restraining order,'' the woman on the line suggested a combination of Alcoholics Anonymous and battered-women's counseling. I tried making a psychiatric appointment for him. But the few psychiatrists who took his insurance were not accepting new patients, and the earliest opening at the community mental health center was two months away.
Our safety net was full of holes. Five days after we bailed him out, my father fled my brother's apartment in a rage.
He called my mother an hour later, in full thrall to his mania, saying he was on the top floor of a vacant building and wanted to jump. He rambled on somewhat incoherently about the darker moments of their long life together: the lost babies, the lost jobs, the lost house. All of them had bled together and been compressed in time.
My mother and sister kept him on the phone while my brother and the police from two towns searched for him. I paced my apartment floor, inhaling cigarettes as I ran through a list of maybes. Maybe we shouldn't have bailed him out. Or maybe we shouldn't have gotten a restraining order in the first place. Maybe it wasn't his illness that pushed him over the edge; maybe it was the pain of being separated from the people he loved most. He rescued me from the oblivion of orphanhood. Bought me my first typewriter. Taught me to grow my own vegetables. And now I had locked him out of our lives. And this was how it was going to end?
Por favor! Mi BaBa esta enfermo! Por favor. Por favor. Por favor.
An hour passed. The police found him, shaking and confused, in the janitor's closet of a church basement. They took him back to PESS. The screeners asked him if he still wanted to kill himself. He said no. So they released him. Because he had violated the restraining order by calling my mother with his suicide threat, the police took him back to jail.
I could feel everyone getting tired. The emergency-screening service kept sending the same patient to the psychiatric hospital, only to see him again the following week. The hospital had to baby-sit for a man who refused to comply with treatment. I made dozens of phone calls and was getting nowhere. The only people who hadn't succumbed to fatigue were my mother, though her fingers were cramped from praying so many rosaries, and the local police, who had no choice in the matter. The same roster of officers responded to each call, shepherding my father from the street to the emergency room to PESS to jail, and periodically driving past my mother's house to make sure things were calm. I worried that before long they, too, would give up and release my father, on his own recognizance, to the street.
And then what?
I imagined him circling a drain, the pull of love and obligation dragging my mother and siblings and me behind him.
Here's what I thought should have happened: My father should have been hospitalized against his protestations until his mania subsided. Once it did, he should have been released under supervision and under the condition that he abstain from drinking, which can exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar syndrome, and adhere to a treatment plan involving some combination of talk therapy and medication. I imagined something like probation, but run by a mental health office instead of a criminal court.
As it turned out, New Jersey's mental health community was debating that very idea. Gregory's Law, an involuntary outpatient commitment statute named after an 11-year-old boy who was killed by a man with untreated schizophrenia, had been passed by the state legislature in 2009. But in 2011, as my father was shuffling between jail and the emergency room, it had yet to be implemented.
The law was being fiercely resisted on a number of grounds. Patients' rights groups said that any form of involuntary treatment -- even outpatient -- would violate civil liberties and that Gregory's Law was tantamount to the forcible medicating of the mentally ill that predated the civil rights era. The New Jersey Department of Human Services argued that the state could not afford to track and monitor patients and that implementing Gregory's Law would divert resources from existing voluntary outpatient programs. Even some would-be supporters said that heaping more mandates on an already overburdened system would do more harm than good -- unless there was money sufficient to finance those mandates.
One state psychiatric hospital, meanwhile, was in the process of closing, even though another was so overcrowded that the Department of Justice had initiated an investigation. ''They are closing down the hospitals to save money,'' says Mary Zdanowicz, whose sister was a patient at Hagedorn and whose brother has been a patient in Massachusetts' mental health system. ''The problem is they are not replacing them with anything suitable for someone like my sister, who's really ill and needs 24-hour care.''
Families of patients and victims have spent the past decade pushing for change. They want a more flexible definition of imminent danger that takes into account a person's recent behavior, not just behavior at the moment of evaluation. They also want more states to adhere to a grave-disability standard, by which mentally ill people who are too impaired to care for themselves can be committed even if they are not dangerous. They are lobbying to prevent more psychiatric hospitals from closing and also fighting to establish outpatient programs that would treat some patients involuntarily in the community.
Like Gregory's Law in New Jersey, many of the outpatient commitment laws bear the names of the victims who inspired them; there's Kendra's Law in New York, named after a young woman who was pushed in front of a train by a man with schizophrenia who had been turned away from several psychiatric hospitals; there's Laura's Law in California, for a 19-year-old shot and killed by a mentally ill man who refused treatment. There's Nicola's Law in Louisiana and Kevin's Law in Michigan.
Opponents of these laws point out that such sensational violence is the exception, not the rule. The threats have been trumped up, they argue, in a deliberate effort to stir public fear. ''When they tried to get legislative support for involuntary outpatient programs, nobody much cared,'' says Virginia Aldige Hiday, a researcher at North Carolina State University who focuses on mental health and civil liberties. ''It wasn't until they started focusing on the violence, safety and criminal justice angle that they got a response.''
Indeed a vast majority of people with serious mental illness are not violent at all. Even among patients who present a danger, only a tiny fraction will ever become extremely violent in the way that most families fear. And you cannot possibly predict whether any given patient will be in that tiny fraction. For every case like Joe Bruce's, there are dozens more in which parents thought their child might kill them but didn't. Given the remoteness of that risk, some argue, protection of liberty should weigh more heavily than public safety. And given the dearth of resources, voluntary programs -- for people who actually want help -- should take precedence over involuntary ones.
But extreme violence is not the only thing families like mine worry about. We worry that our loved ones will themselves fall victim to violent crimes, or accidental disasters, if they are left out in the streets while they are sick and delusional. We also worry that without involuntary treatment, they might not recover.
''Sometimes the worst thing that can happen is nothing -- no tipping point, no treatment, no recovery,'' says Ghowrwal, whose mother has become a shut-in. ''What good are civil liberties if the person we're protecting has zero quality of life?'' There is no doubt that involuntary commitment -- inpatient and outpatient -- impinges on individual freedom. Even as I tried to have my father committed, I fretted over the irrevocability of the process. But it also works. And yes, state hospitals and involuntary outpatient programs are expensive, but evidence suggests that in the long run, they save money. Studies show that, when financed properly, these programs reduce hospitalizations and incarcerations. They also improve treatment compliance and reduce the likelihood that a person suffering from mental illness will either be criminally victimized or will victimize someone else.
On Jan. 8, 2011, Jared Loughner a 22-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia, opened fire at an Arizona shopping center, killing six people and injuring 14 more, Representative Gabrielle Giffords among them. In the months that followed, he would be deemed unfit to stand trial and then medicated. It was around that time, says Davison in Essex County, that New Jersey officials finally agreed to begin implementing -- and financing -- the state's outpatient commitment law.
After his third trip to PESS, my father would stay in the county jail for a month and a half -- waiting for his hearing on the restraining-order violations. If the judge found him guilty, he could be sentenced to as many as 90 days, though it was more likely he would get probation or even be released with time served.
I wrote a letter to the judge, detailing my father's psychiatric history and emphasizing that my father needed medical treatment, not jail time. The judge ordered a psychiatric evaluation. It concluded that even though his behavior had been enough to secure a restraining order, and to land him in PESS and then jail, he still did not meet the imminent-danger standard for involuntary hospitalization.
We didn't know it yet, but my father's mania was beginning to subside on its own. He had started asking for my mother, telling the guards and other inmates how much he missed her and that he had to get home in time for her birthday. To that end, he finally agreed to let the jail social worker share information with me.
Seeing in this gesture that he was groping toward sanity, we hired a lawyer. We wanted to lift the restraining order and take him home, we explained. But we needed some help caring for him. He needed psychiatric therapy, but it had to be court-ordered so that he couldn't simply refuse to comply once released. The lawyer spoke to my father -- and the prosecutor and the judge -- and helped draft the following agreement: My father would have to see a probation officer every week for a year and complete six months of therapy at the community mental health center. If he complied, he could live at home with my mother; if he didn't, the judge would send him back to jail.
It was this legal agreement, brokered by a defense attorney in a criminal court, that finally cleared the path for my father's long-term psychiatric care. With a referral from the probation office, the community mental health center made room for him right away. With the threat of jail, my father kept every appointment. And with therapy and medication, the final traces of his mania finally dissolved. He was back to himself just in time for my mother's birthday in early March.
A year later, he and I were playing cards again, this time at the dining-room table, as my mother cooked in the kitchen. I asked him what he remembered about the whole ordeal. He lamented the time lost with his family. ''Those are days I will never get back,'' he said.
The events that had precipitated his first trip to PESS were fuzzy. He was not himself, was all he could really say. He felt like some other being had possessed him for a time. And he hoped that whatever it was, it was gone for good. My mother echoed those sentiments, shouting from the kitchen that it was the only part of their marriage that she wished to forget. Both of them seemed perfectly happy to ignore the fact that bipolar disorder is considered to be a lifelong condition. They would bury this alongside their other shared tragedies until, eventually, it became just another story they told. Already, my father had dropped the larger subject in favor of funny tales about the people he met at the hospital and in jail, and the jokes he played on them to pass the time. We laughed. And apologized to each other. And then, as best we could, we let it go.Correction: July 8, 2012, Sunday

HEADLINE: Farewell to Chocolate City

BYLINE: By NATALIE HOPKINSON. 
The author of ''Go-Go Live: The Musical Life and Death of a Chocolate City.''; Frank Bruni is off today.

 BODY:
''NOW, I'm not proud of what I did,'' my friend Donna said the other day, her voice dropping to a low, confessional register.
Donna is black, in her late 40s and a graphic designer. Three generations of her family owned a Victorian row house in Washington until a probate dispute a while back forced them to rent in the Maryland suburbs. Driving home from work in the city recently, she took a shortcut through the alley where she frolicked in her youth, but which she now barely recognized, with its three-story decks and Zen gardens that led onto sidewalks freshly paved in red brick.
Donna tooted the horn at a parked car blocking her path. The car's owner, a white woman, dawdled away in her garden nearby. With a blithe wave, the woman suggested a detour. Donna refused. She intended to wait her out, but then the words just tumbled out: ''If you didn't want to follow the rules, you shouldn't have moved your white'' -- and here she used an expletive -- ''into D.C.!'' 
This is the rage, long simmering just beneath the surface, that is bubbling over now that Washington, the once-majority-black city immortalized in George Clinton's 1975 funk classic ''Chocolate City,'' has lost its black majority. But even before the data corroborated that demographic milestone last year, Washington's makeover had created something of an identity crisis.
Ever since Washington was carved from two slaveholding states in 1791, it has been a special place for black Americans. Lincoln freed the slaves in Washington about nine months before the Emancipation Proclamation, prompting blacks from the region to flock here. It was the birthplace of Duke Ellington and home to other artists like Zora Neale Hurston and Sterling Allen Brown, who later fueled the Harlem Renaissance. By 1957, blacks had become the majority of the city's residents, exceeding numbers in any major city in the United States. Ever since Walter E. Washington was appointed mayor by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967, the city has been led by black politicians and shaped by black institutions. This has fostered a sense of black privilege, swagger and, yes, the hubris that comes with leadership.
For the past half-century, the city's black majority has also yielded a distinct culture. But in the midst of gentrification that is now fading fast. Last month, hundreds of mourners streamed into the Howard Theater to say goodbye to the late guitarist Chuck Brown, the godfather of go-go music, perhaps the city's only indigenous art form. The music that Mr. Brown created was once ubiquitous here, but most newcomers today have never heard it.
The political landscape is changing, too: recent federal investigations have led to the downfall of several members of the city's black leadership, from the City Council chairman, Kwame R. Brown, and the Ward 5 councilman Harry Thomas Jr., to two campaign aides for Mayor Vincent C. Gray.
During the decades that Washington had a black majority, national policy makers and investors left the city's aging infrastructure for dead. So it is astonishing to witness the about-face that has accompanied the influx of white professionals in the past decade. Now there are urban-friendly transportation policies, lavish corporate spending on education and billions in private real estate investment and development. As residents finally get the city they have always deserved, many black Washingtonians are feeling the rage of the loyal first wife, kicked to the curb as soon as things started looking up.
Move out of the way!
Black privilege has always been relative. The city's median black household income is $36,948; for whites it is $99,401. This demographic reality creates a crude, ethically charged math, and everyone who owns a stake in Washington calculates with it. The presence of white faces is the most reliable sign of the quality of a school. The more white people move in, the higher the property values go. The city's population is growing, but each black family that leaves a school or neighborhood makes it richer.
IT was Donna who was in the way. ''When you hear people say, 'the good news is the neighborhood is being gentrified,' it just makes you feel worthless,'' Donna told me.
My own initiation in the ways of Chocolate City came nearly 20 years ago when, after growing up black in nearly all-white environments, I arrived in Washington as a freshman at historically black Howard University. The Washington I encountered then was a strange, alternate universe: I saw black schools taught by black teachers and run by black principals reporting to black superintendents. Black restaurants. Black hospitals run by black doctors and staff members. Black suburbs. Black judges ordering black police officers to deliver black suspects to black jail wardens. And of course a black-owned music industry, go-go.
In Washington, we were not ''minorities,'' with the whiff of inferiority that label carries; we were ''normal.'' For the first time in my life, I felt at home.
Of course, Chocolate Cities aren't perfect. I do not accept responsibility for Mr. Thomas, who represented me on the City Council and went to jail for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from youth programs. He does not represent black people any more than the disgraced Illinois governor Rod R. Blagojevich represents white people.
But that's what segregation does. It allows problems like corruption, dysfunction and poverty that are really historic, social and economic (and just plain old individual bad behavior) to be cast as a ''black thing.'' Segregated communities effectively quarantine all the American hurt, all the pain, all the history, and give it a ''chocolate'' label. Today, as the quality of life improves, there is a subtext to change, that in order to make progress, black people must be pushed out of the way. They had it for 50 years!
Some days, walking the streets of Washington, a seemingly colder place where people don't always exchange greetings, I feel nostalgic for the days of black privilege that George Clinton crooned about. But given the warmth of many of my new neighbors of many races, I would like to see the transformation around me as racial progress. The change in attitudes that caused a generation of whites to release their fears and return to the urban centers their parents fled a generation ago is the same change in attitudes that allowed millions of white Americans, in the quiet sanctity of the voting booth, to vote for a black man named Barack Hussein Obama.
Change happens. Where this change ultimately leads I have no idea. As we do move it along, though, we would all do well to remember: Donna planted flowers, too.

HEADLINE: What Sheldon Adelson Wants

 BODY:
No American is dedicating as much of his money to defeat President Obama as Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who also happens to have made more money in the last three years than any other American. He is the perfect illustration of the squalid state of political money, spending sums greater than any political donation in history to advance his personal, ideological and financial agenda, which is wildly at odds with the nation's needs.
Mr. Adelson spent $20 million to prop up Newt Gingrich's failed candidacy for the Republican nomination. Now, he has given $10 million to a Mitt Romney super PAC, and has pledged at least $10 million to Crossroads GPS, the advocacy group founded by Karl Rove that is running attack ads against Mr. Obama and other Democrats. Another $10 million will probably go to a similar group founded by the Koch brothers, and $10 million more to Republican Congressional super PACs. 
That's $60 million we know of (other huge donations may be secret), and it may be only a down payment. Mr. Adelson has made it clear he will fully exploit the anything-goes world created by the federal courts to donate a ''limitless'' portion of his $25 billion fortune to defeat the president and as many Democrats as he can take down.
One man cannot spend enough to ensure the election of an unpopular candidate, as Mr. Gingrich's collapse showed, but he can buy enough ads to help push a candidate over the top in a close race like this year's. Given that Mr. Romney was not his first choice, why is Mr. Adelson writing these huge checks?
The first answer is clearly his disgust for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, supported by President Obama and most Israelis. He considers a Palestinian state ''a steppingstone for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people,'' and has called the Palestinian prime minister a terrorist. He is even further to the right than the main pro-Israeli lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which he broke with in 2007 when it supported economic aid to the Palestinians.
Mr. Romney is only slightly better, saying the Israelis want a two-state solution but the Palestinians do not, accusing them of wanting to eliminate Israel. The eight-figure checks are not paying for a more enlightened answer.
Mr. Adelson's other overriding interest is his own wallet. He rails against the president's ''socialist-style economy'' and redistribution of wealth, but what he really fears is Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on companies like his that make a huge amount of money overseas. Ninety percent of the earnings of his company, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, come from hotel and casino properties in Singapore and Macau. (The latter is located, by the way, in China, a socialist country the last time we checked.)
Because of the lower tax rate in those countries (currently zero in Macau), the company now has a United States corporate tax rate of 9.8 percent, compared with the statutory rate of 35 percent. President Obama has repeatedly proposed ending the deductions and credits that allow corporations like Las Vegas Sands to shelter billions in income overseas, but has been blocked by Republicans.
Mr. Obama's Justice Department is also investigating whether Mr. Adelson's Macau operations violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an inquiry that Mr. Adelson undoubtedly hopes will go away in a Romney administration. For such a man, at a time when there are no legal or moral limits to the purchase of influence, spending tens of millions is a pittance to elect Republicans who promise to keep his billions intact.

HEADLINE: Putting On a Brave Face, but Preparing for Heartbreak on Health Care

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
Late on Tuesday, March 27, halfway around the world, President Obama began one of the most suspenseful waits in recent presidential history.
After a blur of nuclear security meetings in South Korea, Mr. Obama settled into the Air Force One conference room to read a summary aides had written of that day's arguments before the Supreme Court back in Washington. The justices had asked deeply skeptical questions about his health care law.
Mr. Obama's most profound policy achievement was at much higher risk of defeat than his aides had expected, vulnerable to being erased by the margin of a single justice's vote.
Since then, Mr. Obama and the White House have put on brave faces, insisting that the law and the mandate at its center will be upheld when the court rules this month. In private conversations, they predict that the bulk of the law will survive even if the mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance does not. 
But even if the White House is a fortress of message discipline, it cannot disguise the potential heartbreak for Mr. Obama, who managed to achieve a decades-old Democratic dream despite long odds and at steep cost.
If he loses both his law and re-election, many will conclude ''that he bet on his major reform, and the Supreme Court defeated it, and he lost his hold on the presidency,'' Robert Dallek, the presidential historian, said in an interview.
On the day the ruling comes out, one Obama adviser joked, ''I might have to clean out my sock drawer.''
In grappling with what the court may do, Mr. Obama and his advisers now appear to be far past the denial stage (when they dismissed constitutional challenges) but nowhere near acceptance (they still believe the law will be upheld.) Instead, they have quietly entered a surprising new state that might be called Learning to Live Without Universal Coverage.
Former advisers are emphasizing the many aspects of the bill that are not connected to the mandate, like the subsidies to buy insurance. Some aides even argue privately that losing the mandate could be a political boon, because it would rob Republicans of their core complaint against the law.
But that position is uncomfortable for a deeper reason, one that goes to the core of who Mr. Obama wanted to be as president. Earlier in his term, he refused every chance to settle for the more limited health care overhaul that the Supreme Court may now effectively deliver, making epic sacrifices to win something far broader.
Before he became president, critics said that Mr. Obama's greatest achievement was his own rise, that he played it safe -- sometimes voting ''present'' in the Illinois State Senate -- rather than taking risks for what he really believed. ''What's he ever done?'' Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, asked repeatedly in 2000 when he crushed his upstart Congressional challenger, and opponents later echoed the question.
Early in the presidential race, Mr. Obama summoned the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for a conversation about Abraham Lincoln. He was only an upstart candidate, but he was already talking about leaving a legacy, about accomplishing vast things.
In the White House, many of his top advisers, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, counseled Mr. Obama against a sweeping health care overhaul. By summer 2009, with the country still stunned by economic crisis and Republicans falsely raising the specter of death panels, some aides practically begged the president to scale back, take interim steps and move on to other issues.
Mr. Obama did not relent. He had an economic rationale for stabilizing a dysfunctional health system, but he also ''saw what Teddy called the moral issue,'' Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's widow, said in an interview, referring to her husband. For those who wondered what Mr. Obama really believed in, universal health coverage seemed to be the answer.
As the brutal fight continued, the president sacrificed more and more in its name: an overhaul of energy and environmental laws, greater focus on economic issues, some of his own popularity and that of House Democrats, who eventually lost their hard-won majority. ''Michelle and I are perfectly comfortable if we're only here one term if we feel like we really accomplished something,'' he told aides.
That declaration sounds different today. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, uses ''Obamacare'' as an epithet and applause line, promising outright repeal if he wins. A few years ago, the health care law seemed a reason for Mr. Obama to risk losing re-election, former aides said. Now, it is a reason he feels he must win re-election.
As he awaits the decision, Mr. Obama has no more knowledge of or influence on it than any of the other lawyers handicapping the odds in Washington bars and boardrooms.
The former law professor turned president is scathing about the argument that the mandate violates the Constitution, saying it has no merit whatsoever. Sometimes, to the nervousness of advisers, he says as much in public; a few days after oral arguments, he laid down a gauntlet for the Supreme Court, all but saying that striking down the law would be politically motivated judicial activism. (He later softened his statement.)
''To have a voice as profound as the Supreme Court say it's unconstitutional,'' said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was an adviser on the law, would be ''bad news all around.''
But there are clues that Mr. Obama is privately grappling with both the potential loss of universal health care and how much of it he might be able to restore. At a recent fund-raiser in Manhattan, he rattled off a second-term agenda, and along with tax reform and immigration, he mentioned coming back to health care, to work around a negative ruling. His tone was matter-of-fact, one attendee said.
If the court strikes down the mandate and Mr. Obama wins in November, he could face one last version of his perpetual choice on health care: would he settle, learning to live with a sharply edited law? (Given that Republicans see the bill as a signature piece of big-government overreach, he might have no choice.) Or would he expend yet more precious capital on health care?
Ezekiel Emanuel, Rahm's brother and a former health adviser to the president, predicted the second path. ''Too much of the president's legacy -- and the good of the country -- is tied up with this,'' he said.
The final result on health care, then, will help determine whether Mr. Obama is the game-changing president he aspired to be.
''This is his singular policy achievement,'' said Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University who wrote a brief supporting the law. ''So there's a palpable pain in having this go down.''
Though the White House continues to maintain official silence on contingency plans, Mr. Obama hinted at his thinking a few weeks ago. ''In my first term, we passed health care reform,'' he began a joke at the White House Correspondents Dinner in April. ''In my second term, I guess I'll pass it again.''

HEADLINE: Progress on the Sidelines As Rio Conference Ends

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and JOHN M. BRODER; Simon Romero reported from Rio de Janeiro, and John M. Broder from Washington. Taylor Barnes contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Burdened by low expectations, snarled by endless traffic congestion and shunned by President Obama, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ended here as it began, under a shroud of withering criticism.
The antipoverty organization CARE called the meeting ''nothing more than a political charade,'' and Greenpeace said the gathering was ''a failure of epic proportions.'' The Pew Environment Group was slightly more charitable. ''It would be a mistake to call Rio a failure,'' the group said, ''but for a once-in-a-decade meeting with so much at stake, it was a far cry from a success.''
But while the summit meeting's 283-paragraph agreement, called ''The Future We Want,'' lacks enforceable commitments on climate change and other global challenges, the outcome reflects big power shifts around the world. These include a new assertiveness by developing nations in international forums and the growing capacity of grass-roots organizations and corporations to mold effective environmental action without the blessing of governments. 
The Obama administration offered no grand public gestures here, opting to focus on smaller-scale development projects like clean cookstoves and local energy projects.
Europe, traditionally the driving force behind environmental action yet distracted now by efforts to contain a financial crisis, was considerably more active than the United States, taking part in nearly every corner of the sprawling conference, called Rio+20 to commemorate the anniversary of the first Earth Summit held here in 1992.
''Probably those who are most frustrated, and who say they are frustrated, are the Europeans,'' Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil's chief negotiator at Rio+20, said in an interview. ''They think they can still indicate paths which others should follow.''
The sheer size of the gathering -- nearly 50,000 participants including more than 100 heads of state or government -- may have raised expectations, in spite of the mixed record of previous such gatherings. The first Rio summit meeting produced two landmark treaties, on climate change and biodiversity, that have so far failed to live up to their promises.
Yet despite this record, the activity outside the main negotiating sessions here produced hundreds of side agreements that do not require ratification or direct financing by governments and that offer the promise of incremental but real progress.
''Even a complicated, diverse world can address problems not through treaties, but by identifying the goals that then inspire decentralized actions,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.
For instance, Microsoft said it would roll out an internal carbon fee on its operations in more than 100 countries, part of a plan to go carbon-neutral by 2030. The Italian oil giant Eni said it would reduce its flaring of natural gas. Femsa, a Latin American soft-drink bottler, said it would obtain 85 percent of its energy needs in Mexico from renewable sources.
The Indian Ocean island nation of the Maldives, already experiencing dangerous sea-level rise, announced what it said would become the world's largest marine reserve, encompassing all 1,192 of its islands by 2017. A group of development banks announced a $175 billion initiative to promote public transportation and bicycle lanes over road and highway construction in the world's largest cities.
But the ubiquity of corporate and financial sponsorship made some uneasy.
''If George Orwell were alive today, he would be irritated, and then shocked, by the cynical way in which every lobby with an ax to grind and money to burn has hitched its wagon to the alluring phrase 'sustainable development,' '' said Jagdish N. Bhagwati, a professor of economics at Columbia, in an essay called ''Rio's Unsustainable Nonsense.''
Still, some with decades of experience with such summit meetings take a more nuanced view. Thomas Lovejoy, an American conservation biologist who was a driving force behind the first Earth Summit in 1992, said he remained discouraged by the lack of action in reducing carbon emissions.
But Mr. Lovejoy, who began working in the Amazon in 1965, also said he could recognize how some important progress had been made, especially in Brazil, since then.
''There was one national forest and one demarcated indigenous reserve,'' said Mr. Lovejoy, 70. ''Now, 50 percent is under some form of protection.''
Brazil, with command over its vast forests as well as an estimated 12 percent of the world's fresh water, remains crucial to any international preservation efforts. The rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon recently fell to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1988.
Still, others who came here for the conference, like the indigenous leader Raoni Metuktire, 82, a chief of Brazil's Kayapo tribe, said such advances meant little. He said he found himself emphasizing the same things he spoke about at the original Earth Summit in 1992.
''Deforestation continues,'' said Mr. Metuktire, who is normally referred to as Raoni, through an interpreter. ''The river is having dams built into it; the people don't listen,'' he said. ''They don't respect me.''

Cold Spring, N.Y.
WHAT'S a cat have to do to get some love?
Jaguar is breeding its most competitive cars in decades, among them the graceful, dynamically sparkling XF and XJ sedans, yet too few people have been buying them. It's enough to make the company's latest owner, Tata Motors of India, wonder about that ''Rule, Britannia'' mythology.
Now comes the XKR-S, merely the fastest series production car in Jaguar's history. It's another model certain to lift Jaguar's esteem, if not its bottom line.
Jaguar's American sales continue to hover around 13,000 cars a year, even as its sibling under Tata, Land Rover, sells three times as many vehicles. Put another way, only about one in 1,000 cars sold in America is a Jaguar. 
Yet Jaguars are measured against European prestige brands like BMW, which competes in more market segments and attracted nearly 250,000 American buyers in 2011. Even Jaguar's steady showings in quality measures has failed to sway the big spenders. In one closely watched J. D. Power & Associates survey of initial quality released last week, Jaguar vaulted to second place -- tied with Porsche and hard on the heels of Lexus -- from a No. 20 ranking in 2011.
So what's the problem? My hunch is that many shoppers, hearing the Jaguar name, still picture a neighbor's vintage model with the traits of a beautiful teenage rocker: moody, garage-bound and usually broke.
It doesn't help that Jaguar, alone in its sector of the luxury market, offers no entry-luxury models or crossovers, products that Americans buy in bulk. But next year Jaguar will roll out a car enthusiasts have dreamed about: the F-Type, heir to a sports car hall-of-famer, the E-Type of the 1960s.
As placeholders go, a company could do worse than the XKR-S. Spectacular to behold, with 550 supercharged V-8 horsepower and a top speed of 186 miles per hour, it can be considered the explosive cap to the long-running XK lineup.
Just 100 XKR-S coupes and 25 convertibles will come to America this model year. The exclusivity comes at a wallet-detonating price: $132,875 for the coupe and $138,875 for a convertible. Compared with the $85,000 XK coupe (385 horsepower), or even the $98,000 XKR coupe (510), it is asking a lot.
Yet in performance and presence, the XKR-S slam-dunks its doppelganger, the $200,000 Aston Martin DB9, another beautiful Briton shaped by Ian Callum, who is now the design chief of Jaguar. There's about as much visual testosterone as the XK's classical proportions can handle -- too much for some tastes.
The scoops and slits, the stormy 20-inch forged wheels and the carbon-fiber wing issue fair warning: this Jaguar is no gentleman.
Underscoring the focus of the XKR-S, Mr. Callum said that physics and aerodynamics dictated the styling: ''If you don't like the way it looks, you probably won't like the way it drives either.''
Those looks include a selection of paint choices that highlight Jaguar's international racing heritage. The convertible I tested was jacketed in British Racing Green, and there's an Italian Racing Red. But the French Racing Blue of my coupe test car was the to-die-for color. I blame those hues in part for the stream of admirers who kept stopping me and the cars on our travels.
I also succumbed to the Jaguar's megawatt charm. Finishing a hike on the Appalachian Trail in upstate New York and emerging onto a roadway blanketed in twilight fog, I chuckled at the blue orb, still some distance away, its paint cutting through the murk like a lighthouse beacon.
The cabin is jazzed with chunky sport seats, glossy black console trim, a three-spoke steering wheel and the choice of dark-aluminum trim standing in for wood. But even a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon can't mask the XK's age spots. Jaguar's touch-screen infotainment unit remains among the industry's lamest, from its murky display to its sluggish operation.
Compared with the XKR, the S version gets a deeper-breathing V-8, good for a gain of 40 horsepower. An active exhaust system opens its pipes when you really prod the gas pedal, and the V-8's siren song could lure even a tone-deaf sailor to his doom.
Despite its fearsome output, at 15 m.p.g in town and 22 on the highway the XKR-S neatly avoids a guzzler tax. That's a nice touch in a car that can dash from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a conservative, company-cited 4.2 seconds and reach 100 m.p.h. in 8.7 seconds.
The smooth, swift transmission -- on paper, a ho-hum 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters -- proves that you don't always need eight gears or NASA-spec clutch mechanisms to go fast and have fun.
Enormous disc brakes with light, efficient monoblock calipers -- painted gray or red for an extra $450 -- and Pirelli P Zero tires helped reel in this nearly two-ton car with ease. Steering remains the easy-twist variety, yet it's also satisfyingly precise once you remember that every XK prefers gentle inputs from its driver.
The stability control system and torque-vectoring rear differential have been reprogrammed, in part to give freer rein to this beast.
And an odd beast it is: one part purebred feline, one part jungle carnivore, and, um, one part squirrel. On damp or gritty pavement, the Jaguar wanted to spin its tires or shake its tail at the slightest provocation. That old-school volatility is the opposite of modern sports cars like the Porsche 911 or the Nissan GT-R, which are fairly idiot-proof.
In other words, I loved it. When the clouds parted, the XKR-S revealed grace and grit that's rare in this genre of luxury sports car.
This XKR-S will lift the spirits of a few score Americans, and I'm glad to have driven it. With some storied brands dying, Jaguar's viability may demand that it deliver higher-volume cars that buyers want, including entry-level models and sporty crossovers, armchair purists be damned.
For those who harrumph into their Armagnac snifter, I'd ask a question I raised over the Porsche Cayenne, the S.U.V. that ultimately saved Porsche's schnitzel: which would be worse, a Jaguar crossover in a showroom, or that showroom closed and the glorious Jaguar name gone forever?

HEADLINE: Still Depressed, After All These Years

 BODY:
With Europe suffering under self-destructive austerity and the United States facing its own prospect of punishing budget cuts, it is easy to forget that the housing bust has been the biggest drag on the economy over the past five years. Even with recent housing market improvements, sales and construction are still at very low levels, while prices are still falling in most areas. 
Worse, those signs of improvement may not be sustainable. One reason is that millions of foreclosures were delayed from late 2010 until this year, as banks wrangled -- and eventually settled -- with government officials over foreclosure abuses. With the legal issues now out of the way, foreclosures have resumed, with another five million expected between now and 2015, in addition to more than five million homes already lost, according to Moody's Analytics.
If the economy were strengthening, the price declines from more foreclosures could be limited by an influx of first-time buyers and real-estate investors. But with the economy slowing again, housing could also relapse, with falling prices provoking more defaults, foreclosures and distress sales, and ever-lower prices.
That dark scenario was a factor last week when the Federal Reserve downgraded its economic outlook, citing a housing market that ''remains depressed.''
Policy makers need to take steps now to prevent a renewed housing downturn, along these lines:
REFINANCINGS Millions of homeowners have been unable to refinance their high-rate mortgages despite constructive moves by the Obama administration to relax the rules on refinancings in its mortgage-relief programs. Part of the problem appears to be foot-dragging by banks that want to keep borrowers paying at a higher rate. A bill by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, would help break the logjam, in part, by ensuring increased competition among lenders. The challenge, as always, is how to pass needed measures in a hyperpartisan Congress. President Obama should be making it clear to voters that efforts to impede refinancing condemn homeowners to paying above-market mortgage rates.
LOAN MODIFICATIONS Under the recent foreclosure settlement, big banks are supposed to provide some $10 billion worth of principal reduction to some of the millions of borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. One concern is that banks will tailor the relief in ways that help them clean up their balance sheets, while leaving many homeowners deeply underwater. Obama administration officials must be unflinching in their assessments of banks' performance and ensure that noncompliant banks are punished.
LAW ENFORCEMENT The foreclosure settlement allows for further investigation into banks' mortgage abuses. In January, Mr. Obama vowed to begin an expanded inquiry, but there are scant signs of progress. The Justice Department has confirmed that 100 lawyers and staff members from various state and federal agencies are working on the investigation, a skeleton crew compared with the banks' armies of lawyers. Only recently did the department convene a two-day meeting for lawyers, regulators and other experts involved in the inquiry to discuss cases, legal theories and strategies. Coordination is important, but it seems a far cry from a hard-charging prosecution, especially as potential violations draw closer to expiration under statutes of limitation for financial crimes.
Mr. Obama has promised an investigation with real accountability. There is still time, but he has not yet delivered. Meanwhile, with the possible exception of a euro zone meltdown, the housing market remains the largest threat to economic recovery.

WAVES OF VIOLENCE IN JUaREZ
CONTINUE TO TAKE WOMEN
Nearly 60 women have been murdered in Ciudad Juarez so far this year; at least 100 have gone missing over the past two years. The city became infamous for a wave of attacks beginning in the 1990s that left hundreds of women dead over the course of a decade. This time, though, the response has been underwhelming. Page 6
U.S. ROLE ANGERS BAHRAINIS
As hopes for reform fade, protesters in Bahrain are focusing anger on the United States, which supports and arms the ruling monarchy. To their familiar slogans -- demanding freedoms, praising God and cursing the royal family -- young protesters added a new demand, written on a placard in English, so the Americans might see: ''U.S.A. Stop arming the killers.'' Page 6

Getting our sedentary, overweight children off the couch is a challenge. That's why the Nintendo Wii game console was such an exciting prospect.

HEADLINE: Suggested Safeguards Irk Fund Industry

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR a moment last week, watching the Senate Banking Committee hearings on money market mutual fund reforms, I thought I had fallen into a time warp. As Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlined proposals meant to ensure that taxpayers would never need to bail out a money fund, some of the sharp questioning she received had a depressingly familiar ring.
''In my view you're portraying an industry that's extremely vulnerable, that has all these risks of runs, and I really find that extraordinary in light of the actual history,'' needled Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, citing the failure of just one money market fund -- the Reserve Fund in 2008 -- throughout years of crises and panics. ''You're telling us that this is a very vulnerable industry and there's great threats of a run and using that to justify regulations that I think threaten the very existence of this industry.'' 
Suddenly, I was back in September 2003 at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on a similar effort to avert a bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that would become wards of the state just five years later. ''The more people, in my judgment, exaggerate a threat of safety and soundness, the more people conjure up the possibility of serious financial losses to the Treasury, which I do not see,'' Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, said then. ''I think we see entities that are fundamentally sound financially and withstand some of the disaster scenarios.''
Note well: I am not arguing that the money market mutual fund industry is on the same road to ruin that Fannie and Freddie were in 2003. But it is worth pointing out that protecting the taxpayer from a failure of the mortgage giants didn't work out so well, in large part because their defenders in Congress rose to their aid.
With that in mind, it would be a shame if the effort by the S.E.C. to prevent a run on a money market fund -- and the contagion and government assistance that could accompany it -- met a similar fate. Fact is, when the government moved to shore up the money market fund industry in the fall of 2008, the federal financial safety net expanded exponentially. Once the government steps in to stabilize an industry, we have learned to expect it will probably do so again.
Mr. Toomey said Friday that he did not think investors saw money funds as government-backed. He rejected the notion that his defense of the industry was similar to the support given to Fannie and Freddie, saying the circumstances surrounding those companies were completely different.
Ms. Schapiro has stirred the ire of this $2.6 trillion corner of the fund industry by making several suggestions that would cost the industry money or make its offerings less attractive to investors. One idea is to require that the funds set aside capital to protect against an investor selling stampede; another is to require funds to value their shares based on a floating net-asset value, which more accurately reflects changing prices in the investments they hold.
Both are anathema to the fund industry, which is accustomed to its low-volatility and low-overhead business model. And who doesn't like an implied government guarantee?
At the hearing, Ms. Schapiro upset the industry further by disclosing that since the 1970s, there have been 300 occasions where money fund sponsors stepped in to support a fund financially. This casts doubt on the industry's contention that money funds have rarely faced financial difficulties. Paul Schott Stevens, president of the Investment Company Institute, accused regulators, without naming Ms. Schapiro, of viewing money market reform ''through the outdated lens of 2008.'' In remarks prepared for the banking committee, he wrote: ''They are considering structural changes that would alter the characteristics that investors deeply value and reduce competition by driving fund sponsors out of the business. These changes would destroy money market funds, at great cost to investors, state and local governments and the economy.''
BUT is the S.E.C.'s lens really so outdated? David S. Scharfstein, a professor of finance and banking at the Harvard Business School who also testified, thinks not. In an interview Thursday, he pointed to the large withdrawals made by institutional money market fund investors last summer as the European debt crisis escalated. ''It wasn't a panic run but it was a significant withdrawal of funding from financial institutions,'' he said.
Mr. Scharfstein favors a capital requirement that funds would set aside. He suggested a 3 percent buffer; that would amount to $75 billion, a figure few in the industry would welcome. Large institutional money market funds pose risks because shareholders can pull their money at any time, imperiling the large banks that rely on money funds for their operations.
And these institutions dominate the market for securities purchased by money funds. Indeed, money fund holders may not have noticed how much more exposed to the fates of financial institutions their funds have become in recent years. Ten or 15 years ago, nonfinancial companies issued far more commercial paper than they do now. As a result almost all of the top issuers of these securities, a staple of money funds, are large banks. Many are European.
As of May, Mr. Scharfstein noted, the top nongovernment issuer of short-term securities purchased by money market funds was Barclays Bank, followed closely by Deutsche Bank. Together, securities issued by those institutions made up 7.65 percent of assets in prime money market funds. Among the 50 largest issuers of money market securities, only two were nonfinancial -- Toyota and Coca-Cola.
Mr. Stevens said that money funds invest only in institutions that are creditworthy.
Money funds, nevertheless, have become big enablers of the short-term financing business model that got so many banks into trouble when investors ran for the hills in 2008.
''This is really about what is the best way to fund large global banks, and are money market funds the best way to do it,'' Mr. Scharfstein said. ''If you have a demandable claim, like a deposit, there should be some capital backing it.''
Ms. Schapiro has a tough road ahead; she has even met resistance within the agency and does not yet have the necessary consensus to move forward. It's hard to imagine why the other commissioners would not want to let a rule proposal go forward so they could hear from the public on this issue.
''Following the financial crisis, many asked why regulators didn't raise red flags earlier,'' Ms. Schapiro said on Friday. ''While I recognize the industry's strong opposition, I believe we have to protect taxpayers and investors against the susceptibility of funds' breaking the buck and potentially triggering destabilizing runs on the financial system.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Democracy's Lost Years

BYLINE: By JO TUCKMAN. 
A foreign correspondent who writes for The Guardian and other publications, and the author of ''Mexico: Democracy Interrupted.''

 BODY:
Mexico City
IN 2000, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had run Mexico for 71 years with the help of a mixture of authoritarianism, corruption and election-tampering, was voted out of office. This was seen as the end of an era, the relegation of an anachronistic institution to the scrapheap of history.
How is it, then, that the party's candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, seems poised to win the presidential election next Sunday and become the leader of 113 million Mexicans? In part, it's a tribute to the party's survival instincts -- and to an image makeover in the form of a young and telegenic candidate with a matinee idol aura, a telenovela actress wife and an immobile hairdo.
But the party, known as PRI, could not have gotten to this position if the rest of the political elite had not made such a mess of opportunities in the last 12 years to make Mexico a more functioning democracy. 
Negligence, corruption and abuse of power at all levels of government rarely bring any serious consequences. The federal government, once the ultimate political referee, has ceded power to local authorities, but the trickle down has reached few ordinary citizens, whose participation is largely limited to polling day. Civil society has not proved organized or powerful enough to hold the privileged political class accountable. In some parts of Mexico, violent drug cartels have filled this power vacuum. Since President Felipe Calderon, of the National Action Party, or PAN, began his all-out assault against the drug organizations in 2006, some 50,000 Mexicans have died. Headless bodies swing from bridges. Corrupt police officers and prosecutors protect murderous gangs. Local journalists have been killed by the dozen.
Mr. Calderon -- who by law is limited to one six-year term -- says he has saved Mexico from becoming a failed narco-state. The offensive was necessary, he argues, because complicit previous governments, limp American efforts to tackle drug consumption and cross-border gun running, and changes in organized criminal markets had allowed the power and brutality of the cartels to get out of control. He has a point -- but his party's failure to find democratic ways to bolster state power and legitimacy, after one-party hegemony ended, is a large part of the story of why the cartels have yet to be brought to heel.
The damp-rag presidency of Mr. Calderon's predecessor, Vicente Fox, of PAN, who was president from 2000 to 2006, deserves much of the blame. Mr. Fox frittered away the enthusiasm that accompanied his historic election and did almost nothing to reform the structures of government left behind by the PRI. Aside from an energetic, if doomed, push for an immigration agreement with President George W. Bush's administration, he trundled along in a haze of frivolity, punctuated by a streak of malevolence he displayed by trying to block a popular leftist, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from even running for president. That failed, but Mr. Lopez Obrador lost by a whisker to the PAN candidate, Mr. Calderon, who successfully branded him an unhinged messianic radical, in 2006.
The second term for PAN, won by Mr. Calderon, meant further stagnation for Mexican democracy.
The one-term limit for many offices still means that politicians who want to further their careers barter in back rooms with their eye on the next post, rather than debate their record before voters in an effort to gain re-election. Judicial reforms, approved in 2008, have been underfinanced and slow to take effect. Regulatory agencies are too weak to impose their will on the monopolies and oligopolies that control the economy. Mexicans still dance to a tune played by a class of unaccountables, from influence-peddling union leaders to governors who rule their states as fiefs to TV networks that play favorites.
Corruption is so embedded in Mexico's life and self-image that the revelations of kickbacks paid by Walmart to expand in Mexico drew little more than world-weary shrugs. Mr. Fox's promises to go after ''big fish'' and Mr. Calderon's pledge of ''clean hands'' have been all but forgotten.
THERE have been some silver linings in the PAN years. The colossal economic mismanagement of the final decades of PRI rule has mutated into a dogged commitment to stability. Transparency laws and aggressive news media are applying scrutiny to the powers that be. After an open debate, Mexico City has made abortion on demand legal (in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) and recognized same-sex marriage.
But a yawning gulf between the political elite and the rest of the people remains.
Mr. Pena Nieto, the governor of Mexico's most populous state from 2005 to 2011, has promised ''effective government'' and ''a democracy that brings results.'' Both slogans speak to the feeling that Mexico has lost direction, but they also hint at nostalgia for the days of order, sense of purpose and wealth redistribution under the old PRI. He claims to represent a new, pluralism-loving generation that is more capable than the PAN and more disciplined than the left.
Simply put, after 12 years in exile, the PRI is preparing to reassume its traditional place of power. ''It's a gene, a chip that we have and that the other parties do not,'' a lifelong party member who knows Mr. Pena Nieto told me. ''The PAN are good at being in opposition, but they do not know how to be in government, and the best operatives on the left were trained up inside the PRI.'' In other words, the PRI's members were born and raised to rule.
The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called the PRI a ''perfect dictatorship,'' underscoring its tight control of public life without resort to military juntas and their everyday brutalities. To be sure, the PRI today has moved on from there. It is not the same party that massacred pro-democracy students in 1968, nationalized the banks on a presidential whim in 1982 and secured a presidential election victory in 1988 only after the vote-counting computer crashed. But even in its more acceptable form, the PRI does not bode well for pushing democratization forward.
Until a few weeks ago, a return of the PRI seemed a foregone conclusion; most polls showed the leftist Mr. Lopez Obrador and the PAN candidate, Josefina Eugenia Vazquez Mota, battling for a distant second place behind Mr. Pena Nieto. But the late emergence of an energetic youth mobilization against Mr. Pena Nieto, combined with accusations of biased media coverage, have injected a note of passion and unpredictability into the campaign as his lead begins to erode. In other words, Mexico might have a race after all. With any luck, it will help keep the debate about the quality of Mexican democracy at the center of the agenda, whoever wins the presidency.

HEADLINE: The 8.2 Blues

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
At precisely 8:30 a.m. on the first Friday of the month, thousands of people (including me) stare at a dull government Web site and hit refresh until they see the number: how many jobs were created or lost during the previous month. Then, with amazing speed, reports and analysis of the number are disseminated by newspapers, bank economists, independent analysts, investment newsletters and countless TV pundits. Within minutes, the national narrative is set. Either the economy is doing far worse (like last month) or far better (as in January) than anyone realized.
The jobs number, which only the most die-hard econonerds (including me) used to care about, is supposed to tell us how the economy is doing. Now, though, it is doing something much more complicated. The report on past job performance has morphed into a driver of future job performance, essentially mucking up the thing it's measuring. And that's not good, because the initial jobs data are not as precise as many people seem to think. 
Take the most recent report. After it was announced that only about 69,000 jobs were created during May -- and that the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 8.2 percent -- some observers who had expressed cautious optimism as recently as 8:29 a.m. were instantly transformed into grim Cassandras. All at once, it seemed, everyone agreed that President Obama's re-election chances had taken a serious hit and the global economy was headed down the tubes.
What would have happened, I wondered, if the number had instead been 169,000 new jobs? In that same instant, the economy would have appeared back on track; pundits would be talking about Obama's shoo-in second term; global investors would feel reassured. By the way, the number might actually have been 169,000. The initial report is an estimate with a margin of error of around 100,000 people. (We might have lost 31,000 jobs in May too.) But whatever the precise number turns out to be, tens of thousands of jobs either way is only a few hundredths of a percent of the U.S. work force. A tiny blip of a change in an admittedly uncertain statistic shouldn't have such an impact on the national narrative, right? Isn't that kind of dangerous?
If you ask the people who publish the jobs data, as I recently did, they'll tell you two things. One, the monthly jobs report is truly a marvel of modern statistical science. And two, even so, it's best used as a long-term guide, not as a month-by-month panic- or joy-inducing catalyst. (Regarding the latter, the jobs number is revised a few months after it's released.) After all, the two surveys conducted by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- one of citizens, the other of businesses -- that make up the report were born during the Great Depression. That's when John Maynard Keynes, then the world's most important economist, realized that it was crucial for everyone to know how the overall economy was doing. Before this, government officials had little more than rough guesses about whether their Depression-fighting policies were working over the long term.
Since then, the jobs data (along with a host of other indicators) have become essential business tools. Most major corporations (and plenty of minor ones) have economic-forecasting teams that use the new data to prepare reports that guide executive decision making. Will enough people buy cars next year to justify a new glass factory for sedan windows? Will they have enough money to go on vacation, and if so, does that mean that soda sales will spike?
This raises the inadvertent, insidious aspect of the report. Economic growth is, in part, driven by people and businesses feeling optimistic about the future. And after hearing how lousy the job sector looked over the last month, some consumers decide not to buy things, like a new house or even an extra appetizer. After hearing that so many of their customers are out of work, some companies decide there isn't enough growth on the horizon to warrant hiring. Just like that, a bad initial jobs report (obsessed over by a frantic news media) might make a bad situation worse. It sounds simplistic, but much economic policy -- from austerity to stimulus -- comes down to attempts at mass psychotherapy.
For extremely dysfunctional countries, like Greece, no amount of ginned-up optimism can resolve the very real problems. Greece owes lots of institutions lots of money, and it has to pay it back -- or at least persuade the Germans to pay it back -- and then develop goods and services that people in other countries will pay for. The U.S., however, is not Greece. This country has the world's largest market, which means that our own consumers' confidence has a positive impact on the overall economy. (China, for example, needs other countries' consumers to buy their stuff in order to grow.) If Americans started feeling good about the economy, it could spark a positive feedback loop.
Economists know this. In fact, most of the big problem-solving ideas come down to different forms of nationwide economic group therapy, ways of improving the outlook of American consumers and businesspeople. Of course, being economists, they disagree on how best to do this. A majority of economists (about two-thirds, I'd guess, but I've never seen a good poll) support a Keynesian approach -- meaning that the government should spend a lot of money (through infrastructure projects, for example), which will create enough activity to spur self-sustaining confidence. The opponents of stimulus -- largely the Chicago School and many political leaders in Europe -- argue that the only way to make people and businesses feel more optimistic is to cut government spending, pay down debt and also (somehow) lower taxes and reduce regulation at the same time. Those measures, they argue, will get private companies to invest and hire.
In the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek -- founding fathers of the stimulus and anti-stimulus schools, respectively -- would sometimes share a meal. While they disagreed on so much, they seem to have liked and respected each other and could talk constructively about their different ideas. I sometimes imagine a world in which major economic decisions were run like a Keynes-Hayek lunch. Nonpartisan technocrats would look at the economic data over long periods and refine theories rooted in data and impervious to breathlessly reported new estimates. They would always keep in mind that, indeed, every bit of data is an estimate, not a certainty, and that no theory has been definitively proved. We can't be sure that world would result in better economic policies or inspire more confidence. But at least the economy wouldn't be so vulnerable to the modern news cycle.
Deep thoughts this week
1. The jobs number is not just a reflection of the economy.
2. It indirectly affects it.
3. Economics has a lot in common with group therapy.

HEADLINE: Former Russian Minister Warns of Economic Ebb

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- President Vladimir V. Putin was all swagger last week at the annual economic forum here, effectively wagging a finger at Europe over its fiscal problems and keeping the chief executives of some of the world's most powerful oil companies waiting for hours in a hallway until he finally met with them. In the forum's keynote address, Mr. Putin boasted of Russia's relatively low debt burden, balanced budget and ''fiscal discipline.''
But the man largely credited with putting Russia in this enviable position, the former minister of finance, Aleksei L. Kudrin, warned at a news conference on Saturday that Russia was in danger of falling into a recession and that Mr. Putin should delay much of the increased social and military spending that he announced during his recent campaign for the presidency. 
Mr. Kudrin, who was ousted from the government last year after protesting rising military spending, said he listened to presentations and speeches at the forum, where Russian officials typically woo foreign investors, and heard expressions of ''worry'' and discussions of ''worst-case scenarios.''
Still, he said, ''the situation is a lot worse than it was presented.'' With Europe apparently slithering into recession this summer, Russia is now more likely than not to suffer a crisis of its own this year, he said. While he acknowledged that other economists were less worried about Russia than he is, he said, ''I saw even less worry in the Russian government.''
Banks and investors are already pulling money out of Russia, he said in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the close of the three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, while indications from Europe worsen by the day.
Mr. Putin, in contrast, spoke of Europe's turmoil largely to highlight that Russia is better off.
The gross domestic product, Mr. Putin said, will grow 4.3 percent this year. Money the government salted away in sovereign wealth funds from oil profits is ready to prop up businesses in a crisis, he said. And Russia's debt, measured as a proportion of economic output, is one-tenth that of the United States and many European countries.
Mr. Putin, in an apparent reference to the West, said heads of state must show ''effective leadership and a responsible course of action'' to halt the euro zone sovereign debt crisis.
''That means a balanced-budget policy, control over state debt and fiscal discipline,'' he said. ''Rampant financial speculation and political populism are equally dangerous.''
But Mr. Kudrin said Mr. Putin might need to rethink some of his own populism and renege on spending promises. Otherwise, Mr. Kudrin said, Russia's budget could become too vulnerable to a downturn in global oil prices.
During this year's presidential campaign, Mr. Putin announced higher wages, better maternity leave benefits and greatly expanded military spending in the coming decade.
''We need to look again at all programs being launched or expanded,'' Mr. Kudrin said. ''Even our current expenditures will be difficult to meet.''
To balance even this year's more modest budget, Russia needs oil prices for European export of $117 a barrel or higher; the price on Friday was $90.37. Russia's economy suffers when oil prices decline. The Kremlin, Mr. Kudrin said, should brace itself for an extended oil price slump to $60 per barrel or lower.
The forum, an annual event here in Mr. Putin's hometown, reflected many of the challenges ahead, for Russia and the world.
Panel discussions focused on topics like continuing safety concerns about nuclear power one year after the disaster in Japan and the question of whether China's remarkable economic growth has run its course, leaving a risk of stagnation.
Mr. Kudrin did allow that his former boss's speech struck a positive note in highlighting new business-friendly laws and promising a new round of privatization of state enterprises to shore up the budget. In his address, Mr. Putin said these privatizations would be conducted more fairly than those in the 1990s.
Mr. Kudrin said the actions would matter more than talk. ''Putin's speech was good, if it is realized,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report from Rio on Environment a 'Suicide Note'

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The recent United Nations conference on sustainable development, commonly known as Rio+20, was so lacking in hard targets and enforceable goals that some participants were derisively calling it "Rio Minus 20." One activist called it "a failure of epic proportions" --- and that wasn't one of the stronger verdicts. 

 BODY:
The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development has wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro - contentiously so - marking two decades since the first Earth Summit was held, also in Rio, in 1992. 
The recent three-day meeting was more easily known as Rio+20, but so few specifics, so few targets, so few tangible decisions came out of the gathering that some participants were derisively calling it "Rio Minus 20," or "Rio Plus 20 Minus 40." 
"A failure of epic proportions" was the verdict from Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International. 
3 days of empty rhetoric and greenwash from world leaders. #RioPlus20: a failure of epic proportions greenpeace.org/international/
- Kumi Naidoo (@kuminaidoo) June 22, 2012
More than a year of "sophisticated U.N. diplomacy has given us nothing more than more poverty, more conflict and more environmental destruction," said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director for conservation at the World Wildlife Fund. 
"An outcome that makes nobody happy," was how Sha Zukang of China put it - and he was the Rio+20 secretary-general.
The final statement from Rio, is 283 paragraphs of kumbaya that "affirm," "recognize," "underscore," "urge" and "acknowledge" seemingly every green initiative and environmental problem from water crises and creeping deserts to climate change and overfishing. Women's rights, indigenous peoples, children, mining, tourism, trade unions and the elderly also get shout-outs in the document. 
The word "reaffirm" is used 60 times. 
As the German daily Sddeutsche Zeitung wrote in an editorial:
To be sure, all of the great questions facing humanity make an appearance in the document, but without any attempt at a binding agreement. The Rio+20 conference, which really should have provided a new spark, has instead shined the spotlight on global timidity. Postpone, consider, examine: Even the conference motto - "The Future We Want" - sounds like an insult. If this is the future we want, then good night.
If all countries are satisfied with the lowest common denominator, if they no longer want to discuss what needs to be discussed . . . then the dikes are open. There is no need anymore for a conference of 50,000 attendees. Resolutions that are so wishy-washy can be interpreted by every member state as they wish. No one needs Rio.
Mr. Naidoo called the final report the "longest suicide note in history." Jim Leape, director general of the wildlife fund, said it was "a colossal failure of leadership and vision from diplomats."
#rioplus20 too much "take note" and "reaffirm" an too little "decide" and "commit". Big task now for UN nations to follow up #rioplussocial
- Connie Hedegaard (@CHedegaardEU) June 19, 2012
One of the few things the summit meeting did actually decide: the establishment of "a universal intergovernmental high level political forum" to replace another U.N. commission. 
The German tabloid Bild wrote: "Shame on you summit participants!"
"We've sunk so low in our expectationsthat reaffirming what we did 20 years ago is now considered a success," said Martin Khor of the U.N. Committee on Development Policy.
Many mealy-mouthed words coming out of #rioplus20. It's simply not adequate. Governments need a clear action plan virg.in/YrKRI
- richardbranson (@richardbranson) June 20, 2012
The organizers and some activists took some solace in agreements and pledges being made on the sidelines of the official meeting. Australia and the Maldives are moving to protect large swaths of their boundary waters, for example, amid a wider recognition that the world's oceans are in trouble from overfishing, acidification and pollution. 
The oceanographer Sylvia Earle, explorer-in-residence with National Geographic, said she heard from a fellow panelist in Rio that "we have to get over the idea that the ocean is too big to fail."
Otherwise, though, Ms. Earle said, "Concerning oceans, there is reason to suggest that the outcomes could be characterized as Rio+20 minus 40."
Both environmental activists and government negotiators seemed to agree that the Rio summit meeting was perhaps too big to succeed, with its 188 government negotiators and tens of thousands of panelists, observers and attendees. 
(Some of the more colorful moments were described by our colleagues on the Green blog, and on Dot Earth, Andrew Revkin looks at an initiative on sustainable energy led by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations.) 
"I think the expectation that there is one document or one approach that can solve one of the major questions of our time - how do you maintain economic growth and protect the environment? - there's not one paper that can do that," said Kerri-Ann Jones, U.S. assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. 
In an op-ed in The International Herald Tribune, two Rio attendees wrote that government negotiators "spent months negotiating a document that ended up being watered down almost to the point of worthlessness because of their lack of vision and their governments' lack of leadership." 
"But as presidents of two major environmental groups who attended the Earth Summit, we disagree that Rio+20 was a failure," said Frances G. Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice. 
A condensed excerpt from their piece:
We can do this ourselves. 
We saw in the myriad Rio+20-related announcements from countries, communities and companies around the globe that they were taking action themselves - irrespective of any United Nations document.
We heard it from the young people who spoke at Rio+20 - sometimes through tears and with cracking voices - about the fears they have for the world we're leaving for them. 
The fact that 50,000 people came to Rio and that hundreds of thousands more participated virtually through technologies like YouTube and Twitter made that loud and clear. The incredible energy and the enthusiasm they demonstrated is only a hint of what individuals can do. 
As our colleagues Simon Romero and John Broder wrote from Rio, even if the meeting laid out no enforceable goals or specific road maps, it perhaps signaled "a new assertiveness by developing nations in international forums and the growing capacity of grass-roots organizations and corporations to mold effective environmental action without the blessing of governments."
Ms. Earle, the National Geographic explorer, was somewhat heartened that the summit meeting had again put a spotlight, if only briefly, on environmental issues that have perhaps been overlooked, diminished or pushed aside due to the world economic malaise and calls for government austerity. 
We'd love to know your thoughts about Rio+20, and also about sustainability, green initiatives and the most pressing ecological issues. Are large-scale gatherings like Rio worth the time, the cost and the carbon footprint? Is sustainable development even possible, given the current state of the world economy? Should developing countries be held to less stringent rules on greenhouse emissions, for example, than developed economies? Think globally, act locally - for everyday folks is this the best way forward? 
We appreciate your comments. And as always, speak freely.

HEADLINE: Presidential Geography: New Hampshire

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Population shifts have helped make New Hampshire one of the nation's presidential battlegrounds and is a major focus of both the Obama and Romney campaigns. 

 BODY:
Every four years, the glare of the nation's political spotlight fixes on New Hampshire. But the moment is usually brief. For most of the period since World War II, the state's outsize influence on presidential politics has been limited to the nominating process. During the general election campaign, New Hampshire has been shunted offstage, turned into a background player.
The reason: There was no suspense about the results. The Republican candidate carried the state in every election but one from 1948 until 1988, winning by 29 percentage points in 1980, 38 points in 1984 and 26 points in 1988.
Since then, however, population shifts have helped make New Hampshire one of the nation's presidential battlegrounds. In 2012, the state -- despite carrying just four electoral votes -- is among the most important and is a major focus of both campaigns. Mitt Romney began a recent bus tour of America's small towns in Stratham, N.H., and President Obama is scheduled to visit Strafford County on Monday.
For Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney -- both of whom are mapping out routes to the 270 electoral votes needed to take the presidency -- New Hampshire represents not just four votes, but four of the final votes needed to get to, or stay in, the White House. On some of those maps, New Hampshire is the final push across the finish line.
FiveThirtyEight spoke with Andrew Smith, who knows New Hampshire as well as almost anyone. Mr. Smith is the director of the University of New Hampshire's Survey Center and an associate professor of political science there.
New Hampshire has gradually become more competitive because of a political imbalance in the voters who are being added to the rolls and those who are leaving them. New voters -- both people who have moved into the state and younger people who have reached voting age -- are more Democratic than the residents who are leaving the state or dying. 
"A third of the potential electorate in 2008 couldn't vote in the state in 2000, either because they didn't live in the state or because they weren't old enough," Mr. Smith said. The changes have dramatically changed New Hampshire's political landscape from among the most Republican states in the Northeast to one where Mr. Obama was able to win every county in 2008.
But Mr. Obama is unlikely to do as well this year. The recession has slowed the number of newcomers, arresting the state's shift to the left. Moreover, Mr. Romney's brand of Republicanism -- fiscally minded but less strident than many Republicans on social issues -- resonates with many New Hampshire voters. The state, like many others, swung wholly to the right in 2010, and both parties now have areas of support they can count on. The winner in New Hampshire, Mr. Smith said, is likely to be determined by which campaign can get more of their people to the polls.
The Democratic strongholds in New Hampshire start with the Connecticut River Valley in the southwest, which runs from the Massachusetts border north through Keene to Hanover and Lebanon. It is an area filled with college students and is a popular destination for affluent retirees from New York who have bought second homes in the area's mountains.
New Hampshire's coast is also a left-leaning region, with a heavy concentration of Democrats in Portsmouth and Durham, where the University of New Hampshire is located, and in old mill towns like Somersworth, Rollinsford and Rochester.
The heart of the Republicans' territory lies between the coast and Cheshire and Sullivan counties in the west. Though the cities of Nashua and Manchester vote Democratic, the small towns around them are solidly Republican (Hudson, Windham, Salem, Derry and Pelham, for example).
Somewhat paradoxically, the towns close to New Hampshire's border with loyally liberal Massachusetts are also Republican territory. "Democrats call that area 'the Bermuda Triangle,' where Democratic candidates go to die," Mr. Smith said.
The Bellwether: Merrimack County
Merrimack County, which is home to New Hampshire's capital, Concord, has been a close barometer of the Democrats' statewide strength since 2000, with Democratic support in the county consistently about 2 percentage points stronger than their statewide share of the vote. Concord itself, with its government workers, is solidly Democratic, but the towns surrounding it are Republican, almost balancing out the county.
The Bottom Line 
According to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, Mr. Obama is a 71 percent favorite to win New Hampshire, just slightly better than his current odds of winning the election over all, 63 percent.
But New Hamphire has an unusually large number of swing voters and may be especially responsive to changes in the national mood. The state is eighth on FiveThirtyEight's list of top Tipping Point states, ahead of electoral-vote-rich states like Michigan and North Carolina. It is also third on our Return on Investment Index, which measures "the relative likelihood that an individual voter would determine the Electoral College winner."
There are a fair number of plausible cases under which its four electoral votes might prove to be decisive, securing a second term for Mr. Obama or a first for Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: Preparing to Respond to Landmark Decisions

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Rarely have the black-robed justices at the Supreme Court held so much potential for dominating the political conversation. 

 BODY:
THE CANDIDATES Aides to Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, are prepared to use the court's rulings to their advantage, no matter how they turn out.
If the court strikes down the health care law, they will argue that Mr. Obama lost his biggest legacy. If the court upholds it, they will argue that Mr. Romney is the last hope for conservatives seeking to undo the law.
The immigration law, which gives the police in Arizona broad power to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally, is trickier for Mr. Romney, who faces the task of increasing his appeal among Latinos while not pushing away Tea Party conservatives.
Mr. Obama is traveling to the Northeast on Monday, so a ruling that day would quickly frame his trip. Aides have been exceptionally quiet about their preparations for a response on the health care law, but they are thought to be readying a furious response in case it is shot down.
The president has been pretty clear about Arizona's immigration law. He does not like it, and will put pressure on Mr. Romney to oppose it if it is upheld.
CAPITOL HILL In a memorandum to House Republicans on Thursday, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio urged his colleagues to avoid "spiking" the ball if the court strikes down Mr. Obama's health care law. The message: We are focused on the economy.
Still, Mr. Boehner promised his colleagues that the Republican-controlled House would move quickly to repeal "any part of Obamacare that is left standing" by the court.
In the Democratic-controlled Senate, the task would be to protect what is left and try to rebuild the rest - if it can.
Congress is unlikely to do anything on immigration this year, regardless of what the court says about the Arizona law.
INTEREST GROUPS Advocacy organizations have their press releases ready, their surrogates standing by and their outrage primed for both rulings.
Supporters of the health care law are preparing to assail the Supreme Court as political and out of touch if it strikes down the law. They will argue that re-electing Mr. Obama is critical to rein in what they call an out-of-control conservative majority on the court.
Opponents of the law are expecting to offer an outpouring of anger if it is upheld. Tea Party groups, which were born out of the summertime rage over health care in 2009, will stoke that anger.
Immigration activists on both sides are preparing to use the court's ruling to promote their causes. If the justices uphold the law, expect a push for similar rules in other states. If they strike it down, immigration rights groups will use that as an incentive to press for a broader overhaul of the immigration system.
INSURERS The insurance industry has been quietly preparing for the court's health care ruling for months. If the court strikes down the requirement that everyone must buy insurance - a mandate considered a boon to the industry - insurers will be ready with proposals for how to change the rest of the law so that they are not saddled by costs from other elements of the legislation.
If the entire law is struck down, the industry is prepared to go back to square one - though a full-blown debate over health care is all but certain to wait until after the November elections.
THE MEDIA News organizations are preparing for a huge week that could have a drastic effect on the election fight. Television networks and cable broadcasters are preparing special reports, newspapers are ready to deploy armies of reporters, and Twitter is hoping not to crash amid a crush of posts after the rulings.
The biggest challenge for the news media (and the politicians) will be making sense of complicated rulings in the moments after they are issued. Especially in the health care case, the decision will probably not be a simple "yes" or "no." Rather, there will most likely be nuanced points in long opinions.
But the imperatives of the news business will prevail. Expect headlines and Twitter posts to boil the news down quickly to "court upholds health care law" or "court strikes down mandate" shortly after the decision is announced.

HEADLINE: Your Ad Here, on a Fire Truck? Broke Cities Sell Naming Rights

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- Should this city's red fire trucks be transformed into rolling billboards?
After Baltimore officials made the wrenching decision to close three fire companies later this summer, the City Council initially sought to avert the cuts with a new money-raising strategy: it passed a resolution this month urging the administration to explore selling ads on the city's fire trucks.
It is far from clear whether corporate logos will be painted on Baltimore's fire engines any time soon. Officials in Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration have expressed doubts about whether the proposal would generate enough money to keep even one fire company open.
But in exploring the option, Baltimore is joining dozens of other financially struggling cities, transit systems and school districts around the country that are trying to weather the economic downturn by selling advertisements, naming rights and sponsorships to raise money. 
Such marketing schemes have long been used by sports teams and some arts organizations. But now, straphangers in Philadelphia buy fare cards blazoned with ads for McDonald's and ride the Broad Street Line to AT&T Station (formerly Pattison Station), where the turnstiles bear the company's familiar blue and white globe.
KFC became a pioneer in this kind of unconventional ad placement earlier in the downturn, when it temporarily plastered its logo on manhole covers and fire hydrants in several cities in Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee after paying to fill potholes and replace hydrants.
Pizza chains now advertise on some school buses, as a growing number of states consider allowing school districts to sell ads. The Baltimore City Council member who wrote the legislation urging the city to sell ads on fire trucks, William Welch, said he was simply trying to find a way to help the city meet its growing needs in a time of dwindling revenues and support.
''As I've looked at budgets, they get bigger with less support from the federal and state governments,'' Mr. Welch said. ''And we can't tax people out of existence. We're trying, our mayor's trying, to bring 10,000 more people back to Baltimore city. And if you have an increasing fee or tax structure, you're not going to be able to do that. So you have to create alternatives.''
But some fear that accepting ads could send the wrong message. When the town of Tyngsborough, Mass., recently considered selling ads to raise money for its fleet of police cars, Chief William F. Mulligan had concerns.
''Because of what we do, we like to be neutral,'' he said. ''Say there were two shopping plazas, and one advertised and one didn't. Would that company feel like we weren't treating them fairly?'' The proposal was ultimately rejected.
Even before the recession, the small police department in Littleton, Mass., started an ''advertise with the good guys'' program that raised money from a local supermarket chain to pay for new police cars in exchange for ad space on their fenders and trunks. Minneapolis ran antismoking ads on the hose covers of some fire trucks. In Phoenix, local health care providers sponsor safety messages on several fire trucks, with the proceeds going to a charity run by the firefighters' union that helps the victims of fires, local children and the poor.
Rescue helicopters could get ads, too. With budget cuts threatening to ground the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office helicopter in Syracuse, officials there hope to sell ads on it to keep it flying. ''Some people think it's a great idea to help support public budgets,'' said John Balloni, a chief in the sheriff's office, ''and some people are a little put off by the idea that we're getting sponsorship for what used to be a government duty, if you will.''
The downturn seems to have prompted more public entities to sell advertising or auction off the naming rights of public places, said Elizabeth Ben-Ishai, the campaign coordinator for the Public Citizen's Commercial Alert project, which works to curb the spread of commercialization. ''We are bombarded by ads everywhere we go, and these are public spaces meant to be reflective of the values of our society, co-opted by the private sector,'' she said.
Transit systems across the nation have been particularly aggressive in recent years in trying to sell the naming rights of stations. They are struggling with an estimated $77.7 billion shortfall just to get to a state of good repair, at a time of growing ridership, shrinking state support and budgetary shortfalls.
In Brooklyn, new signs went up last month at the Atlantic Avenue subway stop bearing a sponsored addition to its name: Barclays Center, for which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is being paid $4 million over 20 years. Cleveland recently named its new Bus Rapid Transit system the HealthLine after it received $6.25 million over 25 years from the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. (''The HealthLine is not a number to call for free medical advice, any more than Quicken Loans Arena is where you go to take out a loan,'' its Web site notes.) And last month the Chicago Transit Authority began the process of selling the naming rights of 11 ''L'' stations.
Such naming deals have grown more popular with advertisers as they try to reach consumers who have grown more adept at tuning out commercials, whether with remote controls or digital video recorders.
''All we're ever looking for is not only to do something good for the community, but to find another place for eyeballs to be looking at things,'' said Jody Berg, the principal of Media Works, a communications company based in Baltimore, who added that the city could find appropriate sponsors in fields like health care, education, sports or insurance.
But the ads would have to raise a great deal of money to avoid the fire company closings, which are expected to save the city more than $6 million a year.
It was three years ago that Baltimore began closing a few different firehouses each day -- known as ''rotating closures'' or ''rolling brownouts'' -- in what officials hoped would be a temporary move to tide them over until better times arrived. But with economic times still tough and no indication that the city will be able to afford to keep all of its 54 fire companies open any time soon, fire officials said it would be better to choose three to close permanently, giving them the predictability and stability they need to make plans to keep the city covered.
''Back in '09, we thought maybe this will last a year,'' Fire Chief James S. Clack said. ''It's been three years. Our finance folks are telling us that the budget is not going to get significantly better for several more years. So it's time to make a decision.''
At a hearing last week in the city's ornate Council chambers -- its marble and brass a reminder of a more opulent age -- neighbors expressed anxiety at the thought of losing fire protection, as union officials told of a young man having a heart attack who had been saved by one of the companies scheduled to close that morning. Members of the Council expressed grave misgivings about closing the companies for good.
Even if the plan to sell ads on fire trucks fizzles, ads and sponsorships will most likely be coming to Baltimore soon: last week the city began seeking an advertising company to help it sell naming rights and ads and other sponsorships for city buildings, recreation centers and parks.

HEADLINE: New Pension Rules Seek Disclosure

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Cities, states and the millions of Americans who work for them will soon face new accounting rules that will require many local governments to disclose pension obligations that were hidden until now, stepping up the pressure to rein in public workers' benefits.
The new rules are the result of more than five years of work by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board on one of the most contentious topics the agency has ever tackled. The current rules have been criticized for making pensions look more affordable than they really are and creating incentives for governments to take undue risks with taxpayer money.
In many struggling municipalities, the coming changes, which are expected to be ratified by the board on Monday, could lead to credit rating downgrades, making it more expensive to borrow. The rules do not take full effect until 2015, but some governments are likely to adopt them sooner.
Many economists and fiscal watchdogs say the new rules will not reveal the true cost of public pensions, allowing some states and cities to promise more than they can afford. In Washington, there have been calls to strip municipalities of their ability to issue tax-exempt bonds if they do not report their pension numbers more rigorously. 
''This is still a flawed accounting system,'' said Joshua D. Rauh, an associate professor of finance at Northwestern University. He says states should measure their pension promises much as an insurance company sets the price of an annuity -- using the market rates for so-called risk-free bonds that are considered very safe. Using that standard, many states appear to have promised far more than they can reliably pay.
Robert H. Attmore, chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, said the organization had considered using such an approach. ''We decided that it was not appropriate in the government environment,'' he said. ''I understand why it's favored in the private sector, but governments are different.''
The controversy centers on the way governments measure their future payments to retirees in today's dollars, a common financial calculation known as discounting. The accounting board has devised a method that will require severely depleted pension funds to factor in the likelihood that they will run out of money at some point, and have to borrow to pay retirees their benefits.
Healthier plans will be allowed to discount future payments as they do now.
Some pension funds will soon be reporting higher costs, and bigger shortfalls, than they do now. Last year, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College tried to determine how much bigger, using its public pension database. As of 2010, those plans reported having, in aggregate, 76 cents on hand for every dollar they must pay retirees in the future. The center's director, Alicia H. Munnell, estimated that if the new accounting rules had been in effect, the funds would have reported just 57 cents on the dollar.
For states and cities that are not required to use the new discounting method, the value of their pension obligations will look about the same as today. Robert C. North Jr., the chief actuary for New York City, said its five big pension plans would probably be in that group, although he would have to run tests to be sure. The current accounting rules make New York City's plans look almost perfectly funded. Using the risk-free method, Mr. North has said, there would be shortfalls running into the billions of dollars.
Mr. Attmore declined to predict which states and cities would bear the brunt of the board's rule changes, but said that, in general, it would be those that had failed, year after year, to set aside as much money as their actuaries instructed. Such plans include those operated by Illinois, New Jersey and Kentucky.
Ms. Munnell's research suggested the biggest loser would be the Illinois teachers' pension fund, which would have been able to claim just 18 cents on the dollar if the new rules had been in place in 2010. Experts say when a plan is that depleted, it is almost impossible to revive. Top officials of the Illinois teachers' plan have acknowledged that its problems are severe.
Ed Derman, deputy chief executive of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, said he was concerned the fund would have to use the board's new method, making it a lightning rod for critics who say public workers' benefits cost too much.
In California, the cost of teachers' pensions is split among the state, the school districts and the teachers themselves -- but the state's contribution rate is set by lawmakers in Sacramento, and they have refused to increase it to make up for what was lost in the two big market crashes of the last decade.
Because of the state's inadequate contributions, Mr. Derman said, the teachers' fund is at risk of running out of money in 35 years, so it will probably have to use the new discounting method. Its shortfall, now $65 billion, would look bigger. He worried that taxpayers would conclude that teachers' benefits needed to be cut, not that the state needed to contribute more money.
''People are going to misunderstand,'' he said, adding that the same problem might appear in other places where pension contributions were set by state law.
That is not the only change looming. Existing rules let thousands of cities, towns and school districts that have promised pensions to their workers go without reporting any obligations at all. As the new rules take hold, hidden local debts will become more evident.
These unseen obligations have been growing in states that run big, pooled pension systems for local governments, as most states do, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Under current rules, such pooled systems report an aggregate pension obligation for their member governments, with no requirement that each municipality reveal its share of the total.
New York State runs such a pooled system, for example, and it reports total obligations of $177 billion. But a city like Buffalo, which participates in the system, is not required to report how much of that total it is responsible for. Buffalo's financial statements say only that it contributed $27 million to the system last year, a fact that offers little insight into why Buffalo's required contributions are rising, or whether it can afford them.
The California teachers' fund is also pooled, and Mr. Derman said local school district officials ''are obviously very concerned'' about having to start disclosing their shares of the total.
''It may be more difficult for them to float a bond,'' he said.
The accounting board has also taken aim at the tendency of current rules to let states and cities delay the recognition of costs. Existing rules call for governments to spread new costs over 30 years, but many restart the 30-year countdown every year, while others simply spread their costs indefinitely, a recipe for sticking tomorrow's taxpayers with today's bills.
Mr. Attmore of the standards board said the new rules would require some costs to be recognized immediately, for example, when a city or state decided to sweeten benefits retroactively, years after the work had been performed. Certain other costs, like investment losses, would be spread over five years, making it likelier that today's local taxpayers would pay for today's services.
The board will also do away with the commonplace practice of ''smoothing'' the value of pension investments, or spreading the recognition of market gains and losses over several years. The standard actuarial practice has been used in many places as a tool for engineering pension numbers.
Illinois, for example, adopted a new smoothing technique in 2009, when its funded ratio had plunged to a frightening 33 percent; the change pumped the ratio up to 43 percent, at least on paper.

HEADLINE: A Governor Trying to Elude the Sophomore Slump

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the consummate strategist, ran out of leverage this spring.
A year after the governor made headlines by winning approval of same-sex marriage, lawmakers concluded their second legislative session under Mr. Cuomo last week on an anticlimactic note. And perhaps that is no surprise.
Mr. Cuomo used his power over the decennial redistricting process to win some victories in March: He was able to get lawmakers, who wanted him to sign the gerrymandered legislative maps they had drawn, to agree to curb pension benefits for future public workers, to create a more rigorous system for evaluating schoolteachers, and to take the first step toward legalizing a significant expansion of casino gambling. 
But those victories came at a cost. After Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the much-maligned redistricting maps into law, his influence over the Legislature, and particularly the Republican-led Senate, ebbed. The Senate spurned his calls to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and to rewrite campaign finance laws, and rejected a proposal by Assembly Democrats to raise the minimum wage.
By some measures, it was a quiet session. An analysis by the New York Public Interest Research Group found that the Legislature passed fewer bills this year than any other since at least 1914. Of course, given how derided much of the legislation that emerges from Albany is, that is not necessarily a bad thing.
The governor, who tends to praise the Legislature and his own accomplishments effusively in public, allowed some frustration to show in a recent radio interview, in which he took a rare shot at the Senate Republicans, a caucus that he has successfully courted throughout his tenure. ''I think there's no doubt that the State Senate heard the conservative wing of the party,'' he said, ''and they're reacting to it, and that will now be an issue in this campaign season.''
Mr. Cuomo did have achievements in the second half of the year: For example, the Legislature agreed to create a new state agency to police abuse and neglect of people with developmental disabilities and mental illnesses, which Mr. Cuomo had said was his top priority. But there were setbacks, too, like the dissolution, for now, of the governor's proposal to help a Malaysian casino company build the nation's largest convention center in Queens. And there are still significant problems, including the fact that much of upstate New York remains economically battered.
That said, the governor's poll numbers have been consistently high. He has restored a sense that the state is being competently managed after a remarkably chaotic period of scandal, and in winning the passage of same-sex marriage, as well as a cap on property tax increases, he was able to establish his brand as a fiscal moderate and a social progressive.
Mr. Cuomo has chosen superlatives like ''exceptional'' and ''extraordinary'' to describe his tenure, and he has called the last year and a half ''one of the most successful in modern political history.'' But he also faces challenges that are common among governors in their sophomore years: finding new ideas to excite the second half of their terms, and maintaining the negotiating muscle to deliver on promises.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Cuomo said he had understood his strategic limitations heading into the year and responded by front-loading his calendar. Last December, he mitigated much of the projected state deficit by restructuring New York's tax code, lowering taxes for the middle class while creating a new high-tax bracket for the state's top earners. Sensing that his hand would weaken after the middle of the session, he said, he pushed through most of his policy ideas before the end of March.
''This is a dynamic of dealing with legislative bodies,'' he said.
In the first three months of the year, Mr. Cuomo said, negotiations over the budget and redistricting gave him and lawmakers what he called ''an exponential point of mutuality,'' adding, ''We need a better word than leverage.''
''I know in years past, during my father, we didn't think this way,'' he said, seated in the same office his father, Mario M. Cuomo, occupied as governor from 1983 to 1994. ''Basically, you just proposed what you proposed.''
However, Mr. Cuomo said, he concluded that it was important to acknowledge shifting dynamics over the course of a legislative session.
''There's a rhythm to the legislative session and there are rhythms to legislative sessions,'' he said. ''So I think that's very important to take into consideration when you are deciding what to do when.''
The governor will have more opportunities to influence the Legislature. Lawmakers have not received a pay raise in a dozen years, and they are eager to approve one after this fall's election, giving Mr. Cuomo another ''point of mutuality.'' On Friday, he said he was ''open to it,'' though he will doubtless seek support for elements of his policy agenda in return.
The governor, who has been talked about as a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was happy to discuss his strategy for dealing with the Legislature, but demurred when asked if the same tactics could work with Congress.
''We were having such a nice conversation,'' he said, smiling. ''Why? Why do you feel the need?''

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Insure Bank Deposits

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- An organization that serves as an umbrella institution for the world's largest central banks on Sunday joined a growing list of institutions and leaders pushing euro zone countries to insure bank deposits and take other steps to prevent the European debt crisis from further undermining the global economy.
The organization, the Bank for International Settlements, warned that central banks could not cope with the euro zone crisis alone. The central banks are nearing the limits of their resources, the organization said in its annual report, and it is time for policy makers to act. 
''Central banks are being cornered into prolonging monetary stimulus, as governments drag their feet and adjustment is delayed,'' the organization said. ''It would be a mistake to think that central bankers can use their balance sheets to solve every economic and financial problem.''
The unusually sharp language reflected frustration among central bankers at the risks they have assumed to fight a crisis that has continued to worsen. Through emergency lending to commercial banks or large purchases of government bonds, central banks in the United States, Europe and other developed countries have more than doubled the money that they have at risk in the last decade, the organization said. The sum equals about 30 percent of global economic output, or $18 trillion, it said.
The Bank for International Settlements, based in Basel, Switzerland, acts as a place where central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, can conduct transactions with one another. It also serves as a forum for central bankers to discuss issues like economic policy or bank regulation. Members of its board include Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan; Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve; and Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.
Stephen G. Cecchetti, the organization's chief economist, said the views in the annual report were those of the institution and not necessarily of its board.
The message, however, was in tune with recent statements by Mr. Draghi and others that political leaders must move much more urgently to contain the debt crisis.
A growing number of policy makers, including Mr. Draghi and now the Bank for International Settlements, have been pressing euro zone leaders to quickly lay the groundwork for a so-called banking union to end the fatal embrace of overly indebted governments and poorly capitalized banks.
''The first step has to be the banks,'' Mr. Cecchetti said during a conference call with reporters. ''If you can make sure the banks are solid, then the banks are not putting weights on the sovereigns and the banks are able to support real economic activity.''
A banking union would include a deposit guarantee fund to reassure depositors that their money is safe and prevent bank runs in places like Spain. A banking union would also have a powerful, centralized banking supervisor instead of the hodgepodge of national regulators that now exist. And it would have a fund used to wind down failed banks so that taxpayers would not need to bear the burden.
''The conclusion is hard to escape that a Pan-European financial market and a Pan-European central bank require a Pan-European banking system,'' the Bank for International Settlements said.
The report warned that bank deposits were already flowing out of countries perceived as vulnerable. By May, Greek banks had lost about one-third of their foreign deposits and one-quarter of domestic deposits, and the outflow seemed to be accelerating, the report said.
Money is also flowing out of Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and into banks in Germany and the Netherlands that are perceived as safer. The organization regularly collects data on the flow of money between countries.
While Europe is the center of the crisis, the report said, other regions are experiencing similar problems.
''At its root the European crisis is a potential harbinger,'' the report said, ''a virulent and advanced convergence of the problems to be expected elsewhere if policy fails to break the vicious cycles generated by the global weaknesses we describe in this report -- sectoral imbalances, excess leverage, public overindebtedness and overburdened central banks.''

HEADLINE: Polarized Over Health Care, United on Drama of Ruling

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers are not usually eager to get back to Washington after a weekend in their districts, especially during campaign season. But Representative Michele Bachmann boarded a flight from Minnesota on Sunday night -- even though the House will not meet until Tuesday -- to make sure she would not miss the Washington moment she has been excitedly anticipating, the Supreme Court ruling on President Obama's health care law.
''The decision on Obamacare goes well beyond health care,'' Mrs. Bachmann, a Republican and a vocal opponent of the law, wrote in an e-mail. It ''will determine whether or not the court believes the government has a right to mandate that Americans buy a product or service, a direct impact on our freedom and liberty.''
The impending heath care ruling by the Supreme Court has become this city's O. J. Simpson verdict crossed with a papal conclave -- polarizing, maddeningly unpredictable and shrouded in mysterious signaling. The ruling is expected to come this week, either shortly after 10 a.m. on Monday, the last scheduled day of the term, or on an extra day later in the week. 
For members of Congress, health care lobbyists, campaign officials and thousands of lawyers (and the thousands more who have just taken the LSATs) who populate the squat office buildings across the district, the wait for the fate of the health care law has become all consuming.
They constantly check Scotusblog, a Web site devoted to the doings of the court. They play Health Reform Bracketology, a Web site where they can choose among various possible outcomes. They fret, write multiple versions of news releases and fret some more, wondering when the decision will be revealed.
For some it is mere wonkery, but for many more the decision means something concrete: ideology, money and an electoral wedge. Coming at the crest of a contentious presidential campaign, it will be the beginning of the end of one of the most divisive policy battles in decades, one that helped set off the Tea Party movement and became the central conflict in the raging political war between Republicans and Democrats over the proper role and scope of government.
''This is such high drama,'' said Andrew Rosenberg, a partner specializing in health care at Thorn Run Partners, a government relations firm. ''Because you have this decision that everybody knows was made months ago in a town that notoriously does not keep secrets well with such unprecedented implications for one-sixth of the economy.''
The frenzy is just as palpable on the left as it is on the right. For Karen Davenport, the director of health policy at the National Women's Law Center, it is ''the first thing I think about when I get up in the morning'' and the topic she spends most of her day talking about with colleagues. Sitting in a meeting last Thursday, one of several days the court could have ruled on the health care law, ''I was watching my iPhone the whole time,'' she said. ''You can't help but have that hamster in the wheel in your head over the various outcomes. It's a very anxious time.''
The two most engaged groups are probably those made up of people who have spent their entire professional lives working on health care policy and House Republicans who have devoted much of the 112th Congress to trying to overturn or defunding various aspects of the law.
Mrs. Bachmann instructed her staff to reserve space at the House triangle -- a spot of green outside the House side of the Capitol -- where she plans to hold a news conference within 90 minutes of the decision. After that, she plans to head over to the Supreme Court to join Tea Party groups who are expected to gather there.
The press offices of most Congressional Republicans are busy preparing three or four versions of news releases they hope to send out moments after the decision is announced, along with missives for their constituents.
''We're working on the language now,'' said Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, who has given several interviews on the topic with reporters back home. ''It's certainly on the hearts and minds of everybody.''
Richard Mourdock, the Republican nominee for the Senate from Indiana, had his recorded versions of a response spread across the Internet last week.
For the last eight weeks, members of Speaker John A. Boehner's staff have met with their counterparts from the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, to devise a game plan on how to respond. Over the last few weeks, representatives from Mitt Romney's presidential campaign have been brought into the loop as well. No matter the outcome, Republicans are expected to push forward with legislation to repeal the law.
Mr. Boehner, however, cautioned House Republicans in a memorandum last week not to seem too joyous if all or part of the law was struck down.
''We will not celebrate at a time when millions of our fellow Americans remain out of work, the national debt has exceeded the size of our nation's economy, health costs continue to rise, and small businesses are struggling to hire,'' he wrote. This may reflect a growing chasm between Republicans who want to push for measures that would uphold popular parts of the law and those who prefer to let the market rule.
In a nothing-to-see-here contrast, Democrats are coordinating far more loosely, according to several media operatives on Capitol Hill, under the notion that they expect the law to be upheld. A spokesman for the White House declined to discuss post-decision plans.
At a Democratic caucus meeting last week, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was peppered with questions about the ruling from anxious senators, whom he told there should be less fretting about things they cannot control, an attendee said.
Scotusblog -- the TMZ of the legal world, which the court has not officially recognized -- will not be caught unprepared. The site has rewritten its software and moved its popular live blog to a new dedicated server to accommodate the expected traffic, which is already rising fast.
''Our lives are completely different for this brief, fleeting solar flare,'' said Tom Goldstein, who publishes the blog. The closest analogy was a guns case that attracted 250,000 visitors, he said; he is expecting 8 to 10 times as many readers on the day of the decision.
The live blog will have seven people working full time, compared with the normal two. ''We will keep the live blog up so people don't have to refresh,'' he said.
For health care advocates and others who work in the world of health care policy, it is a bit like waiting for a baby to arrive. ''For advocates, it's so weird,'' said Emily J. Holubowich, the executive director of the Coalition for Health Funding. ''When there is something on the Hill, you can advocate. But in absence of anything productive to do, we follow Scotusblog, play Bracketology and do office pools while we wait. Anyone who thinks they know what's actually happening is full of it.''

HEADLINE: Try Finding a Job Without a G.E.D.

 BODY:
The General Educational Development test, which provides the equivalent of a high school diploma, is being revised to conform with the rigorous new standards proposed by the National Governors Association, along with state school superintendents. New York State and New York City will have to do more to prepare people for an exam that could help them get a leg up in the job market. 
Far too many of the 50,000 New Yorkers who take the G.E.D. each year do so without preparation. The state pays only for the test and a $20 subsidy per test taker to help run the nonprofit centers that offer the exam, and the pass rate is a low 59 percent. The rate for Iowa, where students take a diagnostic test and receive remedial help at little or no cost, is 98 percent.
The New York City Council has a pilot project that funnels unskilled job seekers into test preparation programs. The results have been good -- a pass rate of 83 percent -- but with only a thousand people enrolled, the programs will need to be greatly expanded. The Bloomberg administration, with a grant from the MetLife Foundation, is trying to develop a model for educating more adult learners more quickly. At the same time, however, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has proposed zeroing out a program that, for the modest cost of $5.2 million, served an estimated 6,000 people who participated in adult education classes in 2010.
In addition to becoming more rigorous, the G.E.D. is moving from a paper-and-pencil format to an online system that state officials say will raise the state's cost from about $58 per person for the current exam to $120 for the new test.
The state is looking into the option of developing a less expensive exam in collaboration with other states.
These are the numbers that matter most: 2.3 million people in New York State without a high school diploma -- 1.3 million in the city. The economy needs educated workers. Anyone willing to study for the G.E.D. deserves help.
Correction: July 3, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this editorial said incorrectly that the revised G.E.D. test will be offered online. It will be administered by computer at official testing centers.

HEADLINE: Lift the Veil on the Spending Cuts

 BODY:
The Pentagon's powerful Republican friends in Congress are griping about a required $500 billion cut to the military budget over nine years beginning in January. It would ''hollow our military,'' said Speaker John Boehner. It's a ''national disgrace,'' said Representative Howard McKeon, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
The critics are right that taking an across-the-board cleaver to the Pentagon is bad policy, but that is because across-the-board cuts in general are bad policy. They never seem to mention that the cuts are matched by an equally devastating slash at domestic spending -- $500 billion from education, law enforcement, environmental protection, and health and safety programs, among hundreds of others. Both are part of a $1.2 trillion sequester required by the law that ended last year's debt-ceiling fight.
Democrats seem to be the only ones who care about the domestic side of the cuts, and now they are finally starting to counter the Republican insistence -- fueled by heavy pressure and big campaign donations from military contractors -- that the defense cuts are the only damaging aspect of the sequester.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has been worked up about the Pentagon cuts, recently proposed legislation requiring a detailed accounting of which military programs would be affected, and the impact on national security. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, proposed a countermeasure that would require an accounting of the entire sequester. The two measures were combined and passed by the Senate on Thursday as an amendment to the farm bill.
Ms. Murray's amendment asks all the right questions of the White House budget office: What precise programs will be cut? How many jobs will be lost? What will be the effect on students of education cuts, as well as the impact of reductions on middle-class families, public safety and economic growth? (Mr. McCain asked similar questions about the defense cuts.) These matters were never discussed when the sequester was first imposed after the irresponsible threat by Republicans to send the government into default if spending wasn't reduced.
At the moment, even lawmakers know only the broad categories of spending that will be affected, not the precise details. In testimony earlier this year, several cabinet secretaries mentioned a few of the specifics -- at least 26,000 teachers would be laid off, nearly a million women and children would lose nutrition benefits, 300 national parks fully or partially closed, and large reductions made in food safety and federal aviation operations. The full list will be far longer, and the harm much greater.
Even though entitlement programs were largely protected, the sequester was the terrible result of reckless brinkmanship. It could reduce the nation's economic output by half a percentage point in 2013 alone. Much of it can still be averted if Republicans would agree to a balanced, long-term deficit-reduction plan that includes higher taxes on the rich. The best way to achieve that goal -- shocking both parties into action -- is to let the public see the awful details of the alternative.

HEADLINE: For Candidates in Primary, a Frenzied Day of Campaigning as Voting Nears

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR; Beth Kormanik and Eric P. Newcomer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Late Sunday afternoon, an exhausted-looking Hakeem S. Jeffries, his forehead shiny with sweat, walked into his fifth church of the day to make yet another plea for support in the Congressional primary on Tuesday.
Standing before the small congregation at the Brooklyn Community Church in Ocean Hill, Mr. Jeffries, a state assemblyman who is running for Congress in the Eighth District, reeled off the neighborhood's ailments -- unemployment, guns, poor public schools, lack of housing -- and asked that the congregants ''take a chance and send me down to Washington so I can stand up for our community.''
''In just a few days, we'll have an opportunity together to help our community take a step toward the promised land of a better way of life,'' Mr. Jeffries said, before a group of people from the church formed a prayer circle to wish him well in the race. 
Sunday was a day of frenzied campaigning, last-minute telephone calls to supporters, and, yes, prayer for the candidates in some competitive Congressional primaries around the city. They raced to introduce -- or reintroduce -- themselves to voters and ensure that their supporters knew that the election was on Tuesday.
Because this is the first time that New York has held its Congressional primaries in June, turnout is expected to be low, and candidates' ability to get their supporters to the polls is likely to prove critical.
In several of the districts, including the one where Mr. Jeffries is running, the registered voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, so the winner of the primary is expected to go on to win the general election in November.
Mr. Jeffries, who is running against City Councilman Charles Barron for the seat now held by Representative Edolphus Towns, who is retiring, visited six churches in nine hours in neighborhoods across the district -- from Bedford-Stuyvesant to Coney Island.
At the Brooklyn Community Church, one of Mr. Jeffries's supporters, Weyman A. Carey, said he admired the candidate for his ability to collaborate, his articulateness and his diplomacy.
Mr. Carey said, ''We need someone who can work with other people as opposed to alienating them'' -- something he accused Mr. Barron of having done.
Yet a volunteer for Mr. Barron, M. Morton Hall, who was driving a van plastered with Barron signs through Brownsville, praised his candidate's outspoken advocacy for black communities in Brooklyn and criticized Mr. Jeffries for the amount of money he had raised from outside the district.
''The climate that exists right now in America, we don't need get-alongs,'' Mr. Hall said. ''We need somebody who stands up.''
Mr. Barron himself visited several churches in Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to his campaign manager, Colette Pean, who declined to provide a schedule in advance. Ms. Pean said he spent the afternoon in East New York.
Reached on his cellphone, Mr. Barron was not eager to discuss his day of campaigning.
''You're making me miss 10 votes talking to you on the phone -- I'm trying to win an election,'' he said, before hanging up.
Candidates in other races were also out on the trail, trying to rally their supporters and remind them of Tuesday's primary.
In the new 13th Congressional District, which stretches from East Harlem to the northwest Bronx, Representative Charles B. Rangel, who is running for a 22nd term, and his most prominent challenger, State Senator Adriano Espaillat, tried to show off support from key Latino leaders.
Since its lines were redrawn earlier this year, the district for the first time has a Latino majority. Mr. Espaillat has repeatedly emphasized that if he wins, he would be the first Dominican-American elected to Congress.
On Sunday, he campaigned alongside one of his most important supporters, the former Bronx borough president and mayoral candidate Fernando Ferrer. They attended a church service in the Bronx and later a Jewish community festival in Washington Heights.
Mr. Rangel's supporters, led by Assemblyman Jose Rivera, threw an outdoor rally for him at Fordham Plaza in the Bronx, where Mr. Rangel was led to the stage to chants of ''Si, se puede'' (''Yes, we can''), danced to mariachi music and had a black sombrero placed on his head.
''We need a voice, we need a pioneer, we need someone with experience,'' the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., said to a crowd of nearly 200, adding, ''If you care about the Bronx, then you will elect Charlie Rangel on Tuesday.''
Mr. Rangel made jokes about his age -- he just turned 82 -- and some recent health problems, but focused on promising that he would be just as responsive to the needs of the Bronx as those of his old district in northern Manhattan.
He also emphasized his support from Mr. Diaz and from Representative Jose E. Serrano.
''He welcomed me into his political home and made it comfortable for me to come here,'' Mr. Rangel said of Mr. Serrano.
In Brooklyn, Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, who is facing a challenge from City Councilman Erik M. Dilan, started her day at a Transit Workers Union news conference about cuts to bus service in Red Hook.
She then visited a church on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, followed by a street fair on Smith Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
Mr. Dilan attended church services and did canvassing in Bushwick, Cypress Hills and Williamsburg.

HEADLINE: Preparing to Respond To Landmark Decisions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Rarely have the black-robed justices at the Supreme Court held so much potential for dominating the political conversation.
This week, the court is expected to rule on two politically explosive issues that could shape the contours of the presidential and Congressional campaigns over the next five months.
How the justices will rule on Arizona's immigration law and President Obama's health care law, decisions that could come as early as Monday, is unknown. But so are the reactions to those rulings from the political establishment, which is on the edge of its seat. 
Here is how various groups might react:
THE CANDIDATES Aides to Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, are prepared to use the court's rulings to their advantage, no matter how they turn out.
If the court strikes down the health care law, they will argue that Mr. Obama lost his biggest legacy. If the court upholds it, they will argue that Mr. Romney is the last hope for conservatives seeking to undo the law.
The immigration law, which gives the police in Arizona broad power to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally, is trickier for Mr. Romney, who faces the task of increasing his appeal among Latinos while not pushing away Tea Party conservatives.
Mr. Obama is traveling to the Northeast on Monday, so a ruling that day would quickly frame his trip. Aides have been exceptionally quiet about their preparations for a response on the health care law, but they are thought to be readying a furious response in case it is shot down.
The president has been pretty clear about Arizona's immigration law. He does not like it, and will put pressure on Mr. Romney to oppose it if it is upheld.
CAPITOL HILL In a memorandum to House Republicans on Thursday, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio urged his colleagues to avoid ''spiking'' the ball if the court strikes down Mr. Obama's health care law. The message: We are focused on the economy.
Still, Mr. Boehner promised his colleagues that the Republican-controlled House would move quickly to repeal ''any part of Obamacare that is left standing'' by the court.
In the Democratic-controlled Senate, the task would be to protect what is left and try to rebuild the rest - if it can.
Congress is unlikely to do anything on immigration this year, regardless of what the court says about the Arizona law.
INTEREST GROUPS Advocacy organizations have their press releases ready, their surrogates standing by and their outrage primed for both rulings.
Supporters of the health care law are preparing to assail the Supreme Court as political and out of touch if it strikes down the law. They will argue that re-electing Mr. Obama is critical to rein in what they call an out-of-control conservative majority on the court.
Opponents of the law are expecting to offer an outpouring of anger if it is upheld. Tea Party groups, which were born out of the summertime rage over health care in 2009, will stoke that anger.
Immigration activists on both sides are preparing to use the court's ruling to promote their causes. If the justices uphold the law, expect a push for similar rules in other states. If they strike it down, immigration rights groups will use that as an incentive to press for a broader overhaul of the immigration system.
INSURERS The insurance industry has been quietly preparing for the court's health care ruling for months. If the court strikes down the requirement that everyone must buy insurance - a mandate considered a boon to the industry - insurers will be ready with proposals for how to change the rest of the law so that they are not saddled by costs from other elements of the legislation.
If the entire law is struck down, the industry is prepared to go back to square one - though a full-blown debate over health care is all but certain to wait until after the November elections.
THE MEDIA News organizations are preparing for a huge week that could have a drastic effect on the election fight. Television networks and cable broadcasters are preparing special reports, newspapers are ready to deploy armies of reporters, and Twitter is hoping not to crash amid a crush of posts after the rulings.
The biggest challenge for the news media (and the politicians) will be making sense of complicated rulings in the moments after they are issued. Especially in the health care case, the decision will probably not be a simple ''yes'' or ''no.'' Rather, there will most likely be nuanced points in long opinions.
But the imperatives of the news business will prevail. Expect headlines and Twitter posts to boil the news down quickly to ''court upholds health care law'' or ''court strikes down mandate'' shortly after the decision is announced.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Benefits of Sprawl

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The American Dream: Phase II,'' by Allison Arieff (Opinionator, nytimes.com, June 18), simply repeats President Obama's February 2009 talking points on sprawl. So it's no surprise that she is offended by the job creation and economic diversification initiatives of L. Brooks Patterson, the county executive of Oakland County, Mich. 
When Mr. Patterson wrote 10 years ago -- in a guest opinion for a newspaper that is posted on the county's Web site -- that he loves sprawl, he clearly stated that he embraces economic development and diversification. In the decade hence, Oakland County has seen more than $4.4 billion invested by the private sector, creating 66,000 knowledge-economy jobs, and retaining more than 18,000.
Mr. Patterson stands for economic freedom brought about by hard work, the American spirit and individualism.
BILL MULLAN Waterford, Mich., June 20, 2012

HEADLINE: The Great Abdication

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Among economists who know their history, the mere mention of certain years evokes shivers. For example, three years ago Christina Romer, then the head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, warned politicians not to re-enact 1937 -- the year F.D.R. shifted, far too soon, from fiscal stimulus to austerity, plunging the recovering economy back into recession. Unfortunately, this advice was ignored.
But now I'm hearing more and more about an even more fateful year. Suddenly normally calm economists are talking about 1931, the year everything fell apart. 
It started with a banking crisis in a small European country (Austria). Austria tried to step in with a bank rescue -- but the spiraling cost of the rescue put the government's own solvency in doubt. Austria's troubles shouldn't have been big enough to have large effects on the world economy, but in practice they created a panic that spread around the world. Sound familiar?
The really crucial lesson of 1931, however, was about the dangers of policy abdication. Stronger European governments could have helped Austria manage its problems. Central banks, notably the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve, could have done much more to limit the damage. But nobody with the power to contain the crisis stepped up to the plate; everyone who could and should have acted declared that it was someone else's responsibility.
And it's happening again, both in Europe and in America.
Consider first how European leaders have been handling the banking crisis in Spain. (Forget about Greece, which is pretty much a lost cause; Spain is where the fate of Europe will be decided.) Like Austria in 1931, Spain has troubled banks that desperately need more capital, but the Spanish government now, like Austria's government then, faces questions about its own solvency.
So what should European leaders -- who have an overwhelming interest in containing the Spanish crisis -- do? It seems obvious that European creditor nations need, one way or another, to assume some of the financial risks facing Spanish banks. No, Germany won't like it -- but with the very survival of the euro at stake, a bit of financial risk should be a small consideration.
But no. Europe's ''solution'' was to lend money to the Spanish government, and tell that government to bail out its own banks. It took financial markets no time at all to figure out that this solved nothing, that it just put Spain's government more deeply in debt. And the European crisis is now deeper than ever.
Yet let's not ridicule the Europeans, since many of our own policy makers are acting just as irresponsibly. And I'm not just talking about Congressional Republicans, who often seem as if they are deliberately trying to sabotage the economy.
Let's talk instead about the Federal Reserve. The Fed has a so-called dual mandate: it's supposed to seek both price stability and full employment. And last week the Fed released its latest set of economic projections, showing that it expects to fail on both parts of its mandate, with inflation below target and unemployment far above target for years to come.
This is a terrible prospect, and the Fed knows it. Ben Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, has warned in particular about the damage being done to America by the unprecedented level of long-term unemployment.
So what does the Fed propose doing about the situation? Almost nothing. True, last week the Fed announced some actions that would supposedly boost the economy. But I think it's fair to say that everyone at all familiar with the situation regards these actions as pathetically inadequate -- the bare minimum the Fed could do to deflect accusations that it is doing nothing at all.
Why won't the Fed act? My guess is that it's intimidated by those Congressional Republicans, that it's afraid to do anything that might be seen as providing political aid to President Obama, that is, anything that might help the economy. Maybe there's some other explanation, but the fact is that the Fed, like the European Central Bank, like the U.S. Congress, like the government of Germany, has decided that avoiding economic disaster is somebody else's responsibility.
None of this should be happening. As in 1931, Western nations have the resources they need to avoid catastrophe, and indeed to restore prosperity -- and we have the added advantage of knowing much more than our great-grandparents did about how depressions happen and how to end them. But knowledge and resources do no good if those who possess them refuse to use them.
And that's what seems to be happening. The fundamentals of the world economy aren't, in themselves, all that scary; it's the almost universal abdication of responsibility that fills me, and many other economists, with a growing sense of dread.

HEADLINE: North Korea Tests the Patience of Its Closest Ally

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea. Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As Kim Jong-un, the young leader of North Korea, consolidates his grip on power, China is showing signs of increasing frustration at the bellicose behavior of its longtime ally.
Since succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il, six months ago, Mr. Kim has quickly alienated the Obama administration and put North Korea on track to develop a nuclear warhead that could hit the United States within a few years, Chinese and Western analysts say.
Most surprising, though, is how Mr. Kim has thumbed his nose at China, whose economic largess keeps the government afloat. For example, shortly after Mr. Kim took over, a Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs, Fu Ying, visited Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, and sternly warned him not to proceed with a ballistic missile test. The new leader went ahead anyway.
Now, the Obama administration and the Chinese government, who warily consult each other on North Korea, are waiting to see if Mr. Kim will follow in his father's footsteps and carry out a nuclear test, which would be North Korea's third. The previous tests were in 2006 and 2009. 
This month, the North Korean news agency said there were no plans for a third test ''at present,'' a statement analysts said suggested Mr. Kim was just waiting for a moment that better suited him.
''We have made this absolutely clear to them; we are against any provocation,'' Cui Tiankai, another Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs, said in a recent interview when asked about a possible third nuclear test by North Korea. ''We have told them in a very direct way, time and again, we are against it.''
Asked why China did not punish North Korea for its actions, Mr. Cui replied: ''It's not a question of punishment. They are a sovereign state.''
China backed sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations Security Council after the first two nuclear tests, he said. ''If they refuse to listen to us,'' he added, ''we can't force them.''
Mr. Kim's erratic behavior unfolded early on. In late February, his government signed an agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, giving hope that he would turn out to be more open to change than his father. But six weeks later, Mr. Kim ripped up the accord and, without informing China, ordered the missile test that Washington viewed as a test run for launching a nuclear weapon.
The missile test, in April, was a failure, but that did little to alleviate concerns within the Obama administration that Mr. Kim was intent on pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program. ''The North is on track to build a warhead that could in a few years hit any regional target and eventually the United States,'' said Evans J. R. Revere, a former United States principal deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
Since the failed missile test, Mr. Kim has formalized North Korea as a ''nuclear armed state'' in the Constitution, another signal that the government has no intention of giving up its nuclear program, Mr. Revere said. With virtually no contact between the United States and North Korea, Mr. Revere argued, it is time for Washington to toughen its approach.
In a series of quick maneuvers, Mr. Kim, whose exact age is not known (he is believed to be 28 or 29), assumed the mantle of power immediately after his father's death and cast aside early assumptions that his tenure would be a regency largely run by his elderly relatives.
The China News Service, a state-run agency, headlined an article last week: ''Smooth transfer of power six months after Kim Jong-il's death. North Korea enters era of Kim Jong-un.'' The top North Korean Army generals, some of them in their 80s, have joined ranks around Mr. Kim, presenting a unified command, said Daniel A. Pinkston of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, who has written a forthcoming report by the group on North Korea.
At a congress of the ruling Communist Party in April, members of the Kim family were appointed to senior positions in the Politburo. The new appointees included Kim Kyong-hui, a younger sister of Mr. Kim's father. Her husband, Chang Song-taek, also won a spot on the Politburo.
''There are no indications of any opposition to the transfer of power in the party, state or military,'' Mr. Pinkston said. ''Although many North Koreans are dissatisfied with the government, the barriers to collective action make it very risky and nearly impossible to organize any resistance.''
To recover from the embarrassment of the failed missile test, Mr. Kim unleashed a bellicose warning to South Korea in late April, threatening that a ''special operations action'' team would ''reduce to ashes the rat-like'' leadership of President Lee Myung-bak.
In contrast to his taciturn father, Mr. Kim has been seen more in public, particularly with students and children, a propaganda campaign intended to present a more benign image to an impoverished and embittered population.
On the basis of his years at a Swiss boarding school, Mr. Kim was thought by some analysts to be a potential economic reformer. These assumptions have turned out to be misplaced, and the new leader has shown no interest in following the advice of China to open up the economy, even in a modest way.
Despite Mr. Kim's obstinacy, China keeps the economy from collapsing. Right after Mr. Kim assumed power, for example, China gave North Korea 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of crude oil, according to the International Crisis Group report. That helped overcome what a German aid official, Wolfgang Jamann, said in Beijing on Friday was the worst drought in 60 years. His organization, Global Food Aid, has run a food program in North Korea since 1997.
''If it continues not to rain, it would be a problem,'' said Mr. Jamann, who just returned from a trip to North Korea.
So far, though, the aid seems to have prevented disaster. According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, food shortages, while still grim in many rural areas, do not seem as serious as might be expected, given the drought.
China's generosity has not bought it immunity against North Korean rancor. More than two dozen Chinese fishermen were held captive for two weeks by North Korea in May. After their release, one of the fishermen described how his boat was boarded by North Korean Navy men brandishing guns.
After ''13 days in hell,'' the fishermen were released, according to interviews in the Chinese news media. But not before the boats and men were stripped, the men to their underpants, the fisherman said.
Such behavior ignited protests on Chinese Web sites, and normally calm Chinese analysts who follow North Korea said they were infuriated by the indignities. ''I was disappointed in our government's soft line during the incident with the seized boats,'' said a Chinese analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering his superiors.
Nonetheless, senior Chinese officials ''dare not use China's economic leverage'' against North Korea, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. That is because a collapse of the North Korean government could result in a united Korea allied with the United States, which would be a nightmare scenario for China, Mr. Shi said.
Indeed, as China becomes more concerned about what it sees as the United States' stepped-up containment efforts against China -- including the positioning of more warships in the Pacific -- the less inclined it is to help the United States on North Korea, said Yun Sun, a China analyst in Washington.
''China will not help the U.S. and South Korea solve the North Korea problem or speed up a China-unfriendly resolution, since China sees itself as 'next-on-the-list,' '' she wrote in an article last week for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Hawaii, where Pacific Command, the arm of the American military overseeing the increased United States naval presence in the Pacific, is located.
And over all, there are unyielding historical reasons for China's protectiveness toward North Korea, said an experienced American diplomat and expert on China.
''Beijing disapproves of every aspect of North Korean policy,'' J. Stapleton Roy, a former United States ambassador to China and now vice chairman of Kissinger Associates, wrote in an article this month, also for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
But with long memories of both the Korean War and how Japan used the peninsula to launch its invasion and occupation of much of China from 1937 to 1945, ''Beijing has an overriding security interest,'' Mr. Roy wrote, ''in maintaining influence in Pyongyang and in not permitting other powers to gain the upper hand there.''

HEADLINE: Challenges Multiply For Victor In Egypt

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; David D. Kirkpatrick and Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- As his supporters in Tahrir Square were chanting on Sunday for the end of military rule in Egypt, the country's president-elect, Mohamed Morsi, had glowing words for none other than the army, saying he regarded it with a ''love in my heart that only God knows.''
Mr. Morsi's remarks, during his first address to the nation after his victory was announced, were an acknowledgment of his new, changed role. He had gone from being a representative of a banned Islamist group to the leader of a nation and its public's chief negotiator with the military generals who assumed power after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. 
As the first freely elected president of Egypt, Mr. Morsi has a historic opportunity, but he faces a litany of challenges that could prevent him from becoming more than just a figurehead. He will have to spar with the generals, who, just after the election, stripped much of the power from the presidency, and he must overcome the doubts of those who chose his opponent -- nearly half of the voters -- and millions more who did not vote.
Mr. Morsi will also have to convince Egyptians that he represents more than just the narrow interests of the Muslim Brotherhood and to soothe fears among many that his true goal is to bind the notion of citizenship itself more closely to Islam.
''The challenges are very strong,'' said Mohammed Habib, a former deputy chairman of the Brotherhood who has worked with Mr. Morsi. ''Everyone is watching him through a microscopic lens.''
Asked if Mr. Morsi had what it takes to overcome those challenges, Mr. Habib said, ''No, he doesn't.''
Mr. Morsi, 60 an engineer with a doctorate in materials science from the University of Southern California, taught engineering at another California college and at Zagazig University in the Nile Delta.
A lackluster, accidental candidate, he was chosen to run after the Brotherhood's first choice, Khairat el-Shater, was disqualified.
Married with five grown children, Mr. Morsi has a reputation as a religious conservative and a company man, an enforcer for the group who brooks little internal dissent. During the campaign, he portrayed himself as a defender of strict religious values one minute, a moderate courting liberals the next -- doing little to burnish his reputation.
''Morsi is an accident of history. He's a fairly unremarkable guy,'' said Shadi Hamid, a fellow at the Brookings Doha Center. ''I guess the real question is, can he change?''
Mr. Morsi's first test will come immediately. Brotherhood leaders have said that thousands of their supporters will continue to occupy Tahrir Square until the Parliament, which the military council dissolved last week, is reinstated. The military rulers have said that elections will be held for a new Parliament, although those ousted were seated in January. On Sunday, Mr. Morsi threw down his first challenge to the military, saying he would be sworn in only in front of the Parliament whose members were just dismissed. He once served as the head of the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc.
Leaving aside Egypt's all-consuming problems, especially its sputtering economy, Mr. Morsi will face specific governing challenges, especially enlisting partners from other parties who have been reluctant to work with the Brotherhood and dealing with the groaning state bureaucracy bequeathed to him by Mr. Mubarak.
''This is not like running a party or a group,'' Mr. Habib said. ''This is very big.''
Mr. Habib said Mr. Morsi would have to deploy ''reconciliatory rhetoric,'' to coax former presidential candidates like Hamdeen Sabbahi, a leftist, or Abdel-Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former Brotherhood leader, to work with him. ''He must strengthen his relationship, and restore the confidence of the national parties,'' Mr. Habib said. ''Otherwise they will cause him trouble and pull the carpet from underneath his feet.''
Mr. Morsi faces scrutiny over his relationship with the Brotherhood. He resigned from the group on Sunday, but many people believe his years in the organization mean his ties to it will persist. During his campaign, Mr. Morsi never made a major decision without the approval of the Brotherhood's guidance council. Mr. Shater, the group's leading strategist whose disqualification led to Mr. Morsi's running, is seen as especially influential.
''He has a chance to become his own man, but he has to distance himself from the Brotherhood,'' Mr. Hamid said. ''At some point, Mr. Morsi is going to start making his own decisions, and sooner or later, there will be tensions between Shater and Morsi.''
Mr. Habib put it more bluntly. ''He must be completely independent,'' he said. ''There is no choice.''
In his speech on Sunday, Mr. Morsi did not mention the Brotherhood, though he did reach out to Christians, who formed a pillar of support for his rival, Ahmed Shafik. Mr. Morsi, who has said women and non-Muslims should not serve as president, again tried to broaden his appeal.
''We as Egyptians, Muslims and Christians,'' he said, ''we will face together the strife and conspiracies that target our national unity.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:

HEADLINE: Will Oxytocin Keep the Virtual Office Humming?

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Zak is a neuroeconomist, studying how a chemical called oxytocin elicits trust, empathy and better workplace cooperation. He has identified ways managers can produce this chemical in the brains of their staff, and says virtual work environments might be designed to make us even more trusting and productive. 

 BODY:
Even as technology blows companies apart, can the people in them work better together?
Yes, says one researcher studying both the brain and the workplace. Maybe people working online will even perform better.
"Whether it's online or in an office, the leader's role is to empower individuals to be more successful," says Paul Zak, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Calif. "If you keep making me successful, I'll want to keep working for you." There are reasons to think the sense of achievement can be built into a virtual team, he says.
Mr. Zak gives a lot more hugs than most economists. That is because he has made a specialty of studying the social role of oxytocin, a neurochemical once associated with sex that he says is also critical to trust, empathy and family-like bonds. Oxytocin both fosters and feeds on those behaviors, and can also be created by surmountable challenges, dancing, singing, meditation or marching in a group. 
It is also created by hugs, which is why Mr. Zak likes giving them to strangers. The economist's studies tell him that oxytocin is produced in high-performing workplaces. "The classic way to get people to do what you want is fear, but people acclimate to that," he says. "If you want to keep people on task all the time, you want oxytocin-producing situations."
The leadership traits he has identified to produce this include praise, given unexpectedly and in public; transparency in identifying tasks and setting goals; authenticity; effective delegation of work; empathy to others' situations; anticipation of challenges; and autonomy. 
Most of these may be achievable in an office where people encounter each other on a daily basis, and can bond incidentally. But how easy are they to achieve when the work force is fragmenting?
Clearly, the workplace is becoming a virtual environment. Thanks to worldwide bandwidth, cloud computing and mobile devices, we now have teams where some people work at home and some in offices, or in computer-generated environments that straddle the two.
Moreover, online work marketplaces like ODesk and Elance have increased the flexibility of companies. Odds are, the workplace will soon be even more virtual.
Some management tasks can easily move online, Mr. Zak says. "They'll have to get better at communicating the purpose of things - why they are doing something," he says. "It will be important to create a narrative for the virtual team." He imagines workers reading shared biographies of each other, including both work and personal facts, to promote empathy. Communication after a job is completed will be important, so successes can be revisited.
Mr. Zak's lab at Claremont is nearthe Drucker Institute, named for management guru Peter Drucker. Not surprisingly, Mr. Zak is increasing collaborating with the institute. Mr. Drucker, who taught at Claremont for three decades, coined the term "the knowledge society" to describe a world dominated by large information systems.
Many of Mr. Drucker's prophecies about how this world will work seem validated by the way cloud computing and mobility are creating more flexible, if disparate, organizations. He talked about corporate "ecosystems" of work, and the need for managers to provide meaning as well as duties to their workers, the same techniques that Mr. Zak says will be necessary online.
"People have always said that we are on the squishy side of management," said Rick Wartzman, executive director of the Drucker Institute. "Now we're seeing hard science being put behind these things."

HEADLINE: Half of Americans Still Lack 3-Month Emergency Fund

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A survey shows that many Americans still lack a three-month emergency savings cushion. 

 BODY:
How is your emergency savings fund doing?
Nearly half of Americans say they lack enough emergency savings to cover three months of expenses, according to a new surveyfrom Bankrate.com.
Still, Bankrate noted that a similar poll done in 2006 found that 61 percent of Americans lacked a three-month cushion. So the recent findings suggest that the financial crisis convinced more Americans of the importance of savings. "People got the message," said Sheyna Steiner, who writes about investments for the site.
There's room for progress, though. The general rule of thumb is that you need a cushion of at least six months. But only a quarter have saved that much, about the same as a year ago.
Meanwhile, nearly a third the people responding to the survey said they had no emergency savings, up from a quarter last year. That's risky because savings are crucial to avoiding high-cost credit card debt when unexpected expenses arise.
In general, Bankrate's June financial security index showed Americans are feeling a bit better than they did a year ago. Just 32 percent said they were "less comfortable" with their savings, a new low.
The telephone survey was conducted June 7 to 10 by Princeton Survey Research Associates International. The survey included 1,000 adults, with a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points.
Have you managed to squirrel away at least three months' of savings? How did you do it?

HEADLINE: How Wider Coverage Affects Health Spending

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Readers weigh in on an Oregon study that found a group of newly insured people were happier, but also incurred more medical expenses than uninsured people. 

 BODY:
In an article over the weekend, I took a close look at a continuing health study relevant to the Supreme Court ruling due Thursday on the federal health care law, the Affordable Care Act. 
The landmark study is the country's best analysis of how Medicaid coverage changes the lives of previously uninsured, low-income adults - about 17 million of whom would automatically qualify for coverage in 2014 under a provision of the law. 
In 2008, Oregon had enough money to offer Medicaid to about 10,000 uninsured adults living at or below the poverty line. About 200,000 Oregonians fit that description, so the state held a lottery and about 100,000 individuals applied. A prestigious team of researchers then surveyed lottery winners and losers, giving a clear picture of the effect of coverage. 
The Oregon Health Study found that getting Medicaid significantly improved study participants' self-reported mental and physical health, as well as their finances. But the Medicaid-insured group on average accounted for $778 more in annual medical expenses than the uninsured, a 25 percent difference.
Readers had a number of great comments and questions that I'll try to respond to here.

Several readers asked whether the increased medical expenses for the newly insured were a one-time bump or a permanent change, which would carry much more significant budget implications for the country. 
Perhaps the newly insured got a lot of care as soon as they won Medicaid, because they could not afford it before. Perhaps they got more preventive care, holding down their medical expenses over a longer time frame. Perhaps if the researchers surveyed the participants two years or five years later, the uninsured and insured would be accounting for similar medical expenses. 
The study authors address that important question, and conclude that the additional use of medical care is probably not due to pent-up demand. "All of the questions ask about current utilization or utilization over the last six months, not about utilization right after insurance began," the authors write. It seems that the insured just incur more medical expenses.
Other readers questioned whether we could trust the results given that the study is based on self-reported data. Maybe the participants who won insurance just thought they were healthier. 
That's a great point - and it's one where the researchers are getting ready to give us a lot more evidence and analysis. The team has conducted more than 10,000 follow-up health examinations, testing participants' blood pressure and cholesterol, for instance. They are studying any measured differences between the insured and the uninsured, and will most likely have results ready sometime this year. 
Finally, some readers questioned whether the findings of a single study of poor adults really have national relevance. I'd argue that they do, though with some caveats. 
The study shows that winning coverage does have significant benefits for the uninsured and significant costs in terms of higher medical spending. But as the researchers write, its estimates are "difficult to extrapolate to the likely effects of much larger health insurance expansions, in which there may well be supply-side responses from the health care sector."
In other words, Medicaid might change when millions more people are using it. The broader health system might change, too. The Oregon study cannot speak to how.

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh, After the Steel Mills

BYLINE: STACEY BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Within days of wrapping up his picturetaking for our London photo issue, Mark Neville took on a new topic: Pittsburgh and the effects of the steel industry on its suburbs. 

 BODY:
Within days of wrapping up his picture taking for "Here is London," a photo essay the magazine published in March, Mark Neville had moved on to another city, Pittsburgh. He was one of 14 artists invited by the Andy Warhol Museum to examine various local industrial legacies.
For his three-month residency, Neville focused on the effects of the steel industry on the Pittsburgh suburbs of Sewickley and Braddock. When big steel was at its biggest, both were thriving communities: Braddock was home to the Edgar Thompson Steel Works mill, and Sewickley was a summer retreat for wealthy steel magnates. After the industry collapsed, Braddock plunged into economic depression while affluent Pittsburgh residents continued to move to Sewickley.
Neville hopes to return to Pittsburgh in the coming months to establish a printing press that will create jobs and serve as an inspiration for people in Braddock. "I'm trying to do something to contribute," he told me recently. "There may be a young Robert Frank growing up in Braddock as we speak, and he'll have the chance to make a book of photographs on a top quality lithographic press. That would be the best legacy I could possibly leave."
Pictures from Neville's time in Western Pennsylvania can be seen at Factory Direct: Pittsburgh, an exhibition that opened in two locations there on Sunday. The Andy Warhol Museum is hosting Neville's work.

HEADLINE: Zimmerman Seeks Another Chance at Freedom on Bond

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: In a defense motion filed on Monday, Mark O'Mara, a lawyer for George Zimmerman, acknowledges his client misled the court about his finances but said he should be freed on reasonable bond because he does not pose a threat. 

 BODY:
The lawyer for George Zimmerman argued on Monday that his client should be granted bond for a second time as he awaits trial on murder charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
In the defense motion filed with the Seminole County Circuit Court, the lawyer, Mark O'Mara, said that Mr. Zimmerman, 28, is not a flight risk and takes full responsibility for his role in not previously alerting the judge about the tens of thousands of dollars in donations made to an online fund that he had set up before his first bond hearing in April.
Bail was revoked for Mr. Zimmerman on June 1 after prosecutors told the court that he and his wife, Shellie Zimmerman, 25, misled the court about their finances and spoke to each other in code about the estimated $125,000 in donations. The couple's conversations were captured on tapebecause they spoke when Mr. Zimmerman was at the Seminole County Jail.
Mr. Zimmerman, who claims he shot Mr. Martin in self-defense last February when the 17-year-old teenager walked through his condo development in Sanford, Fla., instructed his wife during the telephone calls on how to move the money around into different credit union accounts. He also did not dispute his wife's testimony when she said she did not know how much money was in the fund and said they had limited means for bail because she was a full-time nursing student and he was unemployed. Ms. Zimmerman was later arrested on perjury charges.
"Mr. Zimmerman's failure to advise the court of the existence of the donated funds at the initial bail hearing was wrong and Mr. Zimmerman accepts responsibility for his part in allowing the court to be misled as to his true financial circumstances," Mr. O'Mara wrote in the motion. Last week, Mr. O'Mara made public transcripts, audiotapes and a video of Mr. Zimmerman's account of what happened that night when he shot Mr. Martin.
The second bond hearing is scheduled for Friday.

Mr. O'Mara also noted that the Web site set up by Mr. Zimmerman has been shut down and that money in that fund, with the exception of $20,000 that was being used by the Zimmermans for living expenses, was deposited into a legal-defense fund that is being managed by an independent trustee. Another online legal defense fund has been set up to accept donations on Mr. Zimmerman's behalf.
Mr. O'Mara also asked the Seminole County Circuit Court judge, Kenneth R. Lester Jr., to reconsider his decision to release all of the taped telephone calls between Mr. Zimmerman and his wife.

HEADLINE: A Fresh Look at Oil's Long Goodbye

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new report points to an extended era of expanding oil production capacity. 

 BODY:
[]
My bedtime reading tonight is "Oil: The Next Revolution - The unprecedented upsurge of oil production capacity and what it means for the world." This mind-bending report points to a prolonged period of rising oil production, particularly in the United States (for reasons laid out below), and a potential collapse in oil prices, with all kinds of implications for security, international politics, the economy and, without doubt, climate. 
The report is written by Leonardo Maugeri, a top oil company executive from Italy who is currently a research fellow at the Geopolitics of Energy Project of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Here's a video interview with Maugeri posted by the Belfer Center:
Maugeri offers a field by field analysis of investments in oil production that provides detailed support for the emerging picture of an oil boom conveyed in recent reports in The Times, including Jad Mouawad's article "Fuel to Burn: Now What?" Similar themes echo in Daniel Yergin's recent book "The Quest." 
After a detailed exploration of the reasons for the current increase in oil production capacity, with much more coming after 2020, Maugeri warns that the oil industry will need to work hard to limit environmental risks from greatly expanded drilling for oil (and natural gas) in shale deposits, a vast resource that has been made tappable by hydraulic fracturing, known also as fracking. The report doesn't address the implications for climate policy and energy efficiency that would attend a prolonged era of abundant oil. I'm sure others, here and elsewhere, will dive in on that issue.
Here's an excerpt in which Maugeri explains why he sees a decent chance that the United States will become second only to Saudi Arabia in oil production by 2020 (abundant deposits of shale oil are only one): 
It is worth noting that the U.S. shale revolution cannot be easily replicated in other areas of the world - at least in a short period of time - due not only to the huge resource base of shale/tight oil plays existing in the U.S., but also to some unique features of the U.S. oil industry and market, such as the private ownership of mineral rights, the presence of thousands [of] independent companies - oftentimes small - that historically played the role of pioneering new high-risk, high-reward targets, the huge availability of drilling rigs and other exploration and production tools, a very active financial market [to] supply money for new ventures. With the exception of Canada, these key features are foreign to other parts of the world, and they make the U.S. and Canada a sort of unique arena of experimentation and innovation. 
Last November, former Colorado Senator Tim Wirth, long focused on global warming, sent an e-mail message to a batch of people involved with energy and climate change, myself included, that included two recent articles on these same trends and a poignant reflection from the standpoint of climate policy. These are the articles, both published last November:
- "America is entering a new age of plenty," by Edward Luce in the Financial Times. 
- "Saudi sees threat of shale oil revolution," a Reuters article by Reem Shamseddine.
Here's Wirth's reflection: 
First impressions suggest that this new abundance of fossil fuels will be disastrous for the globe's climate - but maybe that is too fast a judgment. Instead, maybe this new abundance provides a window of time to better understand and explain the challenges of climate, and the options needed. In any case, this new abundance seems to be a reality, requiring new strategies for those of us who continue the urgent concern for the globe's climate.
Your thoughts are welcome. 
For convenience, here's an excerpt from the Harvard news release on Maugeri's report: 
Oil production capacity is surging in the United States and several other countries at such a fast pace that global oil output capacity is likely to grow by nearly 20 percent by 2020, which could prompt a plunge or even a collapse in oil prices, according to a new study by a researcher at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The findings by Leonardo Maugeri, a former oil industry executive who is now a fellow in the Geopolitics of Energy Project in the Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, are based on an original field-by-field analysis of the world's major oil formations and exploration projects.
Contrary to some predictions that world oil production has peaked or will soon do so, Maugeri projects that output should grow from the current 93 million barrels per day to 110 million barrels per day by 2020, the biggest jump in any decade since the 1980s. What's more, this increase represents less than 40 percent of the new oil production under development globally: more than 60 percent of the new production will likely reach the market after 2020.
Maugeri's analysis finds that the gross additional production from current exploration and development projects in the world could produce an additional 49 million barrels per day by 2020, an increase equivalent to more than half the world's current 93 million bpd. After adjusting that gross output increase for political and technical risk factors as well as the offsetting depletion rates of current fields, the analysis projects the net increase by 2020 to be about 17.5 bpd.
His study attributes the expected growth in oil output largely to a combination of high oil prices and new technologies such as hydraulic fracturing that are opening up vast new areas and allowing extraction of "unconventional" oil such as tight oil, oil shale, tar sands and ultra-heavy oil. These increases are projected to be greatest in the United States, Canada, Venezuela and Brazil. Maugeri also predicts a major increase in Iraq's oil output as it regains stability, which will add new production in the Persian Gulf region -- potentially destabilizing OPEC's ability to manage output and prices.
The combination of new production in the Western Hemisphere and the still growing production in other parts of the world could lead to a sharp drop in oil prices, Maugeri finds, which if steep enough could lead oil companies to cut back on investment and ultimately slow down oil supplies. But if oil prices remain above about $70 per barrel, sufficient investment will occur to sustain continued growth in production, possibly leading to a stable phenomenon of oil overproduction after 2015.
"Leonardo's conclusions are not only startling, but his paper provides a transparent explanation for how he reaches them - something lacking in many studies," said Meghan L. O'Sullivan, the Jeane Kirkpatrick Professor of the Practice of International Affairs at the Kennedy School and director of the Geopolitics of Energy Project. "His findings have major implications for geopolitics, suggesting important shifts in how countries interact and wield influence."

HEADLINE: Women Facing Harsh New Pressures in North Korea

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Disproportionate numbers of women are losing their jobs at state companies in North Korea, a new report says. As they gravitate to work in quasi-legal markets, women are running afoul of the police and the state's harsh penal system, a trend that could worsen if Kim Jong-un's regime reinstates more rigid control of the economy. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - As the world's youngest dictator, Kim Jong-un has gotten off to a remarkable start in North Korea.
He has reneged on a deal with the United States for a quarter-million tons of food aid, threatened South Korea with fiery annihilation - nothing new there, really - and embarrassed his principal patron, China.
Most surprising of all this, writes my colleague Jane Perlez, is "how Mr. Kim has thumbed his nose at China, whose economic largess keeps the government afloat." When a senior Chinese diplomat went to North Korea and warned Mr. Kim against a ballistic missile test, Jane says, "the new leader went ahead anyway." 
Mr. Kim, not yet 30, seems to have deftly consolidated his hold on state power since his father's death in December. He appears fully in command of the political, military and diplomatic levers. 
And some of his regime's first policy moves in the economic sphere "were focused on re-enforcing controls" from the central government, according to a new paper by Stephan Haggard and Marcus Noland for the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
They suggest that the regime could impose a return to a more centrally planned economy, as we have seen before. Such a trend, which might well include a crackdown on the private, shadow-economy markets that are predominantly run by women, "could have the effect of once again marginalizing North Korea's women."
Mr. Haggard and Mr. Noland report that disproportionate numbers of women are now being laid off from jobs at North Korea's state-owned enterprises because "working for the state is considered more politically advanced 'man's work.' "
As a result, women have moved into the markets, which are closed to men and operate quasi-legally in North Korea's grudgingly hybrid economy. The regime views these markets - and the women who run them - with "an ambivalent if not actively hostile posture," Mr. Haggard and Mr. Noland write. 
"In other settings, this newfound freedom might be empowering," they say, but the women traders have frequent run-ins with the police and, therefore, the North's harsh penal system. Corruption is rife. Bribing police officers and state officials is common. "In short, the increasingly male-dominated state preys on the increasingly female-dominated market."
"The regime has criminalized a range of market activities," Mr. Haggard and Mr. Noland say, which inevitably lands traders in jails, prisons, labor camps or punitive "collection centers." 
Nearly half of the 300 North Korean defectors surveyed for the Haggard-Noland paper said they had seen executions while in detention. "Roughly three-quarters report forced starvation, and nearly a third report witnessing deaths from beatings and torture," they write. 
Mr. Haggard and Mr. Noland say their research paints "a picture of a vulnerable group that has been disadvantaged" in North Korea's fitful transition from a purely command economy. "Energies are directed toward survival," they write, adding that civil disobedience is rare and that market women as a group appear "to lack the tools or social capital to act collectively to improve their status."
A year ago I interviewed two North Korean women who escaped the North after their jobs at state-owned factories dried up. A famine had taken hold of the country, and both women said they defected because, quite simply, they were starving. One of them, Lee Young-geum, a former truck dispatcher at a state-owned steel mill, called it "the eating problem."
The other woman, Son Hyang-sun, now 41, had taken to eating grass to stay alive. State food rations had ceased at her factory, which produced glass ampules of morphine. There was no salt or sugar. Until she defected, she said, she had never once eaten fish or beef. 
After crossing a river into China, Ms. Son dyed her hair and pierced her ears - small emancipations. But the Chinese police quickly picked her up and sent her back to North Korea. She spent the next four months in prison. 
"With my hair and my pierced ears, the North Korean government thought I was mentally ill and that I would infect other people," she said. 
"So they tortured me with an electric stick" - she searched for the right term - "yes, a cattle prod. They stuck it everywhere." 
She did her time, then ducked the police who were watching her and crossed into China again. She met a North Korean man who wanted to get to South Korea, and they walked thousands of miles, through Vietnam, Cambodia and into Thailand. Together, they finally reached Seoul in May 2003. 
After the birth of a daughter, the couple made their way to South Korea's eastern coast, to the port town of Donghae, renowned for its clams and scallops. They found a small fish shop for sale and managed to get a loan to buy and modernize the place. The three of them now live upstairs. 
And Ms. Son has named her shop "The Future."

HEADLINE: White Working Chaos

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The current outbreak of hostilities over the political allegiance of the white working class is crucial for understanding conflicting analyses of the 2012 election and the future of American politics. 

 BODY:
Political analysts, journalists and academics are fighting over white working-class voters - over how to define them and what their political significance is. Part of the reason for the furious tone of the argument is that this is an issue of central importance in American politics. And it's not just crucial for the presidential election: understanding what the white working class is and where it is going is fundamental if we want to understand where the country is going.
One side of the argument contends that the Democratic coalition retains much of its low-to-middle-income white working-class core. The other side argues that this alliance has been fractured by the defection of working-class whites and that the traditional Democratic coalition is permanently gone.
Part of the problem is that different people mean different things when they are talking about the working class. Is this cohort made up of those without college degrees; those in the bottom third of the income distribution; or those in occupations described by the federal government as "blue-collar"? (The government's list of blue-collar jobs includes "heavy mobile equipment mechanic," "pipefitter," "welder" and "food service" workers.)
Whites without college degrees have been steadily shrinking as a percentage of the electorate, but they remain a very substantial block: in 2008, they made up 39 percent of all voters
The current outbreak of hostilities within an all-star team of academics over the political allegiance of the white working class and even the definition of the white working class began with the publication on June 5 of an essay in the left-leaning British newspaper, The Guardian, "Why Working-class People Vote Conservative," by Jonathan Haidt, author of "The Righteous Mind" and a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
Unfortunately, as Haidt quickly acknowledged, he made the "careless mistake" of failing to specify that he "was talking only about the WHITE working-class."
Before Haidt posted his correction, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, posted a critique of Haidt on June 8 on Monkey Cage, a forum for politically-inclined academics. Gelman's piece was titled, "Lamentably ignorant psychology researcher spews political platitudes without realizing that he's trying to explain a phenomenon that does not exist." Gelman included a link to his own blog with the intriguing headline, "Stop me before I aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
Gelman pointed out that: 
Ronald Reagan did about 20 percentage points better among voters in the upper third of income, compared to voters in the lower third. The relation between income and voting since 1980 is about the same as it was in the 1940s.
Gelman defines "working-class" as those in the bottom third of the income distribution. He is also including all races and ethnicities and not focusing on whites. This will prove important in the debate.
On June 17 Haidt amended his argument to refer specifically to white working-class voters. He broke white voters into four categories: those without college degrees who were working; those without degrees who were not working; those with college degrees and a job; and those with degrees but without a job.
Tracking Democratic and Republican self-identification among these four groups of whites, using findings from the American National Election Studies surveys conducted over four decades beginning in the 1970s, Haidt concentrated his attention specifically on employed whites without college degrees.
As a way of defining the white working-class, this category - whites without college who are working - has the advantage of eliminating students, the retired, those unable to work because of disability and those on welfare. The disadvantages of this definition include the failure to count unemployed blue-collar workers, who are certainly working-class, and the inclusion of highly successful businessmen who do not have college degrees. Bill Gates, for example, would be included in this category.
Nonetheless, Haidt's results are striking. Democratic self-identification among employed whites without degrees (the red line) nosedives from roughly 37 percent to 25 percent over four decades.
Republican self-identification over the same period, among these same voters, grows from roughly 21 percent in the 1970s to 30 percent in the 2000s:
After Haidt posted his amended analysis, Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, weighed in on the debate, posting an essay on Monkey Cage on June 17 called "The Party of the American Working Man and Woman."
"How did a nice psychologist like Haidt wander into this minefield?" Bartels asked: 
Ah, the white working-class, yet again. I wish some psychologist would study why this particular topic generates so much interest and emotion. Perhaps it has something to do with the resonance of the term 'working-class' - and with the flexibility of that term in successive iterations of the debate.
Bartels went on to raise a key question: is the white working-class defection limited to the South, and primarily an issue of race, or is the defection national in scope, involving the broader social, cultural, and moral revolutions of the past 50 years.
Bartels produced the following graphic to argue that the defection is entirely southern:
"While working whites without college degrees have become more Republican in their presidential voting behavior (by 4.5% per decade), working whites without college degrees have become more Democratic (by 1.6% per decade)," Bartels wrote.
Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist from Emory University who has written extensively about the changing composition of the two parties, countered Bartels in an e-mail to participants in the debate:
My view is that the single best indicator of 'working-class' status is occupation-white-collar vs. blue-collar. This excludes non-working respondents. And when you look at northern whites over time there is a very clear pattern - there has been a sharp decline in Democratic identification among blue-collar whites while Democratic identification among white-collar whites has remained stable.
A similar trend is evident when it comes to House voting. When it comes to presidential voting, there is a lot of year to year variation, but blue-collar whites used to be much more Democratic than white-collar whites. Recently, however, they have voted almost identically.
Abramowitz produced the following two charts to show that the sharp movement away from the Democratic Party by white working-class voters occurred in the North as well as the South.
First, by party identification:
Party Identification by Decade
Northern Whites Blue-collar (green line) White-collar (blue line)
Second, in actual voting:
House Vote
Northern Whites
Enter Sam Best, of the University of Connecticut, and Brian Krueger, of the University of Rhode Island, political scientists who work with election day exit polls conducted by television networks and cable news stations. Best and Krueger provided exit poll evidence to The Times supporting the argument made by Abramowitz that white working class support for the Democratic Party declined across the board, but that it declined at a much sharper rate in the South than in the North. They show that in two election years, 1984, with Reagan at the top of the ticket, and in 1994, when Newt Gingrich loyalists gave the Republican party control of the House for the first time in 40 years, that Democratic House candidates took a beating in both the North and South. In the South, Democratic House candidates in 1984 lost the white non-college vote by 39.7 - 60.3, and by 35.6 - 64.4 in 1994. In the North, Midwest and West, the white non-college vote for Democratic House candidates was just 44 - 56 in 1984, and fell to 40.8 - 59.2 in 1994. Since 1994, according to the Best- Krueger data, Democrats have not been able to break 50 percent with either group, losing northern non-college whites by an average of 46.9 - 53.1 and southern non-college whites by 34.4 - 65.6.
Although this is an intra-academic dispute, the stakes are high. Differing stands determine competing interpretations of the past 40 years of American politics, conflicting analyses of the 2012 election, and alternative projections of the near-term future of American politics.
White working class voting trends are obviously of vital interest to key players in this November's election. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, noted that last year Obama's already weak support among non-college whites was dropping. "Working-class white voters were a Republican opportunity," Garin said in an interview with The Times.
In 2010 - the year of a decisive Democratic rout - non-college whites, North and South, cast only 33 percent of their ballots for House Democratic candidates, the lowest level in exit poll history.
With that constituency ready and waiting, "Republicans this year picked their worst possible candidate," Garin argues, contending that Romney's wealth and background provoke animosity to Republican elites among white working-class voters, partially counterbalancing the hostility of many of these voters to President Obama.
William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, published a study last month assuming three different scenarios for turnout and voting margins among whites and minorities in the upcoming November election.
In the first of Frey's scenarios, 2012 will replicate the turnout and voting patterns of 2008 among both whites and minorities. "If that occurs, Obama wins with 29 states and 358 electoral votes," Frey writes.
The second Frey scenario provides that both white and black turnout and voting patterns of 2004 are repeated in 2012. Under this Frey scenario, Romney beats Obama with 286 electoral votes in 30 states.
The third Frey scenario calls for white turnout and voting patterns to replicate those of 2004, and for minority turnout and voting patterns to replicate 2008 - "something closer to what this year's election promises - strong partisan participation by both whites and minorities." In this case, Frey writes, "results favor an Obama win - but barely."
According to Frey's third scenario, "Obama squeaks by with 292 electoral votes spread among 24 states," but his victory depends on winning by very slim margins in four key states - Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Oregon - which together have 66 electoral college votes, far more than enough to tip the contest to Romney if they go the other way.
Frey's analysis demonstrates a crucial fact about current presidential politics: that despite making up vastly different percentages of the electorate, shifts in behavior by both white voters (76 percent) and minorities (24 percent) are key to the outcome.
In an e-mail to The Times, Bartels described the strategic choices facing both campaigns:
If the Democratic Party can do something to win one more non-college white vote, without alienating anyone else, it is exactly one vote closer to winning. If it can do something to win one more college white vote, or Latino vote, or Asian vote, without alienating anyone else, it is exactly one vote closer to winning. If it wins one more non-college white vote and loses one college white vote, or Latino vote, or Asian vote in the process, it is not any closer to winning. The interesting strategic questions have entirely to do with the marginal shifts in vote probabilities produced in different groups by different sorts of appeals, and their collateral political costs (whether alienation or opportunity costs).
In other words, the white electorate remains central to the strategic choices of both the Romney and Obama campaigns, but so does every other significant slice of the population.

The Week's Bests
Catherine Kaputa says successful entrepreneurs have five counterintuitive habits, including understanding that when people say, "You're starting what?" they are probably on to something: "In 1980, Fred Carl Jr was designing a new home kitchen and his wife, Margaret, wanted a heavy-duty range like her mother's 1947 Chambers range. They weren't made anymore so Carl looked into restaurant ranges; but they weren't suitable for homes. So Carl decided to make one. All the major manufacturers told Carl that no one would want a commercial-style range for the home. Everyone thought he was crazy. That's when Carl realized he had a good business idea, and named his range, Viking, because it was strong and enduring."
Tim Berry asks you not to give away ownership: "Giving a piece of your new business isn't like buying a round of drinks at a table, but sometimes people treat that as if it were. But the truth is that you only have 100 percentage points to give away. The best ownership structure is 100 percent you. If, however, you need resources, key people and investment, then you need those percentage points to trade them for absolutely critical long-term relationships, or money. Not to make your cousin happy. Not to save on attorney fees."

HEADLINE: The Litigation That Haunts Goldman Sachs

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: A decision by Judge Paul A. Crotty of Federal District Court in Manhattan will put the firm's 2007 sales of collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages back under the microscope. 

 BODY:
Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, may well be thinking of Michael Corleone's famous line in the otherwise forgettable "The Godfather: Part III": "Just when I thought I was out ... they pull me back in." 
Judge Paul A. Crotty of Federal District Court in Manhattan issued a decision last week that will put the firm's 2007 sales of collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages back under the microscope by refusing to dismiss an investor lawsuit accusing Goldman of making misleading statements about its ethical standards.
Rejecting Goldman's motion to dismiss the complaint means that the plaintiffs' lawyers will get to start digging through the firm for evidence of misconduct. 
Goldman did not come out on the short end completely, however, because the judge dismissed a claim over its decision to not disclose a so-called Wells notice issued in 2009 by the Securities and Exchange Commission informing the firm that S.E.C. staff members intended to recommend an enforcement action against Goldman.
The case concerns sales of four C.D.O.'s in which Goldman has been accused of having a conflict of interest. The firm constructed the securities to be sold to its investors while failing to disclose that it was taking short positions against them. 
For one deal, called Abacus, it did not disclose that its client, the hedge fund Paulson & Company, had participated in selecting the underlying mortgage-backed securities in order to take a bearish position. The firm agreed to settle an S.E.C. lawsuit by paying a $550 million penalty while admitting that it made a "mistake" in not disclosing that "that Paulson's economic interests were adverse to C.D.O. investors."
The plaintiffs are purchasers of Goldman stock from 2007 through 2010 claiming that the firm and Mr. Blankfein committed fraud in violation of Rule 10b-5 by making misleading disclosures about how it sought to avoid conflicts of interest like those found in the C.D.O. transactions and not providing notification about the S.E.C.'s intention to sue the firm over its conduct. 
Goldman filed a motion to dismiss the case before any discovery occurred. In deciding the motion, Judge Crotty was required to accept everything in the investors' complaint as true.
The statements at issue are fairly generic, the typical niceties issued by public companies about how much they value complying with the law. Among the statements that the investors claim were misleading were ones like: "Our reputation is one of our most important assets," "We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to ... address conflicts of interest," and my favorite, "Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business."
Goldman made two arguments why statements of this type could not be the basis for a securities fraud claim. First, it asserted that they were only opinions and, at worst, constituted statements investors would not take seriously -- essentially, the salesman's assertion that no one believes a product really is the "best," "fastest" or "revolutionary." 
Judge Crotty was rather dismissive of this argument, pointing out in a footnote in the opinion, "If Goldman's claim of 'honesty' and 'integrity' are simply puffery, the world of finance may be in more trouble than we recognize."
The second argument was that the statements were not "material" because reasonable investors would not consider them important. The standard for materiality is so broad that it is almost impossible to dismiss a case on this ground, and the judge found the statements could be of enough importance to investors to allow the case to move forward.
More ominous for Goldman and Mr. Blankfein is Judge Crotty's determination that the statements about Goldman's ethical standards could be fraudulent. He relied in part on Goldman's admission in the settlement with the S.E.C. that it made a "mistake" in the marketing materials for the Abacus C.D.O. as evidence that its statements about ethical standards might have been misleading, even though the firm neither admitted nor denied liability in concluding the case. 
"Given Goldman's fraudulent acts," the judge wrote, "it could not have genuinely believed that its statements about complying with the letter and spirit of the law -- and that its continued success depends upon it, valuing its reputation, and its ability to address 'potential' conflict of interests -- were accurate and complete."
One reason companies agree to settle cases with the S.E.C. is to avoid any finding of wrongdoing that can be used by investors in private lawsuits. Judge Crotty's reference to Goldman's statements in the settlement shows that companies might not get a complete free pass if the S.E.C. is able to extract at least some small admission of misconduct when it concludes a case. That is likely to cause lawyers to be very cautious about making any admission in a settlement with the S.E.C. for fear that it will come back to bite them.
The judge's finding that Goldman's failure to disclose the Wells notice was not a violation of Rule 10b-5 will give greater comfort to companies under investigation that decide not to disclose the status of the case. 
The Wells notice is only a statement that the staff of the S.E.C. expects to seek authority to file a case, and the likelihood of litigation at that point is still too uncertain to require a company to disclose the possibility. A company only has to make a disclosure when it has information showing it is more likely that a case will be filed, a vague standard that gives management a great deal of discretion about when to tell investors. 
Although it won on that issue, it is interesting to note that Goldman disclosed in its most recent 10-K filed in February that it recently received a Wells notice about one of its C.D.O. transactions. The firm seems to have changed it approach from 2010, when the S.E.C.'s lawsuit over the Abacus transaction took investors by surprise.
Judge Crotty's decision means the case now moves into discovery, in which the plaintiffs' lawyers will demand a raft of corporate documents and depositions from Mr. Blankfein and the two other Goldman executives named as defendants -- the president, Gary D. Cohn, and the chief financial officer, David A. Viniar. 
Goldman can try to stop the lawsuit by seeking permission from Judge Crotty to file an interlocutory appeal. Under a federal statute, 28 U.S.C.  1292(b), the judge must determine that the decision allowing the case to proceed "involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."
Judges are usually reluctant to authorize appeals at an early stage of a case, so Goldman faces an uphill battle to get appellate review of the case. If it cannot convince Judge Crotty to allow an appeal, then the pressure will increase to reach a quick settlement if Goldman wants to limit scrutiny of its C.D.O. sales.

HEADLINE: Former Obama Aide Joins Re-Election Campaign in Press Post

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Jennifer Psaki, one of the best-known and liked aides in President Obama's long 2008 campaign and then in his White House, is joining his 2012 re-election effort after less than a year as a private-sector consultant. 

 BODY:
Jennifer Psaki, one of the best-known and most well liked aides in President Obama's long 2008 campaign and then in his White House, is joining his re-election effort after less than a year as a private-sector consultant.
 Ms. Psaki will become Mr. Obama's traveling press secretary next week, a role that makes her the campaign counterpart to the White House press secretary, Jay Carney. The need for the separate press officers reflects the president's dual roles as candidate and head of state.
 "With the president on the road in the campaign, we needed a traveling press secretary," said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's longtime strategist. "Jen has a long association with the president and is respected and trusted by the news media. She is a thorough-going pro. There simply was no one better for this role."
 Mr. Obama probably spent more time traveling with Ms. Psaki during the 2008 campaign than with any other aide, and he tried to dissuade her from leaving the White House last year. 
During the earlier campaign, she filled a lesser role as the campaign's liaison and spokeswoman to the media entourage, and she reported to Robert Gibbs, the campaign press secretary. Now Ms. Psaki will have broader responsibilities in dealing with the news media, including being a frequent face of the campaign on television and a member of the campaign brain trust in Chicago. 
 Ms. Psaki has already been a frequent pro-Obama presence on cable television news programs, though she has been working since October as senior vice president and managing director for the Washington office of Global Strategy Group, a public relations firm with corporate, nonprofit and political clients. She will take a leave from the firm through the election. 
 In the White House for nearly three years, Ms. Psaki rose from deputy press secretary, acting as a daily intermediary between the news media and Mr. Obama's crisis-forged economic team, to deputy communications director, responsible for long-range communications strategies on anticipated issues and policies.
On a communications team often criticized by Democrats outside the White House as too insular and prickly, the affable and unflappable Ms. Psaki was easily the most popular member and was said to be runner-up to Mr. Carney for the press secretary job in 2011.

HEADLINE: Obama Challenges Romney on His Home Turf

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: In New Hampshire, the president criticized what he called his opponent's record of sending American jobs overseas. 

 BODY:
DURHAM, N.H. - President Obama traveled to Mitt Romney's home territory on Monday to challenge his Republican rival on what he described as a long record of shipping American jobs overseas.
During a rally before 1,200 cheering locals in a hot high school gymnasium, Mr. Obama called Mr. Romney's views on outsourcing "not just part of his record, it's part of his overall economic vision." 
Mr. Obama's aides, smelling blood, say the president will continue to pound the outsourcing theme. On Monday, the president went after rebuttals from the Romney camp that off-shoring - sending jobs overseas -and outsourcing - the contracting out of certain jobs to outside firms - are different.
"If you are a worker whose job went overseas, you don't need somebody trying to explain to you the difference between outsourcing and offshoring," Mr. Obama said. 
The president sharply criticized Mr. Romney and Republicans in Congress, saying they were solely interested in returning to failed economic policies of the past.
"We don't need more top-down economics," Mr. Obama said. "You need someone who's going to wake up every single day and fight for American jobs and investments here in the United States."
Mr. Obama's aides have been highlighting Mr. Romney's record in private equity, along with reports that the firm he once ran invested in companies described as leaders in outsourcing jobs to China. The Romney campaign says the reports are misleading.
Mr. Obama acknowledged on Monday that the upcoming election will be close. During his speech here, he made no mention of the Supreme Court ruling expected this week on his signature achievement as president: the health care overhaul law.
After New Hampshire, Mr. Obama headed to Boston for a fund-raiser. He will now have attended more than 100 such events, according to Mark Knoller, a White House correspondent for CBS News who has been tracking Mr. Obama's travels to raise cash for the Democrats. On Tuesday, the president will attend fund-raisers in Atlanta and Miami.

HEADLINE: Sandberg Joins Facebook's Board

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook said on Monday that its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has joined the social network's board, becoming the first woman to serve as a director for the company. 

 BODY:
Facebook said on Monday that its chief operating officer, Sheryl K. Sandberg, had joined the social network's board, becoming the first woman to serve as a director for the company.
The elevation of Ms. Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, is an acknowledgment of the crucial role she plays at the company. Lured away from Google, she became one of Facebook's most public figures, making regular appearances at events like the World Economic Forum and the annual Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
Such is Ms. Sandberg's stature that her profile is second only to that of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive. And she has served as one of the company's links to the corporate world, playing a large role in taking Facebook public and working with business partners.
"Facebook is working every day to make the world more open and connected," Ms. Sandberg said in a statement. "It's a mission that I'm deeply passionate about, and I feel fortunate to be part of a company that is having such a profound impact in the world."
She has long been regarded as a star in the corporate firmament. At Google, she was a high-ranking executive with prominent roles in sales and operations. And before that, she served as the chief of staff for Lawrence H. Summers at the Treasury Department.
At Facebook, Ms. Sandberg is largely regarded as an efficient operating executive who frees up Mr. Zuckerberg to work on important projects and chart the long-term direction of the company he founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004.
Her responsibilities include overseeing sales and marketing, business development and corporate policy.
"Sheryl has been my partner in running Facebook and has been central to our growth and success over the years," Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement. "Her understanding of our mission and long-term opportunity, and her experience both at Facebook and on public company boards makes her a natural fit for our board."
Ms. Sandberg is joining a relatively small board for a company whose market value as of Monday stood at $87.8 billion. Others on the Facebook board include the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen, James W. Breyer and Peter A. Thiel; Erskine B. Bowles, the former Clinton administration official; Donald E. Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Company; and Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix.
She already serves on the board of the Walt Disney Company.
An earlier version of this post included the incorrect middle initial for the former secretary of the Treasury Department. It is Lawrence H. Summers, not W.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Rights Groups Unhappy With Supreme Court's Mixed Decision

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Immigrant rights groups expressed unhappiness over the Supreme Court's mixed ruling on Arizona's immigration law. 

 BODY:
Immigrant rights groups said they worried that the Supreme Court's decision on Monday allowing a key provision in Arizona's tough immigration law to stand would lead to racial profiling, as Gov. Jan Brewer described the decision as "a victory for the rule of law."
Supreme Court has upheld what Arizonans knew all along - states have a right and responsibility to protect their citizens. A proud day!
- Jan Brewer (@GovBrewer)25 Jun 12
"It is also a victory for the 10th Amendment and all Americans who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens," said Ms. Brewer, whose administration defended the law. 
As my colleagues Adam Liptak and John H. Cushman Jr.report, the Supreme Court rejected provisions of the law that would have required immigrants to register with the federal government and would have made it a state crime for immigrants to hold jobs without proper documents. 
In the 5-to-3 ruling, the court also struck down part of the law that would have allowed the police to arrest those suspected of being in the country illegally, without a warrant. But the court ruled in favor of a key provision enabling the state to require the police to check the immigration status of people they detain.
#SCOTUS #SB1070 ruling allows enforcement of law that codifies racial profiling. -@anoorani. http://t.co/aoRzxsz3 #immigration
- Ali Noorani (@anoorani)25 Jun 12
Ali Noorani, executive director of theNational Immigration Forum, calledthe provision that the Supreme Court allowed "the pointy end of the sword of the Arizona immigration law."
"Just as the nation is inching closer to a consensus on the need for solutions on immigration, the Supreme Court is dividing the nation," he said.
In Arizona, Puente Arizona, an immigration rights group, said its members would continue to fight the state law, known as S.B. 1070. The group is also calling on the Obama administration, which fought the state law in court, to limit access of Arizona's law enforcement officers to data and resources of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. 
BREAKING: TELL THE PRESIDENT TO STOP #SB1070. http://t.co/Beoi5FZK #justice4az CUT OFF ARIZONA'S ACCESS TO ICE
- Puente Arizona (@PuenteAZ)25 Jun 12
We never had faith in the #SCOTUS case. We have faith in our people http://t.co/w3WL8hrW WE WILL NOT COMPLY #sb1070 #justice4az
- Puente Arizona (@PuenteAZ)25 Jun 12
In an interview, the group's leader, Carlos Garcia, said the ruling paved the way for "racial profiling" statewide.
"It's what we lived under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and now it's expanded to the whole state," he said, referring to the controversial Maricopa County sheriff, who is known for his outspoken stance against illegal immigration and crackdowns on illegal immigrants. "Sheriff Arpaio has been vindicated and allowed to continue his abuse and racial profiling."
On Monday, Mr. Arpaio said on a local television station, KNXV, that "this is a good section that's been upheld." 
"I would have liked to see where we would have the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being here illegally and book them into our jails, but that's not going to happen," he said about one of the provisions in the law that was rejected. "But I think this sends a message that we will be involved in enforcing the illegal alien laws and our police officers will be able to at least try to determine if they're in this country illegally."
Attorney General Thomas Horne saidthe state won the "big one" of the provisions challenged.
In Arizona, The East Valley Tribune gathered
comments from people on both sides of the debate. 
Todd Landfried, a spokesman for Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, said, "We hope that this important decision will discourage states from considering state-level immigration laws and push Congress to directly address the issue of immigration reform expeditiously in a practical and positive manner that helps our businesses, economy and country succeed and grow while ensuring our nation's security."
Caroline Isaacs, director of the American Friends Service Committee's Tucson office, saw the Supreme Court's decision as upholding the "worst part of this mean-spirited law, even as it overturns other sections. In effect, it legalizes racial profiling. How can law enforcement know a person's immigration status simply by looking at them? Most troubling is this decision undermines the moral fiber of the U.S. Constitution, and can be used by other states to enact laws that also enable racial profiling."
Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, said the decision "is a stark reminder of the need for Congress to act immediately on comprehensive immigration reform. It also reminds us that our State Legislature should stop focusing on divisive issues and instead spend their time on job creation and smart economic development for the state of Arizona."
The ruling prompted rallies and protests at the Capitol, with Puente Arizona urging its members also to show up outside federal immigration offices later on Monday.

In the last two years, five other states - Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah - have adopted variations on Arizona's law. Parts of those laws also were on pause pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case.

Civil rights groups that separately challenged the law over concerns that it would lead to rights abuses said their lawsuits would go on.
Even with the limitations that the Supreme Court put on Arizona, the immigration status check will lead to racial profiling and discrimination,said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
"We are not done in Arizona and will continue the battle against discriminatory laws like these that encourage racial profiling and undermine the constitutional guarantee of equal protection," Mr. Romero said. "Be it in the courts or in state legislatures, we will aggressively take on these laws and blunt the effects of this miscarriage of justice. When local police can stop and detain anyone they perceive as 'foreign' because of their skin color, their accent or their surname, it is a watershed moment for civil rights."
Ms. Brewer also said in her statement that she was confident that Arizona's law enforcement officers would apply this law in an "even-handed manner." 
"I know the state of Arizona and its law enforcement officers are up to the task," she said. "The case for S.B. 1070 has always been about our support for the rule of law. That means every law, including those against both illegal immigration and racial profiling. Law enforcement will be held accountable should this statute be misused in a fashion that violates an individual's civil rights."

HEADLINE: A Town That Backed a Failed Project Refuses to Pay

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Residents of Moberly, Mo., got a shock last year when they discovered that their city had guaranteed $39 million in bonds, sold by an independent authority, to help a Chinese company build a plant to make sucralose, an artificial sweetener.
The project fell apart in a matter of months, and residents learned that they had been misled about the company's track record in China -- and that they were now expected to make the bond payments. 
But municipal bond market participants say they were shocked, too, by how quickly the city of about 14,000 would walk away from a solemn promise to guarantee the debt payments through 2025, the life of the bonds.
Cities like Moberly that guarantee debts for entities that borrow for projects like parking garages and hockey arenas often ''don't understand that they are responsible for making these payments,'' said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, a research and consulting firm. However, he said, ''It's as if your kid runs up a $400 cellphone bill. You can't get out of paying it by saying you didn't authorize that.''
Moberly, where the biggest employer is a state prison, had responded eagerly to a pitch by the Missouri Department of Economic Development to host the project, hoping for hundreds of jobs. The company, Mamtek International, was said to have a sucralose plant in Fujian Province producing a sweetener called SweetO, for use in drinks, candy and pharmaceuticals. Most of the authority debt, to go toward building and equipping the plant, was issued under a federal stimulus program allowing private investors to use tax-exempt municipal financing.
But when a bond payment came due last August, with the building still unfinished, Mamtek officials said they didn't have the money. Construction stopped; the handful of employees in Moberly were laid off. Weeks of confusion followed, with subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission, rumors of a split between the Chinese company and its United States subsidiary, reports that the plant would be liquidated and fears that the bond proceeds were gone forever.
When the city's guarantee was called, the Moberly City Council issued a statement saying: ''The city's taxpayers, under these circumstances, should not bear the burden of Mamtek's failures or be asked to 'bail out' their shareholders or investors.''
But the bond market saw the failure as Moberly's. Standard & Poor's cut the city's own credit to junk status, dropping it a rare nine notches, from A to B, even on debts that had nothing to do with the sweetener plant. (The bonds for the plant went from A-minus to D.) Market analysts warned that Moberly's failure to pay might tarnish the credit of other towns in Missouri. Stormy hearings followed in the statehouse, with bankers and analysts testifying that the whole deal had rested on the credibility of Moberly's guarantee, not the Chinese company's prospects.
Investigators also learned that state development officials had learned -- before the bonds were sold -- that Mamtek's sucralose plant in China had never opened, because of environmental concerns. But that information was not relayed to Moberly, according to a report by the Missouri House Interim Committee on Government Oversight and Accountability.
Officials in Moberly said they could not comment while other investigations were pending.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Housing Recovery As Sales of New Homes Gain

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans bought new homes in May at the fastest pace in more than two years. The increase suggests a modest recovery is continuing in the housing market, despite weaker job growth. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that sales of new homes increased 7.6 percent in May from April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 369,000 homes. That is the best pace since April 2010, the last month that buyers could qualify for a federal home-buying tax credit.
Even with the gains, the annual sales pace is less than half the 700,000 that economists consider to be healthy.
Yet other signs show the housing market is slowly improving nearly five years after the bubble burst.
Builders are gaining confidence in the market and starting to build more homes. Mortgage rates have plunged to the lowest levels on record, making home buying more affordable. Prices remain low and have started to stabilize. And sales of previously occupied homes are much higher than the same time last year.
The median price of a new home sold in May edged down 0.6 percent from April, to $234,500. But the median price was 5.6 percent higher than a year earlier.
One reason prices could rise is that the supply of new homes for sale remains extremely low. Just 145,000 new homes were for sale in May. That is not much higher than the 144,000 available in April, which was the lowest supply on records dating back to 1963.
''With no excess inventory of unsold new homes, any sustained rebound in new-home sales should quickly translate into firmer prices,'' said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics.
Builders are responding to the low supply. In May, they requested the most permits to start construction on homes and apartments in three and a half years.
The gains in new homes sold were concentrated in two regions of the country last month. Sales surged 36.7 percent in the Northeast and 12.7 percent in the South. Sales fell 10.6 percent in the Midwest and were down 3.5 percent in the West.

HEADLINE: A Steep Fall for Shares as Outlook for Europe Continues to Be Gloomy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States fell sharply on Monday on doubts that a European summit meeting this week would move any closer to solving the region's festering debt crisis.
The pessimistic outlook led investors to flock to safe-haven assets. In a sign of investor skittishness, the euro fell broadly and Spanish and Italian bond yields rose.
The world's financial markets remain vulnerable to Europe's worsening debt crisis, fearing that it could cause further havoc to the slowing global economy. 
Expectations for the two-day European summit meeting, which starts on Thursday, are low after Germany resisted pressure for creation of common euro zone bonds and for a more flexible use of Europe's rescue funds when the region's four biggest economies met last week.
''Last week we were very hopeful that they were moving forward and the meetings this week would have a positive ending. Today there is a lot of doubt the E.U. summit will generate anything substantial,'' said Gail M. Dudack, chief investment strategist for the Dudack Research Group in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138.12 points, or 1.09 percent, to close at 12,502.66. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.30 points, or 1.6 percent, to finish at 1,313.72, pushing it nearly to a break-even level for June. The Nasdaq composite index slid 56.26 points, or 1.95 percent, to end at 2,836.16.
European equity markets also fell. The FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 1.6 percent to close at 986.41 points, its biggest daily decline in more than three weeks as stocks retreated for a third successive session.
News that Cyprus became the fifth of the 17 European Union countries using the euro to ask for emergency funds just hours after Spain formally requested help for its banks helped push up gold prices. Gold futures for August delivery gained $21.50 to settle at $1,587.50 an ounce.
In the United States, financial and energy stocks were among the primary decliners. News that Spain had requested help for its struggling banks pressured financial stocks.
The two-day summit meeting in Brussels will be the 20th time leaders have met to try to resolve a crisis that has spread across Europe since it began in Greece in early 2010.
''There's been a lot of rhetoric coming out of Europe about the meeting later this week not really accomplishing anything, so everybody is just running from risk to something perceived as being safe,'' said Jeffrey N. Given, managing director and portfolio manager at John Hancock Asset Management in Boston.
''People are moving out of stocks and into Treasuries. Once again, everyone is trying to preserve capital,'' Mr. Given said.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, dashed any lingering hope in financial markets that Europe would issue common euro zone bonds to underpin its single currency after Spain formally became the fourth country to request a financial rescue.
Ms. Merkel said shared debt liability within the euro zone was ''economically wrong'' and ''counterproductive.''
Ten-year Spanish government bonds fell, pushing yields higher to 6.64 percent, while the cost of insuring five-year Spanish debt also rose.
German bonds snapped three weeks of losses to gain on safe-haven buying. The price of bund futures settled up 127 ticks at 142.06 while the yield on 10-year government bonds fell to 1.46 percent.
The euro fell as low as $1.2469, the weakest since June 12, and was last down 0.4 percent at $1.25.03. The euro fell to 99.56 against the yen.
In the United States, investors moved into what were perceived as safer Treasury bonds. That pushed the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up by 21/32 to 101 11/32. The yield fell to 1.60 percent, from 1.68 percent late Friday.
Wal-Mart Stores was the lone advancer on the Dow. Walmart Canada said the company was opening 47 hiring centers across Canada to support its growth plans. The stock rose 1.3 percent to $68.18.
Volume was light with about 5.84 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, well below the daily average of 6.85 billion.
Brent crude fell below $90 at one point, with concerns about faltering global growth and Europe's debt crisis hitting investor confidence. But the global benchmark for oil ended the day slightly higher after trading lower for most of the session.
Crude oil prices in the United States settled down 55 cents to $79.21 a barrel.
Among individual stocks, Chesapeake Energy fell 8.5 percent to $17.03 as the worst performer on the benchmark S.& P. 500 index. Reuters reported that under the direction of its chief executive, Aubrey K.

HEADLINE: First Class as Ransom To Escape the Sardine Can

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BILL CATLETTE gave himself a treat on his last birthday. No more flying in coach.
''It was a present from me to me on my 60th birthday,'' he said. ''I said, look, I've done this for 40 years and it's not getting any more fun. My back hurt, and a lot of it had to do with traveling and being jammed into tight spaces for long periods of time. I decided life is too short. I'm just not going to do it anymore. And I have not been in a coach seat any time this year.''
Along with his partner and co-author Richard Hadden, Mr. Catlette runs a leadership training and consulting company called Contented Cow Partners. He has logged more than three million lifetime miles with one airline alone and is accustomed to spending 100 nights a year away from his home near Memphis. 
His reason for abandoning coach is simple: ''Coach-class travel has become increasingly awful.''
You might think airlines would cringe to hear that, but they don't, not really. Most airlines are quietly hoping that poor conditions in standard coach, where legroom is often reduced as seats are added, will motivate more business travelers to buy their way out of the sardine can.
Many airlines now offer the option of extra space with premium economy seats on international and, increasingly, on domestic flights. These seats are two to three inches wider, with five to seven extra inches of legroom. The cost is 35 to 85 percent more than basic coach, says SeatGuru.com, which offers detailed comparisons of airline seats.
As they promote premium coach seats, some domestic airlines are also quietly discounting first-class seats on some flights. I flew last month on American Airlines from La Guardia Airport in New York to Tucson, with a connection through Dallas.
The one-way fare was cheap, $140.60. But when I checked in, I was given the option of upgrading to first class, for an extra $135, on the New York-to-Dallas leg. That meant I was served lunch (which was excellent), and got priority boarding and extra space. So I went for it. (Really, boss, it was for research. And the cheapest comparable United one-way coach fare on that route available on Monday (for travel this week) was $402 (or $899 in first class).
Of course, an airline discounting some unsold first-class seats also suggests that those seats may not be as readily available to lower-level elite-status members who used to get them free, via upgrades. Meanwhile, airlines are able to squeeze a little extra revenue from fliers like me who would never consider opting for a full-fare first-class ticket.
''I see with Delta, sometimes the fare difference between first and coach is not that much, certainly not as much as it used to be,'' said Mr. Catlette, who flies mostly on Delta out of Memphis. ''I've seen cases where for a trip to New York from Memphis, the cheapest round-trip coach fare is $900, but for $1,100 you can ride in first class.''
How do consulting and speaking-engagement clients react to Mr. Catlette's refusal to fly coach anymore? In most cases, he said, clients are not asked to pay for first-class tickets but rather to just cover the cost of ''upgradable coach.'' That refers typically to full-fare coach tickets (as opposed to cheaper nonrefundable coach fares) that usually ensure an upgrade to first for customers, like Mr. Catlette, who also have high elite status on the airline.
Even on international flights, the airlines seem to be hoping that the discomforts of basic coach travel will encourage more business travelers to pay more for a better seat. ''No doubt about it, they are making travel so miserable that we will be tempted to pay for a few more inches,'' said Michael Johnson, an international business traveler who recently flew from Boston to Paris in Air France's Voyageur basic coach -- where the cheap seats have a scant 32 inches of legroom and are in eight-across rows.
''It was the worst flight ever,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''As we were finally airborne, the Frenchman in the seat ahead of me decided to take a nap. He pushed his seat back to the maximum, blocking my reading light and squeezing me so hard that my knees were bruised.''
Air France, like many airlines, is eager to offer you a way to avoid the squeeze. When you book a standard coach fare online, a screen pops up suggesting, ''Choose Premium Voyageur'' and ''you receive 40 percent more space.''
It'll cost you, though. A round-trip New York-to-Paris ticket on Air France this week with return next week was $2,651 in Voyageur basic coach, versus $4,194 in Premium Voyageur. That is cheap, though, compared with first class -- $15,907 for the same itinerary. Of course, companies receive discounts in exchange for a guaranteed amount of business with the airline, and fares are usually cheaper if they are booked well in advance.
As to first class on a domestic flight, I had a note of caution in an e-mail last week from a business traveler who gave no name.
The reader had just flown from Washington to Chicago on United Airlines. ''Got a complimentary upgrade to first,'' the e-mail said. ''We were given a beverage and a bag of chips. That's it. (I assume they walked through economy and slapped people.) It's getting bad up front, too.''

HEADLINE: The Patriotic Pull Of the Railroad

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
TRAINS may not figure as prominently in the popular imagination as they did in the 1950s, when every American boy seemed to have an electric train set, but the railroad industry is, to be sure, still chugging along.
Union Pacific, for example, earned revenue of $19.6 billion in 2011, an increase of 15 percent over 2010 and a record high for the company, which dates to President Abraham Lincoln's signing of the Pacific Railway Act in 1862.
Now, to mark its 150th anniversary, along with rolling out a vintage steam engine for events from Louisiana to California, Union Pacific is rolling out a national advertising campaign. 
Print ads feature Union Pacific trains winding through sweeping American landscapes, while copy emphasizes the railroad's role in the country's history -- and future.
''In 1862, President Lincoln said start,'' says one ad where a train bisects a panoramic mountain setting in California. ''He never said stop.'' Another, with a train near silos on a Minnesota farm, says, ''Connecting shining sea to fruited plain.'' And another, as a train traces the California coast at sunset, says, ''Today we celebrate the most important day in the history of our company. Tomorrow.''
Donna Kush, assistant vice president for corporate communications at Union Pacific, which is based in Omaha, said the ads were meant to call attention to the industry's role in the economy.
''The railroad industry does have a very American type of image with it, but I think people have lost touch a little bit with how integral we are to the economy,'' Ms. Kush said. ''Some people say if the railroads stopped running, the country would shut down in a few days.''
For the ads, ''First and foremost we did want to use what we call hero shots,'' Ms. Kush said. ''We wanted to show our locomotives especially because they have an American flag on them, which just adds to the Americana feel,'' she said, referring to requests from employees to feature a flag on engines after 9/11.
The ads are by Bailey Lauerman, a Nebraska agency with offices in Lincoln and Omaha. The photographer is Chris Gordaneer who, interestingly, considering the patriotic tone of the campaign, lives in Toronto.
Many of the ads will go where the railroad, operating primarily west of the Mississippi River, does not, namely in East Coast publications like The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Within those newspapers' readerships, Ms. Kush said, are ''opinion leaders and key stakeholders.''
Ads also will appear in Time magazine, and the effort includes a microsite, UP150.com.
The company, which declined to reveal the cost of the campaign, spent $10.1 million on advertising in 2011, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP.
A decline in coal production, the result of a number of factors including the falling price of natural gas, poses a challenge for railroads, with coal freight accounting for 24.7 percent of the industry's revenue in 2011, according to the railroad association.
The fortunes of Union Pacific are not as tightly bound to coal, with 22 percent of revenue from such shipments. The company also reaps benefits from the ascendancy of natural gas, particularly in the widespread -- and environmentally contentious -- mining practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This year, the company expects to haul as many as 230,000 carloads of fracking material, including blasting sand and steel pipe, an increase from 45,000 carloads in 2010.
''If we do have a transition to natural gas, Union Pacific will not suffer as much as other carriers because they're not as reliant on coal,'' said Isaac Pino, a transportation analyst at the Motley Fool, an investment Web site.
Mr. Pino reviewed the new ad campaign and said it could resonate with investors, who in a downturn are drawn to companies like Union Pacific that not only consistently pay dividends, but also have staying power.
''The ads in a sense convey the message that this is a company that has been around for a long time and you can put it in your portfolio without worrying too much,'' Mr. Pino said.
The anniversary date of the signing of the Pacific Railway Act is July 1, and throughout the summer and fall a vintage Union Pacific steam engine, No. 844, will make steam-billowing entrances in dozens of cities.
The last steam engine built for the railroad, No. 844 went into service in 1944 as a passenger engine and was pulled from service in 1959 when the industry's conversion to diesel engines was at full throttle. (The railroad carried passengers for more than a century until most of the nation's long-distance service was transferred to Amtrak in 1971.)
For the new ads, which feature contemporary engines and cars, Marty Amsler, a creative director at Bailey Lauerman, said the tone was meant to be more a celebration than a sales pitch.
''We were trying to capture the power of the railroad and the majesty of the landscape that Union Pacific has been part of for 150 years,'' Mr. Amsler said.
While the photographs by Mr. Gordaneer are breathtaking, he did have an advantage over a typical train enthusiast with a camera: he was working for the company that owned the tracks and trains.
''In this case,'' Mr. Amsler said, ''we had a special train show up and stop just long enough for us to take the shot.''

HEADLINE: Crushed by Promises

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Surprised local taxpayers from Stockton, Calif., to Scranton, Pa., are finding themselves obligated for parking garages, hockey arenas and other enterprises that can no longer pay their debts.
Officials have signed them up unknowingly to backstop the bonds of independent authorities, the special bodies of government that run projects like toll roads and power plants.
The practice, meant to save governments money, has been gaining popularity without attracting much notice, and is creating problems for a small but growing number of cities.
Data from Thomson Reuters suggests that local taxpayers are backing so-called enterprise debt at five times the rate they did 10 years ago. The resulting municipal bonds are sometimes called ''double barreled,'' because they are backed by both the future revenue of a project and some sort of taxpayer backstop. The exact wording and mechanics can vary. 
With many cities now preoccupied with other crushing costs -- pension obligations, retiree health care, accumulated unpaid bills -- a sudden call to honor a long-forgotten bond guarantee can be a bolt from the blue, precipitating a crisis. The obligations mostly lurk in the dark. State laws requiring voter pre-approval of bonds don't generally apply to guarantees. Local governments typically don't include them in their own financial statements or set aside reserves to honor them.
''These are debts that do not show up clearly, no matter how closely you look at the balance sheets,'' said Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has written extensively about government debt. They ''come out of the woodwork in bad times.''
In a number of communities, especially in New Jersey, Michigan and Washington State, local officials have recently scrambled to work out fiscal emergencies caused by guarantees and similar promises. Hoboken dodged a bullet last year, for instance, when a buyer was found for a bankrupt hospital whose debt the city had guaranteed. Buena Vista, Va., narrowly missed a creditor foreclosure of its city hall and police building, after a park authority failed to repay the bonds for a golf course.
In other places, bond guarantees have been time bombs, causing problems too severe to be solved in a workout. Stockton may be headed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy this week after pledging taxpayer money to backstop authorities' debts for a hockey arena and other showcase buildings. Scranton, a faded former coal center, touched off a full-blown debt crisis this month, losing access to the capital markets when its City Council refused to honor a taxpayer guarantee for a parking authority's bonds.
Residents of Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg, recently learned from a forensic audit that their city's fiscal woes could be traced to a guarantee issued in 1998, for the bonds of a trash incinerator project. Every few years after that, the authority running the project issued more bonds, and the city guaranteed those as well.
The audit showed that the authority had been selling new bonds for the cash to pay its older bonds -- saving unwitting residents from having to honor their guarantees for a time, but blowing up their debt from the incinerator to an impossible $310 million. That's more than three times what residents owe on the city's own bonds.
Harrisburg tried unsuccessfully to declare bankruptcy last year but was blocked by the state. It is widely expected to try again.
Moody's Investors Service issued a report this year on taxpayer bond guarantees in New Jersey, after noticing a big upswing there since 2008. The firm is making a broad review of places that it rated in the past, where circumstances may now be changed. In New Jersey, it said, some cities and counties had evidently discovered that by working with independent authorities, they could bypass legal limits on their own indebtedness.
The ''full faith and taxing power'' of communities, a solemn pledge, was being used to guarantee revenue bonds for nonessentials like solar-power projects, apartment buildings and a soccer stadium -- things bailout-weary taxpayers might walk away from if the guarantees were called.
Moody's cut several communities' own credit ratings to junk, briefly making New Jersey the nation's leader in junk-rated municipalities. (Now Michigan has that distinction.) The gritty town of Harrison, just across the Passaic River from Newark, had its rating cut a rare eight notches in a single year, when it couldn't honor a promise to pay debts connected with construction of the Red Bull soccer stadium.
Harrison had to borrow from Hudson County to get through the crisis, but that in turn raised doubts about whether the county's taxpayers would honor their guarantee of yet another project's debts -- $85 million for a faltering waste-disposal system.
''We are seeing more of these than we had seen previously,'' said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, a research and advisory firm for municipal bonds. ''The weak economy is making weak projects worse. It is undermining cities' abilities and willingness to backstop these projects when they do fail.''
Though the number of cases is small, Mr. Fabian said, they send a loud signal to investors about a decline in communities' willingness to honor their promises.
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board on Monday released a draft of a new standard that would require governments to disclose details of the guarantees they have issued for other entities' debts. The board started working on the new rules last year, after seeing more and more little-known guarantees coming to light.
The board's research also showed that some guarantees were very large. The State of Texas, for one, has guaranteed the debts of all the school districts in that state, to the tune of a total of $50 billion. Texas has set aside about $25 billion, however, which analysts consider adequate. A number of states have also guaranteed venture capital projects.
Scranton's version of a debt crisis began when a local parking authority said it couldn't make a bond payment coming due in June, calling on the city's guarantee. The authority had issued bonds to finance parking garages that the city had used in a campaign to woo Hilton Hotels and Resorts to operate a conference center downtown.
Each time the authority issued more bonds, the city backed them with a powerful ''full faith and credit'' guarantee. But by 2008 the authority had $54 million in bonds outstanding, and was spending about 60 percent of its budget on debt service -- so much that it could not cut parking rates to compete with cheaper parking lots nearby.
A majority on the City Council refused to honor the guarantee, saying the authority's finances were in disarray and they wanted to strike a blow for fiscal rectitude.
Suddenly, Scranton, which has been in dire fiscal straits for years, was a pariah. Only one bank had been willing to help it raise money, and it backed out of a $16 million deal to provide short-term financing. Without that cash, the mayor said Scranton couldn't make its next payroll. The city's fuel supplier threatened to halt deliveries of gasoline, which would idle the police cars and garbage trucks. More than a dozen other vendors cut off the city's credit.
A bond insurer, Radian Asset Assurance, started a 30-day countdown to foreclosure on the authority's parking garages. The trustee for the bondholders, Bank of New York Mellon, warned that it would get a court-ordered tax increase.
Taken aback, the mayor and City Council changed course, saying Scranton would pay the parking authority's debts after all. But the damage was done. The initial decision to not make the $1 million bond payment had tainted Scranton's credit on all of its debts for the foreseeable future.
''There's no going back,'' said Gary Lewis, a Scranton native and accountant who has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to persuade the City Council to put a public briefing on Chapter 9 bankruptcy onto its agenda. ''We've proven that the city has failed to comply with its existing bond covenants on absolutely everything we owe.''
Indeed, creditors say they have found other ''conditions of default'' that cannot be corrected quickly, like the failure to have structural engineers inspect the parking garages, or to get yearly financial audits. Boyd Hughes, a lawyer for the City Council, said he expected creditors to seize the parking garages and sell them to raise cash for the bondholders.
Mr. Lewis, who works on the forced mergers that follow bank failures, said he did not think the garages would fetch enough in a fire sale to cover all the authority's debts, so the bondholder representatives would soon be back on the city's own doorstep, clamoring for a tax increase that Scranton's guarantee legally entitles them to.
''You can't do it. You can't raise real estate taxes beyond what they are in this city,'' Mr. Lewis said.
Such situations leave states facing painful quandaries, Ms. Reinhart said. In Pennsylvania, not only are Scranton and Harrisburg struggling with bond guarantees, but another troubled city, Allentown, is defending itself against lawsuits by surrounding communities, accusing it of a convoluted plan to make their residents backstop an authority's bonds for a new hockey arena. Construction has stopped on the arena, and residents are living with a big hole in the ground and a cloud of uncertainty.
''It's a possibility that Pennsylvania does nothing and says, 'O.K., you're on your own. You default, and that's that,' '' Ms. Reinhart said. ''Or it could be that the state intervenes, even though it doesn't guarantee the cities' debt explicitly.'' The problem, she said, is that the bailout of just one distressed city ''is a license for everybody to overspend, on the assumption that they'll be bailed out.''

HEADLINE: For City Parents, Frustration Over Rising Cost of Public School

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER; Elbert Chu and Theodoric Meyer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
School budget cuts, rising expenses and grander ambitions for student activities have driven up the cost of sending a child to a New York City public school. Earlier this spring, SchoolBook asked parents to tell us about their school-related spending. Journalists followed up on the hundreds of responses we received, resulting in a series of reports on SchoolBook, in The New York Times and on WNYC. You can find previous reports here.
Ellen Goldstein, the mother of first-grade twins at Public School 130 in Brooklyn, recalls with a twinge of nostalgia certain items that came home from school this year. There was the all-about-fish book, the Popsicle picture frames and two tissue-paper roses for Mother's Day -- all made by her sons. 
What Ms. Goldstein, 46, will not miss plucking from her children's backpacks are the seemingly endless requests for money and supplies that also came home from their small school on the border of Kensington and Windsor Terrace.
It began in September, Ms. Goldstein said, when she and her 6-year-olds lugged in $300 worth of construction paper, index cards, markers and crayons requested by their teachers. Soon, she was regularly receiving Scholastic booklets and permission slips for trips to bowling alleys and pizza parlors that required $5, $6 and $7 to be stuffed into envelopes. The school also organized two photo drives, including one in which she was sent key chains and bookmarks with images of her children on them.
Unable to say no, she spent close to $90 -- and that was in addition to the $90 for the first drive.
All told, Ms. Goldstein expects to have spent around $700 by the time the school year ends on Wednesday.
''I am completely sympathetic to why they have to do this,'' she said. ''But it really is surprising that we are being asked to give so much.''
New York City public school parents disagree on many things: the benefits of charter schools, the merits of gifted and talented programs, and what to do with failing schools. But as another academic year comes to a close, there is one thing many seem to agree on. As a result of several years of budget cuts, increasingly ambitious PTA's and shifting ideas about who should foot the bill for public education, having a child in public school now involves a staggering amount of wallet-opening, with every year seeming to bring more by way of financial demands.
According to dozens of interviews and submissions from more than 400 public school parents to SchoolBook, the education blog of The New York Times, classroom supplies can cost $400. Fifth-grade graduation dues can be $95. Elementary-school yearbooks go for $30. At some Manhattan schools, it is no longer deemed excessive for a class parent to hand a teacher a $1,000 gift card as an end-of-year thank you, even though Education Department regulations prohibit teachers from accepting personal gifts.
And the days of the free class trip are more or less over: a third-grade overnight to a nearby campsite can cost $120, and for internationally minded high school students wishing to join classmates and a teacher in far-flung locales, $3,500 is not unusual.
Tina Manis, the mother of a sixth grader at New Voices School of Academic and Creative Arts in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, who spent $400 on school supplies this year, called the need for so much parental aid ''criminal.''
''This is public school,'' she said of New Voices. ''They didn't even have rulers or tape.''
An Education Department spokeswoman, Deidrea Miller, said that public school parents had paid for many of these items for years, and that assistance was available for those who could not.
But parents said that in recent years, they had noticed an increase in the sheer number of demands and the dollar amounts expected of them.
Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of education and history at New York University, said that by demanding more financial support from parents, the city's PTAs, teachers and administrators were inadvertently altering long-held ideals about public education being free. ''I don't begrudge the people who are doing this,'' he said. ''But what they now have is a kind of suggested tuition.''
To raise money, many schools no longer make do with just one photo drive, but host two or three during the school year. Some, like Public School 41 in Greenwich Village, solicit the services of expensive professional photographers and ask them to do family portraits as a fund-raiser for $150 apiece.
And Naomi Cohn, the mother of a senior at Hunter College High School on the Upper East Side, has spent, along with her daughter, more than $580 on senior-year expenses -- including $112 for the gift seniors gave to the school; $230 for the cap, gown, yearbook and diploma; $140 for a prom ticket; and $100 for a bus to cart her daughter and her friends around on the night of the event. When it came time for Ms. Cohn, a lawyer who was recently unemployed for two years, to respond to the PTA's $1,200 suggested donation, she gave far less, with only a little bit of guilt.
''I might be more sensitive than other people,'' she said. ''But when I received those letters, it made me feel bad.''
Kyle Spencer is a freelancer writer in New York City.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Unafraid of Aging

BYLINE: By KAREN PENNAR

 BODY:
The signal public health achievement of the 20th century was the increase of the human life span. Now, as that achievement helps raise the proportion of the aged around the world, what once seemed an unalloyed blessing is too often regarded as a burden -- a financial burden, a health care burden, even a social burden.
''It's nuts,'' said Dr. Linda P. Fried, an epidemiologist and geriatrician who is dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. ''To assume defeat from what every one of us as individuals wants suggests we're not asking the right questions.''
Findings from the science of aging, Dr. Fried said, should ''reframe our understanding of the benefits and costs of aging.'' 
From her perch at Mailman, a position she has held for four years, Dr. Fried is pushing students, professors and a wider audience to ask the right questions and ponder the right policies for coping with an aging world population.
Dr. Fried's mandate is to lead a school that will give a new generation the tools to deal with global challenges to public health, including environmental degradation, climbing health care costs and the pressure of rapid urbanization. But she believes that research on aging and health changes ''across the life course'' are central to designing solutions to public health problems in the 21st century.
The Mailman School is newly energized, with enrollment in the master's and doctoral programs up 26 percent over the last four years, and grants from the National Institutes of Health up 12 percent in 2011 -- a year in which the overall N.I.H. budget declined slightly. Mailman's curriculum has undergone a major redesign to reflect a new emphasis on health preservation and prevention for every stage of life. Interdisciplinary study will be required of all students. The curriculum, Dr. Fried boasts, is ''absolutely unique'' among schools of public health, and has generated a great deal of interest. Applications for 2012 admission to the master's program were up more than 20 percent from the year before.
It would be too soon to call the dean's job the capstone of Dr. Fried's career. Petite, energetic and seemingly indefatigable, Dr. Fried, 63, travels extensively, serves on numerous nonprofit initiatives on aging, maintains a house in Baltimore and an apartment in New York, and on occasion dons in-line skates for a spin in Central Park.
She gives the impression of having only just begun a campaign to change people's thinking, and frequently answers a question by saying that she'd like to take several hours to do it justice.
Dr. Fried has spearheaded a large body of scientific research on aging. She spent more than two decades at Johns Hopkins University studying data collected on the health of more than 5,000 men and women 65 years and older as part of the Cardiovascular Health Study, and later mined data on 1,000 women over 65 for the university's Women's Health and Aging Study.
She broke new ground in defining frailty in the elderly, developing a simple assessment tool that uses five criteria to test for frailty. She also developed the concept of a ''frailty syndrome,'' and continues to guide younger colleagues in studies exploring how the frail respond to various stressors. In recent years, she has also collaborated with her husband, Dr. Joseph B. Margolick, an immunologist and H.I.V./AIDS expert, in studying frailty in H.I.V. patients. Dr. Margolick works at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and travels most weekends to New York to be with Dr. Fried. The couple has two grown sons.
Dr. Fried's findings have set new standards for the assessment and treatment of geriatric patients. Her work ''has become core knowledge and core teaching in every geriatric program'' in the country, said Dr. Christine K. Cassel, president and chief executive officer of the American Board of Internal Medicine and a leading expert in geriatric medicine.
Embracing Complexity
Dr. Fried, who is a native New Yorker, grew up in Stuyvesant Town, attended Hunter High School and went on to study history at the University of Wisconsin. After spending five years variously as a paralegal, social worker and a physical therapist, she enrolled in Rush Medical College in Chicago, graduating in 1979.
After training and fellowships in public health at Johns Hopkins, she was recruited for a fellowship in the geriatrics program at the university's medical school by Dr. William R. Hazzard, and hasn't looked back. Dr. Hazzard, now an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said that at the time, most physicians were daunted by the challenges that go with the aging process. Dr. Fried, he said, ''embraced the complexity.''
Indeed, the frailty syndrome that Dr. Fried describes is at once simple in its constituent elements and complex in the manner in which those elements interact. In a sort of negative synergism, insufficient nutrition can lead to loss of muscle mass, which can reduce strength and walking speed, which in turn reduces overall activity and energy. All of these factors interact to dysregulate the immunological, endocrinological and other systems in the body. Many of Dr. Fried's papers on frailty have a schematic with arrows showing the negative feedback loops and how they work.
''I'm an intuitive thinker, and I'm very visual,'' Dr. Fried said. ''There's a progression; you sweat over something. You try to get at it from 40 different directions. One day it all comes together. Then there are years of study to demonstrate what we know. You know that quote from Michelangelo -- sculpting is merely the art of revealing figure in stone. In science, every once in a while you chip away at the marble and what is revealed is exactly what you thought you were going to find.''
Despite the widespread acceptance of Dr. Fried's work on frailty, some researchers have developed competing tools: Dr. Kenneth Rockwood, a geriatrician at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, favors using a mathematical index based on as few as 31 and as many as 100 specific deficits, including ''activities of daily living'' like dressing and bathing.
Dr. Fried has welcomed his input. Some years ago she invited Dr. Rockwood to serve on the external advisory board of the Center on Aging and Health at Johns Hopkins. ''How many other people invite the guy on the other side to come to their program?'' Dr. Rockwood said.
That collaborative approach is a hallmark of Dr. Fried's work. Numerous colleagues cite her generosity of spirit, her years of mentoring and her ceaseless advocacy for young doctors and researchers, especially women. ''I don't think I would have been chair of the biostatistics department were it not for her mentoring,'' said Karen Bandeen-Roche, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
One Generation to the Next
Dr. Fried credits her study of the ''visually beautiful'' art of aikido, which emphasizes nonviolence and conflict resolution, with giving her a ''sense of my strength'' and the tools to help her lead ethically and effectively. Drawn to aikido because of her petite size, she practiced it in her 20s and early 30s and received a black belt.
Dr. Fried was also greatly influenced by her mother, Adrienne Fried Block, a ''highly original and analytical thinker.'' Ms. Block was a musicologist and feminist scholar who got a college degree in her 30s, began graduate school in her 40s and completed her Ph.D. in her 50s, then went on to teach and mentor for many years. She died in 2009 at age 88. Dr. Fried's father, George Fried, is 94 -- and frail, she says.
The biggest lesson she learned from her mother, Dr. Fried said, is that ''no human life should be wasted.''
That impulse pushed her to collaborate with the social activist Marc Freedman and others in the early 1990s to plan and enact a nationwide volunteer program called Experience Corps. The program trains volunteers, 55 and older, to tutor children, from kindergarten through third grade, in economically disadvantaged schools for 15 hours a week. The pilot began with volunteers in five cities in 1996; the program has now expanded to 19 cities, including Baltimore.
For Dr. Fried, the potential for Experience Corps to benefit both children and older adults was not only exciting, but also a testing ground for the psychologist Erik Erikson's principle of generativity -- that one generation seeks, as it moves into old age, to help and pass knowledge on to a younger generation.
Dr. Fried built in health-promoting components, by ensuring, for instance, that tutors had to walk a certain distance to the classrooms where they would meet with children. She also designed the program so that tutors would be randomly assigned to schools, and those people's health outcomes could be evaluated against those of tutors who had not yet been assigned.
A 2009 study using functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that participants experienced short-term gains in executive function governed by the prefrontal cortex region, compared with a control group. Other studies are being conducted on the longer-term effects of the program.
Challenges on the Horizon
Dr. Fried is still looking for new ways to engage members of an aging population. She and Dr. Laura L. Carstensen, director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, both of whom serve on the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on an Aging Society, recently wrote an article together for the World Economic Forum, calling for the development of ''infrastructures that tap the real talents and potential contributions that healthy older people can make to societies.'' One idea that Dr. Fried has weighed in on, now being developed at the Stanford Center, is a program that would steer people who are close to retirement to volunteer activities that they can continue to pursue in retirement. Dr. Fried also hopes to invigorate the International Longevity Center, newly housed at the Mailman School. The geriatrician Robert N. Butler, who died in 2010, founded the center and had discussed bringing it to his alma mater. With affiliated centers around the globe, the center will be the flagship for research projects that cut across disciplines at Columbia. Subjects will include disease prevention and housing for the aged, and Dr. Fried expects that professors from engineering, architecture and other schools will play a role in the center's research agenda.
But the basic business of scientific research still draws Dr. Fried. Every two months or so, she hops on an early train from New York's Penn Station to Baltimore's Penn Station, hails a taxi to the Center on Aging and Health and proceeds to a meeting room where about a dozen current and former Johns Hopkins colleagues gather at a large table. After asking to see baby pictures and chatting about recent vacations, Dr. Fried gets down to business: discussing the latest research on how the frail respond to various stressors.
Dr. Fried challenges, prods and teases her younger colleagues. She reminds them of the questions, big and small, that they are trying to address. After Dr. Rita R. Kalyani, an endocrinologist, presented her findings on diminished glucose tolerance among the frail, Dr. Fried called the work ''breathtakingly exciting.''
Even though financing has run out to support the group's efforts, they have vowed to keep meeting, alternating between New York and Baltimore. Dr. Fried's participation is unusual but welcome. ''I'm really amazed that she still has the energy and motivation to keep working on frailty,'' said Ravi Varadhan, a biostatistician and engineer who is a member of the group.
Dr. Fried wouldn't have it any other way. ''We've been working toward this data for 20 years,'' she said. ''To actually get data that took us 8 to 10 years to design and collect and have it actually be exactly what we had hypothesized, well, that's always a nice experience.''

HEADLINE: On the Campaign Trail, Obama and Romney React to the Justices' Decision

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and HELENE COOPER; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's decision on Arizona's strict immigration law gave President Obama another shot at energizing Latino voters, while Mitt Romney defended states' aggressive efforts to fight illegal immigration.
For Mr. Obama, both parts of the court's split decision -- striking down most of the law while letting stand the most controversial provision, which critics have dubbed ''show me your papers'' -- have the potential to encourage get-out-the-vote efforts. He appealed to voters worried about racial profiling, given that the provision of the law the court let stand requires police offers to check for proof of legal residence.
''No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like,'' Mr. Obama said. 
Mr. Romney, who was visiting Arizona for a fund-raising event, used the ruling to appeal to conservatives concerned about border security.
''I believe that each state has the duty -- and the right -- to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities,'' he said in a statement.
Mr. Romney is trying to retain the base of his party that supports cracking down on illegal immigrants while appealing to Hispanics in swing states like Colorado, Florida and Virginia.
After a Republican primary race in which the rhetoric focused on securing the border and what Mr. Romney called ''self-deportation,'' the presumptive Republican nominee attempted to change his tone last week at a national gathering of Latino elected and appointed officials. He pledged to raise quotas on green cards and support a path to legal status for young immigrants who serve in the military.
His outreach efforts came after an order by Mr. Obama to lift deportation threats for a much larger group of illegal immigrants, including those pursuing college.
Some Republican strategists feared that Mr. Romney's gesture was too little, too late.
''I think Romney made a huge mistake by avoiding immigration for so long, and then Obama showed up and raised the stakes,'' said Ana Navarro, an adviser to Senator John McCain on Hispanic issues during his 2008 bid for the presidency. ''Between Obama's immigration policy announcement two weeks ago and this Arizona law decision, the base is much more energized than they were five months ago.''
In a sign that some national Republicans want to see more bridges built on immigration, Crossroads GPS, an independent advocacy group co-founded by Karl Rove, announced its support on Monday for a bipartisan bill in Congress that would let foreign-born students in technology and science stay and work in the country.
But a prominent view in the Romney campaign is that he has no need to further court Hispanics on immigration. A new survey from Gallup on Monday showed that Latino voters ranked immigration only fifth in importance, behind health care and a host of economic concerns.
Mr. Obama's message on Monday seemed directed at Hispanics who have lived in fear of the law, vowing to ''continue to use every federal resource to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans,'' a politically significant aside that could help him at the voting booth in November, Latino leaders said.
''You may not be doing anything wrong, but depending on the color of your skin, you can be pulled over,'' said Anna Tovar, an Arizona state legislator from a district outside Phoenix that is 80 percent Hispanic. ''It's absolutely ridiculous.''
While many Democrats nationwide say they are not sure whether Mr. Obama has a chance to win Arizona, traditionally a Republican stronghold, Ms. Tovar said the Supreme Court decision could help him.
It could also bolster his chances in other Western states with large Hispanic populations like Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.
''One of the consequences of this is it puts the Romney camp into a more Midwestern strategy, looking at states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and trying to win there instead of in places like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico,'' said Dario V. Moreno, a political scientist at Florida International University.
At his fund-raiser in Phoenix, Mr. Romney attacked the president for what he said was a lack of leadership on immigration and repeatedly called the court's decision ''a muddle.''
''I would have preferred to see the Supreme Court give more latitude to the states, not less,'' he said.
The Romney campaign's attitude, though, seemed to be that this too shall pass. One adviser on Hispanic issues said he expected the advantage to Mr. Obama to last a day or so, until an even weightier Supreme Court ruling, on the president's health care law, lands later this week.
The Romney campaign chartered a plane big enough for the traveling press corps so that reporters would be on hand this week for Mr. Romney's reaction to the Supreme Court's ruling in that highly charged case.
But on Monday, when reporters asked repeatedly if Mr. Romney would discuss the immigration ruling, his traveling press secretary, Rick Gorka, said, ''Probably not.''
Asked why Mr. Romney chartered a plane to comment on one court ruling but not another, Mr. Gorka replied, ''We were very clear that this was about Obamacare.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants Are Crucial To Innovation, Study Says

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Arguing against immigration policies that force foreign-born innovators to leave the United States, a new study to be released on Tuesday shows that immigrants played a role in more than three out of four patents at the nation's top research universities.
Conducted by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a nonprofit group co-founded by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, the study notes that nearly all the patents were in science, technology, engineering and math, the so-called STEM fields that are a crucial driver of job growth. 
The report points out that while many of the world's top foreign-born innovators are trained at United States universities, after graduation they face ''daunting or insurmountable immigration hurdles that force them to leave and bring their talents elsewhere.''
The Partnership for a New American Economy released a paper in May saying that other nations were aggressively courting highly skilled citizens who had settled in the United States, urging them to return to their home countries. The partnership supports legislation that would make it easier for foreign-born STEM graduates and entrepreneurs to stay in the United States.
''Now that we know immigrants are behind more than three of every four patents from leading universities, the federal laws that send so many of them back to their home countries look even more patently wrong,'' Mayor Bloomberg said in a statement.
But some worry that the partnership's ideas for immigration reform would undermine similarly skilled American workers while failing to address broader problems with immigration policy.
''No one is asking what is in their best interest, the American worker,'' said Eric Ruark, director of research for the Federal for American Immigration Reform, an advocacy group that is pushing for reduced immigration. ''It's what is best for the employers. What is best for the foreign workers. It's not as if the foreign workers aren't skilled. What's being ignored is we already have a domestic work force that has the same skills.''
The most recent study seeks to quantify the potential costs of immigration policies by reviewing 1,469 patents from the 10 universities and university systems that had obtained the most in 2011. The schools include the University of California system, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Patents, the study maintains, are a gauge for a nation's level of innovation and an important way for the United States to maintain an edge in STEM fields.
In one illustration of the issue, the study notes that nine out of 10 patents at the University of Illinois system in 2011 had at least one foreign-born inventor. Of those, 64 percent had a foreign inventor who was not yet a professor but rather a student, researcher or postdoctoral fellow, a group more likely to face immigration problems.
Some of the patents that were reviewed for the report have become business ventures. Wenyuan Shi, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, earned a patent for an ingredient in a lollipop he developed that works as a dental treatment for children. A native of China, Mr. Shi has created a company to commercialize his inventions.
But current immigration laws can make it difficult for foreign-born students to remain in the United States after graduation. And employers may be wary of hiring them because green cards, allowing for permanent residency status, are limited and the process of obtaining one is cumbersome and expensive.
Under the current system, foreign-born students are allowed to stay in the United States for 12 to 29 months after graduation, provided they find a job or internship in their field.
After that, more permanent visas are difficult to obtain, restricted by factors like country quotas. The study notes that China is entitled to the same number of visas as Iceland.
Dr. Ashlesh Murthy came to the United States from India in 2001 to pursue a master's degree in molecular biology at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Working with his professors there, he developed a vaccine for the sexually transmitted diseasechlamydia, which obtained patents in 2011 and 2012.
Nonetheless, Dr. Murthy had to negotiate a bureaucratic maze to remain in the United States, and at one point was stuck in India for an extra month because American officials in India doubted a previously approved visa.
Noting that university officials petitioned a congressman to intervene on his behalf, Dr. Murthy, said, ''If I was not in a position where they really wanted me, I seriously doubt I would have gotten back.''

HEADLINE: Captain America?

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
The most powerful office on earth?
Tell that to Barack Obama as he waits this week to learn the fate of his landmark health care legislation, achieved through such fierce effort, meant to be a cornerstone of his legacy, and now utterly out of his hands.
Or as he watches the unfolding debt crisis in Europe, which could capsize the American economy between now and Election Day. He has minimal sway over how European leaders handle it. He has everything to lose if the job is botched. 
Each month he braces for new Labor Department jobs numbers, knowing that his actions at this stage can't influence them much before November and knowing, at the same time, that they could save or doom him.
On most fronts and in many ways, his presidency right now is an exercise in hoping and in holding his breath. He attained the most formidable station in the world only to experience a flimsy degree of control.
He's hardly the first president to cross into this cruel limbo, where every hiccup in the domestic economy and spasm abroad is a potential death knell -- or a mercy.
But how many presidents, at least in recent decades, have known something precisely like the Supreme Court's possible erasure of the Affordable Care Act? How many have confronted a Congress this wholly paralyzed by partisan rancor and this steadfastly unyielding?
How many have done so after such an accelerated and charmed political prelude, during which they exerted such control over their own narratives?
While most politicians write their stories once they've laid some claim to the spotlight and are already operating in its skeptical glare, Obama did so years in advance, setting the stage long before he strode onto it. The first edition of ''Dreams From My Father,'' a framing device for the campaigns and speeches to come, was published in 1995. He wasn't even an Illinois state senator yet.
It was an act of careful and considered self-definition, and with the publication of David Maraniss's new biography of Obama earlier this month, we learned just how careful and considered. Obama tailored characters to suit his themes and invented a few details of his family's past, saying that a step-grandfather was killed in combat against Dutch troops in Indonesia when he really, according to Maraniss, died in a fall from a chair as he hung drapes.
One of the most widely cited observations in Maraniss's biography, ''Barack Obama: The Story,'' is that he had a ''determination to avoid life's traps.'' He refused to let circumstances box him in; craved room to maneuver; kept his options open. In college he floated between cultures and political and social groups, studiously avoiding commitment. In the Illinois State Senate, he stood out in part for the frequency with which he voted ''present'' rather than yea or nay. He wouldn't be pinned or pigeonholed.
And now? He's beholden to lawmakers' whims, buffeted by global winds, as much a spectator as an agent of the most important developments around him, a leader of the free world who follows the news like the rest of us. Against Obama's wishes and will, his attorney general is investigated and excoriated by a House panel. His jobs bill languishes. Egypt charts a once unexpected course, electing an Islamist president. The Syrian government pursues a bloody crackdown against its people, ignoring the Obama administration's protests.
At times he looks dazed, and flails. To focus his economic message, he gave an unfocused 54-minute speech on the apparent theory that the more sentences in the mix, the greater the odds of a keeper.
Less than a week later, he stepped up to a lectern at the end of a conference of world leaders in Mexico and rambled some more, whatever particular point he intended to highlight getting lost in a wonky, windy tutorial on the European economy. He stammered. Sputtered. Slowed down to the point where he almost went into oratorical reverse.
Much has been made of his recent executive decision regarding young illegal immigrants as an act of sheer political calculation. It may well be. But I wonder if there wasn't an emotional motivation as well -- if he wasn't trying to find one small patch of ground on which he could have his unchallenged say and way.
Because the hell of his situation is its amalgam of full responsibility for so much and impotence in the face of most of it. I suppose that's long been one definition of the presidency, but it has seldom fit as well as now. In the twilight of his first term, Obama is learning how unscripted history ultimately is. A second term may hinge on the nifty trick, not yet mastered, of projecting more command than he actually wields.

HEADLINE: As Bloomberg's Third Term Winds Down, Unusually Loyal Aides Begin to Eye Exits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
As New York City mayors go, Michael R. Bloomberg has enjoyed an unusual degree of fidelity among the ranks. His inner circle, mostly unchanged after a decade in office, has avoided the churning disputes and abrupt exits that typically plague political administrations.
But even three-term tenures must come to a close, and City Hall is now starting to experience a phenomenon rarely seen in the loyal pastures of Bloombergland: the exodus.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bloomberg has lost his counsel, his chief procurement officer and his leading legislative aide, among other officials. Last Monday, he announced the departure of Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner since the start of the Bloomberg administration. Other key figures are said to be pondering their next, potentially lucrative steps.
For a mayor who prides himself on hiring the best, a migration of City Hall talent can be worrying. Mr. Bloomberg has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to make maximum use of his remaining 18 months in office, squeezing in ambitious programs and cementing his legacy -- a task that would be made more difficult with a missing or distracted staff. 
''The saying goes, at City Hall, you don't want to be the last guy to turn out the lights,'' said George Arzt, who served as press secretary during the final days of Mayor Edward I. Koch's administration. ''You have one eye on your next job and one eye on doing your job at City Hall.''
Micah Lasher, who had served as Mr. Bloomberg's chief lobbyist in Albany, left in April to help run a group that promotes the mayor's education policies. Marla G. Simpson, the chief procurement officer, left in March. In February, Anthony Crowell, the mayor's counselor, decamped to New York Law School, and he will be joined there by Carole Post, the city's chief technology officer, who left in April.
Mr. Bloomberg has survived the loss of top aides in the past. But hiring top-quality replacements, particularly from outside government, may be impossible when the job will barely last a year, according to several former and current city officials.
Randy M. Mastro, a former deputy mayor for operations under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, put it bluntly: ''I don't think you're going to see nationwide searches,'' he said.
Instead, City Hall is now likely to turn to in-house talent to fill openings.
''Because you're promoting from within, there's a tendency for a lame-duck administration to become stale,'' Mr. Arzt said. ''There's no new thinking. It's a continuation of the existing programs.''
Already, the administration has faced some criticism for replacing Mr. Benepe, the parks chief, with Veronica M. White, a longtime public servant who has overseen antipoverty initiatives for the mayor, but has little experience running parks.
Henry Stern, an outspoken former parks commissioner, issued a skeptical assessment of the mayor's choice, comparing Ms. White's lack of relevant expertise to that of Cathleen P. Black, Mr. Bloomberg's short-lived pick to run the city school system. But Ms. White has many champions, including another former parks commissioner, Gordon Davis, who say she is well-prepared for her new role.
In public, Mr. Bloomberg has sounded an unruffled note about the departures.
''There's turnover all the time,'' the mayor said at the news conference where he announced Mr. Benepe's exit. ''Look, the bottom line is if you're going to have great people, then you should expect somebody to come along and try to take them away. And in fact, if they don't, it's sort of an insult.''
''We have a plan for everybody, what happens if they decide to go on, or if, unfortunately, they have an accident or something,'' Mr. Bloomberg added. ''That's exactly what good management is all about.''
Mr. Benepe, who described his decision to leave as ''wrenching,'' said he spoke with Mr. Bloomberg earlier this year after he was offered his new job, a position focusing on urban park development at a national conservation group. ''There was an understanding that this position was attractive,'' he said. ''Timing-wise, I would have loved to have stayed till next December, but this is when the job was open.''
''You'd like to fantasize you can stay in a particular job like this forever, but that's not the reality,'' Mr. Benepe added.
There is one such fantasy, however, that could encourage some staff members to hold out until the end. While previous mayors could offer a letter of recommendation at best, Mr. Bloomberg controls a Fortune 500 corporation and a multibillion-dollar charity, the Bloomberg Family Foundation, both of which could be the source of long-term, high-paying employment for some valued aides.
''He certainly will be more successful than any typical end-of-termer in keeping people,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. ''Everybody knows that with Bloomberg, there's life after the mayoralty.''
Many believe that only a few slots will ultimately be available at the foundation, and Patricia E. Harris, the first deputy mayor and chief executive of the charity, is expected to play gatekeeper. Some commissioners are gauging the strength of their relationship with Ms. Harris as a guide to whether they could be considered for a position.
''This is going to be like the list for Noah's Ark,'' said one person who deals frequently with City Hall and was granted anonymity to avoid straining any relationships. ''The fact is, there are only two giraffes and only two elephants. There are a lot of giraffes and elephants who are going to be disappointed.''
There are some key members of Mr. Bloomberg's inner circle who do not need to worry about lining up another job, because of their own personal wealth, or because they are of retirement age.
Among those expected to stay are Amanda M. Burden, the influential director of the New York City Planning Department, and Robert Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development, who are leading several of Mr. Bloomberg's more significant third-term initiatives, including the redevelopment of office buildings around Grand Central Terminal.
Other powerful staff members, including Thomas A. Farley, the health commissioner; Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner; and Salvatore J. Cassano, the head of the Fire Department, are also likely to remain, aides said.
Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner, who is overseeing the rollout of the city's ambitious bicycle-sharing program, is expected to stay, barring an invitation to take a powerful job in Washington, colleagues said.
Many commissioners are said to relish their work under Mr. Bloomberg, who allows his cabinet members an unusual degree of autonomy. Mr. Benepe described his own job as ''enchanting.''
''You never want to leave, you want to stay on forever,'' he said. ''It's kind of like Peter Pan. It's either leaving the nursery, or leaving Never-Never Land. Sometimes you have to grow up and realize you can't always have an office in Central Park.''

HEADLINE: Hatch Is Tested in Utah, but Tea Party Anger Cools

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is where the Tea Party slew one of its first giants, toppling a three-term Republican senator in a 2010 electoral coup that scrambled party politics and heralded a litany of fierce contests between establishment Republicans and conservative upstarts.
On Tuesday, the state will again be a battleground in a primary between a weathered incumbent, the six-term Senator Orrin G. Hatch, and a conservative firebrand seeking to harness public anger at Washington's wasteful ways. But this time, Mr. Hatch may halt the Tea Party wave that has cut down other Republican incumbents in primary races across the country. 
Mr. Hatch has been running an aggressive and well-financed campaign to fend off his first primary challenge since he was elected in 1976. But his saving grace, political analysts said, may be that Utah voters don't seem as angry as they were when they ousted Senator Robert F. Bennett in a 2010 party convention.
''There isn't the same anti-incumbent, anti-establishment fervor that existed in 2010,'' said LaVarr Webb, a Republican political consultant. ''The economy has changed, and people are feeling better.''
Even Mr. Bennett agreed. ''The atmosphere has changed enormously,'' he said. ''There's as strong a pro-incumbent wave in Utah as there was an anti-incumbent wave two years ago. It's a backlash.''
Utah's jobless rate is 5.8 percent, sharply lower than the national rate of 8.2 percent. It has a humming export economy, and major employers like Goldman Sachs and Boeing have been expanding. And much of the Republican desire for change is now aimed at the White House, not the Senate race.
Voters in Salt Lake City said they were leery of Mr. Hatch's bid for a seventh term, but they also did not want to cast away another Utah politician with seniority and connections in Washington, one who is likely to lead the powerful Finance Committee should Republicans take control of the Senate.
''At first, it was like: 'Orrin, don't your grandkids like you? You're old, it's time to retire,' '' said Paul Toller, a financial services worker finishing lunch in Salt Lake City. ''But he's our senior statesman, and seniority matters.''
Greg Wilde, a friend eating lunch at the same table, piped up, saying the country needed a major change to shore up its finances, and he questioned why Mr. Hatch was suddenly up for the task after so many years in Washington.
''Are the good old boys going to resolve our fiscal policy?'' he asked.
Recent polls have given Mr. Hatch a double-digit lead over Daniel R. Liljenquist, the former state senator and Tea Party favorite who is his opponent. Mr. Hatch has a commanding cash advantage, raising some $10 million this election cycle compared with Mr. Liljenquist's $800,000. That advantage has allowed Mr. Hatch to spend millions on grass-roots organizing and advertisements trumpeting his political power and conservative credentials.
Mr. Hatch has collected endorsements from Sarah Palin, conservative talk show hosts and a few Tea Party leaders. And as the presidential election intensifies, he is playing up his connection to the presumptive Republican nominee with Utah roots.
Mitt Romney has recorded video endorsements for Mr. Hatch, and the two men made a brief appearance together this month at an airport in Salt Lake City. On Mr. Hatch's campaign Web site, the first image that visitors see is not Mr. Hatch, but a portrait of Mr. Romney accompanied by a quotation saying he will need Mr. Hatch ''to help me restore America as a land of opportunity and prosperity.''
Mr. Romney is so widely popular and recognizable here that even Mr. Liljenquist has tried to hitch a ride on his coattails, emphasizing his career with Bain Consulting, a branch of the private equity firm where Mr. Romney made his fortune.
Mr. Romney's endorsement has paradoxically allowed a 36-year incumbent to run as a change candidate. Should Mr. Romney beat President Obama, Mr. Hatch said, he will play a major part in cutting spending to curb the national debt.
But Mr. Liljenquist, whose candidacy helped to force Mr. Hatch into Tuesday's primary, scoffs at those promises.
Sitting in the 11th-floor conference room of his downtown campaign office, he popped M&M's and reeled off Mr. Hatch's votes on children's health benefits, prescription drug coverage and raising the debt ceiling that he said demonstrated fiscal irresponsibility.
He said that Mr. Hatch's experience and seniority were weaknesses that underscored his opponent's entrenchment in an atrophied political system.
''You can't expect the politicians who got you into this mess of debt and spending to get you out,'' Mr. Liljenquist said. ''You need fresh ideas. I don't think he will do a thing differently.''

HEADLINE: Another Chance for Egypt

 BODY:
Now that Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood has been declared its first freely elected president, Egypt has another chance to steer onto a more democratic course. It will require a much greater willingness to work for the common good than the country's polarized political groups have shown so far. 
The ruling generals nearly forced the once-promising democratic transition off the rails. After an unofficial count showed Mr. Morsi winning this month's election, the official result was delayed for more than a week. This raised fears that the military would instead hand the presidency to its preferred candidate, Ahmed Shafik, Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister. We don't know why the generals did the right thing this time. But allowing Mr. Morsi to take the presidency won't by itself deliver the real change that Egyptians have rallied and died for.
In recent weeks, the generals made a power grab: martial law was reimposed, an interim constitution was issued that limited the president's powers, the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated Parliament was dissolved and the generals took on the legislative role. Now Mr. Morsi will have to press hard for a better and more enduring balance of power. Martial law and new limits on presidential powers should be canceled. One-third of the Parliament seats -- the number the court said were legally questionable -- should be re-contested instead of dissolving the entire legislative body. The military council needs to back away from politics.
Mr. Morsi, a religious conservative, will assume office dogged by serious questions about his commitment to desperately needed reforms. But his victory speech in which he pledged to be ''a president for all Egyptians'' was an encouraging olive branch to the military, liberals and minority groups. He can start by naming a government in which all segments are represented.
Egyptians are responsible for their own future but will need help from the United States and others to revive their economy and achieve a democratic transition. The Obama administration is right to say that Egypt's new government will be judged on its actions.

HEADLINE: Sandberg, Prominent Facebook Officer, Is Elevated to Its Board

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Facebook said on Monday that its chief operating officer, Sheryl K. Sandberg, had joined the social network's board, becoming the first woman to serve as a director for the company. 
The elevation of Ms. Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, is an acknowledgment of the crucial role she plays at the company. Lured away from Google, she became one of Facebook's most public figures, making regular appearances at events like the World Economic Forum and the annual Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
Such is Ms. Sandberg's stature that her profile is second only to that of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive. And she has served as one of the company's links to the corporate world, playing a large role in taking Facebook public and working with business partners.
''Facebook is working every day to make the world more open and connected,'' Ms. Sandberg said in a statement. ''It's a mission that I'm deeply passionate about, and I feel fortunate to be part of a company that is having such a profound impact in the world.''
She has long been regarded as a star in the corporate firmament. At Google, she was a high-ranking executive with prominent roles in sales and operations. And before that, she served as the chief of staff for Lawrence H. Summers at the Treasury Department.
At Facebook, Ms. Sandberg is largely regarded as an efficient operating executive who frees up Mr. Zuckerberg to work on important projects and chart the long-term direction of the company he founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004.
Her responsibilities include overseeing sales and marketing, business development and corporate policy.
''Sheryl has been my partner in running Facebook and has been central to our growth and success over the years,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement. ''Her understanding of our mission and long-term opportunity, and her experience both at Facebook and on public company boards makes her a natural fit for our board.''
Ms. Sandberg is joining a relatively small board for a company whose market value as of Monday stood at $87.8 billion. Others on the Facebook board include the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen, James W. Breyer and Peter A. Thiel; Erskine B. Bowles, the former Clinton administration official; Donald E. Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Company; and Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix.
She already serves on the board of the Walt Disney Company.

HEADLINE: City Hall Budget Deal, for Now, Includes Few Layoffs and No Tax Increases

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Despite uncertainty over hundreds of millions of dollars in anticipated revenue, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council agreed Monday on a $68.5 billion budget for the coming fiscal year that would avoid tax increases, firehouse closings and widespread layoffs.
New York City budget officials were also able to avoid cutting child-care and after-school programs, which had been the subject of intense public pressure. 
The budget was buoyed by a late infusion of $150 million from a settlement between ING Bank and the Manhattan district attorney's office, stemming from a joint federal and state investigation into compliance with United States sanctions against Iran, Cuba and other countries.
The city was also able to save $240 million in debt costs through low interest rates, while collecting $70 million more than anticipated in permits, licenses and fees.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 will be about $500 million more than the current one. That increase, the city said, resulted primarily from a $2 billion rise in costs that the city said it could not control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service.
Then again, compared with those of previous years, this year's budget agreement warrants an asterisk or two.
The budget is predicated on collecting $635 million in revenue in the first year, and an additional $825 million in the next two years, from the expected sale of 2,000 new yellow taxi medallions as part of a plan to expand street hail service throughout the five boroughs. But a judge's ruling this month temporarily blocked the taxi plan, on a jurisdictional question about whether such policy should be set by the City Council or the State Legislature.
Budget analysts are also cautioning that the city's revenue projections could be subject to high volatility in coming months. In May, the city's Independent Budget Office noted that ''New York City is particularly vulnerable to crises that batter the banking sector or international tourism,'' like any upheaval in the Euro zone crisis, the slowdown of the Chinese economy or election-year domestic squabbles over taxes and spending.
As a result, many budget analysts said they would not be surprised if the mayor had to propose sizable midyear budget adjustments in the fall.
Still, during a news conference in the Governor's Room in City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, flanked by more than half of the Council's 51 members standing on risers, could barely hide their enthusiasm, and relief.
''We're able to achieve these goals without asking taxpayers to stretch'' their dollars, Mr. Bloomberg said.
He also praised Ms. Quinn, a likely candidate for mayor next year, who he said ''has once again demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining the city's finances on a sound footing.''
Ms. Quinn returned the favor by thanking Mr. Bloomberg for possessing ''visionary fiscal leadership.'' But she also underscored the determination among council members that ''children are, without doubt, our No. 1 priority.''
When Mr. Bloomberg first proposed his budget in February, the spending plan struck many city officials and economists as being fairly routine, with no layoffs of teachers, police officers or firefighters.
Over the next few months, the city calculated that tax revenue had increased more sluggishly than had been anticipated, while costs for social programs, including ones for the homeless, had risen more rapidly. But the additional shortfall would be filled, Mr. Bloomberg said, by a one-time-only payment of $466 million from Science Applications International Corporation, to settle federal and city investigations into alleged fraud in the CityTime automated payroll system.
Then came the judge's order in the taxi lawsuit. And while the city remains confident that it will ultimately prevail in court, some budget watchdogs have questioned whether a mayor so determined to avoid raising taxes acted prudently by relying so heavily on one-time revenue payments that might not occur.
Full details are expected to be released in the next few days, when the City Council is scheduled to vote on the budget.
But some council members expressed some misgivings. Melissa Mark-Viverito of Manhattan and Letitia James of Brooklyn, two liberal council members, both said that while they were grateful that child-care services would continue, they were concerned that the contracting process would favor large providers at the expense of neighborhood ones.
And Councilman Daniel J. Halloran III, a Republican from Queens, warned that the budget had ''achieved short-term victories at the expense of the long term.'' He added: ''We're presuming that the economy will recover this year. But what if it doesn't? We need a more forward-thinking budget process that lives within our present means and doesn't assume some future pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:

HEADLINE: A New Ride-Sharing Service Turns Private Cars Into Taxis

BYLINE: JOSHUA BRUSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: SideCar allows people to use their private cars as taxis, while giving riders a cheaper alternative to other car-for-hire services. The question of its legality and whether it will need to be regulated looms over the business. Nevertheless, the company has attracted financing. It introduced its service in San Francisco on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
 Technology start-ups continue to chip away at the idea that everyone should own a car or two. 
The latest twist on car sharing comes from a company called SideCar, which introduced its service in San Francisco on Tuesday. The service allows people seeking a ride to use a smartphone app to find someone willing to give them one in their own car. When it works well, it takes about the same amount of time it takes to catch a cab. The company has been in a private testing period for several months and claims to have hundreds of drivers and thousands of riders already using the service. It has given 10,000 rides in total. The company has attracted investment from several venture capital firms and angel investors, as well as Mark Pincus, the co-founder of Zynga. 
There have been car-sharing services available for some time, from the now-ubiquitous Zipcar to peer-to-peer services like Relayrides and Getaround. The idea of using a smartphone app to catch rides with limousine drivers between assignments also caught on last year with a company called Uber, which also started in San Francisco.
Of course, Uber is essentially just an expensive black car service with a novel way to call for a ride. The idea of ride sharing, which would leverage smartphones to save people money while offering a taxi-like service, is potentially more disruptive because it cuts out professional drivers altogether. It has been a tough nut to crack, however. Several attempts to allow ride sharing in New York City taxis, for instance, have fallen flat. 
SideCar's pricing is set up to be rider-friendly. The app tells riders how much others have paid for similar rides, but leaves it to them to decide how much to pay. The main deterrent to being a cheapskate is that doing so will hurt your standing within the community. Riders and drivers rate one another at the end of each trip, so freeloaders may soon find it hard to find chauffeurs for future rides.
Matt Johanek says he has been giving between five and 20 rides a week since April. Every single rider has paid at least the suggested fare, he said. Mr. Johanek occasionally sets aside time to shuttle strangers around town, and ends up earning enough to pay for his gas and insurance. There have been nonfinancial benefits, as well.
"I'll admit I've gotten a couple of dates out of it," he said.
Of course, not everyone looking to get across town is interested in sparking a romance, and attempting to avoid uncomfortable social situations is a fact of life for collaborative consumption companies like Airbnb, TaskRabbit and others. SideCar says it checks potential drivers' criminal backgrounds, driving records and insurance.
Tech services that connect people in the physical world are inherently vulnerable to losing the trust of their users because of abuses by a few users. But even without anything bad happening, some people are simply more comfortable with some kinds of interactions than others.
Cynthia Yeung, who has been using SideCar regularly, said she trusted its internal rating service, and had never balked at taking a ride from a stranger. At the same time, she cannot bring herself to rent a room through Airbnb.
"Sitting in someone's car is a little different from sleeping in someone's bed," she said.
Another question is whether insurance companies will balk if their customers begin using a service like SideCar to turn their private automobile into a business. Sunil Paul, SideCar's chief executive, helped pass share-friendly legislation in California. (He has also been flirting with various car-sharing business ventures since the 1990s). He said that the current standard for what people can do with their private vehicles will easily cover the type of mini-businesses that people might run through SideCar.
At the same time, Mr. Paul does anticipate potential legal complications that could come with success. 
"Long term we are concerned, as are all of these share economy companies, that incumbents will use regulation to hold back innovation," he said.

HEADLINE: Money Market Industry's Resistance May Hurt Companies

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The money market fund industry is pushing back against proposed regulations that could make the funds more stable for issuers and investors, but without reform, corporate America could end up suffering. 

 BODY:
Money market funds are what investors use to earn a few tenths of a percentage point of interest.
Yet in such a quiet, if not boring, corner of the financial products universe, a ferocious battle is being fought between the industry and regulators over how these funds operate. The twist is that the money market fund industry's resistance may hurt corporate America.
Money market funds hold about $2.6 trillion, a sizable sum but down sharply from the days before the financial crisis, when these funds held about $4.3 trillion. The decline came after the Reserve Primary Fund, the nation's oldest and largest money market fund with $64 billion, "broke the buck" - in which the value of its shares fell below $1 - in 2008 in the wake of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. The fund had been left holding $785 million of Lehman's debt.
The events of that week are the impetus behind current efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to overhaul the market and put controls in place. The commission took a first step, supported by the money market fund industry, in 2010, when the S.E.C. adopted rules for greater transparency and required money market funds to invest in more liquid assets with shorter maturities and higher quality.
But the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, does not think this is enough. In testimony before the Senatelast week, she said that the funds should be fundamentally transformed to prevent future runs.
The S.E.C. is considering at least two proposals. The first would be to price funds by their net asset value and not a dollar per share. Investors would always get back the value of the fund, giving them an incentive not to withdraw their funds at the first hint of a loss. The second idea is to have a capital buffer that can absorb a small loss.
These proposals are intended to address a fundamental flaw in money market funds. These funds are meant to mimic bank accounts, with investors buying shares set at a fixed $1 value. The intent is for the shares to be held constant at that value and redeemable at any time. In order to keep a stable value, the funds can never lose money.
But in the case of the Reserve Primary Fund, its loss on Lehman debt meant that its assets were suddenly worth less than a dollar. Investors panicked and withdrew $300 billion from money market funds in a week. The Treasury Department stepped in to provide a guarantee of these funds up to $50 billion and provide short-term lending under which money market funds, including nine of the 10 largest, borrowed about $150 billion in the 10 days after the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck.
The Federal Reserve acted forcefully because money market funds are at the heart of corporate finance, pumping money into corporate America. The funds invest in commercial paper issued for working capital by American corporations, financing vehicles for banks and municipal debt.
Ms. Schapiro testified that the S.E.C. had found more than 300 instances when money market fund advisers were required to shore up their funds. She contends that the agency's proposals are needed to prevent the next run.
The industry has pushed back. The Investment Company Institute, an industry trade association, argued at the same Senate hearingthat pricing funds in units other than a dollar would scare off customers and destroy the industry. The United States Chamber of Commerce is also opposed to the change and submitted to the Senatea research paper by James J. Angel of Georgetown University. The paper, which was financed by the industry, contends that pricing in net asset values would require complex accounting and tax record-keeping by investors, forcing them to flee.
But the core issue is whether another run is likely. Any kind of loss by a fund can set off a run. Even if it is rare, a run is likely to happen at the worst possible time, like during a financial crisis. While the probability of such a disaster may be small, the harm would be enormous.
Against this possible danger must be weighed the issue of whether investors will no longer use these funds. Do they really care whether money market funds are priced at a dollar or have to pay for capital buffers? If so, financing will disappear for corporate America payrolls and government, as well as for financial institutions, now the biggest issuer of debt to money market funds.
But the industry argument that customers care deeply whether these shares are priced at a dollar or at their net asset value, appears to be made of fear.
The industry also ignores possible compromises. Jeffrey N. Gordon of Columbia Law School said in a submission to the Senate that it would be possible to have two classes of shares, one fixed at a dollar and the other floating, which would allow investors to choose.
The industry's logic appears to work only if investors don't understand the product and want dollar pricing because it implies a guarantee that isn't there. These days, about two-thirds of money market users are sophisticated finance investors who should easily comprehend the difference, and can adjust their investing accordingly.
The industry also ignores the costs that an absence of reform will impose on corporate America. The industry argues that new regulation is unnecessary because previous overhauls were sufficient and because the funds have been prudent, investing only in supersafe and ultra-liquid investments.
Yet as a result of these limitations, corporate America can no longer get the wide array of financing it previously received from money market funds. According to David S. Scharfstein of Harvard Business School, who also testified last week, of the 50 largest issuers of debt to money market funds today, only two are nonfinancial firms; the rest are banks and other financial companies, many of them foreign.
One reason is that many of these corporate entities are now shut out of the market and funds are not willing to purchase their paper. Another is that corporate America is less likely to rely on money market financing these days because of its inherent instability.
This is the real issue with money market reform: Will the S.E.C. proposals help financing by making money market funds more stable for issuers and investors?
The S.E.C. will be considering the two proposals in the next month or two, according to reports, and they are likely to prompt a more public confrontation. Three S.E.C. commissioners have already issued a statement heralding caution, and more than one senator called this issue a nonproblem last week, noting that only two funds have ever broken the buck.
But when you look at the facts, it may very well be that the industry is the one crying wolf. Leaving things as they are may only keep people skittish about money market funds, hurting the funds and the companies that rely on them for financing. Perhaps the industry may want to more fully consider the benefits of Ms. Schapiro's reform.
An earlier version of this column misidentified the government agency that pledged $50 billion to backstop money market mutual funds in 2008. It was the Treasury Department, not the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Rounding Up Iceland's Horses

BYLINE: MATT MCCANN


HIGHLIGHT: Lindsay Blatt and Paul Taggart, of Lantern Fish Media, joined forces to shoot "Herd in Iceland," a documentary about Iceland's unique horse breed and its independent people. 

 BODY:
Lindsay Blatt and Paul Taggart did not know much about Iceland beyond the headlines in the news - its recent bankruptcy, the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull, the volcano that ruined many travel plans (and confused many more with its pronunciation), and its most famous native, Bjork.
But their interests were piqued after they learned about a distinct variety of horse native to the country.
The Icelandic horse has been purebred for more than a millennium, having been on the island for almost as long as the natives who brought them there. The animals are small and sturdy, resembling a pony more than the horses one would expect a cavalry to straddle. During the summer, they roam freely, completely untended by humans, until they are rounded up in a big celebration at the end of the season.
Although the horses are integral to Icelandic culture, Ms. Blatt discovered that the roundup had received little attention outside of the island.
Their documentary project "Herd in Iceland," has roots in Ms. Blatt's childhood in Arizona - a place that also has lots of wide open space (the similarities between Iceland and Arizona begin and end there).
"My whole youth, I was so devoted to the kind of horses that I rode, not knowing anything about Icelandic horses," Ms. Blatt said. "If I ever got a horse again, it would have to be an Icelandic horse."
Ms. Blatt and Mr. Taggart launch a Kickstarter project on Tuesday to fund the completion of the film which not only features the Icelandic horse, but also the people who care for the horses, many of whom buck the convention of cowboy.
"You'll see a pretty big guy, a big Viking man riding this tiny little horse," said Ms. Blatt, who is also a freelance photo editor at The New York Times. She added that they are often employed in occupations that are jeopardized by a precarious global economy.
"There's this pull to something authentic, something natural, something you can put your hands on," Mr. Taggart said. "This was lost a generation or two ago. And they want to get it back. They're trying to figure out a way: 'Hey, can we actually make a living off these horses, so I don't have to go work at the bank or be an international sales rep?' They're trying to get back and say, it's about family, it's about living off the land and it's about the animals."

HEADLINE: Al Mancini, Las Vegas Restaurant Critic, Is Answering Questions

BYLINE: JULIA MOSKIN


HIGHLIGHT: How does Las Vegas's 40 million annual visitors decide where to spend their money? Restaurant critic Al Mancini is here to help. Ask him anything about the mix of food, entertainment, and money that is the Las Vegas restaurant scene. 

 BODY:
Al Mancini is a conspicuous character in a city full of them -- Las Vegas, where he is a restaurant critic and journalist. From graduating from Brooklyn Law School, to tending bar at CBGB's Pizza in the East Village, to writing reviews of strip clubs, he has followed an unorthodox path to the luxurious dining rooms he now frequents. 
Las Vegas has recovered strongly from the recession, and is host to ever more of the world's most prestigious chefs -- Guy Savoy, Pierre Gagnaire, Jose Andres -- and expensive meals. At the same time, over-the-top theme restaurants like Lynyrd Skynyrd's BBQ and Oscar's Beef Booze Broads compete for attention.

HEADLINE: Driving the 2013 Ford Focus ST

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Wheels spends a power hour in Manhattan with Ford's 252-horsepower hatchback, a formidable addition to the sport-compact segment. 

 BODY:
Holdouts certainly remain, but the lament that presumes well-engineered, sporty compact cars bypass the American driver is playing more softly of late.
Scion and Subaru dealerships can't keep the FR-S and BRZ sports coupes in stock. Hyundai is readying its 200-horsepower Veloster Turbo to begin sales this summer. And a decade after producing the Focus SVT hatchback, its beloved if belated overture to the tuner culture that flourished in the '90s, Ford has started producing the 252-horsepower, front-drive 2013 Focus ST, which is scheduled to leave the Ford plant in Wayne, Mich., and arrive in dealerships late this summer.
For a vocal group of Focus enthusiasts in the United States who watched impotently as Ford Europe devised one wicked Focus hatchback after another while the American division killed the SVT model and sapped the Focus of its plucky character, the ST represents something like validation.
So it was, as an ST painted Tangerine Scream (a slightly orange shade of yolk yellow, a $495 option) pulled into the garage at Manhattan Ford, I blinked a few times -- first in disbelief, then to preserve what remained of my retinas. A product representative said I had exactly one hour with the car before its next dance partner would arrive.
Equipped with the top-line ST3 package, which adds nearly $4,500 to the $24,495 base price of the ST, this model included full-leather Recaro front seats that perfectly fit my frame, which occupies what the writer Martin Amis calls "that much-disputed territory between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-7." Larger drivers may find the pan short and the back narrow.
Any memory of the 2-liter engine in the basic Focus, which emits a workmanlike churn under light acceleration, is displaced by the slightest throttle pressure in the ST. The note from the 2-liter EcoBoost unit is low and burbling, and altogether more rich than what is typically expected from such a small power plant. Credit the so-called Active Sound Symposer, essentially a sound tube that modulates the quantity of low-frequency rumblings that enter the cabin, depending on vehicle speed.
On a mercifully uncongested West Side Highway, I became acquainted with the ST's intuitive 6-speed manual transmission. Produced by Getrag, the manual is the only transmission available on the ST, and it inspired nothing but confidence and mischief. Dropping out of 6th gear at 60 miles per hour, I was bid passage into 3rd without any notable resistance.
Ford engineers deserve applause for their sensible calibration of the drivetrain. There is a tendency among automakers to browbeat drivers into upshifting prematurely -- be it passively through a light-up reminder on the instrument cluster or through tall gearing that smothers usable torque -- to discourage revving high and burning gas in the middle gears. (Ford has not disclosed fuel-economy estimates for the ST.) But as I left the West Side and cut across Interstate 95 to the F.D.R. Drive, I was pleased to note that at 50 m.p.h. in 4th gear, the tachometer was holding steady at a modest 2,100 r.p.m. And even when traveling in 6th gear at 50 m.p.h., torque was nonetheless available at the tap of a foot, without lag, to squirt the ST into a pocket.
Traffic conditions ruled out any opportunities to test the efficacy of the ST's torque-vectoring system, which is intended to enhance lateral stability in aggressive cornering. I also failed to venture into the MyFord Touch telematics system, which received a software update this year after it experienced a less-than-glowing consumer response.
Focus enthusiasts in the United States who pined after forbidden European fruit should know that their expectations may be exceeded by the ST. The uncommitted hot-hatch customer that cares not for the car's tuner-culture exterior cues -- the ground effects, the retina-searing optional paint -- would do well to remember the Volkswagen GTI, a car that sacrifices more than a step to the ST but remains compelling three years after its last refresh cycle. Then again, Hyundai has made progress with its turbocharger technology, and the Veloster Turbo may be worth a cross-shop. The ST's natural foil is the 263-horsepower, front-drive Mazdaspeed3, but that car rides on a chassis engineered for the previous-generation Focus, and it is unhinged where the ST is collected.
Requiring no deliberation is this: It is a good time in America to consider a well-engineered, sporty compact car.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's Contemporary Sale Makes $108 Million

BYLINE: CAROL VOGEL


HIGHLIGHT: In a little over two hours on Tuesday night, Sotheby's managed to sell $108 million worth of contemporary art, another testament to the breadth and depth of interest in works by well-known names like Basquiat, Bacon, Twombly and Warhol. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a little over two hours on Tuesday night, Sotheby's managed to sell $108 million worth of contemporary art, another testament to the breadth and depth of interest in works by well-known names like Basquiat, Bacon, Twombly and Warhol. The auction house had packed the sale with 79 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, mostly by artists who have brought top prices in recent seasons. But while the salesroom was filled with an international crowd of dealers and collectors, the evening could best be described as more solid than exciting. 
Of the 79 lots on offer in a sale that had been estimated to bring between $89.6 million to $128.5 million, only 10 failed to sell. 
The evening's priciest work was Basquiat's "Warrior,'' a 1982 canvas of an angry-looking man holding a sword. Two telephone bidders vied for the painting, which brought $8.7 million, against an estimate of $8 million to $11.3 million. (Final prices include the buyer's commission to Sotheby's: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
The Basquiat was one of six works in the auction that were guaranteed to sell thanks to what Sotheby's calls an irrevocable bid, meaning a contractual agreement with a buyer to purchase a work for an undisclosed sum. (If someone else is willing to pay more, the guarantor instead gets a percentage of the difference between what he was willing to pay and the higher price.) 
While $8.7 million might not have been as much as some would have predicted for "Warrior," it was more impressive than the painting's past performances at Sotheby's. In 2005 it fetched $1.8 million there; in 2007, $5.6 million. 
The same sort of inflation could be seen with Bacon's "Study for a Self-Portrait,'' a meditative likeness of the artist from 1980 that had belonged to Stanley J. Seeger, a well-known and reclusive American collector who lived in London and died last year. Sotheby's had sold a portion of Seeger's collection in New York in 2001, when this painting brought $1.76 million. On Tuesday night the painting - also with an irrevocable bid and estimated at $8 million to $11.3 million - brought $7 million from another telephone bidder. (On Wednesday night Christie's is auctioning a full-length Bacon self-portrait that failed to sell in 2008 but is now expected to go for upwards of $30 million.)
One of the evening's biggest surprises occurred when the British artist Glenn Brown's dramatic landscape "The Tragic Conversion of Salvador Dali (After John Martin)" from 1998 sold for $8 million, a record for the artist at auction and far above Sotheby's high estimate of $4.5 million. The telephone bidder who bought it beat out five other contenders. A science-fiction take on a Victorian landscape, the painting was said to have been sold by Ivor Braka, the London dealer. 
Sotheby's was clearly hoping to capitalize on Gerhard Richter's rising popularity and prices. "Jerusalem,'' a photo realist painting from 1995 depicting a view of Jerusalem's old city, was estimated to bring $4.8 million to $8 million; it sold for $6.6 million. 
Given that Damien Hirst is the subject of a retrospective on view at the Tate Modern here, it was not surprising to see several examples of his work from different periods and in various styles. The results were mixed. "My Way'' from 1990-1991, one of the artist's glass-fronted cabinets filled with medicine bottles and jars with cautionary labels, had been expected to fetch $1.95 million to $2.9 million, but failed to draw a single bid. On the other hand, three takers were interested in one of the artist's spin paintings from 1998, which ended up bringing $563,080, just below its high estimate of $570,000. It was a high price considering that in 2002, when the painting was last up for sale, at Christie's, it made $141,500.
Many dealers said they saw Tuesday evening's sale as a kind of warm-up for Christie's post-war and contemporary art auction on Wednesday night, when more high-priced works will be on offer. Christie's officials has been touting the evening as the most ambitious auction in this category ever held in London, featuring expensive works by Bacon, Richter and Yves Klein.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Even Republicans Can Support

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Heading off scheduled cuts in military spending could appeal to both parties, and broadly defining such spending could make it a useful source of economic growth, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last Thursday, the National Association of Manufacturers published a report claiming that the Department of Defense budget sequestration scheduled for January will cost one million jobs in the private economy by 2014. The national unemployment rate, it said, will rise by 0.7 percent and growth of the gross domestic product will fall by 1 percent. A study released March 7 by the Aerospace Industries Association came to similar conclusions.
Without further Congressional action by the end of this year, the Budget Control Act of 2011 directs that federal spending will be cut automatically by $1.2 trillion between 2013 and 2021, with cuts divided equally between military and domestic programs.
Republicans have been warning about the loss of jobs from cuts in military spending for some time. At a hearing last October, the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Howard P. McKeon, a California Republican, said, "Defense cuts are certainly a path to job loss." The committee's blog often highlights the loss of jobs from military spending cuts.
According to a poll released May 2012 by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, most Americans agree that cuts in military spending cost jobs, including three-fifths of Republicans. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has also said that programmed cuts in military spending would raise the unemployment rate by 1 percent.
This raises interesting questions. If a cut in military spending costs jobs, then doesn't this mean that cuts in domestic spending also cost jobs? And if cuts in government spending reduce employment, then doesn't it follow that increases in spending will create jobs?

Historically, economists have believed that government consumption and investment spending has the same impact on jobs and growth whether it's for military or domestic purposes. As Paul Samuelson, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, put it in his best-selling economics text: "There is nothing special about G spending on jet bomber and intercontinental missiles that leads to a larger multiplier support of the economy than would other kinds of G expenditure."
In the standard definition of G.D.P., all government consumption and investment spending has the same effect on growth as private spending. Government outlays for transfers such as Social Security benefits or interest on the debt, however, do not add to G.D.P. directly, but only indirectly if they lead to higher private spending.
Thus in 2011, total federal spending was $3.753 trillion. But only $1.233 trillion was added to G.D.P. because it was spending for goods and services. Of that, $835 billion was for national defense.
In the 1930s, the economist John Maynard Keynes said that increasing government spending would cure the Great Depression. He thought it was best for this to be done through investment spending on public goods - those that the private sector cannot supply, such as highways, bridges and such. But if all else failed, even spending on economically worthless projects like pyramids was better than nothing, he said.
Although federal spending roughly tripled as a share of the gross domestic product during the 1930s, this was not nearly enough to get the economy moving. Keynes believed that even more spending and bigger deficits were necessary, but lamented that it was impossible to get the political support for what was needed except during war.
As he wrote in a 1940 article in The New Republic, "It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiment which would prove my case - except in war conditions."
Fortunately for the economy, World War II soon led to unprecedented spending and deficits, which the Federal Reserve willingly financed with easy money. Federal spending rose to 44 percent of G.D.P. in 1943 and 1944 from 9.8 percent in 1940, and the budget deficit went from 3 percent to 30 percent of G.D.P.
World War II ended the Great Depression. The end of the depression and postwar prosperity convinced a generation of economists and politicians that military spending was economically beneficial - a view reconfirmed by the studies by the National Association of Manufacturers and the Aerospace Industries Association.
Indeed, some economists have argued that military spending has in fact been the primary vehicle through which Keynesian economics has operated during the postwar era. The reason is that conservatives who routinely denounce government always give a pass to military spending.
As the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in "The New Industrial State" in 1967, "All business objection to public expenditure automatically exempts expenditures for defense or those, as for space exploration, which are held to serve equivalent goals."
Continuing, he said, "If a large public sector of the economy, supported by personal and corporate income taxation, is the fulcrum for the regulation of demand, plainly military expenditures are the pivot on which the fulcrum rests."
This was most obviously true during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who raised military spending to an average of 5.9 percent of G.D.P. during his administration from an average of 4.8 percent of G.D.P. during Jimmy Carter's. Keynesian economists have long argued that the Reagan recovery owed as much to this as to his tax cuts.
It may be that once again military spending will come to the rescue of a prostrate economy.
Mitt Romney has promised to substantially increase Pentagon spending notwithstanding his promise to cut overall federal spending. Perhaps this is a goal that President Obama could support in order to get Republican votes for additional stimulus. All that's necessary for this to work is some flexibility in terms of what constitutes military spending.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney could perhaps follow the lead of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower and channel some of that spending into public infrastructure. Both signed Federal-Aid Highway Acts to build and expand highways for national security. (The 1956 legislation is popularly called the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.)
There are other spending programs as well that would equally serve domestic and national security interests. Education is one obvious area. In 1958, Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act in reaction to the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957.
It is clear in today's world that national defense does not consist only of bombs and rockets. Adequate public infrastructure, a well-trained labor force that can produce soldiers capable of operating high-tech weaponry, and a strong economy are as important as the traditional tools of war, or more so.

HEADLINE: The Old and Uneducated Watch the Most TV

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Some factoids on television viewing from the new American Time Use Survey data. 

 BODY:
Older Americans and high school dropouts spend the most time watching TV, according to new Labor Department data.
The department recently released its 2011 American Time Use Survey data, a treasure trove of factoids about how Americans spend their days. This time around I pulled out some numbers on TV-watching habits, which show quite a bit of variation by demographics.
On the average day in 2011, men watched 2.99 hours of television, while women watched 2.53. Here are some other statistics, broken down by demographics and weekdays versus weekends and holidays:
Children may be stereotyped as rotting their brains with too much TV, but actually the time spent in front of the tube generally rose steadily with age. (Unfortunately, there's no category for Hulu-watching or other TV substitutes in this survey.)
Additionally, the less educated you are, the more TV you watched on the average day last year. Americans with college degrees spent 1.76 hours watching television on the average weekday, whereas high school dropouts spent an average of 3.78 hours per weekday.
In general, less-educated Americans devoted more time each day to leisure and sports activities than their more educated counterparts, except in a few categories. As education went up, for example, Americans generally spent more time each day reading and playing sports or exercising.

HEADLINE: Engaging Nonfiction: The Times, the Common Core and a Question for You

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: We're presenting workshops this week on The Times and the Common Core Standards. Here are some of the things we'll be saying, and links we'll be sharing. 

 BODY:
During the summer we try to get out of our cubicles and talk to real teachers.
This week we're presenting workshops, first in San Diego at the annual ISTE conference, and then closer to home at the The New York Times printing plant in Queens. 
Both presentations will focus on a topic that we know will be top of mind this summer as you plan for September: the Common Core.
So this week we'd like to ask you, what can we do to help? How can The Learning Network make the transition to the Common Core easier for you? We have some ideas of our own (beginning, of course, with making sure all our lessons are aligned to the standards this fall), but we'd love to hear what you have to say.
Below, a roundup of tips and links for thinking about our content and the Common Core. 
 Update | All our printing plant presentations are now fully subscribed. Thank you for your interest!
 How does teaching with The Times in general help you address the Common Core? 
The Common Core Standards place a much greater emphasis on reading nonfiction and informational texts. They also ask that students "integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse formats and media, including visually."
 Almost everything The Times publishes every day is "informational text" in "diverse formats," including articles, essays, reviews, graphics, photographs, videos, podcasts and more. 
So just weaving the paper into your classroom routine regularly -- perhaps the way these New Jersey teachers have, or the way this Texas teacher did -- can introduce students to a huge range of sophisticated examples of the kind of writing and multimedia they'll need to meet standards.
 For example? 
Well, let's say you're teaching "The Great Gatsby," and you'd like to make it relevant to today and add some informational text to a unit that focuses mostly on fiction. 
If you started just by putting one word, "Gatsby," into the Times search engine, you'd discover pieces about the new Baz Luhrmann movie, a slide show of "Gatsby" locations on Long Island, an Economix blog post about something called "the Gatsby curve" that deals with income inequality, an essay from 1960 called "Gatsby, 35 Years Later," - and you'd find our own lesson plan collection, "Teaching 'The Great Gatsby' With The New York Times."
That's just for starters.
Any author you're likely to teach also has his or her own Times Topics page, where you can find decades' worth of articles, essays and multimedia. For example, hunting around the F. Scott Fitzgerald page can turn up everything from his obituary to essays musings on the connections between the jazz age and the Internet age.
And, of course, your search could just as easily be about topics like DNA, Watergate or algebra.
Scrolling through what comes up in The Times's search engine can lead you to a world of diverse resources on a topic. You can choose to search just the last day, week or year to see how that topic is currently being reported on or discussed, or you can look at what is available all the way back to 1851, when The Times first began publishing. 
 But The Times is difficult for my students. What are some ways to make your informational text more accessible? 
First, we try to do that every day on The Learning Network - through lesson plans that take complex issues in the news (like the affordable care act) and help students see the relevance to their own lives, as well as through our daily news quizzes, Student Opinion questions or simple 6 Q's About the News activities.
But we also have a whole lesson on strategies you might use before, during and after reading Times content.
And we have a popular lesson that helps students recognize "text types" that repeatedly appear in The Times, including cause and effect, problem and solution and compare and contrast.
Don't forget that the Common Core also encourages the use of media beyond the written word, which can be an easier starting point for some students. The Times publishes hundreds of examples in this kind of informational text weekly, including videos, interactive graphics, photographs and podcasts. 
 What about the Common Core focus on "argument"? 
According to the Common Core, students need to both read to "delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text" looking at the reasoning and evidence, as well as write their own arguments to "support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts."
The Times is full of content that fits that description. The entire Opinion section, for instance.
But there's one place on NYTimes.com that we think all teachers should know about since it is dedicated to argument and particularly accessible for students: the Room for Debate blog. We believe in it so much, in fact, that, earlier this year, we published a whole lesson plan on using it in the classroom.
Each Room for Debate post takes an issue or event in the news and rounds up opinions from four to six outside contributors. Because each contributor posts only a brief, four- or five-paragraph response, and because the design of the blog makes it easy to quickly grasp how the viewpoints differ, it is an especially accessible format. 
For example, here are some recent topics:
Is Facebook a Fad? Will Our Grandchildren Tweet?
The Middle School Conundrum
Did Any Good Come of Watergate?
What's the Best Way to Break Society's Bad Habits?
When Do Kids Become Adults?
And if you'd like to have your students practice writing their own arguments in a public forum, we post a daily Student Opinion question that anyone 13 or older can answer. We recently wrapped all 163 we asked this school year into one package.
So let us know what you'd like to see on the blog to help you address the Common Core. We know The Times offers a vast amount of relevant content on almost any academic subject you might teach, but we'd like to know how best to make it useful for you!
And don't forget that The Learning Network and all its posts, as well as all Times articles linked from them and from our Twitter and Facebook accounts, are free and accessible without a digital subscription.

HEADLINE: Top Executives Weigh Breakup of News Corp.

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: Top executives at News Corporation, including Rupert Murdoch and his son James Murdoch, met on Tuesday to discuss a potential breakup that would sever the media company's underperforming newspapers from its lucrative entertainment assets. 

 BODY:
Top executives at News Corporation met on Tuesday to discuss a potential breakup that would sever the media company's underperforming newspapers from its lucrative entertainment assets.
The spinoff, which could be announced as early as this week, comes as News Corporation's newspapers, once the foundation of Rupert Murdoch's $50 billion media empire, face financial strain and a decline in print advertising. The company's British publishing unit, meanwhile, is still reeling from a phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of its News of the World tabloid.
For years, investors and high-level News Corporation executives have pushed for a spinoff of the newspapers. But Mr. Murdoch, a newspaperman at heart who built his company from a single paper in Adelaide, Australia, has consistently rejected those proposals.
On Tuesday, top editors and publishers from the company's newspapers around the world arrived in New York to discuss the proposed separation and what the newly formed company would look like, according to people close to the company who could not publicly discuss the private meeting. The meeting held Tuesday afternoon at the company's Midtown Manhattan headquarters was said to include Mr. Murdoch; his son James Murdoch; and Chase Carey, the company's chief operating officer.
The gathering was largely intended to squelch anxiety and unrest among top editors. A main concern is that the separation would leave the newspaper business vulnerable without the high-performing entertainment assets propping them up financially, one of the people said.
Restive shareholders have often said they would prefer that the company focus on its entertainment assets, which together generated $23.5 billion in revenue in the year that ended in June 2011. The publishing business, by contrast, contributed $8.8 billion in revenue.
The separate company could include The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, The New York Post and as many as 175 other newspapers, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It is also likely to house the HarperCollins book business and a newly formed education division run by Joel Klein, the former New York schools chancellor and a trusted adviser to Rupert Murdoch.
The Murdoch family would likely maintain its roughly 40 percent voting stake in News Corporation, giving the family continued control over both companies. News Corporation management is likely to remain in place, under Mr. Carey and James Murdoch, currently the deputy chief operating officer. Rupert Murdoch would potentially serve as chairman of both companies, though a person close to the company cautioned that no executive decisions have been made.
Mr. Carey and others have contemplated ideas to make the publishing company less vulnerable, including making Mr. Klein's education division a part of the newly formed company. Other businesses like Australian classified advertising companies and other digital assets like Monster.com, which the company does not own but has considered for acquisition, would likely be part of the publishing division.
The executive ladder of the separate company has not been established. But two people close to the company said Robert Thomson -- editor in chief of The Journal and managing editor of its parent company, Dow Jones & Company, and a close confidant of Rupert Murdoch' s - is a possible candidate.
"Dow Jones is the trophy asset so it make sense," one of these people said.
The list of well-regarded executives who could lead the new unit could also include Lex Fenwick, the newly named chief executive of Dow Jones, or Tom Mockridge, chief executive of the British newspaper unit News International, according to another person close to the company.
A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment on what the spun off company would look like. In a statement, the company said, "News Corporation confirmed today that it is considering a restructuring to separate its business into two distinct publicly traded companies."
Mr. Carey has championed separating the companies to bolster the high-performing entertainment divisions. At a Deutsche Bank media conference in Palm Beach, Fla., last March, he said that in the company "certainly there are a number of parties who feel - would push to looking at a way to spin the publishing business separate from the rest." He later clarified on an earnings call that he was referring to investors and not News Corporation executives.
"This is an idea everyone has wanted from a purely economic point of view long before the scandal happened," said one person close to News Corporation who could not discuss corporate strategy publicly.
The move could help placate investors, who have watched their shares suffer from what analysts call a "Murdoch discount." On Tuesday, News Corporation's stock was up 6.4 percent to $21.75.
"They're working to relieve the Murdoch discount," said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Nomura Securities. "All the good work they've been doing in video lately has just been hurt by weaknesses in print, and there's no reason for that connection."
The announcement on Tuesday, first reported in The Journal, comes as the British regulatory agency Ofcom is expected to release its report on whether News Corporation is "fit and proper" to control 39 percent of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting before the Olympics begin on July 27, according to analysts. Spinning off the newspapers could influence Ofcom's decision, analysts said.
"The timing is because of the Olympics," said Thomas Eagan, a media analyst at Canaccord Genuity Securities. "They're looking at ways to help Ofcom make a decision that is favorable to News Corporation."
Ofcom said it continues to weigh the matter. "We haven't given any timetable on our fit and proper assessment. We will make a decision in due course," said Chris Wynn, a spokesman for Ofcom.
Investigations continue into charges of phone-hacking by News Corporation's British newspapers, a damaging scandal that led the company to close the tabloid News of the World and undermined News Corporation's $12 billion bid for the portion of British Sky Broadcasting that it did not already own.
Fallout from the hacking scandal has grown in the last year to touch on an array of figures, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and James Murdoch, who led the company's British newspaper operations.
News Corporation's plan is not unlike the separation of Viacom and the CBS Corporation in 2006, a move that left the company's chairman and controlling stakeholder, Sumner Redstone, in control of both companies. Viacom's stock price has nearly tripled since the split.

HIGHLIGHT: The 2013 Toyota Avalon sedan shares its optional hybrid powertrain with the 2013 Lexus ES 300h. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 On Tuesday, Toyota announced powertrain specifications for the redesigned Avalon sedan. The 3.5-liter V-6 engine found in the Toyota Camry SE as well as the 2013 Lexus ES 350, producing 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque, is the standard powertrain. The Hybrid Synergy Drive system used on the 2013 Lexus ES 300h is repurposed here, helping the Avalon duplicate the ES's combined Environmental Protection Agency-certified fuel-economy rating of 40 miles per gallon. Pricing is expected to be announced late this year, closer to the sedan's sale date. (Toyota)
 The Caterham Group, consisting of the niche British sports-car manufacturer and Formula One program, has parted ways with Ansar Ali, the chief executive of Caterham Cars. Mr. Ali is being succeeded by Graham Macdonald, previously the company's chief financial officer. The group did not disclose Mr. Ali's motivations for leaving. (Caterham)
 At its sale last weekend in Orange County, Calif., Barrett-Jackson auctioned the first production version of the 2013 SRT Viper GTS. The Viper, which had its debut at the New York auto show in April, sold for $300,000, with proceeds from the sale donated to the Austin Hatcher Foundation for Pediatric Cancer in Chattanooga, Tenn. (Chrysler)
 A tax-credit program in Louisiana, introduced in 2009 to encourage purchases of alternative-powertrain vehicles, may cost the state not $1 million as originally estimated, but $100 million in 2012 alone. The cost volatility was introduced by a state official who in April added flex-fuel vehicles to the list of those qualifying. Gov. Bobby Jindal rejected the measure on June 14, but because the law was on the books for the interim period, the state was expected to honor applications for the credit postmarked June 14 or earlier. (The Monroe News-Star, via Green Car Reports)
 Ford announced on Tuesday that the 2013 F-150 SVT Raptor would offer, as optional equipment, bead locks for the vehicle's tires. When the tires are at low inflation levels to facilitate rock scrambles, the bead locks prevent them from slipping off the wheel rims. Ford did not disclose pricing for the feature or for the slightly refreshed truck. (Ford)

HEADLINE: 'The Nance' Looking Likely as Nathan Lane's Return to Broadway

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: Lincoln Center Theater is expected to produce Douglas Carter Beane's burlesque era play in 2013. 

 BODY:
It looks as if the 2012-13 Broadway season will include Nathan Lane in one play at least.
Mr. Lane, a two-time Tony Award winner ("The Producers") with a golden touch at the box office, said in an interview on Monday that he plans to star on Broadway next spring in a Lincoln Center Theater production of "The Nance," a new play about early 20th-century burlesque, written by Douglas Carter Beane ("The Little Dog Laughed").
A spokesman for Lincoln Center Theater confirmed that executives hope to mount "The Nance" at a Broadway house in spring 2013, with the Tony winner Jack O'Brien set to direct.
There has also been buzz recently that Mr. Lane would return to Broadway this fall in "The Iceman Cometh" as part of a transfer of the critically praised production at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, where Mr. Lane played the lead role of the salesman Theodore Hickman. But Mr. Lane said "Iceman" is not bound for Broadway at the moment because of a variety of commercial and producing challenges.
"Iceman," which also starred Brian Dennehy, another Tony winner, ran nearly five hours, and there was only time (and stamina) to hold six performances a week in Chicago, making it a hard slog to profitability on Broadway. The production closed last week.

Any producer who wanted "Iceman" would have to strike a deal with Scott Rudin, the powerful theater producer and tough bargainer, who has the rights to mount the play on Broadway but is not transferring this production himself.
"The financial numbers just haven't been feasible, and if we had to do seven performances a week for several months to turn a profit, Dennehy and I would be dead," said Mr. Lane, who noted that the Broadway producers Jeffrey Richards, David Richenthal and Jordan Roth were among those who have eyed a transfer. "And it's O'Neill, you can't edit out major speeches or characters. So it has just not made sense economically.
"There has been some interest from BAM" - the Brooklyn Academy of Music - "and other nonprofit theaters about perhaps doing it at a later date, but we'll see,'' Mr. Lane added. "It's kind of bittersweet. It's been the best experience of my life."
A spokeswoman for the Goodman said on Monday night that she had no information about a future life for their "Iceman" production in New York.
As for "The Nance," Mr. Lane has been attached to the play for a few years and did a reading of an early draft in 2010 in Mr. Beane's living room with Benjamin Walker ("Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson") and Kevin Chamberlin (Mr. Lane's co-star in "The Addams Family"). The play centers on a performer who played a "nance" in burlesque shows in the 1920s and '30s; nance, or nancy boy, is slang for an effeminate or homosexual man, and nances were popular theatrical figures, akin to blackface performers during that era.
"I think it's the best thing that Doug has ever written, a rather risky and theatrical piece that I think has something to say," Mr. Lane said. "It has funny scenes, yes, and the burlesque sketches are a riot, but there is no happy ending - it's pretty tragic, in fact, but most of all it's a beautiful piece."

HEADLINE: No Income Tax? No Boost.

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: A study pokes holes in supply-side economic theory. 

 BODY:
This past February, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin announced a plan to phase out her state's income tax over ten years. "We're going to have the most pro-growth tax system in the region," she said, according to The Wall Street Journal. Lawmakers in Kansas and Missouri have also pushed to eliminate their state income taxes this year-convinced, like Ms. Fallin and like the majority of the Republican Party since the 1980s, that the best way to grow is to cut.
Too bad there's no proof this theory is right. A new study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows what liberals have always suspected: States that don't impose an income tax are not more competitive. No income tax? No boost.

Drawing from the study, Bloomberg News reports that "the nine states with the highest personal income taxes on residents outperformed or kept pace on average with the nine that don't tax their residents' incomes."
From 2001 to 2010, per-capita economic output increased an average 8.1 percent across all 50 states. The nine no-tax states did slightly better: 8.7 percent. But the nine high-tax states did even better than that: 10.1 percent. Moreover, median household income in the no-tax states fell an average 3.5 percent, compared with .7 percent in the high-tax states.
It looks as though supply-side economics doesn't work as promised.

HEADLINE: Obama Ad Attacks Romney as 'Outsourcer in Chief'

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The attack is the latest iteration of President Obama's attempts to demonize Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
President Obama's campaign is welcoming Mitt Romney to Virginia on Tuesday with an ad accusing Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, of sending American jobs overseas.
The new ad calls Mr. Romney the "outsourcer in chief" and asks whether Virginia voters want to send him to the White House.
"Romney's companies were pioneers at shipping U.S. jobs overseas," the ad says, "investing in firms that specialized in relocating jobs done by American workers to new facilities in low-wage countries like China and India."
The attack is the latest iteration of Mr. Obama's efforts to demonize Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm he led. But unlike the first attacks, which focused on workers who were fired by Bain-owned companies, the new ad targets jobs that were moved overseas.
On Monday, the president mocked Mr. Romney's campaign for trying to draw a distinction between outsourcing jobs and "off-shoring" jobs.
"If you're a worker whose job went overseas, you really don't need somebody explaining you the difference between outsourcing and offshoring," Mr. Obama said at a campaign event in Boston. "What you need is somebody who is going to wake up every day fighting to make sure that investments and jobs are happening here in Massachusetts, and here in the United States of America."
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, called the accusations in the new ads "false and discredited attacks" that are intended to "divert attention from his abysmal economic record."
"If President Obama had even half of Mitt Romney's record on jobs, he'd be running on it," Ms. Saul said. "But President Obama has the worst record on jobs and the economy of any president in modern history, which is why he is running a campaign based on distractions, not solutions."

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Biden Assails Romney for Swiss Bank Account

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's past Swiss bank account seems to be gaining favor as Democrats' metaphor for depicting the Republican candidate as out of touch with average Americans. 

 BODY:
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday joined President Obama in decrying Mitt Romney's investment record at Bain Capital, but Mr. Romney's past Swiss bank account seems to be gaining favor as Democrats' metaphor for depicting the Republican candidate as out of touch with average Americans. 
 "A prospective president with a Swiss bank account and a retirement investments in the Cayman Islands?" Mr. Biden said with mock incredulity in Waterloo, Iowa. "Did you ever think you'd be choosing between two people running for president, one of whom had a Swiss bank account? He's out of touch."
 Mr. Biden, speaking to about 400 people at a United Auto Workers union hall, was beginning a two-day trip through the battleground state that the Obama campaign billed as a "Strengthening the Middle Class Tour." Later he stopped in three other eastern Iowa towns, for treats and glad-handing at a deli in Independence, a drugstore ice cream counter in Manchester and a grocery store in Dubuque. 
 Like Mr. Obama, who was campaigning Tuesday in Atlanta and Miami at fund-raisers, Mr. Biden seized on a recent Washington Post story to slam Mr. Romney for Bain's reported role as a "pioneer" in investing in and managing companies that sent jobs overseas. 
 "You got to give Romney credit: He's a job creator -- in Singapore, and China, and India," Mr. Biden said in Waterloo. 
 Amplifying the theme, the Obama campaign released separate 30-second ads in Iowa and two other swing states. The Iowa ad ended, "Does Iowa really want an outsourcer-in-chief in the White House?" 
 A Romney spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, issued a statement objecting that "Vice President Biden today doubled down on the Obama campaign's same misleading attacks in an effort to distract voters from the president's disastrous economic record."
 While the back-and-forth about Bain has gotten much of the attention, Mr. Biden is hardly the first Obama surrogate to use Mr. Romney's Swiss bank account against him. A financial manager for Mr. Romney has said the account was closed in 2010, between Mr. Romney's two runs for president. 
 Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, for example, raises the issue at almost every stop as he campaigns for Mr. Obama around his state. "Why would a man who wants to be president of the United States of America and has known he had that goal for years and years and years, why would he take his wealth and put it in a Swiss bank account?" Mr. Strickland said recently in New Philadelphia, in eastern Ohio.
"I mean that says something about his judgment as well as his values. What if all Americans did that? What if you and I took our meager resources out of the local bank here and decided to send them to Switzerland, what would that do to our economy?"

TOP STORIES
News Corp. Considers Dividing Itself in Two | News Corporation is considering cleaving its publishing arm from its far larger entertainment division, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook early on Tuesday.
If News Corporation follows through, it would essentially mean splitting off the newspaper business that once formed the heart of the company from the Fox movie studio and television networks that now represent the strongest and most profitable parts of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
Such a split, which may take the form of a corporate spinoff, would create a publishing business that includes The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, The New York Post and the HarperCollins book business.
The Murdoch family would probably retain control of the newly split companies under such an outcome, this person said.
It is not clear whether Mr. Murdoch will actually proceed with the move - something he has rejected in the past - though he has softened his opposition more recently. Should the company settle on this path, it could announce its intentions to pursue a split as soon as this week, the person said. DealBook 
A Con Man Who Lives Between Truth and Fiction | "I'm a proven liar. Don't believe anything I say."
That was what Samuel Israel III told me last week, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column. Mr. Israel is the former hedge fund manager convicted of running a $450 million Ponzi scheme who faked his own suicide in the summer of 2008 to avoid his prison sentence before turning himself in after a worldwide manhunt.
He was sitting across from me in the visiting center of the Butner prison complex, about 45 minutes north of Raleigh in eastern North Carolina. (Bernard L. Madoff is in the same complex.)
I was there to talk to him because his story is a cautionary tale of the highly sophisticated, often endemic, fraud that still lurks on Wall Street. People I spoke with who dealt with him were still mystified about the breach of trust and how no one had a clue about his deception until it was too late. DealBook

HEADLINE: Cyprus to Take Over European Presidency

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
NICOSIA, Cyprus -- When the Republic of Cyprus takes over the European Union's rotating presidency on Sunday, it will have one qualification that could help endear it to the crisis-weary bloc and its 495 million citizens: it, too, is nearly broke.
What was supposed to be a proud moment for this tiny island nation of nearly 800,000 people is turning out to be an awkward embarrassment. The country, whose banks are heavily exposed to Greece's problems, was forced Monday to request a bailout for its ailing banking sector from the very group of nations it is supposed to lead. Economists estimate that Cyprus needs as much as $12.5 billion to shore up its public sector and banks. 
Only hours before, its Communist president, Demetris Christofias -- the self-described ''red sheep of Europe'' -- had attacked the European Union, saying that the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund had operated like a ''colonial force'' by demanding cost-cutting measures of distressed countries, a pointed reference to its big brother, Greece.
Mr. Christofias, whose party faces general elections next year, is so determined to avoid the harsh austerity measures that aides say he is also aggressively lobbying for a loan from China and Russia, so far without notable success.
While his antiausterity mantra resonates with many Europeans, others fret that Mr. Christofias, an ardent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the only Communist leader in the 27-member bloc, could use his position as a bully pulpit, helping to unsettle an already divided union further. ''Christofias has always had an ambivalent attitude toward the E.U.,'' said Fiona Mullen, a leading analyst here. ''He comes from a party that has often looked east instead of west.''
It is not just his stance against austerity that concerns European leaders. A confidential 2009 cable from the United States Embassy in Cyprus to Washington leaked by WikiLeaks noted that Mr. Christofias had praised Fidel Castro, welcomed a new Venezuelan Embassy in Nicosia, lauded Iran and vilified NATO. Such views could complicate delicate foreign policy negotiations, though senior Cypriot diplomats insist the country is determined to be an honest broker.
Above all, the presidency may be overshadowed by Cyprus's long-simmering feud with Turkey, further undermining already frayed relations between Europe and Turkey, whose talks on joining the union are in a perpetual state of disrepair. Turkey has said it will boycott the presidency.
Cyprus is an anomaly in the European Union, in that it has been divided between a Greek part and a smaller Turkish part since 1974, when Turkey invaded in response to a Greek-inspired coup. Turkey, which keeps about 30,000 troops in the north, is the only country that recognizes Northern Cyprus as a state. The division remains a preoccupation for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, thousands of whom were forced to flee their homes as a result of the invasion.
High above this divided city, painted on the face of a mountain overlooking the Greek Cypriot side, is a giant flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, its star and crescent a constant reminder of one of Europe's most enduring frozen conflicts.
''Happy is the man who can say he is a Turk,'' reads a slogan next to the flag, which lights up provocatively at night. While most of the world shuns Northern Cyprus, the north ensures that the south cannot forget.
Turkey's European Union membership talks have been stalled as a result of the seemingly intractable dispute; a resolution is viewed as a prerequisite for Turkey before it can join the union. The signs are not encouraging. Europe wants Turkey to open its ports and airports to Cyprus in return for unfreezing part of Turkey's blocked entry negotiations. But Turkey insists that the European Union should end its embargo of the north.
In a March interview with the Turkish Cypriot newspaper Kibris, Turkey's minister for European Union affairs, Egemen Bagis, said that one option was for Turkey to annex northern Cyprus if the current round of peace talks failed. ''We are in a state of deadlock, as neither side has a stake in changing the status quo,'' said Erol Kaymak, a professor of international relations at Eastern Mediterranean University in northern Cyprus.
United Nations-sponsored peace talks have faltered since they were restarted in 2008, four years after Greek Cypriots voted no in a referendum on reunification of the island. (The smaller Turkish Cypriot population voted yes, which Turkey often cites as proof that Greek Cypriots do not want peace.)
Andreas D. Mavroyiannis, Cyprus's deputy minister for European affairs, said in an interview that Turkey's intransigence was impeding progress. ''If they could sink us and make us disappear from the map, they would have done it,'' he said.
Adding to the tensions is Cyprus's growing outreach to Israel, whose relations with Turkey have been frayed since Israel's deadly raid on a Turkish flotilla to Gaza in 2010. Israel, viewed by Cypriots as a potential bulwark against Turkey, has denied reports that it is considering stationing war planes on Cyprus. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel recently visited Nicosia, and the countries have been in talks on developing natural gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean.
Cyprus has been pleased since the recent discovery of large reserves of natural gas in its territorial waters. But Turkey was incensed last year when the country, which has licensed exploration of a block of natural gas to Texas-based Noble Energy, began to drill. Turkey sent naval ships to accompany its own exploration crew just six miles from the Cyprus drill site.
Yet Neoklis Sylikiotis, Cyprus's minister of commerce and energy, was cautiously optimistic that ''energy can be a catalyst for reunification.'' He added, ''The income from the gas is for all Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots included.''

HEADLINE: Court Backs E.P.A. Over Emissions Limits Intended to Reduce Global Warming

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that heat-trapping gases from industry and vehicles endanger public health, dealing a decisive blow to companies and states that had sued to block agency rules.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declared that the agency was ''unambiguously correct'' that the Clean Air Act requires the federal government to impose limits once it has determined that emissions are causing harm. 
The judges unanimously dismissed arguments from industry that the science of global warming was not well supported and that the agency had based its judgment on unreliable studies. ''This is how science works,'' they wrote. ''The E.P.A. is not required to reprove the existence of the atom every time it approaches a scientific question.''
In addition to upholding the E.P.A.'s so-called endangerment finding, the court let stand related rules setting limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and limiting emissions from stationary sources. Opponents had also challenged the agency's timetable for enforcement and its rules singling out big polluters, but the court said the plaintiffs lacked the standing to do so.
Fourteen states, led by Virginia and Texas, had sued to block the rules. Fifteen states, including New York, California and Massachusetts, went to court to support the agency. Massachusetts and California were among the states that won a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2007, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, that led to the agency's endangerment finding. The attorney general of Virginia said he would appeal Tuesday's ruling.
In 2009 and 2010, Congress debated whether to legislate limits on carbon dioxide emissions, with backers arguing that imposing agency rules instead would be clumsy and expensive. The House passed a bill, but the legislative effort died in the Senate.
''This decision ensures that a regulatory approach to emissions cuts will take place, whether or not Congress acts legislatively,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit group that specializes in energy and environmental issues. ''The question is, does the industry push Congress to develop a more efficient, less costly approach now that regulation is inevitable?''
But Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that Congress's refusal to approve greenhouse gas limits constituted a decision and that lawmakers should act now to reverse the E.P.A. emissions rules. Carbon regulation ''threatens to drive energy prices higher, destroy jobs and hamstring our economic recovery,'' he said.
Industry is divided on regulating climate-changing gases, with the oil, gas, coal and most of the electricity sectors opposing emissions limits and automakers supporting them. In a statement, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers noted that car companies had made huge investments to improve fuel economy and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions and that a unified emissions standard was among its ''top national priorities.''
At the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay Timmons, the president and chief executive, called the ruling ''a setback for businesses facing damaging regulations from the E.P.A.'' The Clean Air Act was not designed for greenhouse gases, he said.
Environmental groups cheered the decision. ''This is a slam-dunk victory for E.P.A. and for the Clean Air Act,'' said Frank O'Donnell, the president of the group Clean Air Watch.
Joseph Mendelson III, a lawyer with the National Wildlife Federation who was involved in persuading Massachusetts to file a suit demanding that the E.P.A. regulate greenhouse gases, noted how long the battle over climate-altering gases had dragged on.
The decision ''puts to rest the big polluters' attempts to deny the E.P.A.'s ability to limit carbon pollution,'' he said. But, five years after the pivotal Supreme Court decision, legal squabbles are still ''delaying the obvious and prevent us from getting to the question of how do we best do it,'' he said.
The panel's opinion was unsigned. The chief judge, David B. Sentelle, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan; he was joined by two Clinton appointees, David S. Tatel and Judith W. Rogers.
The politics of carbon dioxide regulation have grown more partisan over the years. When Massachusetts first brought the case that led to the landmark Supreme Court decision, its governor was Mitt Romney. As the presumptive Republican nominee for president, he has since backed away from his earlier position that human-caused global warming is under way.
According to his Web site, one of his policy goals now is to amend the Clean Air Act, the critical law under which the E.P.A. is now acting, ''to exclude carbon dioxide from its purview.''

HEADLINE: Spain Officials Hailed Banks As Crisis Built

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Raphael Minder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Spain edged closer to a real estate and banking crisis that led to its recent bank bailout, Spanish financial leaders in influential positions mostly played down concerns that something might go terribly wrong.
The optimism of Spanish central bankers who went on to top jobs at the International Monetary Fund echoes the attitudes of officials in the United States who misjudged the force of a housing collapse several years ago that crippled banks and the economy. And it underscores the complications that can arise when government officials take watchdog roles at international agencies that pass judgment on the policies they once directed.
Spain's travails have now become central to the festering financial problems in Europe. The country's biggest mortgage lender has failed, and European leaders are scrambling to prevent the Continent's crisis from spreading further.
''The I.M.F. should be saying unpleasant things to countries to get them to reform,'' said Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception, a London-based research firm that in 2009 published one of the first reports to warn that Spanish banks were in serious trouble. ''They have been quite late in Spain.'' 
From their lofty perches, first at Spain's central bank and then as the I.M.F.'s top executives assessing global banking risk, Jose Vinals and Jaime Caruana were well positioned to sound alarms about the looming bank debacle.
But at a news conference in Washington in April 2010, when analysts were raising red flags about failing Spanish real estate loans, Mr. Vinals -- who a year earlier had succeeded Mr. Caruana -- offered assurances. The Spanish system was ''fundamentally sound,'' he said, and its needs for cash ''very small.''
A year later, as the banking crisis showed little sign of improving, Mr. Vinals again called for calm, saying the market panic that had led to bailouts in Ireland and Portugal would not infect Spain.
Now that the recent failure of Bankia, the big mortgage lender, has prompted a 100 billion euro (about $125 billion) European rescue, it is clear that Mr. Vinals's forecasts were too sanguine.
Mr. Caruana was no more prescient. Pressed at an I.M.F. news conference in July 2008 about falling house prices in Spain, he acknowledged there might be loan losses. But he said, ''The financial system in Spain is able to cope with that and is properly capitalized.''
It is not that the I.M.F. was not paying attention. Under Mr. Caruana and then Mr. Vinals, the organization's economists produced thousands of pages of analysis that, in real time, chronicled Spain's unspooling bank crisis.
The I.M.F. says that it is not a regulator and that its economists and officials warned early and often on the need for Spain and Europe to address its banking problems.
In assessing financial risks worldwide, Mr. Vinals highlighted challenges faced by savings banks, or cajas, and he backed the efforts of his former colleagues at the Bank of Spain to bring order to the sector -- such as the merger of seven cajas to form Bankia in 2010 -- although he often urged them to move faster.
Certainly, Spanish officials were slow to acknowledge the depths of the problem.
In early May, Rodrigo Rato, then the executive chairman of Bankia, told journalists that the bank was in a situation of ''great robustness, both in terms of solvency and liquidity.'' Even after the bank's bailout a few days later, Spain's economy minister predicted that no more than 15 billion euros of public funds would be required to clean up the banks.
Mr. Caruana and Mr. Vinals, who declined to comment for this article, were not the only government officials to make the transition from Madrid to the I.M.F.'s headquarters in Washington.
Most prominent by far was Mr. Rato, now better known for his disastrous two-year run at the helm of Bankia. In 2004, he was picked to lead the I.M.F. after winning global recognition during an eight-year run supervising Spain's growth burst as the country's economy minister.
Until he left the fund three years later, Mr. Rato was better known for praising Spain's economic miracle -- one that relied largely on revenue driven by real estate to drive growth and balance budgets -- than questioning its sustainability.
He considered himself the intellectual father of that miracle, as he made clear in a 2004 speech, citing his reforms as marking ''a new era in economic policy'' for Spain. Mr. Rato, too, declined to be interviewed for this article.
There were many others, of course, who did not foresee the Spanish banking blowup. Topping the list is Europe's main bank overseer, the European Banking Authority.
In December 2011, the authority concluded that Spain's two strongest institutions -- Santander and BBVA -- would need to raise more money than the 1.3 billion euros that was required of Bankia, which would need to be rescued just six months later.
And as the United States financial crisis made clear in 2008, it is no easy task to anticipate the point at which a decline in housing prices will ignite a financial collapse.
In Spain, the increase in house prices between 2000 and 2007 was particularly extreme -- so much so that as early as 2006, a team of inspectors within the Bank of Spain sent a cautionary report to the government.
The study criticized the ''passive attitude'' of Mr. Caruana, who led the central bank from 2000 to 2006, and the extraordinary acceleration of loans to homebuyers and real estate developers.
The inspectors also warned of Spanish banks engaging in unusually heavy short-term borrowing at levels far beyond their deposits.
The 2006 report painted a much darker picture than Mr. Rato and the I.M.F. saw a short time later when the fund made its own assessment in 2007 of Spain's economic and financial health -- and the Bank of Spain's ability to rein in excesses.
The analysis praised the ''dynamism of Spain's financial system,'' and said that ''its strong, prudential supervision and regulation remain a forte of the economy.''
Annual I.M.F. reviews conducted by the European department did become more critical, highlighting on numerous occasions Spain's overreliance on real estate for its growth and warning frequently that the lax lending practices of the cajas needed to be revamped.
Although it was Mr. Vinals's financial risk department that produced the most recent stress test on the banks, fund officials said that he recused himself from its preparation given his past ties to Spain's central bank.
''The I.M.F. has consistently and clearly flagged the dangers that exist in Europe and the urgent need to recapitalize banks,'' said William Murray, a spokesman for the I.M.F. ''Anyone who claims the contrary is either misrepresenting the public record or just does not understand how the fund works.''
People who know Mr. Vinals, a Harvard-trained economist, describe him as smooth and politically skilled -- his name emerged recently as a potential candidate to run Spain's central bank -- who during his stint as deputy governor at the Bank of Spain oversaw its international operations. .
A cautious technocrat by nature, Mr. Vinals and his colleagues are to some extent constrained in how much change they can demand from a government -- especially in the sensitive area of bank supervision -- before the country in question seeks a loan.
Analysts say that former Bank of Spain officials at the fund should have made more aggressive use of its bully pulpit in light of their broad familiarity with the Spanish banking system.
Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization, recently conducted an audit of the I.M.F.'s track record in assessing euro area risks before and after the crisis.
Bruegel's conclusion on Spain is that in the early going the fund was too slow to warn that tax revenue stemming from the real estate boom, and the budget surpluses they produced for Madrid, were illusory. Nor was it ever contemplated that one of Europe's largest economies would experience a capital flight crisis similar to that in Mexico or Thailand.
''You did not see the sense of alarm,'' said Jean Pisani-Ferry, the lead author of the report, which also said the I.M.F. oversight later improved significantly. ''There was a sense that Europe was different.''
Experts say that Mr. Vinals and Mr. Caruana may not have warned earlier on Spain because of the trust they and others in the international financial community had in the Spanish central bank's ability to restructure the cajas without having to resort to a bailout.
''It is fair to say that the I.M.F. may have thought that the Bank of Spain was going to take care of it,'' said Luis Garicano, an economist at the London School of Economics.
In fact, up through the 2008 global financial crisis, Bank of Spain officials had become the toast of the international regulatory circuit for their innovations. Most notable of those was a so-called dynamic provisioning policy, a set of rules that forces banks to set aside extra cash during good economic times to protect against the inevitable rainy days.
For a time, Spanish financial institutions were hailed as paragons of responsible banking -- having set aside over 110 billion euros in reserves.
But Jose Garcia Montalvo, a real estate specialist based in Barcelona, says that this figure could have been higher -- and the banks better prepared for the housing collapse when it came.
The reserves proved insufficient, he said, because the Spanish central bank in 2004, led then by Mr. Caruana, succumbed to bank lobbying and pressure from Europe by halving the amount that banks had to set aside to 15 percent of overall loans, from 30 percent.
From that point, Spanish bank lending, already growing at 14 percent annually, went into overdrive -- up 27 percent in 2005 and an additional 25 percent in 2006.
Mr. Caruana's career has since thrived. After just three years at the I.M.F., he left in 2009 for one of the plum global finance jobs: chief executive of the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel-based regulatory body that serves as a forum for the world's central banks.
Last weekend, in a speech that explored the roots of the financial crisis, Mr. Caruana highlighted the economic distortions caused by frantic real estate lending, and he called for banks to be quicker to recognize losses and raise capital -- although he did not mention Spain by name.
As for Mr. Rato, he left the fund abruptly in 2007, worked as a senior investment banker for Lazard in Spain and took charge of the entity that would become Bankia in 2010 -- before being forced out last month.
Mr. Vinals continues to supervise global banking and financial risk at the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Says 24 Are Arrested In Credit Card Theft Plan

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For hackers in search of information like credit card numbers and software to spy on computers, the site called Carder Profit appeared to be a veritable eBay for thieves.
Instead, it was a creation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
On Tuesday, after a two-year undercover operation, authorities in 13 countries arrested two dozen people who are accused of fraud involving computer crime. 
Federal officials said Operation Card Shop, as the sting is being called, was unusually broad and represented a significant step in combating credit card fraud, which has grown notably more sophisticated recently.
''These guys represent the complete ecosystem of Internet fraud,'' said one senior law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the confidentiality of the investigation. ''We drew them out of the shadows with the Web site as bait.''
Hackers have become increasingly successful recently in obtaining credit card information and other personal data, sharing it on secure Web sites, often on overseas servers. Last year, hackers in Eastern Europe obtained the names, account numbers, e-mail addresses and transaction histories of more than 200,000 Citibank customers.
The online forum, one law enforcement official said, was ''like a restricted eBay,'' open only to people who had a reputation and who had been vouched for by someone on the site. Besides the financial data, hacking tips, malware, spyware and access to stolen goods, like iPads and iPhones, were also possible on the site, the official said.
Federal officials maintained that the sting operation prevented potential losses of more than $200 million. Credit card providers were notified of more than 400,000 compromised credit and debit cards, the officials said.
Many of the 11 individuals arrested in the United States offered specialized skills and products on the sting site. One, who used the screen name xVisceral, offered remote access tools known as RATS that would spy on computers and Web cameras; the programs sold for $50 a copy.
Another, Mir Islam, known as JoshTheGod, sold stolen credit card information and had data on 50,000 credit card accounts, according to the United States attorney for the Southern District. He was arrested after buying cards from an undercover agent and trying to use one at an A.T.M. on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.
Mr. Islam is accused of helping to operate additional forums, UGNazi.com and Carders.org, both of which were seized by the F.B.I. A lawyer for Mr. Islam declined to comment.
Other people arrested offered to ship stolen merchandise and arrange drop services so items like sunglasses, air purifiers and synthetic marijuana could be picked up.
Two individuals were arrested in New York, nine elsewhere in the United States and 13 in a dozen other countries, according to an F.B.I. spokeswoman.
In addition to arresting purveyors of stolen credit card information, authorities also aimed to trap people who created fake credit cards. The information included credit card numbers, addresses, Social Security numbers, mothers' maiden names and details of bank accounts.
Some people who bought software and other items on the sting site purchased products from retailers like Apple and Walmart.
''The coordinated law enforcement actions taken by an unprecedented number of countries around the world today demonstrate that hackers and fraudsters cannot count on being able to prowl the Internet in anonymity and with impunity, even across national boundaries,'' said Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.
In addition to luring hackers onto the site, federal authorities also monitored the discussion threads that sprang up, as specialized hackers sold their wares. The site was created in June 2010 and shut last month.
''From New York to Norway and Japan to Australia, Operation Card Shop targeted sophisticated, highly organized cybercriminals involved in buying and selling stolen identities, exploited credit cards, counterfeit documents and sophisticated hacking tools,'' Janice K. Fedarcyk, assistant director for the F.B.I., said in a statement.
She said the arrests would cause ''significant disruption to the underground economy.''
The overall number of arrests had been reported earlier as 26.
Credit card fraud has exploded in recent years, with increasingly sophisticated hackers teaming up with criminal organizations overseas. In the case of Operation Card Shop, the arrests took place in nations like Britain, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Norway and Germany. Search warrants and interviews were obtained in Australia, Canada, Macedonia and Denmark.
''They didn't just take down one kid and a Web site,'' said Dave Marcus, director of advanced research and threat intelligence at McAfee, a major provider of computer security software. ''They took down a very organized group of people.''
While the international reach of the operation was notable, the number of stolen cards pales in comparison with some earlier breaches. This year, Global Payments, an Atlanta-based transaction processor, reported a breach affecting 1.5 million credit cards. And in 2008, the underground market for the data was flooded with more than 360 million stolen personal records, mainly credit and debit files.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Rose a Third Month in April

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Home prices rose in April for the third consecutive month, the latest indication that a recovery in the housing market was gaining traction.
But in a sign of the struggles still facing the broader economy, a separate report on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in five months in June.
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller composite index of prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.7 percent in April from March on a seasonally adjusted basis, topping economists' expectations for a 0.4 percent gain. 
Compared with a year earlier, however, home prices declined 1.9 percent in the 20 cities. Still, that year-over-year pullback in prices was better than economists' expectations for a decline of 2.5 percent, and an improvement from the 2.6 percent annual decline seen in March.
Six years after the housing market's collapse sent prices down more than 30 percent, recent data suggests the sector has finally hit bottom with leaner inventories and record-low mortgage rates encouraging buying.
''The housing recovery in this cycle has been painfully slow to develop, but it is unmistakably here,'' said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial.
April's monthly gain made for the longest streak of consecutive increases since the homebuyer tax credit from mid-2009 into early 2010 pushed up prices.
Still, the housing market has a long way to go before full recovery as it faces a large pipeline of foreclosures, tight credit restrictions and weak demand.
''The healing continues and we will eventually find ourselves with a normal-looking housing market,'' said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management in Toronto. ''It's still very much a multiyear process, but it's heartening to see those home prices start to go up.''
Robert Shiller, co-creator of the S.& P./Case Shiller index, was less convinced than some that it was a definitive sign that prices had stabilized, saying it was encouraging but still too soon to tell.
''They've been falling for six years now, and people have been asking me this question for six years, and there's always this sense that it's about to turn up,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''Now I think we have a better real possibility that it actually will turn up.''
Separately, the Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 62.0 from a downwardly revised 64.4 in May, falling short of economists' expectations. It was the lowest level since January.
While consumers' assessment of their current situation improved, they were less upbeat about their expectations for the next six months. Fewer respondents expected business conditions or employment would improve in the coming months.
''It's the future they're more scared about, and I can't say I disagree with that concern, given European problems, fiscal cliffs and all the various challenges that will present over the next six months,'' Mr. Lascelles said.
The consumer confidence index is down nearly 10 points from the peak hit in February. Consumer spending -- a major engine of economic growth during the housing boom -- accounts for about 70 percent of American economic activity.
Analysts expect the economic recovery to continue at a sluggish pace after growing at a 1.9 percent rate in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Faulting a Plan to Replace The Scorned Tappan Zee

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- It was unloved from the start, built on the cheap, located improbably at the broadest stretch of the Hudson River, its improvised design derided by its own engineers as ''one of the ugliest bridges in the East.''
Almost everything about the Tappan Zee Bridge has been criticized since it opened in 1955 -- its congestion, its safety, its narrow lanes, substandard design and unfortunate history of suicides -- though Gov. Thomas E. Dewey did defend its location on the grounds that it was outside the range of an atomic bomb falling on New York City and thus the only bridge likely to survive an attack.
Now, after more than a decade of delay and inaction, the state seems on the verge of building a new and significantly upgraded Tappan Zee, a project that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other proponents said would produce tens of thousands of construction jobs, improve commutes for frustrated drivers and replace the George Costanza of New York bridges with a successor twice its size in one of the largest construction projects in state history.
Alas, the bridge may end up better, but there has been no more love for this project. 
Financing for the $5.2 billion bridge remains a riddle, with sharp, unpopular toll increases likely, and environmental groups are concerned about what will be the biggest dredging project in the history of the Hudson.
But the biggest complaint, one that comes from the executives of three area counties, local mayors and state legislators, and from transportation and planning groups, is that the state is building a second misconceived Tappan Zee by dropping plans to include mass transit as part of the construction.
The Westchester County executive, Rob Astorino, commended the governor for moving the project forward. But he said that a bridge without mass transit would look back to the 1950s instead of to the future. ''In an iPad world, an eight-track bridge will be hopelessly obsolete before construction begins,'' Mr. Astorino, a Republican, said.
The criticism has irked Mr. Cuomo, whose advocacy helped get the Tappan Zee on a list of 14 projects chosen by the Obama administration last fall for expedited review.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that the bridge would be built with the potential to add mass transit, and that the decade-long delay and criticism now were emblematic of the inability to build almost any major public works program. More to the point, he said in a phone interview, mass transit could double the project's cost, and he added that the region could not afford more delays on an unsafe, deteriorating bridge that could cost $1 billion to maintain over the next decade.
''There are a lot of nice ideas out there that you can argue should be done but for the money,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I know, but that's life.
''If we only had an additional $5 billion we could do this, but we don't,'' he said, referring to bus service. (Adding rail would cost billions more than that.)
The Tappan Zee carries the New York State Thruway between Rockland and Westchester Counties and has a capacity of 100,000 vehicles a day. It now carries 138,000 and has no shoulders or emergency lanes, so any accident or breakdown can block traffic for miles. The new bridge would meet current seismic standards, while the existing one does not.
The plan is to replace the current seven-lane bridge with either one or two structures projected to have 15 lanes -- 8 for traffic, as well as shoulders and breakdown lanes, a lane for pedestrians and bicyclists and space for designated bus lanes. It would be the first major bridge built in the New York City area since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, in 1964.
Construction could begin by next spring, but crucial deadlines loom in July, when a final environmental impact statement is produced and four consortiums vying to design and build the bridge submit bids. A winner will be selected in September.
Plans developed over the past decade for the new bridge also included public transportation, across a 30-mile corridor focused on bus-only lanes, and possibly also a connection to the Metro-North Railroad.
Just two years ago, the State Transportation Department said, ''Mass transit offers the only realistic means of addressing the requirements of improving mobility in the corridor.'' Proponents saw the plans as crucial to moving the region toward a future with less sprawl and more mass transit.
But no one came up with concrete proposals on how to pay for mass transit. And Mr. Cuomo said it was not clear whether there would be sufficient ridership to support it.
State officials said that the bridge would provide the crucial piece for a mass transit system that does not now exist and that building a system in stages was always the likeliest approach.
And local business, construction and labor groups and other supporters agree that a new bridge is long overdue and avoiding more delays is far more important than adding transit now. They say the critics represent a minority viewpoint.
''The bridge we're building is exactly the same bridge we would build if we were simultaneously building the full transit system,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
But critics say that if no money is allocated for mass transit now, there is no reason to think there will be any in the future. Some say the $5 billion bus estimate is inflated.
''We believe a project design so as 'not to preclude' transit realistically does have the effect of precluding transit,'' the regional chapter of the American Planning Association, which represents 1,200 planners, said in a letter to the state in March.
Numerous other issues must be resolved. The most problematic is how to pay for the project. Charles Komanoff, an economist and policy analyst, said in a report in March that to recover the cost entirely through tolls would require charges of two to four times the current amount, which is $4.75 for passenger cars with E-ZPasses. (The toll is collected in only one direction, from Westchester-bound traffic.)
Political gridlock in Washington is clouding the potential for federal transportation dollars, and the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the Thruway Authority's credit outlook this month partly because of the looming Tappan Zee costs.
Mr. Komanoff said a mammoth bridge without transit would create perverse incentives to increase car traffic, with its costs in pollution and carbon emissions.
''The problems of paying off the debt, I think, are going to be so severe they will instill a powerful incentive to generations up and down the Hudson Valley to pump up the traffic levels over the Tappan Zee,'' he said.
Environmental groups have claimed that there would be risks to water quality and fish populations from the dredging operation. One well-known group, Riverkeeper, has already threatened to sue, citing environmental threats and insufficient time for the public to review the proposal.
Mr. Cuomo said the slow crawl toward building the bridge should be seen in the context of political, economic and regulatory forces that made almost any major public project exceedingly difficult. He announced an agreement between the Thruway Authority and 14 labor organizations last week on work rules and overtime that he said would save an estimated $452 million.
''We don't build bridges anymore,'' he said. ''We don't build tunnels, we don't build airports, we don't built large, visionary capital projects. Why? Because it's very hard and difficult and risky and there's always opposition.''
Mr. Cuomo noted that the Tappan Zee project began three governors ago and that construction had not begun.
''I will prevail in the end,'' he said, ''but I'm sure it's going to be a long and difficult journey.''

HEADLINE: At Fireworks, Not All Seats Created Equal

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
They are an expression of democracy, liberty and equality, a pyrotechnic celebration of the ideals on which the United States was founded. But this year's Fourth of July fireworks on the Hudson River will offer a new tier of premier viewing -- a V.I.P. section in Hudson River Park where spaces will go for $200 a pop.
The decision by the Hudson River Park Trust and its fund-raising partner, Friends of Hudson River Park, to sell at least 500 tickets at the end of Pier 84 reflects the financial strains that the five-mile-long public park is facing. In recent years, there have been development setbacks and maintenance challenges on a number of the park's piers, where marine organisms are eating away the pilings. 
But the elite viewing platform has struck some parks observers as, well, elitist. ''Any time you section off or privatize or limit access to the general public, it's against the grain of what a public park is supposed to be,'' said Melissa Mark-Viverito, a member of the City Council who is chairwoman of the parks and recreation committee. ''It's symbolic of what we're seeing at the city and state level, where we're not allocating enough resources to keep our parks in a state of good repair.''
In fact, because of directives from the New York Police Department, most of the park, which stretches from Battery Place to 59th Street, will be closed to the public. Crowd control has dictated that only Pier 84, at 44th Street, and a few other locations are available to viewers, with the expected throngs directed onto the West Side Highway, which will be closed to traffic.
Friends of Hudson River Park, the nonprofit group that has stepped up fund-raising efforts, will keep most of Pier 84 open to the public at no cost on a first-come-first-served basis. But the group saw the special access at the tip of the pier, where there will be food and music, as a way to thank big donors who bought tables at its recent gala fund-raiser, as well as a way to raise revenue.
''We wanted to provide an opportunity to people who want to support the park,'' said A. J. Pietrantone, executive director of the Friends group, adding that tickets would be priced at $200 for adults and $100 for children.
Madelyn Wils, president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust, which runs the park, defended the event. ''This is a very, very small amount of the whole, so this should not prevent anyone from being able to watch the fireworks,'' she said. ''There are a lot of people who use the park, so we are basically introducing the idea that if you love the park the way the park loves you, then help support the park. It's not a new idea, but it's new for us.''
The state-chartered park, which was devised to be self-sustaining, has struggled during the recent recession. Capital funds from the city and state have fallen to just $7 million from a high of $42 million in 2008. This spring, legislation was introduced in the State Assembly that would have relaxed the restrictions on the types of development allowed on Pier 40, but the bill languished. While Pier 40, at Houston Street, was supposed to be one of the biggest revenue generators for the park, it has instead become a drain.
Some parks advocates backed the trust's decision to capitalize on the popularity of the Macy's fireworks. ''If funds go back to the park for care and maintenance,'' said Holly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, ''then the public is getting a direct benefit from the temporary closure.''

HEADLINE: Markets Gain on a Positive Housing Report

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Major stock indexes in the United States rebounded from Monday's sell-off, as optimism about the housing market tempered concern about a worsening of Europe's debt crisis.
Shares of News Corporation rose 8.3 percent after reports that the company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, was considering splitting into two publicly held corporations.
Apollo Group, the profit-making college chain, surged 10 percent after beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising its forecast. A measure of home builders in Standard & Poor's indexes jumped 3.8 percent as housing prices dropped at the slowest pace in more than a year. 
The S.& P. 500-stock index finished the day up 0.5 percent to 1,319.99, after tumbling 1.6 percent on Monday. Still, amid concern about a global economic slowdown, the benchmark measure is on pace for the first quarterly slump since September. Energy, financial and technology shares have had the biggest losses so far in the second quarter, tumbling at least 9.5 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average increased 32.01 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,534.67. The Nasdaq composite index was up 0.63 percent, or 17.90 points, to 2,854.06. Volume for exchange-listed stocks was about six billion shares, or 12 percent below the three-month average.
''There are lots of variables at play,'' said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer for Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, in a phone interview. ''People are looking at signs of stabilization in the housing market, there's the European summit this week, it's almost quarter end. It's going to be a volatile week.''
The S.& P./Case-Shiller index, which measures property values in 20 cities, dropped 1.9 percent in April from the same month in 2011, the smallest decline since November 2010. The data overshadowed a surge in yields at auctions in Italy and Spain ahead of a European Union summit meeting on Thursday and Friday.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32 to 101 4/32, pushing the yield up 1.63 percent, from 1.60 percent on Monday.
''We're caught in this limbo,'' said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wis. ''People are waiting to see what comes out of the European Union summit this week.''
Consumer discretionary, energy and financial shares had the biggest gains among the 10 main S.& P. 500 industries. Home builders advanced with PulteGroup and Lennar adding more than 3 percent.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their recommendation on JPMorgan Chase, sending its shares up 1.1 percent to $35.71.
Goldman Sachs upgraded JPMorgan to a buy on its ''Americas conviction list'' of highly recommended stocks, while Morgan Stanley was removed from that list and lowered to neutral, the analysts wrote in a research note.
Dow Chemical slid 2.9 percent to $31.32. Its stock was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan. The 18-month share price estimate is $36.
The S.& P. 500, which has been hurt by weakening economic data, is about to face another barrier: the election-year calendar.
The gauge has climbed an average of 0.1 percent in the third quarters before a presidential vote in election cycles since 1945, the worst return of the year and down from an average increase of 2.2 percent from April to June, according to S.& P. Shares in the United States have returned 5.7 percent in election years since World War II, the second-worst performance during four-year executive branch terms.
Stocks have retreated after a rally in the first quarter, dragged down after reports on manufacturing and employment trailed economist forecasts and concern grew that Europe's debt crisis will spur a global recession.

HEADLINE: Boston Properties Sticks to Its Formula

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
When Boston Properties, a real estate investment trust that focuses on prime office buildings in five markets in the United States, said recently that it had abandoned efforts -- at least for now -- to make its first foray into the London market, many Wall Street analysts were relieved.
The possibility that Boston Properties might tamper with its winning formula had created some uneasiness in the investment world, where the governing mantra these days is ''stick to what you know.''
''They've been so clear and focused that in order for them to go into other markets, there had better be a really compelling reason,'' said Ross T. Nussbaum, a senior analyst at UBS. ''For them to take on the risk, the investment returns have to be exceptional.'' 
Founded in Boston in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, Boston Properties has been a public company since 1997. Today it owns and manages 153 properties in the New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco areas as well as in Princeton, N.J., and it also has the only office tower currently under construction in Midtown Manhattan.
Its portfolio includes high-profile office towers like the General Motors Building and 601 Lexington Avenue in New York (the former Citigroup Center); the Prudential Center and John Hancock Tower in Boston; and the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco. Mr. Zuckerman, 75, often boils down the company's strategy to a single phrase: owning ''A buildings in A locations.''
''We have, as a company, had a particular kind of strategy to concentrate in certain markets, where we thought we would do well in good times, and not do terribly in bad times,'' he said last week. ''Everybody does well in good times, but the buildings we have found that do the best in bad times are A buildings in A locations. It's that simple.''
Indeed, since the depths of the recession, commercial real estate prices in major markets have recovered more than twice as quickly as those in nonmajor markets, showing an increase of 37.1 percent compared with 17.5 percent, according to Moody's/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices.
Since Mr. Linde's death in 2010, Mr. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News and U.S. News & World Report (where he is also editor in chief), has stepped up his involvement in the real estate company, assuming Mr. Linde's title of chief executive. Mr. Linde's son, Douglas, with the company 15 years, is president. In contrast to Mr. Zuckerman's media holdings, which have experienced a great deal of turnover, Boston Properties is known for its stable management team.
In addition to praising the high-quality portfolio, analysts give the company high marks for not taking on too much debt, and for being a skilled developer, operator and longtime owner, not just a wheeler-dealer. ''They have a longstanding track record of doing fairly complicated center-city development, which gives them a competitive advantage,'' said Ross Smotrich, a managing director at Barclays who focuses on real estate investment trusts, or REITs.
Near the peak of the market, while a buying frenzy was taking hold, Boston Properties sold billions of dollars of buildings, including 5 Times Square for $1.28 billion, and 280 Park Avenue for $1.2 billion. ''They've done a very good job of managing risk,'' said Barry Vinocur, the editor of REIT Zone Publications in Novato, Calif. ''They showed an ability to pull their chips off the table when others weren't doing it.''
Those transactions enabled Boston Properties to take advantage of the downturn in the market and acquire trophy office towers like the General Motors Building in 2008 and the John Hancock Tower in 2010.
Since the commercial real estate market was at its lowest, on March 1, 2009, total returns for Boston Properties have outperformed SNL Financial's United States REIT Office Index by 209 percent to 165 percent, according to SNL, a research company in Charlottesville, Va.
Signaling its confidence in the future of the New York office market, Boston Properties resumed construction last year of a 39-story Midtown Manhattan office tower at Eighth Avenue and 55th Street after halting work on the project during the downturn. In May, the last beam was placed on the building.
Mr. Zuckerman made the decision to go ahead even though the building has only one tenant so far, the national law firm Morrison & Foerster, which is leasing 184,000 square feet, about 19 percent of the total. Two other law firms, Chadbourne & Parke and Kaye Scholer, as well as Microsoft, are reportedly considering taking space there, though Mr. Zuckerman would not discuss potential tenants.
The tower will be the first new office building in Midtown since 11 Times Square, on Eighth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets, was completed last year. That building is only about 40 percent leased, but is arguably in a more pioneering stretch of Eighth Avenue than the Boston Properties building, 250 West 55th Street, near the Hearst Tower and the Time Warner Center.
Still, analysts said the new Boston Properties building was not without risk. ''It's a great physical product,'' said John W. Guinee III, a managing director at Stifel Nicolaus. ''But it's a secondary location in Manhattan. The market is very thin at over $100 a square foot, particularly if you're not on Park Avenue or in the Plaza district.''
In addition, the building is being marketed primarily to law firms at a time when that business is contracting. At a recent conference call with analysts, company officials acknowledged that law practices today need less space than they used to. But Robert E. Selsam, the senior vice president who manages Boston Properties' New York office, said, ''I have seen no movement away from private window offices for attorneys.''
A rival New York office landlord, Scott Rechler, chief executive of the privately held RXR Realty, said that the new building will not be ready for tenants until 2014, when demand for space is expected to rise. ''The timing is going to work out for them,'' Mr. Rechler said. ''They can afford to be patient and bring in the right tenants at the right rents.''
Despite its blue-chip reputation, Boston Properties has not entirely escaped criticism. Analysts raised eyebrows when the company, like many other REITs, sold additional shares in 2009 to shore up its balance sheet, in that way diluting the value of the existing shares. Additionally, Michael Knott, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company should have moved aggressively to acquire buildings in the hot San Francisco area.
''One could say we should have a larger portfolio in all the markets we are in,'' Mr. Zuckerman said in response.
Mr. Vinocur points out that Boston Properties' decision in 1998 to make its first investment in San Francisco by buying the Embarcadero Center, an office and retail complex in the financial district, drew the same kind of complaints more recently leveled at the company for dipping its toe in the London market.
These days, analysts are a little more willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. Though officials have said they looked at several properties in London, it was widely reported that they had considered buying Drapers Gardens, a 292,500-square-foot building in the financial district. ''Had they consummated that deal,'' Mr. Knott said, ''we would have been skeptical, but we wouldn't have changed our perception of their entire body of work.''
Mr. Zuckerman made it clear that he had not ruled out investing in London at some point. ''We're going to continue to look,'' he said. ''The London market has a lot of characteristics that we do like.''
