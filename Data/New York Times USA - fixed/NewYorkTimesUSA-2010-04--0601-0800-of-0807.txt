HEADLINE: NATO Endorses Plan for Gradual Transfer of Command to Afghans

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
TALLINN, Estonia -- Setting the stage for a gradual withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States and other NATO countries adopted a plan here Friday that sets conditions for beginning to remove troops from a lead role in Afghan provinces by the end of this year.
 The plan, which NATO hopes to turn into a formal agreement with the Afghan government in July, would transfer authority to Afghans when they have met three criteria: a competent local police force, a durable civilian government and signs of reconciliation with the Taliban insurgency. 
 NATO's goal is to announce in November that it has begun to hand over authority in a cluster of provinces, most likely in Afghanistan's relatively stable north and west, officials said. If successful, the plan would help President Obama meet his deadline of starting to pull out American troops by July 2011. But American officials cautioned that the timetable could slip if security remained poor or if the insurgents proved resilient.
 At a meeting of NATO foreign ministers here, the alliance received an update on the progress in the war from Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top military commander in Afghanistan, and Ambassador Mark Sedwill, NATO's recently appointed senior civilian representative.
 As the American-led coalition prepares for its next big operation, in the southern Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Mr. Sedwill said it had learned valuable lessons from the recent campaign to stabilize Marja -- namely, that achieving a rough balance of power among competing tribal groups was critical to restoring order.
 The Marja campaign, he said, had been hampered because some landowners amassed so much power that they had co-opted the local police force, transforming it into a militia used against the people.
 ''The big lesson we learned in Marja, which we're taking to Kandahar, is that you got to get the politics right,'' Mr. Sedwill told reporters. ''Balanced access to political and economic power is vital.''
 Britain's onetime ambassador to Afghanistan, Mr. Sedwill has emerged as a major figure in the Western effort in the country. Since his arrival, the United States has stopped calling for the appointment of a high-level coordinator who would function as a civilian counterpart to General McChrystal.
 NATO's progress report was welcomed here, since the emphasis in many war-weary alliance members has shifted from the combat mission to turning Afghanistan back to its own people.
 Still, the Danish secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, pledged that foreign troops would continue to support Afghan soldiers long after they relinquished command. ''It will not be a pullout; it will not be a run for the exit,'' he said at a news conference. 
 NATO's commitment to the war has come under question in recent weeks. The alliance has fallen 450 people short of a goal to supply 2,000 trainers for the Afghan national police force by October. Afghanistan wants to expand its police force to 134,000 by October 2011, from 103,000 now.
 ''The gap matters,'' Mr. Sedwill said. ''We've got 100,000 troops there; we ought to be able to find 450.''
 The shortfall has been whittled down steadily, Mr. Rasmussen said, with Canada pledging to send 90 additional trainers. He said he was confident that NATO would be able to staff its training mission fully. The United States still supplies the large majority of police trainers.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the Obama administration was satisfied with NATO's contribution, which now comprises 10,000 soldiers, trainers and so-called mentors.
 ''We started off with a significant gap and we have narrowed it considerably,'' she said.
 Mrs. Clinton said she was optimistic that with the proper training, the Afghan security forces and the police could be counted on to take control. 
 ''Does that mean it will be smooth sailing?'' she said of the transfer. ''I don't think so. Look at Iraq.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton went out of her way to praise President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, with whom Washington's relations have recently been turbulent. She said he had an impossible job, and that his successes, like the greater number of Afghan girls now in school, were not as widely reported as his failures.
 Mr. Sedwill also defended Mr. Karzai, saying that his recent anti-Western outbursts reflected frustration with what Mr. Karzai viewed as the West's disregard for Afghanistan's sovereignty.
 ''They didn't invite us in,'' he said. ''To many Afghans, this is essentially us fighting our war for our reasons on their soil.''

HEADLINE: Running On Empty

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The election season is starting in earnest, and already one thing is crystal clear. Both the Democrats and the Republicans are hopeless. It seems inconceivable that either party can possibly win anything. This may be the year when the Whigs finally get to make their comeback.
 The whole world is expecting a cataclysm for the Democrats in November. After all, the economy is still a mess, and the party is still ... the party. In Illinois, which was first out of the box this season, the Democrats have already moved beyond the primary and into buyer's remorse. They've already dumped the voters' pick for lieutenant governor. This week, their question is whether they can get rid of their Senate nominee, Alexi Giannoulias, the son of a Chicago banking family, whose bank failed on Friday. 
 The Democratic disaster scenario would make absolute sense if it did not also require that the Republicans do something right. But in one state after another, they seem bent on nominating the worst possible candidate. The world is one big scavenger hunt, and their clue says, ''Find somebody unelectable.''
 In Connecticut, having driven Senator Chris Dodd from the race, the Republicans are racing into the corner of Linda McMahon, whose claim to fame is her role in exporting professional wrestling around the globe. In Florida, they got tired of having their popular governor, Charlie Crist, as the senate nominee even before they actually nominated him. Now Crist is expected to run as an independent, and the G.O.P. will try to live happily ever after with a conservative state legislator who has issues about his use of the party credit card.
 In Nevada, where Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, appeared to be hopelessly unpopular, the Republicans' favorite, Sue Lowden, got caught up in a controversy over whether she favors returning to the days when people paid their medical bills by giving the doctor a couple of chickens. This is truly not the sort of policy debate you want to use to jump-start a campaign. And Lowden has yet to explain how much poultry it would cost for a colonoscopy.
 The country may have moved to the right, but conservatives tend to underestimate the amount of blue that's still out there. The new Republican governor of Virginia seemed stunned that his state reacted badly to his call for a Confederate History Month that did not mention slavery. But really, the very definition of a purple state is a place where, when you devote an entire month to recalling the glories of the confederacy, you have to give some time to the bondage angle.
 In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, intended to take nothing for granted when it came to keeping the Republicans' hold on a Senate seat that's up for grabs this year. His first, and canniest, move was to force the incumbent, Jim Bunning, to retire. Bunning, a cranky ex-baseball player, barely won his last race when he got caught using a teleprompter during a debate and claimed that his opponent, an Italian-American doctor, looked like ''one of Saddam Hussein's sons.'' 
 For Bunning's successor, McConnell picked Trey Grayson, the secretary of state, who looks a little like a younger, larger Mitch McConnell. Unfortunately for the plan, Grayson is currently getting his clock cleaned by the Tea Party candidate, Rand Paul. 
 It is very hard to pick a favorite. Would you prefer the man endorsed by Mitch McConnell and Dick Cheney, or the one backed by Sarah Palin and Jim Bunning? I watched a Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce debate on Friday, and Grayson, who opposed wasteful earmarks, but not the good wholesome ones that come to Kentucky, kind of faded into the woodwork.
 It was the out-of-the-running candidates who were the attention-grabbers. There was a very large, genial man whose slogan was ''We need to make a U-turn to God,'' and a small, gnarled World War II veteran who called the president ''a would-be mullah of the most evil kind.'' This was Gurley Martin, and his answer to a question on cap-and-trade legislation was to croak out ''Horsefeathers! Horsefeathers! Horsefeathers!'' 
 If Paul holds on to his lead and wins the nomination, the Democrats -- who never really felt they had a prayer in Kentucky -- will take heart. Paul is going to be hampered by a general impression in many parts of the state that he is sort of strange. This may be because Grayson keeps running ads titled ''Rand Paul: Strange Ideas.''
 The Democratic nominee may be the lieutenant governor, Daniel Mongiardo, the same guy who Bunning called Saddam-like six years ago. If he and Paul are both the final candidates, it will be an all-physician Senate election. You do see more and more doctors in the political game. Perhaps they want to get out of the medical business before that payment-by-chicken thing kicks in. 
 Charles M. Blow and Bob Herbert are off today.

HEADLINE: A Popular U.S. Export: The $100 Bill

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
ONE of the most successful export businesses in the United States is run by the government, which produces a product for a small fraction of the price that people will pay for it. 
 That product is currency.
 This week, with much fanfare, the government announced a new $100 bill with features aimed at foiling counterfeiters.
 ''The blue 3-D Security Ribbon on the front of the new $100 note contains images of bells and 100s that move and change from one to the other as you tilt the note,'' the announcement said. ''The bell in the inkwell on the front of the note is another new security feature. The bell changes color from copper to green when the note is tilted, an effect that makes it seem to appear and disappear within the copper inkwell.''
 Some people may wonder why the government went to the effort. Most Americans never see a $100 bill.
 But if you think of currency as an export, $100 bills are where the business is. There is no sure way to know just how many bills are overseas, but what is known is that the total volume of United States currency outstanding rose by $34.7 billion in 2009. All but $3.3 billion of the increase was in $100 bills.
 The government's Web site offers materials explaining the features of the new bill in 25 languages, among them Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Uzbek and Vietnamese. The government has arrangements that allow banks around the world to have such notes in their vaults, ready to issue, without having to tie up bank capital until the notes are actually bought by customers.
 The market for dollar bills stems in part from tourism and in part from illicit use by drug smugglers. But a big part of the demand comes from the use of American currency in stores and at street vendors in many countries, including some in which citizens have little faith in their own currencies. 
 In that role, the dollar has a competitor, the euro. The European Central Bank is even more willing to appeal to those who want to have a lot of money in a small envelope, offering notes in denominations of 100, 200 and 500 euros. One euro is now worth about $1.33.
 The accompanying tables show the growth in outstanding amounts of currency since euro coins and bills were introduced at the beginning of 2002. There are still more dollars in notes outstanding than there are euros. But adjusted for the shifting exchange rates, the value of outstanding euro notes in circulation has exceeded the value of dollar notes since late 2006.
 The demand for euros, as well as dollars, is in the big notes. In 2009, the value of euro notes outstanding of 100 euros or more rose 6.3 percent, while smaller bills climbed only 4.9 percent. The dollar split was even sharper, with $100 bills rising 5 percent and smaller bills gaining only 1.5 percent. 
 That difference would be greater but for the greater reliance on coins in Europe. The smallest euro bill is for five euros, with coins worth one and two euros in broad circulation. In the United States, efforts to introduce dollar coins have met little success.

HEADLINE: CHINESE MILITARY SEEKS TO EXTEND ITS NAVAL POWER

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
YALONG BAY, China -- The Chinese military is seeking to project naval power well beyond the Chinese coast, from the oil ports of the Middle East to the shipping lanes of the Pacific, where the United States Navy has long reigned as the dominant force, military officials and analysts say.
 China calls the new strategy ''far sea defense,'' and the speed with which it is building long-range capabilities has surprised foreign military officials.
 The strategy is a sharp break from the traditional, narrower doctrine of preparing for war over the self-governing island of Taiwan or defending the Chinese coast. Now, Chinese admirals say they want warships to escort commercial vessels that are crucial to the country's economy, from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Strait of Malacca, in Southeast Asia, and to help secure Chinese interests in the resource-rich South and East China Seas. 
 In late March, two Chinese warships docked in Abu Dhabi, the first time the modern Chinese Navy made a port visit in the Middle East. 
 The overall plan reflects China's growing sense of self-confidence and increasing willingness to assert its interests abroad. China's naval ambitions are being felt, too, in recent muscle flexing with the United States: in March, Chinese officials told senior American officials privately that China would brook no foreign interference in its territorial issues in the South China Sea, said a senior American official involved in China policy. 
 The naval expansion will not make China a serious rival to American naval hegemony in the near future, and there are few indications that China has aggressive intentions toward the United States or other countries.
 But China, now the world's leading exporter and a giant buyer of oil and other natural resources, is also no longer content to trust the security of sea lanes to the Americans, and its definition of its own core interests has expanded along with its economic clout. 
 In late March, Adm. Robert F. Willard, the leader of the United States Pacific Command, said in Congressional testimony that recent Chinese military developments were ''pretty dramatic.'' China has tested long-range ballistic missiles that could be used against aircraft carriers, he said. After years of denials, Chinese officials have confirmed that they intend to deploy an aircraft carrier group within a few years. 
 China is also developing a sophisticated submarine fleet that could try to prevent foreign naval vessels from entering its strategic waters if a conflict erupted in the region, said Admiral Willard and military analysts. 
 ''Of particular concern is that elements of China's military modernization appear designed to challenge our freedom of action in the region,'' the admiral said.
 Yalong Bay, on the southern coast of Hainan island in the South China Sea, is the site of five-star beach resorts just west of a new underground submarine base. The base allows submarines to reach deep water within 20 minutes and roam the South China Sea, which has some of the world's busiest shipping lanes and areas rich in oil and natural gas that are the focus of territorial disputes between China and other Asian nations.
 That has caused concern not only among American commanders, but also among officials in Southeast Asian nations, which have been quietly acquiring more submarines, missiles and other weapons. ''Regional officials have been surprised,'' said Huang Jing, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore. ''We were in a blinded situation. We thought the Chinese military was 20 years behind us, but we suddenly realized China is catching up.''
 China is also pressing the United States to heed its claims in the region. In March, Chinese officials told two visiting senior Obama administration officials, Jeffrey A. Bader and James B. Steinberg, that China would not tolerate any interference in the South China Sea, now part of China's ''core interest'' of sovereignty, said an American official involved in China policy. It was the first time the Chinese labeled the South China Sea a core interest, on par with Taiwan and Tibet, the official said.
 Another element of the Chinese Navy's new strategy is to extend its operational reach beyond the South China Sea and the Philippines to what is known as the ''second island chain'' -- rocks and atolls out in the Pacific, the official said. That zone significantly overlaps the United States Navy's area of supremacy.
 Japan is anxious, too. Its defense minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, said in mid-April that two Chinese submarines and eight destroyers were spotted on April 10 heading between two Japanese islands en route to the Pacific, the first time such a large Chinese flotilla had been seen so close to Japan. When two Japanese destroyers began following the Chinese ships, a Chinese helicopter flew within 300 feet of one of the destroyers, the Japanese Defense Ministry said.
 Since December 2008, China has maintained three ships in the Gulf of Aden to contribute to international antipiracy patrols, the first deployment of the Chinese Navy beyond the Pacific. The mission allows China to improve its navy's long-range capabilities, analysts say.
 A 2009 Pentagon report estimated Chinese naval forces at 260 vessels, including 75 ''principal combatants'' -- major warships -- and more than 60 submarines. The report noted the building of an aircraft carrier, and said China ''continues to show interest'' in acquiring carrier-borne jet fighters from Russia. The United States Navy has 286 battle-force ships and 3,700 naval aircraft, though ship for ship the American Navy is considered qualitatively superior to the Chinese Navy.
 The Pentagon does not classify China as an enemy force. But partly in reaction to China's growth, the United States has recently transferred submarines from the Atlantic to the Pacific so that most of its nuclear-powered attack submarines are now in the Pacific, said Bernard D. Cole, a former American naval officer and a professor at the National War College in Washington.
 The United States has also begun rotating three to four submarines on deployments out of Guam, reviving a practice that had ended with the cold war, Mr. Cole said. 
 American vessels now frequently survey the submarine base at Hainan island, and that activity leads to occasional friction with Chinese ships. A survey mission last year by an American naval ship, the Impeccable, resulted in what Pentagon officials said was harassment by Chinese fishing vessels; the Chinese government said it had the right to block surveillance in those waters because they are an ''exclusive economic zone'' of China. 
 The United States and China have clashing definitions of such zones, defined by a United Nations convention as waters within 200 nautical miles of a coast. The United States says international law allows a coastal country to retain only special commercial rights in the zones, while China contends the country can control virtually any activity within them.
 Military leaders here maintain that the Chinese Navy is purely a self-defense force. But the definition of self-defense has expanded to encompass broad maritime and economic interests, two Chinese admirals contended in March.
 ''With our naval strategy changing now, we are going from coastal defense to far sea defense,'' Rear Adm. Zhang Huachen, deputy commander of the East Sea Fleet, said in an interview with Xinhua, the state news agency.
 ''With the expansion of the country's economic interests, the navy wants to better protect the country's transportation routes and the safetyof our major sea lanes,'' he added. ''In order to achieve this, the Chinese Navy needs to develop along the lines of bigger vessels and with more comprehensive capabilities.''
 The navy gets more than one-third of the overall Chinese military budget, ''reflecting the priority Beijing currently places on the navy as an instrument of national security,'' Mr. Cole said. China's official military budget for 2010 is $78 billion, but the Pentagon says China spends much more than that amount. Last year, the Pentagon estimated total Chinese military spending at $105 billion to $150 billion, still much less than what the United States spends on defense. For comparison, the Obama administration proposed $548.9 billion as the Pentagon's base operating budget for next year.
 The Chinese Navy's most impressive growth has been in its submarine fleet, said Mr. Huang, the scholar in Singapore. It recently built at least two Jin-class submarines, the first regularly active ones in the fleet with ballistic missile capabilities, and two more are under construction. Two Shang-class nuclear-powered attack submarines recently entered service.
 Countries in the region have responded with their own acquisitions, said Carlyle A. Thayer, a professor at the Australian Defense Force Academy. In December, Vietnam signed an arms deal with Russia that included six Kilo-class submarines, which would give Vietnam the most formidable submarine fleet in Southeast Asia. Last year, Malaysia took delivery of its first submarine, one of two ordered from France, and Singapore began operating one of two Archer-class submarines bought from Sweden. 
 Last fall, during a speech in Washington, Lee Kuan Yew, the former Singaporean leader, reflected widespread anxieties when he noted China's naval rise and urged the United States to maintain its regional presence. ''U.S. core interest requires that it remains the superior power on the Pacific,'' he said. ''To give up this position would diminish America's role throughout the world.''

HEADLINE: Greece and Who's Next?

 BODY:
As Greece careened ever close to default this week, frightened investors also rushed to dump bonds from financially troubled Portugal, Spain and Ireland. But while the markets increasingly see this as a euro zone crisis, many European leaders are in denial. 
 Unless the European Union and the International Monetary Fund back up Greece, it could default on its debts. And the roughly $40 billion bailout promised -- grudgingly -- by Brussels with an additional $15 billion to $20 billion from the International Monetary Fund is unlikely to be enough. Greece has more than $50 billion in debt coming due over the next 12 months alone. 
 Meanwhile, Germany is resisting turning over the money. After George Papandreou, the prime minister of Greece, called on Friday for the bailout plan to be ''activated,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Greece first had to negotiate ''a credible savings program.'' Georg Nuesslein, a lawmaker in Merkel's governing coalition, told Bloomberg the program ''has to hurt.'' 
 Greece's efforts to curtail public spending have not made enough of a dent in its deficit to persuade investors it can bring its debt under control. But amid a severe recession, which is likely to be exacerbated by budget cuts, even the tightest belt-tightening can't eliminate a deficit that amounted to more than 13 percent of its gross domestic product last year.
 To stop a rout, the European Union must commit to activating the bailout. Then Europe and the International Monetary Fund must start negotiations with Greece for a much bigger bailout package. This would help restore investors' confidence, allowing interest rates on its debt to fall from the punitive heights of nearly 9 percent reached last week. While some economists believe Greece would still have to restructure its debts, it would have space to negotiate the terms. 
 As investors made clear this week, the turmoil doesn't end with Greece. Portugal, Spain and Ireland have seen their deficits balloon as the housing bust and the economic downturn took a toll. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund must put together a pre-emptive bailout package to convince investors of the stability of their finances and head off a flight to dump their bonds on a bigger scale. Speed is essential. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and European finance ministers should start working on that during this weekend's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington. This is mainly a European problem. But Washington must ensure that the fund commits adequate resources. The good news, if there is any here, is that American banks do not own much Greek debt. But the American economy won't be immune if the Greek crisis spreads much further.

HEADLINE: Flood Plan Back, for Now

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
The National Flood Insurance Program is back in business, at least until May 31.
 Late last week, President Obama signed legislation that, in addition to extending additional unemployment benefits, also provided a temporary extension of the federal flood insurance program until May 31. 
 According to the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America association, the retroactive extension means that ''in theory'' the program will return to normal operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees the program, said the program returned to normal operations last Friday. In addition, renewals will be effective from the date of the application. Meanwhile, for new policies, the required 30-day waiting period before new policies take effect will begin on the date an application was submitted rather than on the date the program returned to normal operations.
 ''This reauthorization will allow for policies to continue to be issued or renewed,'' said Brad Carroll, a spokesman for FEMA. ''Individuals who were seeking to renew their policies or purchase a new policy during the period between March 28 and April 15 may now proceed with their purchase. Existing policies were not impacted by the lapse in Congressional authorization and continue uninterrupted.''
 Congress had left for recess at the end of March without renewing the program, which was set to expire on March 28. As a result, the program was suspended from March 28 until this latest temporary extension (the program has been temporarily extended a number of times in recent years as Congress tries to work out disagreements over what it should look like in the future).
 During the latest suspension period, mortgage buyers and some lenders said those seeking to buy homes in flood zones could still get a mortgage as long as they provided certain proof that they had applied for flood insurance.
 Still, some trying to buy homes in flood zones said getting mortgages during the extension wasn't that easy, or even possible, in practice. According to this Associated Press article, thousands of people were affected by the temporary suspension.
 How has the extension of the program affected you, if at all?
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Illinois: Bank Owned By Candidate's Family Is Shut

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Friday shut down the bank owned by the family of State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, setting up an expected but daunting hurdle in his bid to keep the Senate seat once held by Barack Obama in Democratic hands. Broadway Bank, which was heavy into real estate loans and lost $75 million last year, had been given until Monday to raise about $85 million in new capital. But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced at the close of business Friday that Broadway was among seven banks, all in Illinois, that had failed. Mr. Giannoulias, 34, worked at the bank as a senior loan officer until he ran for treasurer four years ago. He has tried to take some of the political and public relations sting out of a collapse, acknowledging that the bank was likely to fail but blaming the bad economy. His Republican opponent, Representative Mark Kirk, has made the bank's finances a central issue in their Senate race.

HEADLINE: With Impact Investing, a Focus on More Than Returns

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The very phrase ''impact investing'' sounds rapacious, but it is an emerging hybrid of philanthropy and private equity that proponents say is about to become more widespread. It is also something that has some very rich people intrigued. 
 ''It's filling the space in between this historical space around philanthropy -- charitable giving to fight poverty and alleviate misery -- and the traditional investing space that is return-driven,'' said Julia Sze, director of investments at Wells Fargo Family Wealth, who ran an impact investing conference in San Francisco on Thursday. 
 More often, impact investing is described by what it is not. It does not work in the same way as socially responsible investing, which excludes areas a person does not want to invest in -- like tobacco or guns -- through a simple screening process. Impact investing focuses more on bringing about change -- helping the working poor in India buy a home, for instance.
 While most of the money is going into areas like helping to reduce poverty and improving the climate, it is not philanthropy. Investors expect at least a return of their capital with an adjustment for inflation and, in many cases, a lot more than that. 
 And while microlending is a part of it, impact investing is different from what is offered by Web sites like Kiva. With minimum investments often around $1 million, it is also more sophisticated. In addition, these investors have a defined plan to sell their investments after a specific amount of time. 
 I came to think of impact investing as a private equity fund for social change. This may sound like an oxymoron, given the criticism that private equity funds have faced recently over their management of companies they have taken private. But the structure is similar: there are three or four capital calls in the first year, and the fund is not fully invested until the fourth year. As the end of its investment period nears, the fund then starts to look for ways to sell its investments. Doing good matters to investors, but they also hope for private equitylike returns of close to 20 percent a year. 
 And like private equity, these investments are illiquid and can be risky. Because the area is so new, the funds lack the traditional track records and transparency. 
 For this reason, many of the people interested in impact investing are focused on more than the returns. 
 ''I think we have to look at investment as a positive tool in advancing human goals,'' said Chris Redlich, who sold his family's company, the Marine Terminals Corporation, in 2007. 
 He has taken $10 million, or about 1 percent of his net worth, and started to invest it in a series of funds. One fund is run by Grassroots Capital and makes traditional microfinance investments. Another is a fund focused on affordable housing in India. A third concentrates on energy technology in China. 
 As for returns, Mr. Redlich said he expected his children and grandchildren to reap the benefits from what he was doing now. He is also realistic about the pros and cons of what he is doing. ''With each dollar, you have to understand both the positive side -- building up societies -- and the dark side -- the impact of industrial growth is significant. We have Superfund sites today where people didn't think what they were doing was a bad thing at the time.'' 
 The glow of doing a social good mixed with high returns would seem attractive to high-net-worth individuals. But impact investing is still in its infancy. The Global Impact Investing Network, a nonprofit group, said that current impact investments amounted to about $50 billion. It projects this area to grow to $500 billion by 2014, putting it at roughly 1 percent of all managed assets. 
 ''I think the tipping point is now,'' said Camilla Seth, director of programs and operations. ''This activity has been happening for 10 years but investors have been insulated.''
 Not all agree that a boom is upon us. John Skjervem, chief investment officer of Northern Trust, said his firm had long been prepared for the boom in socially responsible and impact investing but it had yet to materialize. ''Impact investing hasn't made much of an impact yet, but we're ready for it,'' he said. ''There still isn't sufficient awareness of it.'' 
 He said his group managed $150 billion, of which $200 million was focused on impact investing. But for the few clients who are interested in this, it is important. 
 One of the main reasons for the slow growth is the lack of basic investing information. The Global Impact Investing Network is trying to remedy this. It has created standards to measure what a recipient says it is doing. ''If an investor is trying to create jobs, the question is, 'How do I create more jobs?' '' Ms. Seth said. ''Everyone was measuring it in a different way. We want a job to be a job to be a job.'' She said the network had also built a reporting platform to track how investments were accomplishing their goals.
 Growth has also been slowed because making a meaningful impact investment is more difficult than putting together a traditional socially responsible investment. ''Years ago, it was just easy,'' said Steven Soja, a director at Credit Suisse Private Bank in San Francisco. ''You took out the sin stocks, the tobacco, the pornography and other things you didn't like.'' 
 Most investors need to have a net worth of at least $10 million to participate in a meaningful way in impact investing. And then they expect sizable returns for their commitment. Mr. Soja said many of his clients have shown more interest in investing in renewable energy and biofuel funds as a way to bring about change. 
 For Mr. Redlich, though, the goal is different. ''I think investment improves the quality of life around the world,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, I already have enough money. I'm not chasing yield to be wealthier. I'm chasing yield to improve society in a more capitalistic way.''

HEADLINE: Former Employees Criticize Culture of Rating Firms

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former executives at Moody's and Standard & Poor's offered damaging critiques on Friday of the practices at the two credit rating agencies during the run-up to the financial crisis. 
 In testimony before a Senate panel, four former officials said that competitive pressures and conflicts of interest were allowed to undermine accurate, fair and unbiased ratings of complex securities that Wall Street sold to investors.
 Perhaps the most riveting testimony came from Eric Kolchinsky, a former managing director at Moody's who for most of 2007 oversaw the ratings of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. 
 ''The vast majority of the analysts at Moody's are honest individuals who try hard to do their jobs,'' Mr. Kolchinsky said. ''However, the incentives in the market for rating agency services favored, and still favor, short-term profits over credit quality.'' 
 Mr. Kolchinsky added: ''It was an unspoken understanding that loss of market share would cause a manager to lose his or her job.'' He said he was suspended after warning in September 2007 that a batch of securities ''being hyper-aggressively pushed by the bankers'' had been given a rating that was too high because it was based on 2006 ratings that were about to be downgraded. 
 ''I believe that to assign new ratings based on assumptions which I knew to be wrong would constitute securities fraud,'' Mr. Kolchinsky said. 
 Another witness, Richard Michalek, a lawyer who joined Moody's in 1999 and lost his job at the end of 2007, said the culture at the organization deteriorated after Moody's was spun off from Dun and Bradstreet in 2000.
 ''As the culture and the pressures of work increased with the increased deal flow between 2003 and 2007, it was clear that survival -- in a culture that favored and was dominated by quantity over quality -- required modifying one's approach, even if it meant lowering one's standards,'' Mr. Michalek said.
 Arturo Cifuentes, whom Mr. Michalek called a former mentor at Moody's, testified that the rating agencies had misjudged the quality of the subprime mortgages that backed the securities they rated, as well as the risk associated with repackaging the loans.
 Moody's failed to adjust the ratings on older securities after introducing new standards. ''The fact that the rating agencies kept on issuing ratings and collecting fees, as if nothing had happened, is shameful,'' said Mr. Cifuentes, now a finance professor at the University of Chile.
 Frank L. Raiter, who retired from S.&P. in 2005 as head of its residential mortgage rating group, said a failure of regulatory oversight led managers to ''believe that the increasing revenues and profits they were enjoying were the result of superior management skill and insight rather than the oligopoly granted them'' by regulators and by low interest rates.
 The panel, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, also heard from three current managing directors at the two rating agencies; from Kathleen A. Corbet, who was president of S.&P.'from 2004 to 2007; and from Raymond W. McDaniel Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Moody's.

HEADLINE: Gas Drilling Is Severely Restricted in Catskill Watershed Supplying New York City

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
New York State environmental officials announced on Friday that they would impose far stricter regulations on a controversial type of natural gas drilling in the upstate area that supplies most of New York City's drinking water, making it highly unlikely that any drilling would be done there.
 Although they did not impose an outright ban on drilling, state officials said that any natural gas company would have to conduct a separate environmental impact review for each well it proposed to drill in the Catskills watershed, which supplies the city. 
 Those rules also apply to the smaller Skaneateles Lake watershed, which supplies drinking water to Syracuse and some other communities.
 In other areas, companies would face a far less cumbersome permit process that would rely on the state's own environmental assessment of where drilling can be allowed. 
 New York City officials and environmentalists had vigorously opposed the drilling, citing concern about the disposal of wastewater from the drilling and the danger of leaks into groundwater and deep aquifers. 
 The gas companies planned to rely on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, which involves blasting water mixed with chemicals into rock at high pressure to extract the gas. 
 With the New York City water issue shelved, state officials clearly hope to put the controversy behind them. They said they expect to release their final regulations on hydraulic fracturing by the end of the year, having solicited more than 14,000 comments from the public. 
 The decision by the State Department of Environmental Conservation also means that New York City will not have to worry about spending billions of dollars on a filtration plant to protect its water supply from possible contamination by the drilling. 
 City officials welcomed the announcement. ''The additional reviews that D.E.C. has mandated will ensure that the specific and cumulative impacts in the New York City and Syracuse watersheds are understood, and that these unique landscapes are fully protected, as a prerequisite to any drilling activity,'' said Cas Holloway, commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. 
 He said the decision ''recognizes that protecting New York's water supplies must be our top priority.''
 The two areas lie within the Marcellus Shale region, a subterranean layer of rock stretching from New York to Tennessee believed to be one of the world's biggest natural gas fields.
 The Catskills watershed supplies drinking water to 8.2 million people in New York City and about one million people in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties. The Skaneateles Lake watershed serves about 200,000 people in Syracuse and elsewhere.
 While the prospect of drilling stirred deep opposition in New York City and nearby counties, it drew support from many upstate residents who argued that the benefits would far outweigh any risks, given the weakness of the economy.
 The conservation department's commissioner, Alexander B. Grannis, said that landowners' property rights had weighed heavily in the decision not to issue a ban on drilling in the two watersheds. He said that about 70 percent of the property in the watershed is privately owned and that a ban would have undoubtedly brought lawsuits from owners deprived of lucrative leasing deals with gas companies.
 ''At the end of the day, an outright ban risks very substantial litigation,'' he said. 
 Instead, the department decided to add more scrutiny to any potential application to drill in the two areas, he said. 
 But while the well-by-well environmental reviews will be a deterrent to the drilling, environmental groups were not claiming victory. Kate Sinding, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said nothing but a ban would ensure that gas companies do not exploit the watersheds in the future. 
 ''If they get into the shale and find it productive, they're going to knock on the door of the watershed,'' she said. The two watershed areas account for less than 10 percent of the shale, state officials said. Bowing to public pressure, the Chesapeake Energy Corporation said last October that it would stay away from the New York City watershed despite holding leases that would have allowed it to pursue state permits to drill there.
 Jim Smith, a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, called the state's regulatory stance ''excessive and unnecessary.'' 
 But he said that there was ''not a lot of interest in the watershed from companies'' at this point at any rate.
 State officials said the two watersheds presented additional concerns that had nothing to do with the safety of the drilling, like pollution from increased truck traffic related to the drilling operations.
 By omitting the two watersheds, they said, they will be able to focus on the overall environmental safety of drilling. 
 ''Originally, we thought it'd make sense to address all of this at once,'' said Stuart Gruskin, executive deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation. 
 ''We acknowledge that there's a separate subset of issues that are independent of the safety of hydrofracking,'' he said. ''It's better to leave those issues out of it.''
 The Department of Environmental Conservation came under intense pressure after issuing draft regulations governing the drilling last year. New York City officials pushed to have the regulations withdrawn after commissioning a study that showed drilling could damage infrastructure, including aqueducts.
 And in formal comments last December, the federal Environmental Protection Agencytold state officials that it had major concerns about how the proposed drilling would affect public health and the environment. 
 The agency did not specifically call for a ban on drilling in watershed areas, but said it had ''serious reservations about whether gas drilling in the New York City watershed is consistent with the vision of long-term maintenance of a high-quality unfiltered water supply.''

HEADLINE: Hearing on Limits For Vendors Gets Creative Response

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When the city's artists are fuming, they create. And when the focus of their rage is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his efforts to crack down on selling art in parks, a new genre is born.
 There, on Friday, was the mayor in all varieties: Bloomberg the Barbarian, a muscle-bound mayor with sword and helmet; Bloomberg the Stalinist, a frowning mayor lost in a fiery red sea; Bloomberg the Billionaire, with dollar signs for eyes.
 More than 100 street vendors who ply their trade in the parks filled the Chelsea Recreation Center for a public hearing on Friday and, one by one, told the city why it should drop a proposal that would cut their ranks by 75 percent. The new rules would limit the number of vendors that could operate in Battery Park, High Line Park, Union Square Park and in high-traffic areas of Central Park. 
 The battle has proved contentious partly because it forces New Yorkers to choose between two cherished urban ideals: the serenity of its scarce greenery and a thriving and eclectic art scene.
 The city maintains that street vendors have proliferated so rapidly that they pose a safety hazard on many sidewalks and park paths. Vendors say that slashing their numbers amounts to trampling on their First Amendment rights.
 On Friday, those tensions were on full display. Before the hearing, sponsored by the Department of Parks and Recreation, about 200 people gathered outside the recreation center to protest, many wearing shirts saying ''Artist Power!''
 ''A park without art is like eating spaghetti without spaghetti sauce,'' said Aleksandar Milenkovic, 35, who sells oil pastels in Union Square.
 But Michael K. Burke, vice president of Statue Cruises, which operates tour boats around Manhattan, said the rules were long overdue. He unrolled jumbo-size photos of crowds swarming near the company's docks in Lower Manhattan to emphasize his point. 
 ''The public are entitled to freely enjoy their park in a safe and secure environment,'' he said, as the artists booed loudly.
 The rules would limit the number of vendors of ''expressive matter,'' which includes items like photos, paintings and books, in congested areas of four parks. The city estimates that more than 300 vendors sell such items at the parks. The new regulations would reduce that to 81. Artists would secure space on a first-come-first-served basis.
 Much of the debate on Friday revolved around the question of how to define an artist. 
 Some say the new rules should apply only to those who are in the business of reselling certain items, like a Barack Obama refrigerator magnet or a Tolstoy novel. They argue that artists who create original work -- a photo of the Empire State Building or a miniature sculpture of the Statue of Liberty, for example -- should be free to sell where they please.
 Henry J. Stern, a former parks department commissioner, said that over the past three decades, the city's parks had been overtaken by vendors offering ''canned'' work. ''I don't think that even John Lennon would want his picture sold at 100 different places in the park,'' he said. 
 Many businesses and park advocacy groups have rallied behind the city's efforts because they contend that vendors are marring the tranquillity of some of the city's most popular gathering spots. 
 ''We don't want to make a mall of our parks,'' said Rita Denowitz, a retiree who lives on the Upper East Side and volunteers in parks. 
 Elizabeth Lorris Ritter, a member of Community Board 12 in northern Manhattan, said a resident's right to peace and quiet should come first. 
 ''In a city of eight million, no one's right to anything is absolutely to the exclusion of someone else's right,'' Ms. Lorris Ritter said.
 Melissa Mark-Viverito, a City Council member, said the proposal lacked ''any real, equitable system'' for awarding vendors a spot. She suggested a system of distributing permits through lottery.
 Parks officials said they would review the comments from Friday's hearing before deciding whether to move forward with the restrictions. 
 With the economy still ailing, artists said the new rules would create an unfair financial burden.
 ''If you're going to steal people's livelihoods, you should offer some alternative,'' said Michael Murray, 37, a photographer from Brooklyn. He suggested that the city create a special market for artists who produce their own work.
 ''There has to be some regulation,'' Mr. Murray said. ''But these limits are too drastic.''

HEADLINE: Signs of Life for Mideast Peace Talks

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- The American envoy to the Middle East, George J. Mitchell, planned to meet on Friday with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, a sign that indirect Israeli-Palestinian peace talks may be getting back on track, officials from all three parties said. 
 In advance of encounters with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and, separately, with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, Mr. Mitchell met on Friday with the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, Reuters reported, but no details of the discussions were made public.
 The talks with the two leaders had been expected to begin last month but were delayed after Israel announced plans to build 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians hope to build their capital. The Palestinians and President Obama were furious at the announcement, made during a visit to Israel by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the Americans made a number of demands of Israel aimed at restoring the negotiations. 
 The specific demands have been kept secret, but it is clear that they involve assurances that further announcements for building in East Jerusalem would not be made in the coming months and that Israel would agree to allow substantive topics, like Jerusalem, borders and refugees, to be discussed in the American-brokered indirect talks rather than insist that they wait for the direct negotiations expected to evolve from them. 
 Israel has not offered a formal response to the Obama administration, but officials indicated that enough understandings had been reached that indirect talks may start in coming weeks. 
 Officials from all three parties said the sides were drawing closer to the prospect of starting talks. 
 Mr. Netanyahu has stated publicly on a number of occasions that he would not freeze all Jewish building in East Jerusalem, as the Palestinians have been demanding. But he instructed all ministries involved in Jerusalem housing to provide his office with relevant plans, apparently to prevent progress on such building from being announced or approved in a way that could derail the negotiation process. 
 He has also made clear that a number of other concessions would be forthcoming, notably improving conditions for the Palestinian economy through eased access of movement in the occupied West Bank, and perhaps increasing the area of responsibility of Palestinian security forces there. 
 ''We want to get these negotiations started, but what we don't want is to suddenly see more bulldozers and settlements in Jerusalem,'' Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said by telephone. 
 He said President Abbas needed to hear from Mr. Mitchell directly Friday on what was offered before any decision on the proximity talks could be made. But his tone indicated greater optimism than in recent weeks. 
 It seemed likely, nonetheless, that it would be some weeks before the fate of the talks was decided.

HEADLINE: C. K. Prahalad, 68, Proponent of the Poor as Consumers

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
C. K. Prahalad, a management professor and author who popularized the idea that companies could make money while helping to alleviate poverty, died Friday in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. He was 68 and lived in San Diego.
 The cause was an undiagnosed lung illness, his family said. 
 Mr. Prahalad wrote ''The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits,'' about how companies could tap the poor as customers and, as a result, improve the lives of millions of impoverished people in developing countries.
 His work on poverty, and earlier on how companies should build ''core competence,'' earned him a loyal following in corporate boardrooms around the world, especially in India. Though he had lived in the United States for more than 40 years, he traveled frequently to India to advise corporate executives and political leaders.
 Anand Mahindra, chairman of a Mumbai-based business conglomerate, Mahindra & Mahindra, said Indian executives flocked to listen to Mr. Prahalad, who pushed them to be more adventurous in expanding their companies overseas and at home.
 ''He would say, 'I just don't believe you guys have enough ambition,' '' Mr. Mahindra said in a telephone interview. ''It had to do with his patriotism, his very, very deep desire to see Indian brands and companies succeed.''
 Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad was born in the south Indian city of Coimbatore on Aug. 8, 1941. His mother was a homemaker and his father was a judge and prominent labor rights lawyer who wrote several books about Hindu philosophy. 
 In the early 1970s, Mr. Prahalad came to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree in management at Harvard Business School. After earning his degree, Mr. Prahalad moved back to India in 1975 but he arrived just as Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, was declaring emergency rule and suspending many civil rights. 
 ''As a patriotic person, my father believed that is not what India represented,'' his son, Murali, said. Two years later, ''they made a very tough choice to return to the United States.''
 He became a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, where he taught until his death, traveling regularly from California.
 Mr. Prahalad had established a reputation as a formidable business strategist when he started his work on poverty in 1995, according to the preface of ''Bottom of the Pyramid.'' His daughter, Deepa, said her father was concerned about the lopsidedness of growth in India, which had begun loosening government control over its economy in the early 1990s -- something that he had long advocated.
 ''India was starting to see some examples that money could be made and consumers could be tapped,'' she said. ''What concerned him was that the focus in developing countries was often on the middle class and upper class.''
 In the book, he focused on initiatives that he believed had succeeded in reducing poverty. One example was e-Choupal, a project started by the Indian tobacco, food and hotel conglomerate, ITC. The company provided computers to farmers so they could check the prices of soya beans and other commodities in various markets, and compare them with the prices ITC was offering. Doing so raised farmers' incomes and reduced ITC's costs because it did not have to use middlemen.
 Executives and scholars say his research helped encourage companies to serve poor customers with products like small-size pouches of shampoo and low-cost cellphone service. 
 In recent months, he was researching new management styles emerging in nations like India and China and how to assure that the economic rise of people in developing countries could be managed in an environmentally sustainable way, his daughter said.
 In addition to his wife, daughter and son, Mr. Prahalad is survived by three grandchildren, a brother and a sister.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rays of Hope For Job Hunters

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR the first time in two years, many job seekers may have reason to feel hopeful. Employers are beginning to hire again -- or at least think about it. 
 Although the unemployment rate remained at 9.7 percent in March, and many economists expect the rate to stay high for some time, there are now some very positive signs. And they go well beyond other government figures showing that employers added 162,000 nonfarm jobs for the month.
 The shift is most apparent in job postings, which have begun to surge. Indeed.com, which collects job listings from thousands of sources, reported a 19 percent increase in postings in March, versus the same month last year. 
 The number of postings rose in 10 of 12 industry categories. (The only category that declined was health care, one of the few bright spots during the recession.) The industries that showed the biggest uptick in March openings were retail, up 42 percent; hospitality, 33 percent; and media and newspapers, 30 percent.
 ''The opportunities are growing fast,'' said Paul Forster, chief executive of Indeed.com, which culls its information from sources like corporate Web sites, newspaper classified ads and job boards. Granted, the increases are coming from a low base, he said, but they are still encouraging. 
 Recruiters are also seeing signs of life in hiring. For one thing, said Bill Driscoll, New England district president for the recruiting firm Robert Half, ''There are more people going to work on a temporary basis than there were six months or nine months ago.'' That's often a sign that permanent hires are not far behind, he said.
 The job market is still very competitive, he added. While companies are hiring more people on a permanent basis, he said, those decisions are strategic and cautious.
 Regional differences are stark. Indeed.com says jobs per unemployed person are most plentiful in Washington, D.C., followed by San Jose, Calif., Baltimore and New York. On the other hand, among 50 metropolitan areas, job seekers in Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and Sacramento face the most competition. 
 Economists have been using the phrase ''jobless recovery'' to describe how this upturn will play out, and the Obama administration says that for the nation as a whole, high unemployment is likely to linger a while. 
 Still, the current outlook is a contrast to the deep gloom of 2008 and 2009. Companies' profit reports, recent retail sales, manufacturing and other data are generally improving. At some point, businesses will have more work than workers, and will need to hire.
 Tamara Erickson, an author and work-force consultant, said the recession masked a long-term trend that will intensify: a worker shortage caused by the continuing retirement of baby boomers. 
 Suddenly, she said, employers are starting to realize that they don't have, or won't have, people with the skills they need. Some are starting to worry, she said, while others ''have no idea what's going to hit them.'' 
 Her advice to job seekers? ''Cheer up,'' she said. ''The real possibility of finding a job that you'll like is increasing every day.'' 
 The new picture is likely to affect both those who are employed and those who aren't, as well as businesses that will be in the unfamiliar position of having to hire -- and of wondering whether they can retain their best workers.
 Many people have stayed in jobs they dislike -- and that became more stressful as they took on the work of laid-off colleagues -- because they fear that there is no alternative. 
 Others took jobs that weren't a good fit because the market was so competitive, said Barbara Safani, owner of Career Solvers, a career management firm in New York. Now, some of these people will start to look again. 
 At first, these factors will mean more competition for the unemployed, she said. But, eventually, the situation should bring more opportunities for everyone: as those who are already employed move to new jobs, there will be a ripple effect of openings.
 People can be more confident in finding the right career fit, Ms. Safani said, and they shouldn't let doubts about their worth in the marketplace, aggravated by the recession, hold them back. 
 SOME employers have been lulled into complacency by the recession, Ms. Erickson said: ''They haven't been thinking about a talent shortage for two years now.''
 The onus is now on companies to make sure they keep their most valued workers, Mr. Forster said.
 The most vulnerable companies may well be the ones that maintain recession-era staffing while taking on recovery-era work. These companies will demand more from their employees without offering much in return. 
 ''Employers want to be very cognizant of how they're engaging their current employees,'' Ms. Safani said. They need to reward their workers, monetarily or otherwise, she said, or risk seeing them walk out the door.

 BODY:
FLANNERY: A Life of Flannery O'Connor, by Brad Gooch (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $16.99.) This ''big, calm, gentlemanly biography,'' as Joy Williams described it in the Book Review, is the first major life of O'Connor, who died in 1964 at age 39. Relying on letters and interviews, Gooch meticulously reconstructs the sedate life of a writer whose novels and stories were anything but. 
 CLOSING TIME: A Memoir, by Joe Queenan. (Penguin, $16.) Queenan's unsentimental story of growing up poor and Irish in Philadelphia in the 1950s and '60s is dominated by his relationship with his violent, alcoholic father. Books (as well as growing to be six feet tall) offer an escape, but, Queenan writes, ''every idea I assimilated furnished yet another tool to aid me in my flight from my father's economic class.'' Although Queenan supported his father in his old age, ''I did not have it in me to forgive him.'' A different kind of troubled father inhabits A POCKET HISTORY OF SEX IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: A Memoir, by Jane Vandenburgh (Counterpoint, $15.95). A bisexual architect, he killed himself by jumping off a building; his wife retreated into schizophrenia. Vandenburgh and her brothers were raised by their aunt and by one another, and she finds herself on the brink of adolescence on the brink of the sexual revolution. Our reviewer, Alison Bechdel, admired Vandenburgh's ability ''to wring this kind of coherence from life's chaos.'' Said Sayrafiezadeh's Iranian-born father was a ''leading comrade'' in the Socialist Workers Party; he left Said and his mother when the boy was a baby. In WHEN SKATEBOARDS WILL BE FREE: A Memoir(Dial, $15), Sayrafiezadeh describes growing up with his long-suffering mother ''in a world of gloom and doom,'' buffeted by his parents' passionate politics and his desire to be a typical American boy. In The Times, Dwight Garner praised this ''exacting and finely made first book'' for its ''delicacy and discernment.'' 
 THE OTHER SIDE OF DESIRE: Four Journeys Into the Far Realms of Lust and Longing, by Daniel Bergner (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.99.) Bergner introduces us to a devoted husband with a foot fetish, a fashion maven who's a sadist, a man who is sexually attracted to his young stepdaughter and an advertising executive who lusts after amputees. Bergner, a contributing writer for The Times Magazine, combines a novelist's storytelling ability and ''a journalist's skill at standing back and letting his subjects speak for themselves,'' Lori Gottlieb said in the Book Review. After reading the book, she added, ''I'm no longer sure where normal ends and abnormal begins.'' 
 AS THEY SEE 'EM: A Fan's Travels in the Land of Umpires, by Bruce Weber. (Scribner, $16.) In this ''wonderfully detailed look at the craft of umpiring,'' as our reviewer, Jim Bouton, put it, Weber attended the Academy of Professional Umpiring (a ''combination vocational school and boot camp'') and met the students who aspire, against long odds, to become major-league umpires. Weber, a reporter for The Times, eventually worked behind the plate in a major-league spring training intrasquad game. The book gave Bouton ''a new appreciation for the men in blue,'' he said. Umpires had little power during the early days of baseball; instead, a local dignitary would be asked to sit near home plate to ensure that games were honorably played. These and other glimpses of the evolving game (until the appearance of the fastball in the 1860s, pitches were intentionally easy to hit) are served up by Peter Morris in BUT DIDN'T WE HAVE FUN?: An Informal History of Baseball's Pioneer Era, 1843-1870(Ivan R. Dee, $16.95). 
 THE MARRIAGE-GO-ROUND: The State of Marriage and the Family in America Today, by Andrew J. Cherlin. (Vintage, $16.) This provocative overview by a sociologist analyzes changes in family life and compares Americans' relationship experience with that of people in other industrial countries. Marriages in the United States are the most unstable; although Americans idealize marriage, we aren't good at it. (By age 35, for example, 10 percent of American women have lived with three or more husbands or domestic partners.) Unstable relationships are found throughout NOTHING RIGHT: Short Stories, by Antonya Nelson (Bloomsbury, $14). The characters in these 11 stories really can do nothing right, especially strong women who put their trust in weak men. Adultery, the power struggles of family life and the lure of alcohol all appear here, presented with insight, grim humor and fluid writing. 
 THE FOOD OF A YOUNGER LAND,edited by Mark Kurlansky. (Riverhead, $16.) In the late 1930s, the Federal Writers' Project sent participants around the country to report on topics like New York soda-luncheonette slang and Minnesota lutefisk. The planned book was a casualty of World War II, and the contributions remained in the Library of Congress until Kurlansky culled and collated them. The collection reveals both how much American food has changed and how much it hasn't; complaints about standardization abound. ''Wandering through these pages is like canvassing food blogs,'' Jonathan Miles wrote in the Book Review, finding wheat and chaff alike. A contemporary take on the ''food blog as book'' genre is A HOMEMADE LIFE: Stories and Recipes From My Kitchen Table,by Molly Wizenberg. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) Wizenberg, the creator of the blog Orangette, mixes recipes and personal history in posting-length chapters.

My darling granddaughter will soon read from the Torah at her brother's bar mitzvah. She modeled the dress that she intends to wear to the synagogue for me. It is so short that you could describe it, not in inches above her knees, but in millimeters beneath her hips. I'm afraid that she will be the subject of much conversation -- none of it having to do with her reading. The dress is completely inappropriate. Her parents think this is funny; I do not. What's a grandmother to do? 
 Anonymous 
 Well, Nana, that depends on how you feel about Mother's Day, which is just around the corner.
 I've long said (or was it Cole Porter?): ''In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking.'' Nowadays, we're lucky if the kids wear underpants -- which is where I might draw the line with the micro-mini.
 It doesn't sound as if your grandchildren are being raised by wolves, and you seem to have weighed in on Dress-gate already. If not, take your son or daughter aside and calmly -- I repeat, calmly -- say: ''I'm concerned that Janie's dress is not appropriate for temple. Will you think it over?''
 Otherwise, better to bear your shame in silence. If you make a Jerry Bruckheimer production out of this (or other harmless matters), you'll go down as a controlling mother and the granny no one wants to visit.
 Don't let the hemline spoil your day, or theirs. Remember: A little boy is becoming a man -- and a girl, quite possibly, a hussy. (Only kidding!) So, mazel tov!
 Thank You. No, Thank YOU.
 I recently celebrated a birthday and received a lovely gift from a close friend. I haven't written her a thank-you note. I know: completely unacceptable. But her birthday is a few weeks before mine, and I never received a thank-you note for the gift I gave her. I didn't take offense. But I'm afraid that my thank-you note would be received with embarrassment instead of gratitude, as if I'm pointing out her lapse in manners. What should I do?
 R.K., New York City
 It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's Rationalization Man!
 I applaud your sensitivity, R.K., but fear that you may be verging into excuse-making territory. Like Superman's ability to fly, yours is a power that should be used only for good -- and not to justify laziness or cutting the line at Gristedes.
 Your impulse is to write the note; hence the guilt. So write it, already. We can't let others dictate what's right for us to do. Can you imagine the chaos in the subway if we did?
 It wouldn't be the worst thing for your pal to rethink her relationship to thank-you notes, either. If yours does that, and your friend calls, embarrassed by her lapse, just take her off the hook. Try: ''Don't give it another thought. You thanked me when I gave it to you.''
 Odds are, you'll receive a sweet note the next time around. Win-win, right?
 No Boos From the Pews
 My fiance and I are planning a small wedding, and we've reached a point of contention over whether to invite a good friend of mine who has had some issues with my fiance and openly disapproves of my choice of mate. My fiance believes we should invite only people with whom we both want to share our special day, while I think any person who is important to either of us should receive an invitation. Who is correct?
 Anonymous, New Jersey
 Welcome to wedded bliss, sweetie.
 Try not to think of it as a cage match, with bloodied losers and gold-belted winners, but as a lifelong negotiation with horse-trading, blackballing and special ''Get Out of Jail'' cards -- like game night at ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
 Ordinarily, I'd suggest a compromise: use your fiance's two scoops of lovin' as the general rule for admission, with a small number of free passes for either of you to use, unilaterally. But I'm afraid the friend you propose inviting, who's throwing stink bombs even as you walk the aisle, has no place at your wedding.
 So here's a new rule: No one who hates anyone in the bridal party at your wedding -- unless it's your mother. She sort of has to come.
 Cheapest Date of All
 I invited a friend to dinner at a restaurant. He said he'd love to come if I paid for him, promising to reimburse me as soon as possible. I didn't know how to decline without sounding rude, so I agreed, even though he has a job and I'm unemployed. What should I have said?
 Anonymous, Brooklyn
 Not to go all Suze Orman on you, but why are you proposing restaurant dates if you're unemployed? (Sorry, none of my business.)
 Go with the truth: ''Not to worry! I'm a little strapped for cash myself these days, being in-between jobs and all. Let's make it a coffee, instead -- or graze the free poundcake samples at Williams-Sonoma.''

HEADLINE: A Film Fest, and Beyond

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
There are movies about music in the Connecticut Film Festival in Danbury this year, like ''The Wrecking Crew,'' focusing on studio musicians who backed up famous performers including Frank Sinatra and the Beach Boys. And there are movies about illness, from the deadly serious ''Still Here,'' about a man living with H.I.V. for 30 years, to the quirky ''Collecting Things,'' the story of a woman with a borderline hoarding disorder. But as far as I can tell, only one film on the festival schedule (May 4 to May 9) deals with the biggest issue of the decade: the economy. That is Matt Judge's ''I Work in Public,'' about a laid-off administrative assistant who takes an unusual approach to entrepreneurship. 
 Behind the scenes, though, the economy has been a major factor in the planning and the execution of the festival, right down to the ticket prices. 
 ''We charge $7 for a matinee, $8 for the evening,'' said Tom Carruthers, the festival's founder and executive director. ''We were going to try and raise them, but the economy was tanking. We really have to do everybody a favor and keep prices down.''
 Danbury officials did not commit to hosting the festival as early as it had in previous years, possibly because of economic issues. So Mr. Carruthers and his team had only 90 days to put the six-day event together. 
 Other festival films include Marc Meyers's drama ''Harvest,'' starring Robert Loggia; Martin West's ''Years in the Making,'' a documentary about working artists 70 and older; the festival's 2009 Audience Favorite Award winner, ''The Baker,'' with Damian Lewis and Michael Gambon; and Barry Levinson's ''PoliWood,'' a documentary about the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions. 
 Since last year, the film offerings have been joined by music and digital media events, Mr. Carruthers said, partly because of tax credits. Scheduled musical performers include Laura Ganci, Seth Lefferts, Mike James, Milton, St. Bernadette, the Selkies, Awkward Ending, and Joe Roberto and Poverty Hash. But it is the focus of the festival's educational offerings that seems to best capture the moment. 
 A number of workshops are geared to artists on a budget, like ''Making 3-D Movies Using Free Software'' and ''Video Production Using Free Software Tools.'' And there is a wide range of new-media events for career changers, including ''WebTV and Digital Films: Turning Video Into Gold,'' ''Narrative Web Production,'' ''Flash and Beyond: Interactive Media Tools,'' ''Intro to Media Sharing'' and, for people who do not know a tweet from a domain name, ''Introduction to the Web: Why Does It Matter?''

HEADLINE: Cops Who Deliver A Bang for the Buck

BYLINE: By JOE RHODES

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
 ALL the familiar props are here: the half-empty coffee pots, the battered metal desks, the caged-off evidence room, the rolls of yellow crime-scene tape. On a cold, rainy day in January, the interior of the Food and Fiber Pavilion, part of the 277-acre Fair Park complex here that houses the annual State Fair of Texas, looked like every TV police precinct you've ever seen. 
 ''Dan, we got thrown off the case,'' the actor Colin Hanks shouted to his co-star, Bradley Whitford, in an exasperated exchange as familiar as the surroundings.
 ''That's 'cause we're doing a good job,'' Mr. Whitford yelled back. 
 ''A good job? We broke damn near every rule the department has.''
 ''Yeah,'' Mr. Whitford responded. ''And we found the bad guys.''
 That we've seen all this before, or at least feel as if we have, is a key reason why ''The Good Guys,'' the first broadcast network series from Matt Nix, the creator of ''Burn Notice,'' was picked up for a 13-episode summer run by Fox without even a pilot. But just as important as the twisted familiarity of Mr. Nix's premise were the practical applications of his pitch, which was as much about production schedules and budgets as it was story lines and characters.
 ''Matt walks in the door with not only a finished script and a pitch for what the whole season was going to be,'' said Kevin Reilly, the president of Fox Entertainment, ''but with a willingness to deliver a network-quality show on a cable budget. We are getting a lot of bang for our buck, literally.''
 Emiliano Calemzuk, president of Fox Television Studios, which produces ''The Good Guys'' and ''Burn Notice,'' said that the broadcast networks -- whose production costs per hourlong episode range from $2 million to $5 million -- can save as much as 30 percent by using the tighter budgets and schedules under which cable dramas like ''Burn Notice'' and ''The Shield'' have been forced to operate.
 ''The Good Guys'' shoots an episode in seven days, three days fewer than a typical network drama. Shooting in Dallas also lowers costs, as does filming in the early part of the year. ''We're not competing with the normal pilot season and staffing season,'' Mr. Calemzuk said. ''All those things give us a cost advantage.''
 That his first network series may have gotten picked up for reasons of economics as much as art, doesn't bother Mr. Nix, 38, who started his show business career in the development department at Turner Network Television. ''It's no secret that everybody's looking at the broadcast model and asking, 'How can this possibly last?' '' he said. ''It's too expensive, it's too difficult, and the audience is fracturing. I'd love to work on a show like 'The Cosby Show' that half of America watches every week. But that doesn't exist anymore. And it's never coming back.''
 Making his bosses at the network happy serves Mr. Nix's purposes as well. ''And my attitude is that I want it to be a really on-time, on-budget profitable show,'' he said. ''Then the network guys don't worry so much about what I'm doing creatively and let me do what I want to do.'' 
 What Mr. Nix wanted to do 10 years ago, when he wrote the first version of ''The Good Guys'' as a feature film script, was find a way a way to reinvent the buddy-cop action-comedy genre in the same way that ''The Princess Bride'' had reinvented fairy tales. ''What I loved about that movie,'' he said, ''is that it's telling a classic story in a way that acknowledges that you've heard the story before but finds a way to let you enjoy it in a whole new way. So I thought, 'How can I remake this in the same way that gives me the same pleasure as when I was a kid?' ''
 The series, which makes its debut May 19, stars Mr. Whitford and Mr. Hanks as two problematic and seemingly mismatched Dallas cops relegated to the low-priority property crimes unit. They become a sort of Starsky & Hutch of small-appliance theft cases.
 While ''The Good Guys'' draws heavily from the dark humor of films like ''Get Shorty,'' ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Raising Arizona,'' it's also an unapologetic shout-out to the days of TV cops with muscle cars and slightly askew moral compasses. Dan Stark, Mr. Whitford's mustachioed character, may be drunk on the job -- a lot -- but Mr. Nix emphasizes that ''he's not a bad cop. Even if he does things that seem sleazy, they ultimately serve the cause of truth and justice.''
 It's a premise full of archetypes and in-jokes: the washed-up former hero (Mr. Whitford as a schnapps-swilling, '80s-fashion-wearing rule breaker) and his reluctant younger partner (Mr. Hanks as a tech-savvy, full-of-himself know-it-all) solving crimes that invariably involve car chases, explosions and outraged superiors. The Fox promos scream: ''Whitford. Hanks. Mustache.''
 Mr. Nix promises that the show is smarter and more complex than it seems. But he also said he believes that there's nothing inherently wrong with giving the audience and the networks what they want.
 ''I'm very self-conscious about saying this, but I was watching an English documentary about Bernini, about all those buildings centuries ago in Rome, and I realized that's kind of the same thing we're doing,'' said Mr. Nix, a University of California, Los Angeles, graduate who grew up in Los Angeles, where his father was a private school headmaster and his mother the development director for the Living Desert nature preserve.
 ''I mean, you don't get to say, 'I want to build St. Peter's without any creative input from the cardinal.' You don't get to build the Vatican as a solo creative artist, being free and putting columns wherever you want them. You've got to make a building that accommodates a certain number of people, that has room for bathrooms and that makes the guy writing the checks happy.'' 
 ''And when I look at my heroes in television and my heroes in art,'' Mr. Nix added, ''they're the people who embraced that and got things done, didn't hate the politics of it and didn't hate the practical realities of it. Because you got to be an operator, that's what the business is.''

HEADLINE: Cracked Foundation

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer and author of, most recently, ''The End of Wall Street.''

 BODY:
Timothy Geithner, a man whose taste for Kierkegaard is usually kept under wraps, recently held forth to the House Financial Services Committee on the ''central, existential question'' that is facing America or, at the very least, that is facing its reform of housing finance. The Treasury secretary is bedeviled over what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bailed-out mortgage giants that have cost the taxpayers upward of $125 billion with as yet no end in sight. Shutting them down is not so easy because -- get ready for this -- since their bailout, in September 2008, Fannie and Freddie have become more, not less, important to the U.S. housing market. At present, 9 of every 10 new mortgages are sold to, or guaranteed by, arms of the U.S. government, the majority of them to Fannie and Freddie. Which is to say, without Uncle Sam, it is not clear that the private market for housing would even exist. 
 But retaining Fannie and Freddie in their present form is unpalatable; government support of the mortgage twins was among the original sins of the financial crisis. It stemmed from the country's affection for homeownership -- a legacy of a frontier nation that subsidized homesteading for pioneers and encouraged later generations to homestead in the suburbs via the mortgage-interest deduction. Renting was disfavored; federal policy encouraged ownership. But the policy was wrapped around the fiction that federal support promoted self-reliance rather than dependence.
 Fannie and Freddie developed as tools of credit enhancement; direct handouts offended laissez-faire sensibilities, whereas loan guarantees were nearly invisible. The practice of disguising government aid dates to the rescue of farmers and homeowners during the Depression. Mortgage capital barely existed and so, in 1934, the New Deal chartered the Federal Housing Administration to stimulate mortgage lending. Within a generation, the government was operating 74 separate programs to bolster credit through guarantees, insurance or outright loans, according to Sarah Quinn, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, who researched these programs. The point, Quinn says, was nearly always the same: ''to camouflage, hide, or understate the extent to which [the U.S. government] actually intervened in the economy.''
 No organizations epitomized the charade so well as Fannie and Freddie. Fannie was created in 1938 to purchase mortgages and allow lenders to write more loans. In the '60s, when the mortgage industry sputtered, the Johnson administration began to use Fannie to sponsor securitizations -- that is, to guarantee pools of mortgages and sell them to investors. A House committee in 1966 saw what was, then and now, the fundamental hazard with such guarantees: to investors ''it makes no difference what the quality of these assets are.'' 
 President Johnson was perfectly willing to let Fannie backstop investors, but he had a problem. Every mortgage Fannie purchased went on the government's books, which were already strained by the Vietnam War. After valiant efforts to manipulate the budget, Johnson hit on a solution -- privatize Fannie, so that its expenditures would be somebody else's problem. 
 The clever twist was that Fannie, which exited the public sector in 1968, wasn't wholly separate. Investors viewed Fannie, and its new sibling, Freddie, as having the implicit backing of the Treasury. This lowered the companies' costs and arguably led to lower interest rates for borrowers. 
 As long as Fannie and Freddie stuck to conservative underwriting, the arrangement seemed to work. But Congress was eager to use the twins for political purposes, like increasing homeownership and affordable housing. As Dwight Jaffee, a professor at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley, observed, legislators persuaded themselves that Fannie and Freddie could further such causes ''basically at no cost.''
 When Fannie and Freddie began to face competition in their business of securitizing loans and providing liquidity to the mortgage market, their profits and stock prices took a nosedive. Seeking to recoup, the firms took more risk. And thanks to their implicit Treasury support, they could borrow virtually at will. Eventually, their debts reached the absurd level of 100 times their capital. When mortgage values tanked, a bailout was unavoidable. 
 For 19 months, the pair have been wards of the state. No one wants to repeat the experiment in irresponsibility that they represented, but officials are unlikely to yank support as long as the mortgage market remains weak. Geithner, who is developing a plan for Fannie and Freddie, has promised that ''private gains will no longer be subsidized by public losses,'' but he also insists that ''there is quite a strong economic case, a quite strong public-policy case, for preserving and designing some form of guarantee by the government.'' 
 Are the two agendas -- private risk and public assurance -- consistent? Peter Wallison, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, fears that Congress could opt for the path of least resistance and revive the twins as government-sponsored private firms. Yet private companies, Wallison says, cannot perform a public mission, which the twins' recent history would seem to confirm. If homeownership was the goal, securitization barely made a dent. In 1980, 64 percent of Americans owned their homes; three decades later, the rate is 67 percent. What the twins accomplished during the bubble was to help some people who could not afford mortgages temporarily pose as owners. 
 Are the firms really so indispensable? Unlike during the Depression, a private market for mortgages does exist (albeit, it is dormant now). The government might consider making a calculated exit. A strategy proposed by Jaffee is for Fannie and Freddie to gradually raise the fees they charge for guaranteeing the value of mortgage securities. At some point, private companies would be able to securitize mortgages for less, and the business would shift to the private sector. Functions the market will not support (like helping affordable housing) are best transferred to the government, financed on-budget.
 America may want a private mortgage market, or it might want the security of a subsidized market. What every administration since L.B.J.'s has coveted and what has always been a lie is that we can get a subsidized market free.

HEADLINE: Fall in Motorcycle Deaths First in 12 Years

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
MOTORCYCLE deaths in the United States fell steeply last year, according to a new study.
 After 11 straight years of increases, motorcycle traffic fatalities are projected to decline by at least 10 percent nationally in 2009, the Governors Highway Safety Association announced in a report released on Thursday. 
 The rise in motorcycle deaths every year since 1997 ''is pretty alarming'' said Barbara L. Harsha, executive director of the association, which represents state highway safety offices. ''What's significant is this is the first year there has been a downturn in 12 years.''
 Among the reasons for the decline, according to the report, were less leisure motorcycle travel because of the economy, fewer beginning motorcyclists, bad weather in some states and increased attention to state-sponsored safety programs. 
 The report was based on preliminary fatality data collected from state highway safety agencies, taken from police accident reports. Fatality numbers for the entire year were reported by 11 states and the District of Columbia, and 39 states reported complete counts for at least the first nine months of 2009 and fairly complete numbers for the remaining months.
 Ms. Harsha said the association was confident in forecasting that motorcycle fatalities were expected to fall in about 75 percent of the states. Some experienced particularly steep declines. In California, deaths were predicted to decrease 29 percent, and in New York, 16 percent.
 The report was prepared by James Hedlund of Highway Safety North, a consulting firm in Ithaca, N.Y. Mr. Hedlund was previously the associate administrator for traffic safety programs at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 An official with N.H.T.S.A. said the agency received the preliminary data from the association and was evaluating it, adding that the agency was pleased by the overall reduction in national highway deaths, including the fact that its estimates for 2009 indicate the lowest fatality rate since records have been kept.
 Final figures for motorcycle fatalities are expected to be released later this year by the safety agency.

HEADLINE: Escaping The Crowds

BYLINE: By LIONEL BEEHNER

 BODY:
BARBADOS
 WHY NOW The sugary beaches of Barbados have long been a Caribbean playground for Britain's elite. But while the gated plantation homes and polo grounds are still there, hoteliers are angling to attract a hipper and younger crowd. In the spring, when the high season tapers off, you're just as likely to see fashionistas from New York City throwing back cocktails at the pompously chic Sandy Lane Hotel as tea-sipping octogenarians. Getting there is also easier. JetBlue has new, daily nonstop flights from Kennedy Airport, which means you can leave in the morning and hit the beach by lunch. 
 WHAT TO DO Barbados's two most famous exports -- rum and Rihanna -- also sum up your to-do list. To learn how the ''white gold'' gets distilled into spicy rum, take a tour of the Mount Gay Distilleries (Exmouth Gap, Brandons, St. Michael; 246-425-8757; mountgayrum.com) for $7. Or hike inland to explore the vast sugar fields. For music, follow the well-dressed partygoers to any of the clubs pumping out reggae and calypso along a strip known as the St. Lawrence Gap. 
 WHERE TO STAY Hotels in Barbados used to be geared toward pensioners, but that's changing. The Crane (St. Philip; 246-423-6220; thecrane.com), which opened in 1887, has undergone a major renovation that includes a new village, a cocktail lounge and a 1.5-acre pool area. Off-season rates are slashed by a third, with the coral suites starting at about $300, compared with around $500 during peak season. 
 WHERE TO EAT Barbados -- the only Caribbean island with its own Zagat guide -- likes to eat well. In winter, reservations are a must. But come spring, diners can stroll right in and snag that seat overlooking the coral reef. Slip into the elegant courtyard of Nishi (Second Street, Holetown; 246-432-8287; www.nishi-restaurant.com), a fusion restaurant opened in 2009 by the Londoner Paul Edwards that serves up peppery steaks and fresh sushi. Or try the Bajan cuisine of the cookbook author Laurel Ann Morley, who reopened the Cove (St. Joseph; 246-433-9495) in January after renovations. 
 DON'T MISS The waves still rock, but there's no line of surfers paddling out in front of you. Beaches along the island's east coast, especially Soup Bowl, are favored for their pink sands and surfer-friendly breaks.
 CHARLESTON, S.C.
 WHY NOW High temperatures in Charleston average about 76 degrees in April and May, near-perfect weather for exploring its refurbished historic downtown. A new waterfront park and pier were installed last summer in the town of Mount Pleasant, just over the Cooper River. And the nearby Union Pier Terminal will be welcoming more Carnival cruise ships next month, conveniently coinciding with the opening of new hotels, a renovated open-air market and the restoration of cultural landmarks.
 WHAT TO DO The Dock Street Theater (135 Church Street; 843-720-3968), which opened in 1736 and calls itself America's first theater for performing arts, is set to reopen to audiences next month after a $19 million face-lift. That's just in time for the Spoleto Festival USA (843-579-3100; spoletousa.org), the annual celebration of live music, dancing and theater that begins May 28. The outdoor City Market (between North and South Market Streets; thecharlestoncitymarket.com), which predates the Civil War, was spruced up this spring with wider walkways and roomier stalls to hold even more sweetgrass baskets. 
 WHERE TO STAY The Restoration on King (75 Wentworth Street; 877-221-7202; restorationonking.com), a 16-suite boutique hotel in a former office building wedged between the Antiques District and the French Quarter, opened this month. Rates start at about $300 for rooms that offer plenty of antebellum charm, like exposed brick walls and knotty pine floors; in-room breakfast is included.
 WHERE TO EAT Low Country cuisine is all about seafood and raw bars. And in the middle of the historic district is Amen Street Fish and Raw Bar (205 East Bay Street; 843-853-8600; amenstreet.com), which opened in November in a 19th-century brick building. Young professionals cram the black-leather booths, nibbling on raw oysters until 2 a.m. Or drive a little out of town to 17 North (3563 Highway 17; 843-606-2144; 17north.net), a roadside kitchen that also opened in November, in a ranch-style house. The menu features sustainable and seasonal fare, including smoked pulled pork, and a rib-eye steak drizzled with truffle oil. 
 DON'T MISS Low humidity, few crowds and flowers in full bloom are ideal conditions for exploring Charleston's many parks and nearby plantations. The Francis Marion Hotel (387 King Street; 843-722-0600; francismarionhotel.com) hands out picnic coolers stuffed with fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits and assorted jams. Packages, which include the cooler and a one-night stay for two, start at $189.
 GREECE
 WHY NOW The bad news from Greece -- striking workers, mounting debt crisis -- may be good news for tourists. The crisis has depressed prices and made Greece a better bargain for Americans. ''It's a golden opportunity to visit Greece right now,'' said Nikolas Zoulakis, a spokesman for Greece's tourism office in New York City. The hot Mediterranean is also milder now through June, with temperatures on the islands hovering in the high 70s. And the beaches are not yet packed with pasty-white vacationers.
 WHAT TO DO Spring on the mainland tends to be gray and rainy, so head to the sunnier Greek islands in the south. Watch the wildflowers bloom from the rustic tavernas, beautiful beaches and countless gorges of Crete, Greece's largest island. Or enjoy the rare solitude of Santorini's seaside hamlets, while taking in the spectacular views of the island's volcano at sunset. Ferry schedules are nearly fully operational now. 
 WHERE TO STAY Even the Greek Islands' most exclusive hotels are dropping their prices. On Santorini, the Astarte Suites (Kaldera Akrotiri; 30-2286-0833-88; astartesuites.gr), a family-run boutique that overlooks Santorini Volcano, has a pair of junior suites with private verandas and whirlpool tubs encased in Swarovksi crystals that start at 220 euros, or about $290 at $1.32 to the euro (jumps to 330 euros, or $436, after June 1). In Crete, the Elounda Ilion Hotel (72053 Elounda; 30-2841-0417-03; elounda-ilion.com) renovated its expansive pool deck and 30 minimalist rooms last year. Doubles with bay views start at 94 euros before June. 
 WHERE TO EAT Chances are, your travel plans will take you through Athens. A scenic spot to ease into the bustling capital is Dionysos Zonars (43 Robertou Galli Street; 30-210-9233182; dionysoszonars.gr), a modern Greek restaurant overlooking the Acropolis. On Santorini, Selene (30-2286-0222-49; selene.gr), a food lover's favorite known for creative Cycladic dishes, is moving to the town of Pyrgos this month, to a yellow house facing the Aegean. And on Crete, Avli (Xanthoudidou 22, Rethymnon; 30-28310-58250; avli.gr), tucked within a leafy Venetian-style courtyard, serves traditional Cretan dishes like fouriariko, slow-roasted goat smothered in thyme and honey. 
 DON'T MISS The black sand beaches of Santorini, like Kamari and Perissa, can be scorching in summer. But in May, it's less risky to go barefoot, and sun worshipers can work on their tans. 
 LAKE GEORGE
 WHY NOW Things come cheaper in Lake George. Campsites go for $25. New Yorkers can zip up on one tank of gas. And hiking peaks like Tongue Mountain requires no fees or parking permits. Lake George is especially enticing before school lets out. Route 9N, the artery that hugs the west side of the lake, is not backed up with Winnebagos, the water is not crammed with kids on water skis, and lakefront motels are even cheaper than usual. 
 WHAT TO DO Avoid Lake George Village, a tacky lakeside strip mall. Instead, follow the lake north to Bolton Landing, an unpretentious town with classic Adirondack-style motels, family-owned gear shops and pubs that serve good grub. Bolton also offers the most scenic vistas of Lake George, where the mountains, forested islands and quiet blue waters form a Switzerland-like tableau. Golfers can continue north to the Sagamore Golf Course (Federal Hill Road; 518-743-6380; thesagamore.com), one of upstate New York's finest public links. Before Memorial Day, reserving a tee time is a breeze and just $100 on weekdays, $110 weekends ($10 less for guests at the Sagamore Resort). 
 WHERE TO STAY The Sagamore Resort (110 Sagamore Road; 866-385-6221; thesagamore.com) is the stately face of Lake George. The face looks a little younger this spring, thanks to a $20 million renovation that includes a new lakeside pool, a fine Italian restaurant and 37 new rooms with lakeside verandas. Rooms with lake views start at $179 in spring, not the $539 of summer. A budget-friendly choice is the Chelka Lodge (4204 Lake Shore Drive; 518-668-4677; chelkalodge.com), which has recently renovated rooms just steps from the lake, starting at $165 this time of year. 
 WHERE TO EAT For alfresco dining with lake views, the new La Bella Vita at the Sagamore Resort (518-644-9400) serves homemade gnocchi ($10) and Maine lobster ravioli ($28). Also opening this spring is Son of a Sailor (4933 Lake Shore Drive; 518-470-9991; sonofasailor.com), a family-style restaurant with gray-and-white trim and lobster on the menu. 
 DON'T MISS Lake George may be too cold for swimming before June, but mountain runoff and open dams turn the surrounding region into a whitewater rafting bonanza every spring. Adirondack River Outfitters (4527 Route 28; 800-525-7238; aroadventures.com) organizes trips down the Hudson River in wetsuits starting at $76, including lunch, beer and a barbecue afterward.
 MONTAUK, N.Y.
 WHY NOW Montauk prides itself on being the poor man's side of the Hamptons, where bars cater to deep-sea fishermen, not deep-pocketed hedge-funders. But sandy-haired surfers are showing up in greater numbers, hotels have upped their thread counts, and the Jitney set has started to make inroads. To experience the old Montauk, visit before Memorial Day, when the secluded coves and sweeping dunes are calm, and the cool breezes off the Atlantic make the place feel more like Maine than Long Island.
 WHAT TO DO If it's too chilly to surf at Ditch Plains Beach, no worries: May is fast becoming festival season in Montauk. May 13 to 16 will be the premiere of the Montauk Music Festival (themontaukmusicfestival.com), with performances ranging from rock and rap to blues and jazz, and May 29 and 30 is the third annual Montauk Fine Arts Festival (montaukartshow.com). For bicycle enthusiasts, there's the Montauk Century bike ride on May 16 (5bbc.org) along the South Shore of Long Island to Montauk, with starting points in either Manhattan (for a 145-mile ride) or on Long Island (for a 100- or 65-mile trip).
 WHERE TO STAYDon't let the ritzy name fool you: the Montauk Yacht Club Resort and Marina (32 Star Island Road; 631-668-3100; montaukyachtclub.com) is open to anyone, even if your yacht is in the shop. The resort completed a $100 million upgrade last year, adding full-size bathtubs and nautical touches. A double room with sea views starts at $209 (and jumps to $269 after Memorial Day). Stay Mother's Day weekend and receive a $100 credit for meals and drinks. The trendy Surf Lodge (183 Edgemere Street; 631-668-1562; thesurflodge.com), which brought a dash of the swankier Hamptons to Montauk, opens for the season in mid-May, with rooms starting at $275 in the spring. Get there now before the stretch Hummers arrive.
 WHERE TO EAT Sean MacPherson, the bold-faced restaurateur, recently bought the Crow's Nest Inn and Restaurant (4 Old West Lake Drive; restaurant: 631-668-2077; crowsnestrest.com), which offers a time capsule of a dining experience complete with lobster tanks. So, when it opens for the season in May, it could be the last time before the humble place goes hip. Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast Kitchen, at the yacht club, has just recruited a chef from South Florida, Robbin Haas, to add more seasonal sizzle to the menu. 
 DON'T MISSTennis enthusiasts can take advantage of the pre-Memorial Day $150 package offered by the Manhattan-based Gotham Tennis Academy (gothamtennis.com), which has just partnered with the yacht club. The deal, starting May 1, includes a private lesson and a group clinic, each an hour long, and all the court time you can squeeze into a day.
 MONTREAL
 WHY NOW Montreal's cultural awakening seems most acute this time of year, when long winters give way to mild spring days, and the city's artists and musicians come out of their studios. Cafes along Boulevard Saint-Laurent and Rue Saint-Denis fill up with night owls; the city's 300 miles of European-style pathways are crisscrossed with cyclists; and street festivals turn entire blocks into all-day rave parties. 
 WHAT TO DO Montreal architects and designers open their doors during the Design Montreal Open House (designmontrealopenhouse.com), held May 1 and 2 to highlight the city's designation as a Unesco City of Design. Mutek (mutek.org) kicks off its annual festival from June 2 to 6 to showcase digital creativity and audiovisual art. And starting in May, electronic music devotees converge every Sunday from 2 to 9 p.m., for an outdoor D.J.-fueled ritual known as Piknic Electronik (piknicelectronik.com) in Jean-Drapeau Park. Get there early, though, as the concrete dance floor fills up fast. 
 WHERE TO STAY About a decade ago, Old Montreal became saturated with boutique hotels trying to steal guests away from the faceless chains near downtown. It's still happening. One of the newest and most popular is Le Petit Hotel (168, rue Saint-Paul Ouest; 877-530-0360; petithotelmontreal.com), a smartly designed hotel housed in a 19th-century stone building. Its 24 rooms with bamboo wood floors start at 158 Canadian dollars (about $161 at .98 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar), compared with 188 Canadian, or $191, in summer. Chain hotels are also muscling into Old Montreal. Le Westin Montreal (270, rue Saint-Antoine Ouest; 866-837-4262; westinmontreal.com) opened last summer, with 424 rooms starting at 199 Canadian dollars. 
 WHERE TO EAT New restaurants seem to pop up every week in Montreal. La Salle a Manger (1302, avenue Du Mont-Royal Est; 514-522-0777; lasalleamanger.ca), a modern French bistro that opened in Le Plateau in 2008, is still generating buzz for its suckling pig, which serves 12 and must be ordered two days in advance, and for a long bar made from wood salvaged from bowling lanes. And Jerome Ferrer, the chef at Europea (1227, rue de la Montagne; 514-398-9229; europea.ca), recently opened a more casual and Catalan-inspired counterpart, Andiamo (1083, cote du Beaver Hall; 514-861-2634; andiamo.ca). 
 DON'T MISS May 30 is Montreal Museums Day, which means free admission to 30 museums. To cover more ground, try out the city's one-year-old BIXI bike-sharing program (bixi.com), which has 400 stations around town. Bikes are 5 Canadian dollars for 24-hour access, with the first 30 minutes included and charges of 1.50 to 6 Canadian dollars for each additional half-hour. 
 RIO DE JANEIRO
 WHY NOW Caipirinha and samba keep the party going in Rio de Janeiro, no matter the season. Despite pounding rains that devastated certain Rio neighborhoods, the city's famed beaches are relatively unharmed and attract plenty of bronzing Cariocas through May. Meanwhile, because the months between Easter and July are Rio's low season, hotels slash prices by as much as half, and flights from New York City drop to about $700, which shaves another $300 or so from high-season prices. 
 WHAT TO DO Be sure to see Maracana Stadium (www.suderj.rj.gov.br) before the temple of Brazilian soccer, which was opened in 1950, receives a $280 million primping this year for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. A new subway stop in Ipanema makes the Hippie Fair (feirahippieipanema.com) -- an open-air arts and crafts market held every Sunday in General Osorio Square -- that much more convenient. That leaves you just a few blocks from the beach, which should be empty come June as the whole city fixates on the World Cup in South Africa. 
 WHERE TO STAY Off-season deals exist all along Copacabana Beach. The new Arena Copacabana Hotel (Avenida Atlantica 2064; 55-21-3034-1501; arenahotel.com.br), with the requisite rooftop pool, is offering low-season rates from $156 for a double. For a less touristy area, the hilltop neighborhood of Santa Teresa has a swarm of boutique hotels, with some of the best views of the city's skyline and rock formations. The recently opened Hotel Santa Teresa (Rua Almirante Alexandrino 660; 55-21-2222-2755; santateresahotel.com) has 44 rooms starting at around 750 reais (about $440 at 1.7 reais to the dollar). 
 WHERE TO EAT Good luck getting a table at Aprazivel (Rua Aprazivel 62; 21-2508-9174; aprazivel.com.br) during the high season. But this Santa Teresa favorite, known for its sweet views, outdoor garden and inventive Brazilian cuisine, frees up in May. For something more casual, head to Chico e Alaide (Rua Dias Ferreira 679, 21-2512-0028; chicoealaide.com.br), a recent addition to Leblon's botequim scene. Its appetizers of shrimp and jerked meat may taste familiar to patrons of Bracarense (Rua Jose Linhares 85; 21-2294-3549); the two bars share the same chef. 
 DON'T MISS So you think you can dance? Before hitting Lapa 40 Graus (Rua do Riachuelo 97; 55-21-3970-1338; lapa40graus.com.br), a steamy samba lounge spread across three floors, learn a few steps. Carlinhos de Jesus Dance House (Rua Alvaro Ramos 11, Botafogo; 21-2541-6186; carlinhosdejesus.com.br) offers classes for beginners starting at 45 reais a person.
 YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK
 WHY NOW Yellowstone National Park, where snowplows are deployed to clear icy roads well into May, might not seem like an obvious choice for a spring fling. But as the frost recedes, the snowmobiles empty out, yet the roads are still mostly off-limits to cars. It's an almost magical time, when you can glide past geysers and hot springs by bike and breathe in the colorful scenery without the crush of RVs and tourists, who have been flocking to national parks during the recession. 
 WHAT TO DO The fauna springs to life. Grizzly bears awake from hibernation, wolves slip out of their dens and bison give birth to bright orange calves that look from afar like little pumpkins. Hike up the Rose Creek trail from the historic Buffalo Ranch in Lamar Valley to experience what park rangers call the American Serengeti. For do-it-yourselfers, grab a copy of National Geographic's ''Yellowstone Country'' by Seymour L. Fishbein, which was rereleased in January; it offers detailed maps, gorgeous photos and primers on the park's ecology. There is also a new iPhone app, GeoRoamer (georoameryellowstone.com), that offers GPS-guided audio tours for $8.99. It's lighter than the 200-page book. 
 WHERE TO STAY The nine lodges scattered throughout Yellowstone don't usually open until late May or early June. Most are also bare-bones. A more civilized option is the Three Bears Lodge (217 Yellowstone Avenue; 800-646-7353; threebearlodge.com), a 44-room hotel just outside the park in West Yellowstone. After a 2008 fire, the hotel fully reopened last summer with a modern makeover that retains its Goldilocks-inspired kitsch. Doubles start at $109 before May 20 ($189 after). 
 WHERE TO EAT Pack a lunch if you're exploring outdoors: there are slim pickings within the park during the spring. Ernie's Bakery and Deli in West Yellowstone (406 Highway Avenue; 406-646-9467; erniesbakery.com) makes sandwiches on homemade bread. The Lake Yellowstone Hotel (307-344-7311; yellowstonenationalparklodges.com) opens mid-May. After a long day, explorers can dig in to hearty fare like farm-raised bison, wild Alaskan salmon and organic chicken. 
 DON'T MISS Morning coffee at the Lake Yellowstone Hotel's Sun Room, just when the sun peeks over Mount Sheridan's 10,000-foot summit. A marine layer forms above the still-frozen lake, as if the mountain were floating above the clouds.

HEADLINE: With Teacher Layoffs Coming, Battle Turns to Seniority Rules

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Peter Borock, 23, is in his second year teaching history at Health Opportunities High School in the South Bronx. It could be his last.
 With New York City schools planning for up to 8,500 layoffs, new teachers like Mr. Borock, and half a dozen others at his school, could be some of the ones most likely to be let go. That has led the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, into a high-stakes battle with the teachers' union to overturn seniority rules that have been in place for decades.
 Facing the likelihood of the largest number of layoffs in more than a generation, Mr. Klein and his counterparts around the country say that the rules, which require that the most recently hired teachers be the first to lose their jobs, are anachronistic. In an era of accountability, they say, the rules will upend their efforts of the last few years to recruit new teachers, improve teacher performance and reward those who do best.
 ''Nobody I've talked to thinks seniority is a rational way to go,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Obviously there are some senior teachers who are extraordinary. You recruit young talent you think is good for the future, and to just get rid of that by the numbers seems to me to be a nonsensical approach.'' 
 This month city officials persuaded lawmakers in Albany to introduce a bill that would allow the city to decide which teachers to let go, although its chances of passing are slim. Similar legislation in California, where thousands of young teachers have received letters saying they could be out of work, moved forward last week, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arizona abolished seniority rules last year, and this month its Legislature banned the use of seniority if teachers are rehired. 
 Unions argue that administrators want to do away with seniority protections so they can get rid of older teachers, who are more expensive. 
 They say that without seniority safeguards, principals could act on personal grudges, and that while keeping the best teachers is a laudable goal, no one has figured out an accurate way to determine who those teachers are. 
 ''There is no good way to lay people off,'' said Randi Weingarten, the former leader of the city's teachers' union, who is now the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ''But to be opportunistic and try to rush something through without knowing if there's some degree of objectivity and a comprehensive and valid evaluation system is appalling.''
 Indeed, even if school districts switched to performance-based layoffs, younger teachers could still face big losses.
 Several studies have shown that teachers just beginning their careers are more likely to struggle than more experienced instructors. And a New York Times analysis of the city's own reports on teacher effectiveness suggest that teachers do best after being in the classroom for at least 5 years, though they tend to level off after 10 years. 
 ''You want to keep a rookie who looks good relative to other rookies, even if it's not that great relative to all other teachers, because they are going to turn into a really good teacher,'' said Douglas O. Staiger, an economics professor at Dartmouth who has worked with the city on teacher quality studies. ''The question is: Are our current methods good enough at figuring out who those teachers are? I'm not sure where you draw the line on that.'' 
 Mr. Klein frequently cites the teachers' contract in Washington, D.C., as a model. Last year, when the Washington schools chancellor, Michelle A. Rhee, laid off nearly 300 teachers, she was not bound by seniority. 
 The fight to end seniority rules could be Mr. Klein's most uphill battle yet. He is fresh off a deal with the union to speed the process of firing teachers accused of wrongdoing or incompetence, including the ending of warehousing such teachers in what are known as rubber rooms. 
 But he continues to struggle with the union over his desire to lay off so-called absent-teacher reserves, teachers whose positions have been eliminated because of school closings or classroom shifts, but who are entitled to full salaries because they have not done anything wrong.
 But the reserves account for only 1,050 teachers, a small percentage of the number that could lose their jobs if proposed state budget cuts are enacted.
 So the chancellor has tried to increase parent support for ending seniority by releasing projections showing that layoffs would be disproportionately concentrated in the South Bronx, where many young teachers begin their careers, and the East Side of Manhattan, where a boom in the student population has led to a large number of new teachers. 
 Some of their positions would be eliminated, and those that remained could be filled by more senior teachers from other schools.
 Mr. Borock, the Bronx teacher, said that the layoffs would discourage newer graduates from entering the profession. ''If you have a number of job opportunities, as many of us did, and you have a nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you could lose this job really quickly,'' he asked, ''why would anyone want to go into that?'' 
 He joined a group created recently by other young teachers, Educators for Excellence, to lobby against seniority rules, taking on their own union. 
 At River East Elementary School in Harlem, half of the teaching staff has fewer than three years of experience. Alison McKenzie, the principal, said she was worried but believed that some of the young teachers would be protected because many were certified in bilingual and special education, two areas with a shortage of teachers. 
 Ms. McKenzie said she could not imagine losing in ''these tender situations'' a teacher whom she has supported.
 Seniority is an article of faith for trade unions, which say that it protects against the whims of employers and provides stability for employees. Ms. Weingarten said that more experienced teachers were also better equipped to deal with other effects of budget cuts, like larger classes and fewer supplies. 
 Arthur Goldstein, the chapter chairman of the teachers' union at Francis Lewis High School in Queens, said that Mr. Klein and his supporters were trying to pit teachers against one another.
 ''I understand how they feel -- I lost my job four times and nobody ever helped me,'' Mr. Goldstein said of the younger teachers. ''I don't have a principal who is crazy now, but I've had other principals who would have fired me in a New York minute. It had nothing to do with teaching -- things he would take as a personal insult.'' 
 Ending seniority was easier in Arizona, where Republicans control the Legislature, than it will probably be in New York, where Democrats are in power and the teachers' union still has influence. 
 In California, where unions are also fighting the bill to end seniority-based layoffs, State Senator Gloria Romero, a Democrat from East Los Angeles, said that it was crucial not to ''waste a time of crisis.'' 
 ''There has to be the willingness and the conviction to fight for the most vulnerable,'' Ms. Romero said, ''even if it means going against some of the most powerful allies that have funded the Democratic Party.'' 
 In New York, Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democratic state senator who represents Upper Manhattan and is running for attorney general, said that veteran teachers had little reason to worry.
 ''It wasn't just dead on arrival, it was dead before it was put in the mail,'' Mr. Schneiderman said of the legislation. ''It does open the conversation about how to ensure there are quality teachers, but the idea of giving the administration total discretion to pick and choose who is fired with no standards is not going to fly.''
 Limited data on teacher effectiveness in New York City suggests that a purely performance-based system would not favor younger teachers.
 In 2008, New York City began evaluating about 11,500 teachers based on how much their students had improved on standardized state exams. 
 A Times analysis of the first year of results showed that teachers with 6 to 10 years of experience were more likely to perform well, while teachers with 1 or 2 years' experience were the least likely. 
 The analysis could not account for differences in the makeup of the 11,500 classrooms, like how many of them had large numbers of students with learning disabilities.
 Mr. Klein has said that if he has his way, principals will be able to use a mix of factors, including student test score data and classroom observations by administrators and other teachers, as well as their own ''vision for long-term planning.'' He compares the decisions to what private business managers are able to do when making staffing decisions.

HEADLINE: Bias Accord as Harbinger

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
A DECISION this month by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to drop its racial-discrimination lawsuit against Wells Fargo in exchange for a say in reviewing its lending practices could set the stage for similar agreements with other big mortgage lenders, some experts say. 
 From 2007 to 2009, the N.A.A.C.P. filed suit against 15 lenders, accusing them of offering high-cost loans to many black borrowers during the subprime lending boom, even though many of the applicants could have qualified for lower interest rates and closing costs. 
 Wells Fargo, the first of the lenders to end the litigation, agreed to allow the N.A.A.C.P. to review its lending practices and recommend ways to ''improve credit availability to African American and diverse businesses and consumers,'' according to a statement by the N.A.A.C.P. 
 Benjamin Todd Jealous, the group's president, said Wells Fargo would give his staff access to lending data typically provided only to federal regulators; if discriminatory trends were discovered, Wells Fargo's executives would be apprised.
 Wells Fargo and the N.A.A.C.P. will also collaborate on outreach programs to help persuade struggling borrowers to seek help, according to Jon Campbell, Wells Fargo's executive vice president for social responsibility. When the bank is actually able to meet with borrowers, he said, they are able to avoid foreclosure nearly half the time.
 Kenneth D. Wade, the chief executive of NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit group that assists homeowners, said he supported the N.A.A.C.P.'s contention that many minority borrowers had faced racial discrimination when they applied for loans during the mortgage bubble. 
 ''People of color were disproportionately impacted by the subprime debacle,'' he said. ''And it's likely going to result in the largest loss of wealth for African-Americans and Latinos in the country's history.''
 Mr. Wade added that the agreement between Wells Fargo and the N.A.A.C.P. would have broader implications for all lenders. ''It serves notice on the sector as a whole,'' he said, ''to look at their policies, procedures and practices and make sure they're not doing anything that could subject them to litigation risks.''
 Mr. Jealous said he was optimistic that the N.A.A.C.P. would reach similar agreements with Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, which the N.A.A.C.P. is also suing. He added that he also hoped to negotiate such an agreement with Bank of America, which is not part of the lawsuit. ''Bankers were using affinity-based marketing -- for instance, going into churches and other networks and aggressively marketing,'' Mr. Jealous said, and as a result, the borrowers often believed that the lenders' offers were trustworthy. 
 He added that when his group was reviewing complaints of racially discriminatory lending, the greater New York City area was among the regions with the most complaints. 
 These days fewer minorities are being steered toward subprime loans, said Brian Kabateck, a lawyer representing the N.A.A.C.P. in its remaining lawsuits, though largely because lenders have stopped offering subprime loans. 
 Mr. Kabateck said he was now tracking loan modifications. ''Blacks are having a harder time keeping their homes,'' he said, ''and it's not just related to their ability to pay or not pay.'' 
 Mr. Wade of NeighborWorks America said that in the past three years his organization had worked with about 950,000 borrowers through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program and more than half of them were minorities.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Campbell of Wells Fargo said that the bank's lending policies would not immediately change as a direct result of the agreement with the N.A.A.C.P. ''But now we have a partner, and we can look at ourselves through their lens,'' he said. ''Will there be tweaks? We hope so.''

HEADLINE: Tea Party With A Difference

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I've been trying to understand the Tea Party Movement. Sounds like a lot of angry people who want to get the government out of their lives and cut both taxes and the deficit. Nothing wrong with that -- although one does wonder where they were in the Bush years. Never mind. I'm sure like all such protest movements the Tea Partiers will get their 10 to 20 percent of the vote. But should the Tea Partiers actually aspire to break out of that range, attract lots of young people and become something more than just entertainment for Fox News, I have a suggestion: 
 Become the Green Tea Party. 
 I'd be happy to design the T-shirt logo and write the manifesto. The logo is easy. It would show young Americans throwing barrels of oil imported from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia into Boston Harbor.
 The manifesto is easy, too: ''We, the Green Tea Party, believe that the most effective way to advance America's national security and economic vitality would be to impose a $10 ''Patriot Fee'' on every barrel of imported oil, with all proceeds going to pay down our national debt.''
 America now imports about 11 million barrels a day, about 57 percent of our total oil needs -- mostly from Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. As T. Boone Pickens told Congress the other day: ''In January 2010, our trade deficit for the month was $37.3 billion -- $27.5 billion of that was money we sent overseas to import oil.''
 If we put a Patriot Fee on all of those imported barrels, we would use less, cease enriching bad regimes, strengthen our own dollar, make the air cleaner and the climate more stable, foster the exploitation of domestic and renewable energy sources, promote electric vehicles, help bring down the global price of oil (which hurts Iran and helps poor Africa), and we could use the revenue to shrink the deficit. It's win, win, win, win, win, win ...
 Indeed, the Green Tea Party could say, ''We've got our own health care plan -- a plan to make America healthy by simultaneously promoting energy security, deficit security and environmental security.''
 ''Think about it,'' said Carl Pope, the chairman of the Sierra Club. ''Green tea is full of antioxidants,'' which some believe help reduce cancer and heart disease. ''It's really good for your health.'' And a Green Tea Party, he added, could be good for the country's health ''by harnessing all of its energy and unconventional politics'' to end our addiction to oil.
 Yes, I know, dream on. The Tea Party is heading to the hard libertarian right and would never support an energy bill that puts a fee on carbon.
 So if there is going to be a Green Tea Party, it will have to emerge from a different place -- the radical center, a center committed to a radical departure from business as usual. Acting on that impulse, Senators John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joseph Lieberman had forged a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill that deserves an energetic centrist Green Tea Party to support it.
 This critical piece of energy legislation was supposed to be unveiled by the three senators on Monday, but it was suddenly postponed late Saturday because of Senator Graham's fury that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the White House were planning to take up a highly controversial immigration measure before the energy bill.
 If this is what the Obama administration is doing -- to score a few cheap political points with Hispanics -- it is a travesty. The bipartisan energy bill is ready to go. It is far from perfect. Indeed, it is a shame the fossil fuel industries still have such a stranglehold on Congress. But it's the best we're going to get, and we have got to get started. However, without a centrist Green Tea Party movement -- one that brings the same passion to cutting emissions that the Tea Party brings to cutting deficits -- even this effort will never pass. 
 This bill introduces a carbon price and other means to control the CO2 emissions of various sectors of the economy, without an economywide cap-and-trade system. The bill's goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. But to garner broad support, it will also expand domestic production of oil, natural gas and nuclear power and offer tax breaks to manufacturers who make their facilities more energy efficient and create green jobs.
 ''No bill that could pass Congress right now or in the immediate future would be sufficient to produce enough clean power to mitigate climate change at the rate we need,'' remarked the physicist Joe Romm, who writes the blog climateprogress.org and is author of an insightful new book on this subject, ''Straight Up.'' ''We simply aren't sufficiently desperate to do what is needed, which is nonstop deployment of a staggering amount of low-carbon energy, including energy efficiency, for the rest of the century.''
 The reason a Green Tea Party should coalesce to support this bill, argued Romm, is because it will set a price on carbon pollution and help foster commercialization of clean technologies -- like hybrids, batteries and solar -- at sufficient scale to enable the U.S. to rapidly ramp up when the seriousness of climate change becomes inescapably obvious to all.
 In short, the bill is a step in the right direction toward reducing greenhouse gases and expanding our base of clean power technologies so we can compete with China in this newest global industry. It ain't perfect, but it ain't beanbag. And if we don't start now, every solar panel, electric car and wind turbine we'll have to buy when climate change really hits will come with instructions in Chinese. Go Green Tea Party.

HEADLINE: A Euro-Style David Vs. Minivan Goliaths

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
SOME cars just make sense. But that doesn't mean Americans will like them. 
 For instance, Americans have largely dismissed the station wagon, preferring taller-riding crossovers by as much as 10 to 1. But the compact van known in much of the world as an M.P.V. -- for multipurpose vehicle -- can't even claim the Brady-Bunch nostalgia of the station wagon. 
 In Europe, where gasoline averages about $7 a gallon, M.P.V.'s like the Renault Scenic, the Opel Zafira from General Motors and the Ford Focus C-Max are the ubiquitous answer to this basic question: How can I afford to move my family around without drilling for oil in my backyard?
 But here, measured against hulking ''minivans,'' the rare M.P.V.'s have been seen as scrawny and suspiciously ''euro'' -- the way soccer players are dismissed by rabid N.F.L. fans. 
 If that's not challenge enough, the Mazda 5 -- the only pure M.P.V. (with sliding doors) on the market -- is still a minivan, writ small but no less boxy. Social monitors in the neighborhood might view the Mazda as carrying all the minivan's suburban-square baggage, while simultaneously announcing that you couldn't afford a real one. 
 But that would be unfair. First, there are signs that the big-crushes-all mentality, once as secure as an armored Hummer, is just one gas-price spike away from being shattered forever. Second, all it takes is a whip around the neighborhood to make you realize that Mazda's mouse is sportier than its elephantine rivals. 
 There is good reason for this: at barely 15 feet long, with an unloaded weight of less than 3,500 pounds, the Mazda is nearly two feet shorter and a half-ton lighter than a Honda Odyssey. 
 And the Mazda is just a smart family car, because it combines the good parts of a minivan -- three rows of seats, easy entering and exiting, unimpeded views -- with the exterior footprint, maneuverability and price of a compact. For all the cavernous virtues of an Odyssey or a Toyota Sienna, those minivans can top $40,000, on par with luxury sedans.
 The Mazda starts at less than half that: $19,260 with a 5-speed manual transmission. The midlevel Touring version that I tested, with an automatic transmission, goes out the door for $22,235. The priciest Grand Touring model starts at $23,755 and tops $27,000 when equipped with options like a navigation system and DVD player.
 One cannot help but admire a machine that combines sporty and utilitarian virtues at such a reasonable price. Yet there's no denying that this cute vanlet is a niche vehicle that faces stiff competition, not just from larger vans, but from wagons and from compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. (The Mazda's most direct rival is the Kia Rondo, which has conventional hinged rear doors.) 
 The 5 may undercut the big minivans by $10,000 or more, but it isn't as plush, powerful or quiet. And while the Mazda can haul six people to the movies, you can forget packing that sextet for a trip to the Grand Canyon unless you strap a few children to the roof. 
 The Mazda's interior is straightforward and well finished. There's a whiff of economy car in the plastics and fabrics, offset by nicer touches like sporty gauges and a leather-wrapped automatic shifter that protrudes from the dashboard.
 Fold the third row flat, and there's a generous 44.4 cubic feet of cargo space. With the second row down, the space expands to nearly 90 cubic feet. Both figures trump any compact crossover. But if six people are spread across the Mazda's seats, there's only 11.7 cubic feet of storage behind the third row. That space is on par with the three-row RAV4. Yet here, the tale of the tape doesn't lie: if you are putting bodies in every seat, the Odyssey, Dodge Grand Caravan and other likesize vans can pack roughly three times as much cargo behind the rearmost row.
 That is one reason why Mazda executives see the 5 as ideally suited to families with one or two children. 
 The 5's sliding doors are cleverly engineered. Though they are not power-operated, they open and close so weightlessly that a small child can operate them, yet they don't require the heavy (and trouble-prone) electric motors of larger minivans. 
 Those doors create a huge, nearly 28-inch-wide entryway: If you pivot the second-row seats forward in a smooth one-touch operation, the Mazda offers access to the third row that no hinged-door model can touch.
 When opened, those manual doors also hug the vehicle's sides more than the electric portals of other minivans. Throw in a body that's eight inches narrower than the Odyssey's, and the Mazda is especially easy to load or off-load in tight parking slots or garages. At the rear, the liftgate opens just high enough for a six-footer to stow gear without having to duck below it. 
 To get everyone to fit, the Mazda takes a socialist approach to resource-sharing. The front seats are normal, except for their captain's-chair folding armrests (which are so stubby only a T-Rex might find them useful). But the second- and third-row seats are subtly shrunken to maximize the space and allow all that magical flat-folding. 
 When I sat in the second row, the top of the seatback ended at my shoulder blades. And in the third row, taller riders need to slide the headrest up some 10 inches to get support for their heads.
 The second row has three inches less legroom than the CR-V or RAV4, though you can slide the seat back nearly four inches to expand the space. A theater-seating layout, with each row positioned slightly higher than the one ahead, helps to stave off claustrophobia. That's combined with the Mazda's fantastic outward views, aided by pleasingly low window sills and enormous vistas of glass.
 Some car critics have complained that the Mazda's third row is strictly for children, and it is true that knee space and foot room are tight back there. But when I was forced into the way-back space, with my 3-year-old daughter sitting ahead of me (thrilled at seeing Dad relegated to the cheap seats), I found that a lone adult rider can fully stretch his legs down the center aisle, making the journey surprisingly comfortable. 
 Motivation comes from a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder with 153 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. Even without a load, the 5 is on the slow side, running from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 9.7 seconds. With passengers aboard while climbing steep foothills north of New York City, the Mazda sweated a bit to make speed. While the Mazda engine is one of the smoother 4-bangers around, no magic of balance shafts or engine mounts can make it as quiet and vibration-free as a 6- or 8-cylinder. Still, the Mazda will still cruise effortlessly at 80 m.p.h. 
 And if there's not much of Mazda's signature ''zoom zoom'' in the acceleration, there's plenty elsewhere. Despite noticeable body roll on turns, the steering and suspension are joyfully sharp, sensitive and fun -- you just have to work at it. Once I pledged to keep that little motor on full boil, working the shifter's manual function like mad, the 5 responded in kind. It's hard to say how many family owners want to carve turns in a minivan, but with the 5 it can be done. And for 2010, the 5 gets electronic stability control -- a valuable safety feature -- as standard equipment. 
 Among vans, the fuel economy battle goes to the Mazda, with the 5 rated at 21 m.p.g. in town, and 27 on the highway (22/28 with the 5-speed manual), compared with 17/25 for an Odyssey (with an engine that shuts down cylinders at cruising speed).
 Shoppers should know that Mazda intends to replace the 5 with a redesigned version next year. But as a second heads-up, that new version will also add the grinning-idiot front fascia that currently disfigures the otherwise brilliant Mazda 3 compact car. 
 With carmakers working to bolster their fleetwide fuel economy, the Mazda will soon have some serious competition. Future rivals include the seven-passenger Ford C-Max, which shares its platform with the Mazda and will reach showrooms in late 2011. Chevrolet will offer its Orlando that year; that seven-passenger M.P.V. may eventually adopt the Volt's plug-in hybrid technology.
 It's another sign that the world is shrinking and that car styles long popular in Europe -- including these compact people-movers -- may establish themselves here. 
 At this rate, those N.F.L. fans will start rooting for Real Madrid and noshing on brie and quiche.

HEADLINE: They're Calling Almost Everyone's Tune

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
''It's tough to handle this fortune and fame.
 Everybody's so different; I haven't changed.''
 -- Joe Walsh, ''Life's Been Good''
 LOS ANGELES
 FOR a man who sits atop one of the most feared corporations in the music business, Irving Azoff seems surprisingly proud of his middle finger. Images of it, raised high and defiant, are hard to avoid in his home, a 12,000-square-foot mansion in one of the richest neighborhoods in this city.
 There he is, the chairman of the newly merged Ticketmaster and Live Nation, staring from behind his digit of choice in a photograph on his stationery. And there he is again, grinning from the same vantage point in an image on a sweatshirt that he wears one afternoon when he offers a tour of his estate.
 Somehow, when deployed by Mr. Azoff, this obscene gesture seems less a profanity than a very succinct statement of personal philosophy. At roughly 5-foot-3 and at the age of 62 -- imagine an accountant who used to be a jockey -- he has a teenager's sense of humor and a rascally, triumphant style that has been the bane of his enemies and the delight of his allies for four decades. 
 ''He who dies with the most toys wins,'' read the front of a T-shirt that he once had made for employees of his artist management firm, which has handled acts like the Eagles, Steely Dan, and the Go-Gos. The back of the shirt read, ''Irving wins!''
 He has won often over the years, but his biggest victory might well have come on Jan. 25. That day, the Justice Department blessed a merger between Ticketmaster, the ticketing giant that Mr. Azoff has led since 2008, and Live Nation, the world's largest concert promotion company.
 Live Nation Entertainment, as the new company is called, is a colossus unlike anything the industry has ever seen. Ticketmaster has roughly 70 percent of the concert ticket market in the United States and is known for the ever-rising cost of an assortment of tacked-on fees, now as much a part of concert experience as sticky floors and shoving. Live Nation, led by Michael Rapino, 43, is a roll-up of regional promoters that now runs more than 22,000 events a year, many in the 127 amphitheaters and clubs that the company owns or operates. Total annual attendance is more than 50 million.
 Then there's the company's not-so-secret weapon, Front Line Management, a consortium of artist management agencies that Mr. Azoff started cobbling together in 2005. Front Line shepherds the careers of roughly 200 marquee solo artists and bands, ranging in age from Miley Cyrus to Willie Nelson and including Van Halen, Neil Diamond, Christina Aguilera, Kid Rock, Maroon 5 and the Kings of Leon.
 To say this new conglomerate has inspired fear in the live-concert business doesn't capture the extent of the quaking. A coalition of consumer groups and independent promoters lobbied hard against the merger, warning that Live Nation Entertainment could quietly threaten venue owners by hinting that if they dropped Ticketmaster, they would have a hard time booking Live Nation tours or Front Line talent. The coalition also said the new company would have something close to a monopolist's hand when it came to setting ticket fees.
 ''Now that it's united with Ticketmaster, the sky will be the limit when it comes to fees,'' says Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League. ''It's not enough to say 'If you don't like the high prices, don't go to the show.' We need a concert market that has real and robust competition.''
 In their first interviews since the merger was completed, Mr. Azoff and Mr. Rapino denied having much weight to throw around, saying that it's established artists who are really in charge.
 They say they are still trying to figure out new ways to generate revenue, and the two men acknowledged that if their companies weren't allowed to merge, Live Nation in particular would have been in awful financial shape.
 ''There's an old saying, 'It's easier to kill a business than to change,' '' says Mr. Rapino, now Live Nation Entertainment's C.E.O. ''We wanted to make sure we got married before we spent four years too long saying, 'God, we should have put these companies together.' ''
 That the Justice Department went along with this marriage surprised many who were expecting the Obama administration to pursue possible antitrust questions more aggressively and take the companies to court. But department officials contend that they extracted real concessions in a consent decree that prohibits an assortment of bullying tactics by the new company. The department also tried to gin up some competition in the ticketing market by, among other moves, forcing Ticketmaster to sell off a subsidiary called Paciolan in the hopes that it would become a serious competitor.
 Maybe that will happen, but for now, Mr. Azoff is as close to a commissioner for live music as this country has ever had. And he occupies this job at a time when labels, as a force in the market, are withering and bands are making the bulk of their income from concerts. Which is to say, more power than ever is concentrated in the live-music side of the business, and the business of live music is more concentrated than ever.
 Other executives in this industry have made greater fortunes, but Mr. Azoff is arguably the most powerful man in the history of pop music.
 ''This business has always had a lot of guys who wield a lot of decision-making power,'' he says, in a tone that suggests he doesn't have more influence than the music titans before him.
 IRVING AZOFF has never broken through as that staple of pop culture, the nationally known mogul. But it is not for lack of charisma, money or a flair for the outlandish. On occasions when he has found a restaurant's service slow, he has lit the menu on fire. He once had a gift-wrapped boa constrictor delivered to a manager whose wife he considered a bit treacherous.
 The accompanying happy-birthday note said: ''Now you have two of them!'' 
 ''My wife was involved in that one,'' says Mr. Azoff, chuckling. ''But it was a baby boa constrictor, in a cage. It actually was kind of a nice gift.''
 In music circles, he's been known as a savvy negotiator and a ferocious advocate for his artists, capable of sonorous shouting jags. ''Let's just say you had a ringing in your ears for a few days after he yelled at you,'' says Dave Lucas, a former concert promoter now with Live-360, which consults with music venues. ''You waited a while before you called back unless you wanted more.'' 
 Mr. Azoff is also known for bending the truth when it suits his purposes or those of his clients, a propensity that long ago earned him the nickname Swerving Irving. He has been surprisingly honest about his penchant for dissembling -- even saying so under oath, in a deposition in a lawsuit over the band Boston. After calling two music executives liars, he said, ''Come to think of it, you can't believe much of what I say, either.''
 ''That's Irving,'' says Don Engel, a lawyer who has worked both for and against Mr. Azoff. ''His game is, 'I say whatever I want, and if I change my mind, that's the new truth.' ''
 It's all part of the game, Mr. Azoff says: ''Various jobs that I've had require me to stand behind the curtain and -- what's the word? -- create an illusion. This is a business that requires different tactics at different times.''
 One recent afternoon, Mr. Azoff was sitting in his office, recovering from strep throat. He was about to hit the phones for a few hours of the quick conversations and messages that consume most of his waking life. First, however, he wanted to listen to Ms. Aguilera's newest single, ''Not Myself Tonight,'' which had just been uploaded to her Web site. It takes a minute or two to find the play button on the right Web page -- Internet-proficient, the man is not -- and suddenly the tune is blasting out of a pair of speakers at concert volume. 
 ''It's dance-y,'' he yells over the din. 
 During this three-hour visit, Mr. Azoff is flip, funny and kind of cuddly, at least when he talks to his musician clients. His wife, Shelli, is home and visiting with a few friends, but the house is so large that we won't cross paths. His 12-year-old son is in the backyard getting a tennis lesson. There's also a guest cottage here that's been turned into a gym and a separate building for a pool table and a Ping-Pong table. 
 His favorite toy, though, is a gleaming $110,000 black Tesla, an electric car he says is the fastest car he's ever owned. (''And I've owned Ferraris. I've owned Porsches.'') He offers a demonstration and we inch down his driveway, past his koi pond, through a set of slowly opening gates. When Mr. Azoff reaches the street, he punches the accelerator, and the car lunges to about 70 m.p.h. in under four seconds.
 ''Need I say more?'' he cackles, barely braking in time for a stop sign. ''It's insane!'' 
 As he drives, he narrates a tour of the neighborhood. That's David Geffen's house, that's where Lucille Ball lived, Michael Jackson died in a house over there. He points to land beside his. ''This is an old widow, who's 86 years old,'' he says. ''I've got an option to buy this when she kicks.'' 
 Mr. Azoff is the last of a generation of rock entrepreneurs who started as young men in the early '70s, when rock transitioned out of its hippie, anti-establishment phase and into its professional, stadium-tour era. Some of his contemporaries retired rich. Most were flattened by trends and competition they never saw coming. For those without the instincts of a survivor, this is an industry with few happy endings. Its nearest analog isn't an industry at all; it's politics. Alliances shift, backs are stabbed and most people have at least three agendas, only one of which they will discuss candidly.
 Consider the saga of Ticketmaster and Live Nation.
 IN the years before their courtship, these companies were on the verge of war.
 For a long time, Live Nation had been Ticketmaster's biggest customer: if you wanted a ticket to a Live Nation site, Ticketmaster sold it to you. But Mr. Rapino looked enviously at Ticketmaster's balance sheet, which showed a steadier business with higher margins and less agita. Today, if you buy a ticket to a Lady Gaga concert, you'll need to hand over a $2.50 ''facility charge,'' as well as a $15.45 ''convenience charge'' and $2.50 if you want to print your ticket at home.
 Some of that money goes back to promoters as rebates -- a practice that Ticketmaster pioneered -- but Ticketmaster keeps most of it. So, in 2007, Live Nation told Ticketmaster that it would not renew its contract and began developing a ticketing platform of its own.
 For a fleeting moment, it looked as if price competition was coming to the concert business.
 But ticketing technology is notoriously tricky, and Live Nation's ran into a rather infamous glitch in February 2009, when Phish fans briefly overwhelmed the system. Even so, Live Nation's ticketing ambitions helped persuade Ticketmaster to merge, in part because Live Nation was starting to make overtures to venues with Ticketmaster clients. Ticketmaster had a choice: it could either merge with the company that had once provided about 15 percent of its revenue, or compete against it.
 For Live Nation, there were plenty of reasons to join Ticketmaster. Live Nation was saddled with so much debt -- about $800 million, much of it for maintaining venues and for upfront fees for artists -- that Mr. Rapino worried about becoming a takeover target. In March 2009, its stock traded for less than $3 a share.
 To Mr. Rapino, it was either an all-out battle, which could have devastated his company, or a merger he regards as win-win for everyone. Certainly, Live Nation Entertainment has benefited. When Ticketmaster and Live Nation announced the merger in February 2009, as Wall Street neared its bear-market low, they said the new company would be worth $816 million. It's now worth $2.8 billion.
 But Mr. Rapino says that fans and artists will come out ahead, too. His goal is to turn Ticketmaster's Web site into live music's answer to Amazon.com, allowing him to sell merchandise, fan club memberships and so on. ''Now,'' he says, ''I'm not just a guy with the stage who puts on the show.''
 Mr. Rapino is sipping a Fresca in Live Nation's office in a sleek, modern building in Beverly Hills. He has a closely trimmed beard and black hair in what could be described as a mulletlike cut. He was raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and started his own promotion company after college, which was bought by Clear Channel Communications, the radio and concert giant. He went to work there and became known for assembling facts for snazzy presentations. He was also regarded as a ruthless infighter and a shameless, if slightly tin-eared, self-promoter.
 On this particular afternoon, he has just come from a meeting with Dave Stewart, best known as the male half of the Eurythmics. Before Mr. Stewart leaves, he drops by Mr. Rapino's office to say goodbye.
 What was he doing there?
 ''When the Internet came about,'' Mr. Stewart replies, ''the artist realized, well hang on, you can't steal a ticket for a seat, so we started to lean more toward, I don't really want a record deal, I want to be aligned with somebody who can help me sell tickets. But then I want a company that can use that music and that seat to get ancillary revenues'' -- from things like food, beverages and sponsorships -- ''to help me survive.''
 Mr. Rapino nods through all this. ''He said it better than I can,'' he says, sounding awed.
 The relationship between Mr. Rapino and artists is complicated. On the one hand, he must be deferential and accommodating, because without a regular caravan of acts, he has nothing but empty seats and red ink. At the same time, some artists are exasperating, though Mr. Rapino is far too diplomatic to say so.
 Instead, he'll simply note that artists -- at least the famous ones -- are in a position these days to define their own destiny. And without question, that destiny includes higher ticket prices. The average price of a ticket to one of the top 100 tours soared to $62.57 last year from $25.81 in 1996, according to Pollstar, far outpacing inflation. The interesting question is why.
 Mr. Rapino's theory is that musicians are just benefiting from the same trends that have enriched other superstars, like athletes and actors.
 ''The ticket was underpriced 40 years ago,'' he says.
 Rival promoters see another culprit in high ticket prices: Live Nation. The company, they say, represents a consolidation of regional promoters that didn't just coincide with rising ticket prices but also helped cause them. Ticket prices, in this telling, have gone up because the largest promoter has been paying whatever-it-takes sums to get bands in the door -- both to drive out competitors and to bring in desperately needed revenue to cover fixed overhead costs and to fill up seats. The company's biggest outlays include ''360 deals'' with Jay-Z, Madonna, U2 and others, giving the company a stake in tours, recording and merchandise profits in exchange for nine-figure paydays. Jay-Z's deal was reportedly worth more than $150 million.
 ''Look at what has happened to ticket prices, and the price of everything else at a concert, over the last 10 years, right when consolidation was happening,'' says John Scher, who books shows in Madison Square Garden, at Radio City Music Hall and elsewhere in New York. ''I talk to college kids all the time and they tell me that going to a show at an arena or an amphitheater is just beyond what they can afford. And it's because Live Nation has been paying the acts these outrageous sums, which is just alienating the fan base.''
 Mr. Rapino denies overpaying for bands, and says that the price of tickets often triples when they're sold by scalpers, which suggests that they were actually underpriced.
 Then again, when Mr. Rapino was describing the parlous condition of the concert business in front of Congress last year, he noted that 40 percent of concert tickets go unsold, a statistic that he offered as a symptom of an industry in distress but that might just be evidence that Live Nation and its rivals don't know how to price and sell their products. Today, as high as ticket prices are, Live Nation earns none of its profit from ticket revenue. The artists get nearly all of that. Live Nation's earnings come from stuff sold on site, like beer, parking and advertising.
 While there is plenty of argument about what combination of forces caused ticket prices to go up as Live Nation's share of ticket money went down, there is a broad consensus about one of those forces.
 The force is named Irving Azoff.
 MR. AZOFF started by booking rock concerts in high school and later dropped out of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to work as an artist manager. The folk rocker Dan Fogelberg, whom he met in college, was his first client, and then came REO Speedwagon, an unknown at the time. Next was the future Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh.
 ''We met one night at the Whiskey a Go Go,'' says Mr. Walsh, referring to a club on the Sunset Strip. Mr. Walsh says his solo career was in a rut, and he was broke. ''So I said: 'You can manage me. But first you have to help me trash this dressing room.' And we threw everything everywhere.''
 This was one of the secrets to Mr. Azoff's career: He didn't just join the juvenile behavior of his acts. He encouraged and led it. He started food fights on planes. He reveled in pranks. He assumed that there was no amount of mayhem that a few $100 bills couldn't fix. When Mr. Walsh wanted a room that connected to Mr. Azoff's and a hotel had none to offer, Mr. Azoff dispatched an underling to a hardware store to buy a chain saw, which Mr. Walsh used to cut a makeshift door.
 ''Then he bought me a case so I could bring the chain saw on the road,'' Mr. Walsh says. ''Just having a chain saw when you're on the road, you can accomplish an awful lot. You don't even need to start it.''
 For all his frat-boy shenanigans, Mr. Azoff had a Doberman's instincts about protecting his clients. Plenty of managers at the time became rich by keeping clients in the dark about their finances, arguing that mixing commerce and art was bad for the music. He did the opposite.
 ''Irving basically said, 'I'll bring you into the negotiation,' '' says Cameron Crowe, who wrote a profile of Mr. Azoff for Rolling Stone and became a friend. ''You'd go to his office and Dan Fogelberg would be sitting across from Irving, just watching the show.''
 Mr. Azoff was part of the defiant counterculture but was fluent in the language of contracts and comfortable mixing it up in corporate suites. He also had great intuition about how to psychologically size up both foes and friends, and he could sweet-talk and charm as convincingly as he could erupt in rage. 
 ''We met him in 1975 right when my partner Walter Becker and I had decided to give up touring,'' says Donald Fagen of Steely Dan. ''We expected him to say, 'You guys have to tour if you expect a career.' Instead, he said, 'I'm going to triple your album sales without you touring.' Maybe he kind of guessed at what we wanted to hear, which is a kind of business genius itself.''
 But the place where Mr. Azoff's style would have the widest and most lasting impact was on the road. 
 The concert business was regional at the time, and many promoters had rather creative ways of divvying up the spoils. Some would subtract fictional overhead costs from the band's share -- for replacing the hockey ice under the stage, for instance, even if the ice was intact through the entire show. In the movie ''Almost Famous,'' a slick new manager pitches his services to a band by asking, ''Do you know to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards at Chicago Stadium?''
 That was an Irving Azoff line, says Mr. Crowe, who wrote and directed the movie.
 ''He'd come out of Urbana-Champaign with a knowledge of where the bodies were buried because he was a booking agent in his previous life, and he'd buried them,'' Mr. Crowe says. ''At the time, there was a lot of mystery about promoting concerts and a lot of promoters had a wonderful ride until Irving came to town.''
 His expertise was determining exactly how much money the promoter stood to pocket from a show, always a closely guarded secret. He'd send an employee into the parking lot to count the number of cars paying parking fees. He'd call the food concession and ask for sales data. What he couldn't sleuth out on his own, he would coax from one of the promoter's underlings, who were often eager to curry favor with the great Irving Azoff.
 ''Every guy working at the lower level in this business dreams of moving up,'' says Mr. Azoff, shrugging as though this particular idea didn't take a genius.
 He added up all the numbers and argued that when it came time to split the proceeds, this revenue should be considered, too. Why not? Without the talent, there were no fans to pay for food and parking. Knowing how much the promoter was earning on a given night, Mr. Azoff could ask for a larger cut of ticket revenue.
 The promoters, he'd say, could keep the money earned at the venue, but in exchange they'd have to give Mr. Azoff and his acts a greater cut of ticket revenue than they typically handed over. Ninety percent, to be precise. It became known as ''the Irving deal.''
 THE Irving deal pinched the margins of every promoter. But none were pinched quite like those of an entrepreneur named Robert F. X. Sillerman, who began a buying spree of regional promoters in late 1996, ultimately spending more than $1 billion, most of it borrowed. How would Mr. Sillerman turn a profit? By selling more ads and sponsorships, he said. Great, replied Mr. Azoff. His bands will take 90 percent of that income.
 ''I said, 'Of course you're going to give me 90 percent of the money, Bob,' '' says Mr. Azoff, remembering a contentious phone call. '''That's our standard split or we're not going to play. How many people do you think will pay to see Robert Sillerman at the Boston Garden?''
 This was posturing, to a degree -- Mr. Azoff didn't really expect 90 cents of every ad dollar. But he was reminding Mr. Sillerman of a simple principle. If a promoter was going to earn money from some new source, he'd have to share some of it with Mr. Azoff's bands.
 Ultimately, Mr. Sillerman didn't even try to make his conglomeration, SFX, a viable long-term venture. Instead, in 2000, he sold the company to Clear Channel for $3.3 billion in stock and the assumption of $1.1 billion in SFX debt, a sum that seemed preposterously high to many in the industry. Five years later, as Clear Channel stock languished, the concert business was spun off -- and Live Nation was born.
 That same year, Mr. Azoff decided to ''fight clout with clout,'' as he puts it. He started consolidating management firms, reportedly with more than $100 million raised from sources including the Warner Music Group and a private equity firm, Thomas H. Lee Partners. Many of the management firms took a lump-sum check against a share of future profits.
 ''His pitch was, 'Let's create a big company that gives the artists a power base,' '' says Clint Higham, a manager at Morris Artist Management in Nashville, whose clients include Kenny Chesney.
 In 2008, Ticketmaster, which had owned a piece of Front Line, bought Warner Music's minority stake for $123 million. As part of that deal, Mr. Azoff became the C.E.O. of both companies.
 A year later, Mr. Azoff set aside his ambition to ''fight clout with clout,'' and Live Nation and Ticketmaster unveiled the mother of all music industry mergers.
 THE Justice Department considered the merger, and negotiated with the parties, for just under a year. Ultimately, officials approved the deal after what they described as significant changes. 
 First, there is an attempt in the consent decree to jump-start two ticketing competitors -- Paciolan, the aforementioned subsidiary, which was sold to Comcast; and the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which was granted the right to sell tickets using Ticketmaster's technology for the next five years, in exchange for a royalty fee to Live Nation Entertainment. A.E.G., Live Nation's closest rival in the promotion business, has the option after five years to build its own platform or buy Ticketmaster's source code.
 ''Our hope is that there will be competitive choice for venues,'' Christine Varney, the department's antitrust chief, said in a phone interview. ''Whether that'll mean lower prices for fans, we'll see, but we think that the more competitors there are in this field, the more likely it is that prices will go down.''
 To many, the government's effort to nurse a couple of Ticketmaster rivals into fighting shape seems a long shot at best. But the government also won from Live Nation Entertainment a promise that it would not engage in certain anticompetitive behavior. The company's ticketing side, for instance, is barred from sharing data with the promotion side.
 That reflects the worry of promoters with Ticketmaster contracts that the hugely valuable information collected through ticket sales -- the e-mail addresses and the musical appetites of customers -- will be quietly exploited by Live Nation. There are penalties for violating the consent decree that Ms. Varney described as $10,000 a ticket, but a lot of promoters worry that the company could break the rules and that nobody would know.
 ''There is supposed to be this Chinese wall at the company,'' says Mitchell Frank, who books shows for a Los Angeles club, Echoplex. ''But really, what is to stop them from mining all the data that I collect?''
 If the merger presents so many potential hazards, why did the Justice Department approve it? 
 Several people familiar with the negotiations inside the department said that officials didn't think they had much choice. According to Jim Hurwitz, a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer who wrote a paper for the American Antitrust Institute arguing against the merger, Live Nation told the government that it was going to exit the ticketing market no matter what happened with this deal and that it would enter an informal alliance with Ticketmaster if it wasn't allowed to merge. On the other hand, if it was allowed to merge, the government could exert some control through a consent decree.
 In other words, Mr. Hurwitz explained, the choice presented to the Justice Department was this: either let us get married and have a say in our union or try to stop us -- in which case, we're just going to start seriously dating. ''My sense also is that Justice was worried about its prospects if it went to court, and it didn't want to lose its first major case,'' Mr. Hurwitz says.
 Ms. Varney of the Justice Department has disputed that notion, saying that it would have litigated if it hadn't won the concessions it wanted. 
 NOW that Live Nation Entertainment is a reality, how does it intend to grow? Mr. Azoff and Mr. Rapino are still coming up with answers. They want to improve Ticketmaster's e-commerce site and look for ways to sell merchandise, fan club memberships and so forth to people buying tickets. The two executives talk about new pricing models and a better fan experience.
 Potentially, these changes are revolutionary. For years, neither promoter nor ticketer has considered fans as the first priority. Ticketmaster's most important clients are venue owners. The promoter, of course, worries foremost about the artist. If you've ever attended a concert and felt treated like an afterthought, now you know why.
 But as Live Nation Entertainment tries to create this fan-friendly concert experience and improve its margins, it has tough trends to fight. The number of new bands with arena-packing power is dwindling. The company has made few inroads in hip-hop and rap. We live in a world of downloadable singles, but albums and artists' repertoires are what traditionally sell big tours.
 Then there is the problem that Mr. Azoff can blame only on himself. No matter what ideas Live Nation Entertainment conjures to generate more cash, artists are likely to demand part of the upside. They'll want the Irving deal. And why wouldn't they?
 ''We've squeezed every drop that there is to squeeze,'' Mr. Azoff replies, using ''we'' to refer to artists and managers. ''We've probably squeezed too much. But we're not going backward,'' and here the ''we'' switches to Live Nation Entertainment, ''so with this merger we're going to form new businesses through e-commerce so we don't have to go to artists and say 'We want to take back some ground.' ''
 When it comes time to negotiate the deals between artists and promoters, Mr. Azoff in many instances will have a seat on both sides of the table, a potential conflict of interest that he dismisses -- because he's been at this a long time, he says, and because everyone trusts him to do what it is fair for everyone.
 Does that group include fans? We are about to find out. Much about the concert business is now an open question, but what's clear is how much of the future resides in Mr. Azoff's impish little hands.

HEADLINE: Welcome to Queens. Please Stay Awhile.

BYLINE: By GREG BEYER

 BODY:
QUEENS PLAZA has the distinction of being the gateway to Queens, a traveler's first sight after alighting from Manhattan via the Queensboro Bridge. But that is not to say it has always been a sparkling example of a hospitable welcome. 
 For a long time the reputation of this industrial part of Long Island City owed more to strip clubs evicted from Times Square than anything else. Nor has the last decade brought rapid change to the area, tucked between Dutch Kills, to the north, and Hunter's Point to the south. 
 Not everyone would even call Queens Plaza a neighborhood. It consists of two wide streets, Queens Plaza North and Queens Plaza South, which traverse the three-quarters of a mile between the Sunnyside rail yards and the point where the Queensboro Bridge vaults over the East River to Manhattan.
 Yet development, even if gradual, has helped strengthen the area's identity -- having been given a big push in 2001 from an influential city rezoning and, since then, from new residents enamored of its unusually quick commute to Manhattan. Some believe the changes may signal Queens Plaza's future as one of those up-and-coming zones coveted by savvy investors and practical home shoppers. (Effects on the area's population, which the census 10 years ago put at almost 8,000, remain unclear.) 
 Businesses are investing. Last month, JetBlue Airways announced that it would soon quit its Forest Hills headquarters and move its nearly 1,000 employees to a historic building on Queens Plaza North (the runner-up site was Orlando, Fla.). Similarly Gotham Center, a 21-story glass building rising on the site of the former Queens Municipal Parking Garage, will by next year house the city's Department of Health, bringing 2,800 employees into the neighborhood. There is an increasing supply of hotels, from budget to luxury; a number of new places are up and running, and more are on the way.
 The city is also in the process of replacing sidewalks and lighting, and adding crosswalks and bicycle lanes. 
 ''You have a real sense of activity and movement,'' said Gayle Baron, the executive director of the Long Island City Business Improvement District. ''It's not all fully realized yet, but it's really coming, and you see how far it's progressed in the past four or five years.'' 
 She says her hope is that the improved streetscape and residential appeal of the area will spur the ''normal evolution of services,'' bringing in retail outlets, sit-down restaurants, drugstores and other amenities that have generally been lacking. And lately she has noted several hopeful indicators like the opening last year of the speakeasy-style cocktail lounge Dutch Kills on Jackson Avenue a few blocks from the Queens Plaza subway station.
 Andy Gerringer, a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman who has worked throughout Long Island City, sees the Queens Plaza area as having ''grown by leaps and bounds,'' but said it still lacked shopping. ''You don't see the retail,'' he added, ''and once that comes in, it becomes more of a neighborhood.'' 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 In many ways the area has the aesthetic contradictions to be expected from a place in transition. Not far from condominium buildings with doormen and plush lobbies, there are isolated blocks flanked by the opaque windows of unoccupied industrial buildings. The Queensbridge Houses, the city's largest public project, is just north of the Plaza, near the East River; its 26 buildings are home to almost 7,000 people. Just south of the Plaza are the Silvercup Studios, where shows like ''Gossip Girl'' and ''30 Rock'' are taped.
 Strip clubs like Scandals and Cityscapes Gentlemen's Club are reminders of the Plaza's past: such clubs settled in when the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani forced them from Times Square in the 1990s, though residents and neighborhood advocates say attendant issues like prostitution -- along with a number of the clubs themselves -- have largely dissipated.
 Jeffrey Travia, the deputy director of the business improvement district, guessed that people living just off the Plaza were still more likely to say they lived in Long Island City. But as condos rise and businesses and people move in, he said, an identity may solidify. 
 It was a mix of factors that attracted Henry Lee. As a college student, he had been living with his parents in Little Neck, Queens. When he graduated and got a job at an accounting firm on 40th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan, he (his entire family, in fact) began to consider Queens Plaza. 
 In early 2007, his parents helped him with a down payment on a 730-square-foot one-bedroom condo with a balcony, in a building called Queens Plaza on 27th Street, just north of the Plaza. Mr. Lee, 28, paid the list price of $430,000. About a year later his parents helped his brother, Philip, 30, buy a one-bedroom in a nearby condo, View 59.
 Henry Lee estimates his door-to-door commute is 15 minutes. ''Basically if you work in Midtown,'' he said, ''it doesn't get any better in terms of the commute.''
 ''It's probably not the most convenient area in terms of eating and shopping,'' he added. ''You'd really have to take the subway and travel one stop in either direction.'' 
 When Mr. Gerringer of Prudential Douglas Elliman started selling in the neighborhood about five years ago, he said most buyers were Manhattan renters who realized they could afford to buy in Long Island City. In the last three years, however, he has seen the buyer population diversify; there are more from Long Island, Brooklyn, and elsewhere in Queens, as well as an influx of Asian-American buyers.
 Shana Bowes, a broker at aptsandlofts.com, said that in addition to the Manhattan commute, residents like the ease of travel to ''get out to their families that are further out in Queens.''
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 The rezoning paved the way for several luxury condo buildings (including a few, in various stages of completion, with uncertain futures). 
 One-bedrooms range from the low $400,000s to nearly $500,000, said Harold Valestin, a broker for the Developers Group. Two-bedrooms range from the low $600,00s to about $700,000.
 At Queens Plaza, the condo where Mr. Lee lives, all units for sale have two bedrooms and two baths; Ms. Bowles says they cost $573,500 to $595,000. 
 In the last year, she said, units have been staying on the market for about a month, and selling at about $550 a square foot. Mr. Gerringer says that in the last year units throughout Long Island City, often closer to the water, have been priced closer to $700 a square foot.
 Ms. Bowes said that selling units for about 10 percent under market value had kept sales steady in spite of the recession. But she has seen some evidence of its influence: Last year, a foreign investor entered negotiations to buy 17 units but backed out. 
 There are also rentals. Packard Square, on Crescent Street just off Queens Plaza North, has studios for $1,675 and one-bedrooms for $2,000. Jermain Miller, a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman who represents View 59, on Queens Plaza at Crescent Street, highlighted an available one-bedroom rental for $2,200 and a four-bedroom penthouse rental for $4,500. Mr. Miller suspects that some people are still put off by Queen's Plaza's past. ''I think if you can see the opportunity to purchase in one of those buildings or in that area right now,'' he said, ''it would be a phenomenal purchase.''
 THE SCHOOLS
 The four nearest elementary schools include William Hallet, No. 076; last year 59 percent of fourth graders met standards in English and 85 percent in math, versus 69 and 85 citywide.
 Among the four closest middle schools is Jacob Blackwell, No. 111, for prekindergarten through Grade 8. In 2009, 60 percent of eighth graders met standards in English, 64 percent in math, versus 57 and 71 citywide.
 At the Academy of American Studies, which serves Grades 9 through 12, SAT averages last year were 483 in reading, 494 in math and 487 in writing, versus 435, 432 and 459 citywide.
 WHAT TO DO
 Queensbridge Park, in the shadow of the bridge, offers spectacular views of Manhattan across the East River. 
 Nearby, the Ravel Hotel's rooftop bar, Penthouse 808, offers a striking panorama of the city. 
 The Foundry, on Ninth Street off Queens Plaza South, is an example of efforts to preserve the area's industrial past. Once a site for melting and casting, it is a vine-covered brick building now used as a private event space.
 THE COMMUTE
 The subway trip to Rockefeller Center from Queens Plaza takes eight minutes. The neighborhood has two stations: One, at Queens Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, serves the E, R and V lines; the other, at Queens Plaza near 27th Street, serves the 7, N and W. Queens Plaza is also a hub for buses, including the 32 and 60 to Manhattan and the 102 to Astoria.
 THE HISTORY
 The 1909 construction of the Queensboro Bridge drove the area's development. ''Long Island City,'' by the Greater Astoria Historical Society, notes that in ensuing years Queens Plaza, ''with the borough hall, chamber of commerce, and temples of finance, was the financial and political center of Queens.''

HEADLINE: Drafted Together, Ending Up Far Apart

BYLINE: By PETE WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Giants defensive tackle Chris Canty is entering the second of a six-year, $42 million contract that includes $17.25 million guaranteed. Like many professional athletes, he is in an enviable financial position at age 27.
 Fred Gibson was drafted one pick ahead of Canty toward the end of the fourth round in the 2005 N.F.L. draft. At 28, he is out of football and working toward completing his undergraduate degree at the University of Georgia. Gibson played on the practice squads of three teams, including the Giants, but never saw action in an N.F.L. game.
 Throw a dart at any round-by-round list of any N.F.L. draft, and it is possible to come up with players selected back to back and discover diverse career paths. For all of the prognostication that occurred during the just-completed draft, it is impossible to predict how a player's career will pan out. 
 The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Gibson with the 131st overall pick, right before the Dallas Cowboys took Canty, who was a defensive end from the University of Virginia.
 Both players thought they would be selected much earlier. Gibson invited dozens of friends and family members to a draft party at a community center near his childhood home in Waycross, Ga.
 Canty, who had endured a serious knee injury and a detached retina in the eight months before the draft, limited his viewing party to immediate family members at his parents' home in Charlotte, N.C. Like Gibson, he did not hear his name called during the draft's first three rounds, which from 1988 until this year were held on a Saturday.
 ''It's a blow to your ego at first,'' Canty said. ''So much is made prior to the draft about where you're chosen and how the more money you're paid initially, the more opportunities you'll have. You have to get the job done no matter where you're taken.''
 As a rookie, Canty thrived playing under Bill Parcells in a 3-4 defense similar to the one Canty played at Virginia under Al Groh. After four seasons with the Cowboys, Canty signed as a free agent with the Giants. Coach Tom Coughlin, like Groh, had been a Parcells assistant.
 At Georgia, Gibson was such a highly regarded athlete that he played basketball and football for two years before concentrating on wide receiver. Rail thin, he struggled to put on weight before the draft. The Steelers cut Gibson in training camp. He declined a practice-squad invitation and instead joined the Miami Dolphins as a practice player. He was the only one of the Steelers' draft picks not to make the team, which went on to win the Super Bowl after the 2005 season.
 He spent two seasons with the Dolphins, never on the active roster, and later spent time in training camps or practice squads with the Atlanta Falcons, the St. Louis Rams and the Giants. He played briefly in the Canadian Football League and even dusted off his basketball skills to play in the N.B.A.'s Development League. Last summer, Gibson returned to college at Georgia, where he is two semesters shy of his undergraduate degree in housing and consumer economics. He said he planned to pursue a career in the government or perhaps coaching
 Like Canty, Gibson received a draft signing bonus of about $300,000. Unlike Canty, he has never earned $100,000, let alone millions, for a single season. Gibson said he might have stuck in the N.F.L. if he had more versatile skills as a special-teams player. He now supports a 4-year-old daughter; he and her mother no longer are together.
 ''I saved my money because I came to the realization that I no longer can base my life on sports,'' Gibson said. ''It's weird, though. I've never had to have a real job. I've been playing sports all my life.''Like Gibson, Canty said he recognized that he had a lower margin for error as a fourth-round pick. Teams are more patient with players they give bigger signing bonuses. That and his predraft injuries inspired him to work even harder as a rookie.
 Canty was part of a banner Cowboys draft in 2005 that included the Pro Bowl players DeMarcus Ware (first round), Marion Barber (fourth) and Jay Ratliff (seventh). Canty said he occasionally looked back at the 2005 draft list.
 ''You have first-round guys who didn't pan out and seventh-round guys like Jay who ended up in the Pro Bowl,'' Canty said. ''What matters isn't the draft but what you do when you get there.''
 Pete Williams followed Fred Gibson and Chris Canty in 2005 for the book ''The Draft: A Year Inside the NFL's Search for Talent.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pushing Pedals, Not Budgets

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS

 BODY:
IT was a busy day. In the morning, I'd followed a creek as far upstream as I could, until it disappeared underground. At midday, I'd stopped in town for a slice of pepperoni pizza. And in the afternoon, I'd explored a chain-link-fence maze at the edge of a university. Now, with dinnertime approaching, I was pedaling home on the trusty bicycle that had taken me to the far corners of my world. I was 10 years old.
 That blue BMX may have been the last bike I owned, but in the past quarter-century I've never lost my appreciation for the freedom of movement that two wheels offer. Powered not by expensive gas but by cheap leg energy, easy and usually free to park, bicycles are perhaps the ideal vehicle for a frugal traveler, capable of taking you across a city or, if you have the time and ambition, around the world. 
 They can, however, get pricey, whether you're renting a hybrid for a couple of days or investing in a serious road bike that will take you coast to coast. And it only gets more complicated (and more expensive) when you're doing it in another city or another country. As usual, of course, there are a few ways of ensuring you're saving money on your ride. Let's talk about rentals first.
 In the ideal world, there would be a great Web site that could search out rentals all over the United States and beyond, that would let you filter the results by size and style (road bike, mountain bike and so on). And there is such a site -- sort of. RentaBikeNow.com is a searchable database of bike-rental outfits across North America that lets you narrow your quest for, say, tandem bikes in Montreal or mountain bikes near Flagstaff, Ariz.
 But RentaBikeNow.com has its limits. Looking for a rental in New York City? Well, the site lists only a single shop in the five boroughs: Pedal Pusher Bicycle Shop, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where road bikes cost $50 a day -- not very frugal.
 There are, of course, many other places to rent bikes in this city, but RentaBikeNow doesn't point users to them. Why not? Well, the site is only a year old, and shops have to opt in to get into the database. Maybe with time -- and a little publicity -- more shops will join up and RentaBikeNow will become more useful. Until then, you're probably better off Googling your destination with the words ''bike rental.'' 
 In the meantime, though, there are other options. Like, for instance, visiting a city that has a free (or nearly free) bike-rental program. Many of these are quite famous -- Paris's Velib' is probably the best known -- but cities in North America including Montreal and Irvine, Calif., have inaugurated similar programs. Two years ago, Washington, D.C., started SmartBike DC (smartbikedc.com), in which a $40 annual subscription gets you access (in three-hour increments) to bicycles at 10 locations throughout the nation's capital. Not a bad deal.
 The other cities and towns with bike-sharing systems are too numerous to mention, but the Bike-Sharing Blog (bike-sharing.blogspot.com) and a Wikipedia article on bicycle sharing systems(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle--sharing--system) keep good track of developments in that realm.
 In a sign that more travelers are demanding bicycles, many hotels, including the Sullivans Hotel in Perth, Australia, and Hotel Heldt in Bremen, Germany, now offer them to paying guests. Last spring at the Ace Hotel in Portland, Ore., I was overjoyed to make use of the free bikes provided to guests, and while that sort of service was to be expected in the cycling capital of America, it's nice to see it being expanded to other cities. Strangely enough, the New York branch of the Ace doesn't have bikes, but both the Bowery Hotel and the Jane (where rooms start at a fantastic $99 a night) downtown offer bikes for guests.
 Occasionally, rental shops don't carry a bike that's right for you. Or the price may simply be too high. For example, Bike and Roll (bikeandroll.com), which has rental shops in five major cities, charges about $39 a day for a basic cruiser in New York. That's cheaper than hopping in taxis all day, but it's considerably more than a one-day, unlimited Metrocard, at $8.25. 
 If you're staying somewhere for a week or longer, that quickly adds up, and it might be smarter to buy a used bicycle instead of renting. Craigslist is the obvious place to start looking. Right now, on the New York City site, I'm seeing road bikes on sale for as little as $50, and an intriguing Soviet-made folding bike for $140. If you can sell the bike at the end of your stay, you can recoup the entire cost. Listing a bike on Craigslist just requires a digital camera, an honest description and some downtime as you wait for customers to answer your classified ad. 
 There are a couple of big caveats here. First, as anyone who's ever owned a bike in New York City can tell you, bikes are stolen and resold with frightening regularity. Be wary of overly good deals and aggressive sellers; you don't want to contribute to this illegal underground marketplace. Also, you'll need a decent lock. Second, you get what you pay for. The cheaper the bike, the more unsuited it may be to your needs, and the more dangerous. Everyone I've spoken with says a full used-bike tune-up could cost about $100, which may be a worthy investment.
 There are a couple of ways to avoid these pitfalls. One is to skip Craigslist entirely and seek out used bikes at, say, yard, garage, tag or stoop sales. (The lingo varies with geography.) In Portland, I spotted $50 bikes at yard sales. Were they any good? No idea, but considering that the owners were right there, I could have quizzed them and taken a test ride.
 Another is to join a ''freecycling'' group. No, freecycling isn't specifically about bikes -- it's the idea of simply offering up all kinds of used items (lamps, beds, CD cases, photo frames and so on) to people who want them, usually through a Yahoo-based group and mailing list. Every once in a while, bikes come up on these lists, and if you're really lucky, you'll find one available wherever you're headed. When you're ready to come back home, just put it back on the freecycle list and watch it vanish back into the barter economy.
 A more reliable way of picking up a used bike is to seek out a refurbishing organization like Recycle-a-Bicycle (recycleabicycle.org). Primarily, Recycle-a-Bicycle runs programs through public schools that train kids in bicycle mechanics and lets them earn free bikes through volunteering. The bikes the kids refurbish, however, go on sale at the organization's East Village and Brooklyn locations, often for very reasonable prices. The bike won't need a tuneup, and it will have the shop's imprimatur when you try to sell it at the end of your visit.
 Finally, you can just take your own bike along. Last winter, in my holiday gift guide on the Frugal Traveler blog (nytimes.com/frugaltraveler), I recommended the Tokyo Citizen folding bike (citizenbike.com), which costs an insanely low $164 and weighs 29 pounds -- small enough to check in easily. (You'll want the $28 carrying bag as well.) Be careful, though. Some airlines will charge you for a bike, even if it's smaller or lighter than a similar-size piece of luggage. Before you fly, check out the International Bicycle Fund's (ibike.org) handy chart on which airlines charge what.
 Oh, and before you get on that lovely new cheap bike, do what you know your mother would ask you to: put on a helmet.

HEADLINE: Future Stars in the Spotlight At Three Student Tournaments

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
The dour economy seems to be hurting scholastic chess. 
 Every year, the United States Chess Federation holds championships for elementary, junior high and high school students, and this year the number of competitors is down significantly. 
 At the junior high tournament, held this month in Minneapolis, 930 players signed up, and the high school event, which ended last weekend in Columbus, Ohio, attracted 1,336 competitors. The elementary school championship, set for May 7-9 in Atlanta, has enrolled just over 1,600 students so far. 
 If those numbers do not change significantly, fewer than 4,000 students will have played in the three tournaments. Last year, when the events were all held in Nashville at the same time, there were more than 5,300 competitors. In previous years, the totals have usually topped 4,500 players. 
 Still, scholastic chess is far ahead of where it was decades ago, both in terms of the number of players and in the quality of the competition. It used to be fairly remarkable if there were even a few masters (with ratings above 2,200) in competition; this year there were 14 of them, including three on the winning team from Hunter College High School in New York City. 
 One of the Hunter students, Alec Getz, finished in a 10-way tie for the individual title. The winner in a tie-breaker was Kristopher Meekins of Ohio, another master. Meekins was leading by a point going into the last round, but then he lost to the top seed, Shinsaku Uesugi of Maryland. 
 The opening began as a Reti -- in which White allows Black to seize the center, with a plan to attack it later -- but it became a Catalan after 6 c4. 
 Meekins should have played 13 ... c5, which would have given him equal chances after 14 Qe2 cd4 15 Nd4 Bg2 16 Kg2 Qb7 17 Qf3 Qf3 18 Nf3 Nc5. Instead, 13 ... Re8 left him with a slightly worse position because of his weakness on the h1-a8 diagonal. 
 His decision to exchange bishops with 17 ... e5 was a strategic error because it gave Uesugi an outpost on d6 for his rook; 17 ... h6 would have been better. After 25 c5, Meekins could not escape. 
 Uesugi did not play the rest of the game as well as he could have. He could have played 32 Ra7 Ke6 33 Rc7, giving him two connected passed pawns. But the end was never in doubt, and Uesugi wrapped things up nicely with an exchange sacrifice beginning with 41 Bc6. Meekins resigned because he would have had to give up his rook to stop White's d pawn, leaving him with a hopeless endgame.

HEADLINE: Anatomy of a Benjamin

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER. 
Steven Heller writes the Visuals column for The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
Last week, the Treasury Department introduced its new $100 bill, a redesign intended to frustrate high-tech counterfeiters when it goes into circulation Feb. 10.
 The $100 bill, a favorite of forgers, is not only the highest-value denomination in general circulation, but also the most widely distributed and most counterfeited outside the United States. 
 Perhaps anticipating the criticism that accompanies anything new, a special-effects-laden ''unveiling'' video released by Treasury reveals a sensuously undulating $100 note as it enumerates the bill's security features.
 But how does the look of the new $100 bill compare with its predecessor?
 BENJAMIN FRANKLIN Old: The off-center oval is too large and unbalanced. New: Adding Franklin's shoulders and removing the background avoids the unbalanced look.
 COLOR Old: The green is elegantly traditional. New: The shifting-colored hues gives the bill a modern aesthetic.
 BACKGROUND AND WATERMARKS Old: Subtle. New: Too many and they look like smudges.
 COMPOSITION Old: Comparatively simple, yet the seals, type and other graphic elements seem disjointed and appear random. New: Many obtrusive graphic elements, including the security bars and watermarks, yet curiously the overall design is more unified.
 SECURITY RIBBON AND THREAD Old: Not there. New: Necessarily obtrusive. Gives the impression of a credit card or money order.
 FILIGREE (THE BORDER AROUND THE BILL) Old: Classic application gives the note an official banknote aesthetic. New: Reductivist and minimal application lightens the note and implies modernity but could unwittingly suggest deflation.
 NUMERALS Old: Well positioned in relation to filigree. New: Smaller is better, but the numbers are not well integrated into the filigree, making them look like an afterthought.
 BELL IN INKWELL (IN ORANGE) Old: Not there. New: Playful and unnecessary.
 DENOMINATION IN WORDS Old: Elegantly composed as part of the filigree. New: Squeezed too close to Franklin's forehead.
 SERIAL NUMBERS Old: Clear and unencumbered. New: Harder to read against watermarks and somewhat less legible for players of liar's poker.

HEADLINE: They've Got It: Fixes for the Financial System

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress is consumed by the proposed legislation to overhaul the financial system, with lawmakers clashing over the best ways to regulate derivatives, protect consumers and end taxpayer-supported bailouts.
 Most proposals in the Senate bill supported by President Obama amount to variations on the current system of regulation.
 But some scholars in finance, law and economics -- perhaps less inhibited by practical considerations -- see an opportunity to revolutionize the financial system. In books, papers and presentations, they have proposed an avalanche of ideas, some more outlandish than others. Here are a half-dozen; judge the merits for yourself.
 End the Dollar's Supremacy JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ 
 The housing bubble was inflated with vast sums borrowed from the rest of the world. Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist at Columbia, says the United States should surrender some of its borrowing power by trying to end the use of the dollar as the primary international reserve currency.
 The United States basically borrows money by printing dollars and selling them, in the form of Treasury securities, to China and other governments that hold those dollars in their financial reserves. The United States then uses the borrowed money to buy foreign goods. This system, Mr. Stiglitz says, has, in effect, made the United States the world's largest recipient of foreign aid.
 The inflow of foreign money also tends to create asset bubbles, such as the spike in housing prices, making the American economy much more vulnerable to disruption and crisis. If other nations no longer needed dollars, the United States would not be able to borrow money as easily. ''Knowing that it would be more difficult to borrow might curb America's profligacy,'' Mr. Stiglitz writes in ''Freefall: America, Free Markets and the Sinking of the World Economy'' (W. W. Norton, 2010).
 Give Bankruptcy a Chance THOMAS H. JACKSON
 When Lehman Brothers went to bankruptcy court in September 2008 after the government refused to rescue it, credit markets froze. The authorities quickly caved in and bailed out a bunch of other companies.
 Lehman's disorderly collapse, conventional wisdom says, showed that bankruptcy courts could not handle huge financial failures, because they were too slow, lacked the expertise and were not designed to consider the intricate linkages that hold financial companies together.
 The bills in Congress seek to design a federal ''resolution authority'' -- a way to arrange the orderly liquidation of giant financial companies -- modeled after the process the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation uses to take over failed banks.
 But Thomas H. Jackson, former president of the University of Rochester, says the panic was not caused by bankruptcy proceedings, but by letting Lehman fail in the first place. Under current law, parts of Lehman went through bankruptcy, while other subsidiaries could not.
 Among other changes, he calls for amending bankruptcy laws to cover companies -- retail banks, stock and commodity brokers and insurance companies -- so that large, complex institutions could be fully dealt with in court. And regulators would be able to pull the trigger.
 ''There's a lot to be said for a judicial process rather than a government agency process,'' says Mr. Jackson, author of an essay in ''Ending Government Bailouts as We Know Them'' (Hoover Institution, 2009). The legal system is more predictable and transparent and better established.
 Bonds Can Regulate Banks, Too ROBERT C. POZEN
 Many economists say that creditors, who determine how much banks can borrow and on what terms, are often better equipped than regulators to provide the market discipline that can keep banks from taking on too much risk.
 Unlike stockholders, bondholders have little to gain when banks take on risk in the hope of reward. What they want is a steady stream of income and the repayment of their loan. Corporate bonds tend to be held by institutions like mutual funds, hedge funds and insurance companies that have the time and resources to monitor their debtors.
 Robert C. Pozen, chairman of MFS Investment Management and author of ''Too Big to Save? How to Fix the U.S. Financial System'' (Wiley, 2010), wants to require banks to issue an existing kind of bond known as long-term subordinated debt. ''Subordinated debt is bought by very sophisticated investors who insist on conditions like capital requirements and covenants to make sure that banks don't take on too much risk,'' he says.
 Since their investment is not guaranteed and their time horizon is long term, such creditors have interests closely aligned with those of government regulators, says Mr. Pozen, who is also a lecturer at Harvard Business School.
 In a 2000 report, the Fed studied requiring banks to hold subordinated debt, but the idea went nowhere. Banks don't like it because such debt generally charges higher interest than other kinds of corporate bonds.
 Compound Interest 101 ANNAMARIA LUSARDI
 A person borrows $100 at an annual interest rate of 20 percent. How long does it take that debt to double? About four years. What share of American adults can figure that out? About one in three, says Annamaria Lusardi, an economist at Dartmouth College.
 Ms. Lusardi wants to add financial literacy to high school curriculums. A crisis sparked in part by the decisions of millions of Americans to take mortgage loans they could not afford has underscored her conviction that ''lack of financial knowledge is alarmingly widespread.''
 Only three states -- Missouri, Tennessee and Utah -- now require a course devoted to personal finance, according to the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, a nonprofit group. Another 18 states incorporate some lessons into other courses.
 ''Financial literacy is an essential piece of knowledge that every student should have,'' Ms. Lusardi wrote recently on her blog. ''Just as reading and writing became skills that enabled people to succeed in modern economies, today it is impossible to succeed without being able to 'read and write' financially.''
 Take the Money Out of Banks LAURENCE J. KOTLIKOFF
 Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a liberal economist at Boston University, wants to dismantle the banking system.
 Instead of checking accounts, people would place money in all-cash mutual funds. Savings accounts would be replaced by short-term funds that make conservative investments. And people could also place money in more adventurous funds that made mortgage loans, or extended lines of credit or played the market in derivatives.
 It is a system designed to reduce risk taking by preventing banks from gambling with other people's money.
 Depositors now relinquish control when they place money in a bank. The institution decides how to use the money and it keeps the profits -- or suffers any losses. Most banks also borrow large sums of money from investors to increase their lending and profits.
 Under Mr. Kotlikoff's model, called ''limited purpose banking,'' banks would manage families of mutual funds. No more borrowing. No more gambling. Except for office space, computers and furniture, banks could not hold any assets.
 ''Banks would simply function as middlemen,'' Mr. Kotlikoff writes in ''Jimmy Stewart Is Dead: Ending the World's Ongoing Financial Plague With Limited Purpose Banking'' (Wiley, 2010). ''Hence, banks would never be in a position to fail because of ill-advised financial bets.''
 Race to the Scene of a Disaster ANDREW W. LO
 When an airplane crashes, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board race to the scene to determine what happened to avoid future disasters. There is no comparable federal agency to look into financial catastrophes. After the 2008 market crash, more than a year passed before an inquiry commission, established by Congress, held its first hearing.
 Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wants the government to create a safety board for the financial industry. Unlike the current commission, this agency would be insulated from political pressure, staffed by professionals and able to criticize the government as well as businesses.
 ''It is unrealistic to expect that market crashes, manias, panics, collapses and fraud will ever be completely eliminated from our capital markets,'' Mr. Lo said at a House hearing in October. ''But we should avoid compounding our mistakes by failing to learn from them.''

HEADLINE: 2 Mob Museums in Las Vegas, Ready to Go to the Mattresses

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- The people of Chicago debate the Cubs versus the White Sox. In Philadelphia, the cheese steak purveyors Pat's and Geno's have long divided the citizenry. Soon, the residents of Las Vegas -- and the millions of people who visit -- will be able to argue over which museum best depicts the moral turpitude of organized crime.
 Dueling centers chronicling the history of the mob are planned for Las Vegas, and it seems almost certain that someone is going to get hurt. Well, feelings anyway. 
 ''I am not the least bit worried about them,'' Mayor Oscar B. Goodman said of the potential competition to the Las Vegas Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, a city-sponsored project he has championed for years. That museum is set to open next March in the old downtown federal courthouse, the site of the 1950 mob hearings led by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee.
 ''They are no competition because we are the real thing,'' said Mr. Goodman, a former defense lawyer for reputed Mafia figures. ''Forget about it.''
 But the rival, which involves the daughter of the famed Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana, is promising a collection of mob memorabilia in the Tropicana casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 
 ''Our experience will be very different from theirs,'' said Carolyn Farkas, the spokeswoman for the museum, the Las Vegas Mob Experience. ''Theirs is more a law enforcement accounting; for us it is more a personal view.''
 The idea for the Las Vegas Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement was seeded when the city bought the 1933 federal courthouse and post office from the federal government for $1 in 2002, with the strict understanding that the building -- one of the oldest in Southern Nevada -- be used for cultural purposes. 
 For much of the middle of the last century, organized crime ruled the Strip, developing and managing an array of casinos, skimming their way to success. Federal prosecutors put an end to their reign in the 1980s. The city determined its historical relationship to organized crime -- and the role the courthouse played in it -- made the site a perfect fit. ''It came from the soil of this building,'' said Nancy Deaner, the city's cultural affairs manager. 
 The building is being meticulously restored, down to the original coffered ceiling and crown moldings hidden for years and the original mustard, oxblood and royal blue colors long ago washed in white. 
 The $42 million project has been financed through a series of state, federal and local grants, and the work has progressed a bit glacially as money has trickled in.
 The project, once listed as one that could stimulate this city's embattled economy, was attacked by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, when city officials suggested that it might qualify for federal stimulus money.
 ''That got blown out of proportion with morons in Washington shooting off their mouths,'' said Mr. Goodman, whose office chair resembles a throne. He said he tried his first case in the court building.
 The museum will have three stories and nearly 17,000 square feet of exhibits, including an interactive courtroom in which visitors can get finger printed. It will also include the brick wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (it was removed brick by brick and put in storage but will be constructed, bullet marks and all, Ms. Deaner said), roughly 700 objects and extensive exhibits on law enforcement efforts against the Mafia. 
 The museum is dear to Mr. Goodman's efforts to revitalize the downtown area of Las Vegas, which for years has been the dirty ashtray to the Strip's gilded cup.
 ''This story is so rich, our efforts to tell it are hard to do in a museum this size,'' said Dennis Barrie, the creative director of the museum, who curated the collections at the International Spy Museum in Washington and at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland.
 At the same time, Eagle Group Holdings -- working with Antoinette McConnell, the 74-year-old daughter of Mr. Giancana -- is looking to open the Las Vegas Mob Experience at the end of the year. 
 While executives from the Mob Experience declined to identify the planned site, a document provided by someone involved in the transaction who was not authorized to speak before a planned announcement of the deal next month shows an agreement with the Tropicana Las Vegas, which is undergoing a $165 million renovation.
 The Mob Experience would include theme park-style exhibits, including one called ''Final Fate'' in which a visitor ''gets made or gets whacked,'' according to the description.
 The Tropicana, one of the oldest properties on the Strip, had fallen on hard times over the years but was recently sold and is now co-owned and run by Alex Yemenidjian, a former chief executive of MGM Studios. Rather than demolishing the original structure, as has happened with other older hotels, the new owners are restoring it.
 Mrs. McConnell, who splits her time between Las Vegas and Chicago, said in a telephone interview that such an exhibit had been ''a dream of mine'' for years and that it would offer ''the greatest thing you have ever experienced.'' 
 Mrs. McConnell, whose late husband was a lawyer who represented organized crime figures, added: ''The Mafia is something that people can't get enough of. For some people it is like an addiction.''
 While Mrs. McConnell and Mr. Goodman could go head-to-head on hyperbolic enthusiasm for personal projects, Mr. Goodman says the sheer force of his gorgeous building, an esteemed staff and the power of his bully pulpit alone will make his museum the most talked about in town.
 ''My whole life has been competitive,'' he said. ''And I don't lose.''

HEADLINE: The Fountain of Reinvention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CLEARWATER, Fla.
 I'D never been to a boomer conference and figured it was time to try one. So, recently I joined 250 mainly boomer-age business people who had paid $195 each for a day's worth of speeches, seminars and networking opportunities here at the second annual Florida Boomer Lifestyle Conference.
 It was hard at first to tell from the list of speakers and sponsors whether this was the best of times for boomers (Shirley Mitchell, author of ''Fabulous After 50'' and ''Sensational After 60''); the worst of times (Roger Chiocchi, author of ''Baby Boomer Bust? How the Generation of Promise Became the Generation of Panic''); or the end of times (Suncoast Hospice, a major conference sponsor).
 If there was a buzzword, it was ''reinvention.'' The morning keynote speaker was Brent Green, the author of ''Generation Reinvention.'' The speaker at seminar 2B, ''Reinventing Your Business, Reinventing Yourself,'' was introduced as the ''reinvention guru Karen Post.'' The conference was opened by Colleen Chappell, a marketing executive who praised boomers for ''truly reinventing everything,'' including ''redefining reinvention.'' 
 But it was a presentation by Lorin Drake, a market researcher, that made clear why so many attendees needed to be reinvented: 39 percent of boomer households in Florida had someone who'd lost a job in the last five years; 34 percent had experienced a hospitalization; 15 percent had a mortgage that was larger than the value of their home.
 The good news, said Mr. Drake of Schwartz Consulting Partners, is that 74 percent of boomers plan to stay in Florida. The bad news is there is not much choice because of the dead real estate market.
 More bad news, he said, was that a quarter of Florida boomers are now living with a parent or an adult child, or both. ''What's it result in?'' he said. ''A boomer mom who says, 'I didn't sign up for this.' ''
 The good news for savvy marketers? ''If we win over the boomer mom, we win over the adult kids and parents who live with her,'' he said. ''We can scoop up all three at once.''
 That was why Mary Maloney, 41, a marketing specialist in the technology sector who has been downsized twice in this recession, was in attendance, and she took note. ''I mean, there are 78 million boomers -- it's good to know,'' she said.
 Darlene Jalowsky, 62, a former geriatric-care manager, agreed. ''I'm here to learn how to make money off boomers,'' she said.
 Mr. Drake had one last bit of research to share before concluding. His surveys indicate that a significant number of boomers don't like the term. When addressing one, he suggested saying ''your age group'' instead.
 Although the attendees were dressed in business attire and had worked in corporate America for decades, you could still hear an occasional echo of the '60s. One speaker, A. D. Frazier, the former chief executive of the Chicago Stock Exchange who now has his own business that provides back office services to small companies, urged those who were laid off to start a business. ''Don't go back to work for The Man,'' he said.
 Pat Deering, 59, did not. A longtime human resources director for a real estate company, she told the conference, ''I'd sent a lot of individuals home because positions were eliminated'' -- and then she, too, was fired.
 Instead of re-upping with The Man, she bought the Tampa-area FranNet franchise -- which finds franchises for people to buy.
 ''Stand up, Paul Lallanilla,'' she said. ''He's taken control of his life.'' 
 The audience applauded for Mr. Lallanilla, who'd spent $100,000 to buy a Right at Home home-care franchise with Ms. Deering's help.
 ''Ron, would you like to stand up?'' Ms. Deering said, and they applauded for Ron McCaslin, 63, who had opened a Speedpro Imaging printing franchise. Mr. McCaslin had been president of Jim Walter Homes, overseeing 2,000 employees until the recession. The company's construction business closed, and he was let go. He paid $350,000, half of his retirement savings, for the Speedpro franchise. ''I've put it all on the line,'' he said. ''I won't ever retire.''
 Laurie Orlov, 59, the founder of Aging in Place Technology Watch, told the group how she had parlayed several trends affecting older people into a successful business with clients that include AARP and Philips Global. With the real estate collapse, she realized that more elderly people would not be able to sell their homes or afford assisted living (projected to cost $51,000 a year in Florida by 2015); that they would need more monitoring at home; and that they had techno-savvy adult children willing to spend on products like health alarms and movement sensors.
 She described a new, computer-linked pill dispenser that lights up when it's time to take medication and calls you if you've forgotten -- and if you don't answer the phone, it can call your children. The problem, she said, is that the technology companies don't know how to sell it.
 ''This is a kind of sad market right now,'' she said. She believes the way to go is bundling such devices -- pill dispensers, neck alarms, movement sensors, GPS devices -- into a package of services that families could subscribe to for a monthly fee of perhaps $50.
 Ms. Orlov described how her background -- being a chief technology officer for two companies, a market researcher in the late 90's when e-commerce was beginning and a caretaker for her mother, who had Alzheimer's -- helped her to see what others hadn't.
 In the afternoon at reinvention seminar 2B, Ms. Post displayed a line graph of her life that looked like a roller coaster. She explained that she had become a reinvention guru the hard way, by having two businesses fail, including a dot-com start-up that she'd raised $1 million for in 2001 and that went bust nine months later. ''You feel like you want to die, but we baby boomers are so strong,'' she said.
 She said that her current business, as an inspirational speaker and coach on rebranding and reinvention, is ''all on the upswing.'' Each time she's started over, people she thought were friends discouraged her. ''I had to shed friends and associates,'' Ms. Post said. ''Sometimes you have to kick friends to the curb.''
 Other advice: 
 ''You cannot believe what your own mind tells you. My life was saying big loser. Separate truth from trash in your head.''
 ''It's never too late to come up with an idea and reinvent yourself.''
 ''You need to step up and stand out.''
 During questions, David Valladarez, an architect, asked, ''This is all great, but how do you use it to get work?''
 Ms. Post said, ''Your services need to be sliced and diced and repackaged.''
 She suggested that -- with so many boomers now having parents and adult children moving in, and with elderly people staying in their homes longer -- Mr. Valladarez, as an architect, might be able to capitalize on the need to redesign and adapt those homes. She called it ''spicing new spices on your business.''
 Later, I asked Mr. Valladarez, who's been an architect 25 years, how bad business was. ''Dead for lack of a better term,'' he said. ''The floor's been pulled out. No real projects.''
 Asked if the conference was worthwhile, he said: ''Oh, yes. This boomer thing, multi-generational housing, people aging in place -- I'm thinking about it.
 ''It could be the first time in my career I'm out front of the curve,'' he said. ''It's just so hard to know.''
 And then he hurried off to hear the closing speaker, Mary Furlong, the author of ''Silver to Gold: How to Profit in the Baby Boomer Marketplace.''

HEADLINE: ESSAY: The Raging Center

 BODY:
At a time when politics has become an almost minute-by-minute spectacle, political thinkers who try to discern a sweeping interpretive pattern in current events or to predict where those events may be heading are likely to find their work evaluated in terms dismayingly like those applied to candidates and strategists. One wrong guess, or an abrupt change in the political weather, can make even an illuminating political book seem as irrelevant as a bungled campaign. 
 A good example is Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's book ''The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics.'' Published in 2001, it argued that the nation was ready for ''political transformations and realignments'' as broad in scope as those created by the Civil War and the Great Depression. Halstead and Lind were instrumental in founding the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan Beltway think tank, in 1999, and ''The Radical Center'' was in effect the foundation's mission statement, making the case for ''progressive privatization'' of Social Security, grants of $6,000 to every child at birth, and other programs geared ''to the rapidly emerging technologies and circumstances of the Information Age.'' Much of this remains as utopian as it was in 2001. 
 But if Halstead and Lind's proposals were questionable, their analysis of the paralyzed condition of American governance was incisive and prescient, particularly their depiction of a substantial base of disenchanted voters who had become profoundly alienated from the ''increasingly dogmatic two-party system,'' both parties ''captured by their extremes,'' with the result that a growing slice of the electorate could not ''find even a faction within a major party with which they can identify.'' 
 When ''The Radical Center'' was published, mere weeks after the trauma of 9/11, its picture of a highly polarized nation seemed instantly outmoded. ''The attack on the United States has changed the tone and content of American politics, at least for the time being,'' one reviewer, Robert B. Reich, wrote in the Book Review. ''An era of big government is beginning,'' he added. George W. Bush, suddenly ''more popular than any president in modern history,'' had formed a strong partnership with ''a once-bitter and factious Congress glowing in bipartisan resolve.'' And ''a public that was abysmally cynical about Washington, interested only in political sleaze and sex and eager to throw the bums out, is rallying behind incumbents of whatever stripe.'' 
 Not quite a decade later, things look very different. ''Big government'' is once again viewed with deep hostility, and much of the public is not merely cynical, but fuming. Many on the left feel betrayed by the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats, while the Tea Party movement has been expressing the same ''radical'' frustrations Halstead and Lind described. Meanwhile, political observers are recycling, if not always wittingly, the authors' terminology. In his Times Op-Ed column, Thomas L. Friedmanrecently called for ''political innovation that takes America's disempowered radical center and enables it to act in proportion to its true size, unconstrained by the two parties, interest groups and orthodoxies that have tied our politics in knots.'' And David Ignatius, the Washington Post columnist, has said that officials at Barack Obama's White House ''speak of this president as being a man of the radical center'' who seeks to occupy the ideological middle but at the same time aspires to ''be the agent of change, to break this system that everybody knows is broken.'' 
 ''The Radical Center'' raises the possibility that a book can be at once behind and ahead of its time, mistaken in some of its prescriptions -- Americans still resist ''progressive privatization of Social Security,'' as Bush discovered after his re-election in 2004 (though the authors shrewdly sketched the battle lines in the recent health care reform debate) -- but true in its assessment of the costs of a dysfunctional civil society. 
 Halstead and Lind, following other analysts, noted a decline in governance after the period from the 1930s to the 1970s, when relatively ''weak parties and strong cross-party coalitions'' had forged ''the major Congressional achievements of the 20th century -- Social Security, the Marshall Plan, the enabling legislation for NATO and the U.N., the G.I. Bill, Medicare, Head Start, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.'' But ''The Radical Center'' inventively situated those accomplishments on a continuum of adjustments made by a succession of farsighted ''founders'' who had understood that the relationship between government and larger economic and social forces must undergo periodic recalibration, whether it was the 18th-century gentleman farmers who had established the agrarian Republic, the 19th-century statesmen who had built ''an urbanizing America of factory towns'' or the New Deal reformers who had ''enlisted the new technologies of electricity and the internal combustion engine'' to create a suburbanized nation with a vast middle class. 
 In other words, ''The Radical Center'' is as much about the past as about the present and the future, and belongs to the tradition not of policy manifesto but of revisionist theory. In fact, Halstead and Lind drew explicitly on ''The Radical Center: Middle Americans and the Politics of Alienation,'' a sociological study published in 1976. Its author, Donald I. Warren, had supervised nearly 2,000 interviews with a cross-section of citizens, almost all of them white, in an effort to isolate the attitudes of ''middle American radicals,'' whose anger at political and social institutions had erupted in the early and mid-1970s. Some of their protests were culturally driven: uprisings against court-ordered busing in Boston and the ''maggots of the media'' who supported it, and against the school board in Charleston, W.Va., that had added left-wing authors to grade-school curriculums. Others were reactions to the decade's raging inflation: a truckers' protest against rising diesel prices, a consumers' meat boycott. 
 Opposing these radicals, Warren reported, was another group, ''average middles,'' who had more faith in established institutions and the stability they offered. Middle America was thus split into two competing sectors. As many as 43 percent of the ''radicals'' -- but only 26 percent of the ''other whites'' in the survey -- agreed, for instance, that ''the true American way of life is disappearing so fast that we need to use force to save it''; and 41 percent of the ''radicals'' approved of activists who ''go to the state capitol and stop legislative sessions,'' while only 22 percent of ''average middles'' favored such actions.
 These conflicting outlooks often reflected differences in education, ethnicity and religion. Put roughly, ''radicals'' were blue-collar Catholics, and ''average middles'' were white-collar Protestants.
 The novelty of Halstead and Lind's book lay in its suggestion that subsequent changes in demographics and party affiliation had collapsed the two warring factions into one. Between 1970 and 2000, the percentage of college graduates in the population at large had more than doubled, from one in 10 to one in four. Evangelicals had joined Catholics among the ranks of social conservatives. The working-class ''flight'' from the Democratic Party was all but completed in the 1980s and '90s even as moderate Republicans began to vote for Democrats. 
 The question Halstead and Lind tried to answer, whether this fusion of the two ''middles'' might form a new consensus, is again the most pressing issue of the day, with conflicting answers supplied by left and right, and with the outcome fluctuating from moment to moment, possibly confirming the authors' guess that ''the future of American politics may well belong to the major party that is first to renounce its more extreme positions.'' This is why ''The Radical Center'' remains valuable even as the political realities that seemed to discredit its argument a decade ago have themselves proved fleeting.

HEADLINE: Spreading His Gospel Of Warm And Fuzzy

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
It was early in the class, in a nondescript room on Union Square, where more than a dozen business managers had gathered to learn the hospitality secrets that have made Danny Meyer one of the nation's most successful restaurateurs. The moment to share had arrived. 
 Susan Reilly Salgado, a managing director of Mr. Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group, asked the students to name their favorite mentor, co-worker or place to shop. Michael Sullivan, an assistant manager at Tekserve, which sells and services Apple products, chose an acting coach. ''She really brought herself as a person to each person in the class,'' he said.
 ''She took a personal interest in you,'' Ms. Salgado said, nodding encouragingly. Then she turned to the others to nail down her point: ''Isn't that nice?''
 Nice is Lesson 1 at Hospitality Quotient, the consulting business Mr. Meyer and his partners started last month to spread their management style beyond New York and even beyond the restaurant world. To a mix of people from all lines of work, they teach that a warm, personal touch can be more persuasive in winning repeat customers than the product or service itself. 
 ''You do not have to be the very best in your business to be people's favorite,'' Ms. Salgado explained. ''It's all about how you make people feel.''
 That approach -- the metaphorical hug in which Mr. Meyer, a 52-year-old son of the Midwest, wants to envelop his guests -- has incongruously spawned a gastronomic empire in a city so sharp-elbowed and indifferent that Mr. Meyer refused to hire native New Yorkers when he opened his first restaurant, Union Square Cafe, in 1985. 
 ''Back then, I viewed New York as a scary, crime-ridden city, and its population as cynical, unfriendly and tough,'' he wrote in his 2006 memoir and business guide, ''Setting the Table.'' 
 Mr. Meyer has since softened that view and added locals to his staff. But the core tenets of his operation have remained the same, even as they have evolved into a unified credo from a haphazard collection of insights gleaned from his St. Louis upbringing, European travels and many dining-room disasters. 
 In one of those, in the early days of Union Square Cafe, he spilled a glass of cold Champagne on Mariel Hemingway while leaning in to get a better look at her newly enhanced cleavage; another time he got into a fistfight with a drunken customer.
 Mr. Meyer, who serves up labels and analogies as readily as foie gras, calls his approach the Virtuous Cycle of Enlightened Hospitality: Employees focus first on pleasing one another -- creating a warm-and-fuzzy energy that fuels the staff as it tends to patrons, the community, suppliers and, ultimately, a company's backers. Meyer restaurants offer employees a variety of rewards, from bonuses to birthday cakes; employees, in turn, have discretion to give customers free extras. 
 ''When you really take a perspective that the customer comes second, which is counterintuitive in a society that always puts the customer first, you also end up attracting stronger employees over time, which increases the odds that your technical and your emotional and hospitality performance are going to be competitive,'' Mr. Meyer said, with typical focus, in a telephone interview. 
 In the recent class, Hospitality and Service, one of five half-day sessions, Ms. Salgado said that Meyer restaurants strive not just to satisfy diners but also to ''thoroughly delight'' them, so they will ''rave about their experience and have no choice but to return.'' She was as gracious as a host might be at showcases like Eleven Madison Park and Gramercy Tavern, asking several times if it was too warm in the room and assuring students that they should feel free to slip out to check on work or take a call. 
 Mr. Meyer always looks to hire what he calls ''51 percenters'' -- people whose job skills are 51 percent emotional and 49 percent technical. Managers can teach technical skills, the theory goes, but cannot recalibrate someone's emotional makeup.
 The concepts may not be revolutionary -- some, in fact, are just common sense. But Judi Brownell, dean of students at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, said they were packaged in a way that was catchy and easily digestible, even if they occasionally had the ring of echoes from an encounter group. 
 ''Skunking,'' for instance, refers to ''spraying contagious, negative energy into the workplace.'' But because skunks spray when they are frightened, as Ms. Salgado explained, co-workers are encouraged to make a ''charitable assumption'' -- Meyer-speak for the benefit of the doubt -- and approach the fragrant employee with respect, trust and perhaps an offer of help and support. 
 The ''jazz level'' refers to how excited one is to be at work, while A.B.C.D. means ''always be connecting dots'' -- collecting clues about what a customer wants. ''In hospitality,'' Mr. Meyer has written, ''one size fits one!'' 
 These cheerful aphorisms are serious business, and they have helped guide the growth of Union Square Hospitality Group from a neighborhood bistro into 11 successful New York restaurants and a catering company with a reputation for great service, loyal staff members and a minimum of the industry's usual dysfunction. 
 Richard Coraine, a managing partner of the Meyer empire, said the education business grew organically: the restaurants had acted for years as informal schools for visiting chefs and managers, and Mr. Meyer spent the two years after his memoir came out speaking to employees at airlines, insurance companies and hedge funds. 
 Now, the education program is formalized in Hospitality Quotient, which charges $425 for a four-hour session and $1,500 for a two-day immersion, which includes dinner at a Meyer restaurant.
 Mr. Meyer said hospitality will define the next cycle of the economy, as the art of making people feel important and cared for will become the critical edge against the competition.
 ''It has now become almost impossible to distinguish your business based on innovation or execution for more than about two seconds,'' he said. ''In this next economy, if you want to distinguish yourself as being the best and being the favorite business within your category, the only thing left is the hospitality experience.''
 But the Union Square way may not be a perfect fit for every business. As he sat in class, David Lerner, a co-founder of Tekserve, seemed unconvinced that he could ever earn raves from the 20 percent of his customers to whom he has to deliver bad news, like a higher-than-expected repair fee or an unsalvageable motherboard. Still, he sent a second group of employees to two days of classes.
 ''Ten or 15 years ago, we were the only place to get a Mac fixed, and now there are lots of choices,'' Mr. Lerner said. ''It's not enough to do a perfect repair if the customer feels you were grumpy or you kept them waiting too long.''
 Officials at the city's Department of Small Business Services, who went through a Union Square training program last year, said it helped improve communication and customer service at its Workforce Career Center in Downtown Brooklyn. 
 Lakythia Ferby, who directs the center, said she created a staff-appreciation program in which co-workers take note of each others' high performance and nominate them -- using a form headed, ''Kudos, you were caught doing good!'' -- for a reward of a $5 Dunkin' Donuts gift card. 
 Michael Proscia, president of BluCo Energy, a Brooklyn-based supplier of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas, praised the program but wondered how to translate the easy warmth of a top-rated restaurant to his business servicing a harried New York clientele.
 ''New Yorkers are typically in a hurry,'' Mr. Proscia noted. ''They don't have a lot of patience.''

HEADLINE: The Rise Of the Fleet-Footed Start-Up

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
ERIC RIES and Steven Blank think they have a better way to build a start-up, one that takes less time and money to try new ideas and find paying customers. They are leading proponents of the ''lean start-up'' -- a fresh approach to creating companies that has attracted much attention in the last year or so among Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, technologists and investors.
 The concept is gaining a following beyond the Valley as well. ''If it works, it will reduce failure rates for entrepreneurial ventures and boost innovation,'' says Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''That's a big deal for the economy.'' 
 The term ''lean start-up'' was coined by Mr. Ries, 31, an engineer, entrepreneur and blogger. His inspiration, he says, was the lean manufacturing process, fine-tuned in Japanese factories decades ago and focused on eliminating any work or investment that doesn't produce value for customers.
 ''This is lean manufacturing for start-ups,'' explains Mr. Blank, 56, a serial entrepreneur.
 Since 1978, he has been a founder or early employee in eight start-ups, both winners and losers. To cite a couple, Rocket Science Games, a once-promising video game maker, founded in 1993, cratered amid losses a few years later, while Epiphany, a business software company, founded in 1997, was acquired by a larger corporation for $329 million in 2005 -- ''one my grandchildren will be grateful for,'' Mr. Blank notes. 
 Today, he advises start-up companies and teaches at Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Technology animates the lean start-up process. Free open-source programming tools and easily distributed Web-based software drive down the cost of developing new products and services. The early companies embracing the principles live largely on the Web, which makes it possible to measure and track customer behavior constantly and to invite suggestions and criticism.
 Internet companies have steadily taken advantage of the falling costs of getting up and running -- often spending just hundreds of thousands of dollars instead of the millions that were required several years ago. But the lean start-up formula adds management practices tailored to exploit the Web environment. 
 The concepts apply both to designing products and to developing a market, and emphasize an early and constant focus on customers. To be sure, the methods often build on the work of others.
 In product development, for example, Mr. Ries is an enthusiast of so-called agile programming methods, which emphasize rapid development, small teams and constant improvement. But, he adds: ''The agile practices have to be adapted, shifting the focus somewhat from generating stuff to learning about what customers will want. Most technology start-ups fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because they are making something that there is not a real market for.''
 So the lean playbook advises quick development of a ''minimum viable product,'' designed with the smallest set of features that will please some group of customers. Then, the start-up should continually experiment by tweaking its offering, seeing how the market responds and changing the product accordingly. Facebook, the giant social network, grew that way, starting with simple messaging services and then adding other features.
 The goal, explains Mr. Blank, is to accelerate the pace of learning. ''A start-up is a temporary organization designed to discover a profitable, scalable business model,'' he says.
 Mr. Ries points to his own experience as a study in contrasts between the traditional start-up model and the lean approach. He was a senior engineer at There.com, a 3-D virtual world, from 2001 to 2003. There.com raised $40 million and spent years in stealth mode, building impressive technology, he recalls. But it had so much invested in one technology path and one business plan that the company lost its ability to change, Mr. Ries says.
 To switch course, Mr. Ries joined a founder of There.com, Will Harvey, and in 2004 they started a company called IMVU, a social network in which users chat online and create personalized avatars. By design, it raised no outside money in the early going. ''I didn't want us to have the freedom to go for years without customer feedback,'' recalls Mr. Harvey. 
 IMVU began as a bootstrap operation, a forerunner of the lean start-up model. Its early revenue goals were just a few hundred dollars a month. (Users buy clothing and other virtual goods for their avatars.) Today, while There.com has folded, IMVU claims one million active users -- and is profitable, says Mr. Harvey, the chairman. 
 Many young Internet businesses have embraced the lean start-up principles of beginning small and getting products into the marketplace quickly in pursuit of paying customers. Several gathered last week at a conference in San Francisco, including representatives from Grockit, an online education network; KISSmetrics, a Web site measurement business; and Dropbox, an online file storage and sharing service. Others represented PBworks (Web collaboration tools), Flowtown (software for social media marketing) and Aardvark (a social network search service, recently acquired by Google). 
 THE rise of smaller, fleet-footed companies in the lean start-up mold is also bringing changes in venture financing. These companies are typically funded with $500,000 or so from professional angel investors instead of traditional venture capital firms, which are geared toward investing millions at a time. The venture capital investment may well come later, when the companies need money for expansion.
 But, according to some Silicon Valley veterans, this means a shrinking role for venture capitalists in seeking and backing promising young entrepreneurs. That vital task in the food chain of capitalism, they add, is increasingly being taken over by major angel investors like Ron Conway, Dave McClure and Mike Maples Jr.
 ''Venture capital has to reinvent itself for this world,'' says Mitchell Kapor, an angel investor who has made 25 investments in lean start-up companies in the last two years.

THE WAR LOVERS
 Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst, and the Rush to Empire, 1898
 By Evan Thomas
 Illustrated. 471 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $29.99
 THE IMPERIAL CRUISE
 A Secret History of Empire and War
 By James Bradley
 Illustrated. 387 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $29.99
 These are books about men who wanted a war. Or at least the next best thing: a state of intimidation, fear, anxiety and excitement, which would produce the fruits of war, foremost among them order and peace. But what these men got was not always what they yearned for. And the price was not what they were ready -- or even able -- to pay.
 One figure looms over all of them. Barking his commands and posing for photographers in his tailored military uniforms, Theodore Roosevelt was the very image of a war-loving martinet. Yet, improbable though it may seem, he was also the proud recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Yes, Henry Kissinger also garnered one of these. But nonetheless it does take the breath away. 
 Although neither of these fine books is meant to be exclusively about Roosevelt, he hovers over and inside them -- just as he must have sucked all the air out of any room he entered. This is not only because of his martial manner and bellicose deeds, but also because he was such a paradox: a political reformer, a conservationist, a buffalo hunter, a prolific author, a militaristic liberal and, yes, a ''war lover'' if he thought it would achieve peace and order. His admirers were legion and sometimes surprising. The renowned Progressive newspaper editor William Allen White summed it all up when he wrote, ''Theodore Roosevelt bit me and I went mad.'' Even the normally sober Walter Lippmann, who admired and later fell out with Roosevelt, confessed that he never quite ceased to be ''an unqualified hero worshipper.''
 Neither Evan Thomas, an editor at large at Newsweek, nor James Bradley, the author of ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' suffers from this affliction. Indeed they both take Roosevelt to task for being, at times, a racist, a jingoist and a warmonger. They view him, fairly enough, from the perspective of a time very different from the one he lived in, which was a moment when the United States was just beginning to flex its muscles as a rising great power. We, by contrast, are at a stage when we nervously worry about our receding hairline and whether we still have the right stuff.
 War, as we are told, is hell. Except, that is, when it is noble, thrilling, profitable or simply convenient. But in a more innocent time, when the nation was younger and its people more credulous, and its soldiers stayed mostly at home, war was viewed as a great adventure. And never was a war so popular as the one that a band of influential Americans provoked in 1898 against Spain over the remnants of its decaying empire. Yet never did an American war, so casually begun and so enthusiastically supported, have such unforeseen and sweeping consequences.
 From that war flowed six decades of American economic and political control of Cuba, its acquisition of a military enclave called Guantanamo, the occupation of the Philippines (during which Americans used an interrogation technique very similar to waterboarding), a war with Japan for mastery of the Pacific, a protracted confrontation with the ancient civilization that Americans were instructed by their government to call ''Red China'' and the American devastation of Southeast Asia to ''save'' some Vietnamese from other Vietnamese.
 The late 19th century was a time when the United States, reunified after the traumatic blood-letting of its Civil War, was taking its place among the ranks of the major powers. The resources and restless energies of a continent-spanning nation had increasingly impressed a nervous world. Most important, a handful of influential men were ready to embark upon a great imperial adventure. 
 These were the men who provide Evan Thomas with the title of his book ''The War Lovers,'' and who James Bradley identifies in ''The Imperial Cruise'' as the architects of a new American empire in the Pacific. Together these two engrossing histories dramatize, from different perspectives, the critical events and powerful ambitions that toppled an old empire and changed the global power balance. Today, as that balance is being challenged by emerging Asian goliaths, the stories they relate, like the lessons they draw, could not be more relevant.
 The three major war lovers in Thomas's rousing tale -- Roosevelt, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and the press baron William Randolph Hearst -- had differing motives but similar ambitions that war promised to satisfy. For the arrogant Lodge, who embodied ''Brahmin coldness and snobbery,'' war against the crumbling Spanish empire would help achieve America's destiny to join the ruling powers of the world. For Hearst, whose sensation-mongering tabloid, The New York Journal, was locked in a press battle with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, war offered an opportunity to manipulate public opinion, gain prestige and advance his political ambitions. 
 But neither of these men yearned for war more ardently than did Roosevelt. For him war was a means both to assert his own masculinity and to fulfill a national destiny. Although born too late to have fought in most of the wars to drive Indians from their historic lands, he found adventure in riding with Western cattle herders and bathing his hands in the blood of buffaloes. This ferocious competitor, in Thomas's words, ''regarded sport, the more violent the better, as the next best thing to war.'' 
 These three eminent war lovers may have been bold, but they were not foolhardy. With the wounds of the Civil War not yet healed, they wanted no fiery conflagration. Rather they sought what one of their band, the statesman John Hay, called a ''splendid little war'' they could be sure of winning. An alluring opportunity lay waiting 90 miles off the coast of Florida. There, a band of rebels were struggling to liberate the island of Cuba from the grip of Spain.
 For Lodge, the unrest in Cuba was a justification for American expansion and for Hearst a way to sell newspapers. In Roosevelt's case (for whom ''just about any war would do''), Cuba offered an irresistible means for ego gratification, masculinity enhancement and self-promotion. With politicians pumping for action and journalists inventing tear-inducing atrocities, the nation was primed for war -- just so long as it was thrilling, brief and involved little danger.
 The opportunity came in 1898 when the American warship Maine caught fire in Havana harbor. Congress, without bothering to determine the cause (which was probably an internal explosion), whooped through a declaration calling for Cuban independence. Roosevelt, seizing that chance, assembled a troop of adventure seekers he labeled the Rough Riders, donned a uniform tailored for him by Brooks Brothers and headed for battle with a gaggle of journalists and photographers. The demoralized Spaniards soon laid down their arms and sailed for home. Excluded from the surrender ceremonies, Thomas pointedly notes, ''were the Cubans, the people for whom the war had been fought.'' 
 Although Congress had declared that Cuba would be independent, it also passed the Platt Amendment in 1901 giving the United States the right to intervene whenever it pleased. ''Inevitably,'' Thomas writes, ''a ruling class tied to U.S. commercial interests re-emerged, and racism, always deeply rooted, worked its poison in Cuban society.'' Sixty years later Fidel Castro, leading his victorious rebels into Santiago, drew on bitter memories in declaring ''this time, fortunately for Cuba, the revolution will be consummated.'' 
 The war set in motion a series of events that changed the map of Asia and ultimately led to a great war halfway around the world. Roosevelt, in his post as assistant secretary of the Navy during the war for Cuba, took advantage of his superior's absence and dispatched an American armada across the Pacific to attack the outgunned Spanish fleet in Manila harbor. When the Americans landed to take control they encountered fierce resistance from Filipinos fighting for independence. Rather than leave the islands, President McKinley declared that there was nothing to be done but to ''take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and Christianize them.'' 
 The Filipinos, who had long since been converted to Catholicism, continued their struggle for independence. During the bloody effort to control the islands, some 4,000 Americans and about 200,000 Filipinos died in battle, along with perhaps another 200,000 civilians who perished from disease in relocation camps. During the pacification the Americans learned, and liberally used, the ''water treatment'' to extract information from prisoners.
 In his absorbing narrative of men who found duty or fulfillment or personal meaning in a war for empire -- and of other men, like William James, who feared that such a quest would rot the nation's soul -- Thomas has illuminated, in a compulsively readable style, a critical moment in American history. This is a book that, with its style and panache, is hard to forget and hard to put down.
 Roosevelt also looms over Bradley's provocative study of a little-remembered ''imperial cruise'' that, in his view, set the stage for World War II in the Pacific. Seizure of the Philippines, combined with the forced annexation of the Hawaiian Islands at the behest of naval strategists, American missionaries and sugar barons, had given the United States an enormous interest in the balance of power in Asia.
 Roosevelt moved to enhance that interest in 1905, Bradley tells us, when he sent his secretary of war, William Howard Taft, on a disguised diplomatic mission to Asia. Promoted as simply a good-will gesture, the ''cruise'' was designed to mask negotiations of secret accords that would allow Japan to expand into Korea and China, thereby providing a barrier to Russian expansion on the Asian mainland. Convinced, as he said, that ''Japan is the only nation in Asia that understands the principles and methods of Western civilization,'' Roosevelt concluded that the emperor's kingdom should be the ''natural leader'' of Asians and the protector of American strategic and economic interests.
 Thus it was that Taft served as the midwife to secret agreements that had the effect, Bradley argues, of subjecting Korea to Japanese domination for the next four decades. In Bradley's caustic words, ''at the behest of London and Washington, the Japanese military would expand into Korea and China to civilize Asia. Later generations would call it World War II.'' Roosevelt had never foreseen that America's search for order and opportunity in Asia, set in motion by the seizure of the Philippines, would later lead into a terrible war between the United States and Japan for control of the Pacific.
 In the decades since his death Theodore Roosevelt has suffered many detractors, and with considerable justification. Yet he was also a great domestic reformer, a trust-buster and a conservationist. What is fascinating about Bradley's reconstruction of a largely neglected aspect of Roosevelt's legacy is the impact that his racial theories and his obsession with personal and national virility had on his diplomacy. Engrossing and revelatory, ''The Imperial Cruise'' is revisionist history at its best.
 Perhaps, as Bradley writes, the history of the 20th century would ''be different if the American Aryan had not made the Honorary Aryan his civilizing surrogate in Asia.'' But in statecraft, what is viewed as ''national interest'' invariably trumps moral qualms. And it is worth pondering that if Roosevelt were alive today he might, like Nixon and Kissinger, have surprised both his admirers and detractors by putting his bets on a rising China as the ''natural leader'' of Asia.

HEADLINE: A Family Portrait of a Greek Tragedy

BYLINE: By PHILOMILA TSOUKALA. 
Philomila Tsoukala is an associate professor of law at Georgetown.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 AFTER months of rising taxes and budget cuts, the Greek prime minister announced on Friday that the country officially needed an international bailout. The European Union and International Monetary Fund rescue plan is widely expected to require further cuts in public spending and civil service wages and pensions, in addition to changes that would increase labor ''flexibility'' by weakening rules protecting workers. 
 But these plans overlook the basic organizing principle of Greek society -- the family -- and its stultifying influence on the economy. 
 Welfare programs like unemployment benefits and housing subsidies are already significantly smaller in Greece than in the rest of Europe; Greeks rely instead on government jobs and their families for support. It's true that Greece's public sector is expensive, rife with cronyism and in need of reform. But fixing it won't fix Greece's problems. 
 The more pressing issue is that the country's private sector is comprised mostly of family-owned and family-staffed businesses that hinder competition and innovation and depress wages. In fact, austerity measures will only reinforce the family's stranglehold on both the state and the market. 
 Upward of 75 percent of Greek businesses are family-owned. Most are small and rely on family labor, which is as flexible as it gets -- in practice, no minimum-wage or maximum-hour laws apply. Women often work for their husbands without salary, and divorce laws don't effectively ensure the divorcing spouse's stake in the family business or remuneration for the work she put into it -- meaning it's very difficult to leave a marriage. 
 Young people are similarly constrained. The lucky ones land government jobs through family connections or work in a family business, ''helping out'' with no pay while formally unemployed. The unlucky ones toil for meager wages at someone else's family business, where they have almost no chance of advancing into management. Many live with their parents up to the age of 35 because they can't afford to live on their own. Unsurprisingly, fertility rates are very low. Young people also depend on their families to supplement their wages and pay the ''tips'' necessary to get decent health care.
 Those who desire independence join the flourishing Greek diasporas in Europe and the United States. I left Greece when I realized that, as an aspiring lawyer with no family connections in the business, I would probably spend the initial years of my legal career serving coffee to someone's father or son. 
 Until Greece can find a way to disentangle the private sector from the family and find another way to allocate resources -- free from the intergenerational, class and gender inequities of the family unit -- no amount of reform will make a difference. 
 The European Union and the I.M.F. should forget about dismantling Greece's (already puny) welfare state and increasing labor flexibility in the (already flexible) private sector. The public sector does need restructuring, but the resulting unemployment will only strengthen the dominance of the family. A better solution would be to create a real public safety net that would help free young Greeks from the supportive yet suffocating grip of their families. 
 This won't resolve Greece's financial crisis immediately, of course -- nothing can do that -- but there's a generation of young workers languishing in their parents' living rooms and storerooms who, if freed, could help to turn the Greek economy around.

HEADLINE: Rolling Out the Rentals

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
ROUGHLY 1,500 rental units are gradually being rolled onto the northern New Jersey market starting this spring. One large new building in Hoboken will start leasing this week; several other apartment complexes in both cities and suburbs have opened or are about to, and two tall rental towers are being readied to open early in 2011.
 ''It does seem like a lot, coming in a market that has been distressed,'' said David Barry, a principal with Ironstate Development, the company behind the 348-unit 225 Grand, in Jersey City, which starts leasing on May 1, and also a 95-unit building that will open by fall at the Shipyard complex, in Hoboken. 
 ''But it's not a tremendous amount,'' Mr. Barry quickly added, ''given that there is always a steady stream of demand for new units, even in a down market for other kinds of housing.''
 He said he did not sense an impending oversupply of rental units; he and other New Jersey builders have found that the pipeline for future rental units is now being virtually choked off, because of severely tightened standards for granting construction loans. ''Lenders are requiring builders to provide major chunks of equity -- up to 20 or 30 percent of the cost of a project -- before they will consider writing a loan,'' Mr. Barry said. ''Most companies, even larger ones, can't proceed on that basis.''
 The projects opening in the next six to nine months represent the last housing developments to have been granted construction loans before the housing market ''turned'' and lending standards tightened, said Debra Tantleff, a vice president for development of the Roseland Property Company.
 Ms. Tantleff's company is building the Jersey City high-rise project -- two 50-story buildings, called Monaco Towers, that will house 524 apartments. The development was conceived as condominiums, Ms. Tantleff said. Then, at the time ground was broken in late 2008, Roseland and its partner on the project, Garden State Development, said one tower would be condos, the other probably rental.
 Ultimately, as sales slowed to a crawl last year, plans changed again; all units are now rentals.
 Roseland began leasing within the last six weeks at two other new rental buildings it has built in concert with different partners: the Metropolitan at 40 Park in Morristown, and Highlands at Hilltop in Verona.
 The seven-story Metropolitan, with 130 units set over ground-floor shops, was built adjacent to the new 40 Park condo building, which faces the historic green in Morristown. Both are part of a downtown redevelopment done in partnership with Woodmont Properties.
 The Highlands at Hilltop complex in Verona is a more suburban-style rental community: two four-story buildings, containing 95 apartments and a 4,902-square-foot clubhouse, set on 24 acres.
 The one- and two-bedroom units at the Metropolitan are larger, and priced higher. Monthly rates are $1,959 to $3,438. At the Highlands, one- and two-bedroom units go for $1,800 to $3,000.
 Both properties are offering two months' free rent with a 14-month lease. ''This is the concession we typically offer,'' Ms. Tantleff said, ''and it is the extent of what we've had to do during a more difficult market.''
 Other developers of projects opening now said they were offering either a month or two in free rent, or -- as Mr. Barry said Ironstate had done -- lowering rates to suit the times.
 Ms. Tantleff said the appetite for rentals remained strong at all Roseland properties in New Jersey, with occupancy at 98 percent. About 10 units per week have been leased at the Highlands at Hilltop since it opened in late March, and also at the Metropolitan since it opened in early April.
 At the Alexan Riverdale, a 212-unit apartment complex that will start leasing next week, the marketing agent reported that 500 people had signed up online or in person to express interest.
 The Alexan, developed by Trammell Crow Residential, is the first modern ''luxury'' building to open in the area west of Wayne, said Brian Cheripka, the sales director for the project.
 Its design is similar to that of the Alexan CityView in Bayonne, which opened last year. But the Riverdale building, set in woods rather than on the Hudson riverfront, has about 15 acres, and offers an outdoor pool, a barbecue area and walking trails.
 ''We think this is actually a very good time to open rentals in this particular area,'' Mr. Cheripka said. ''We think it boils down to specific submarkets, and demand varies from town to town, county to county -- and there is pent-up demand right here.''
 In general, the percentage of people who are homeowners -- which climbed to about 70 percent during the boom years -- is declining again, he noted. ''Many people don't see homeownership as a way to build equity anymore, especially younger people,'' Mr. Cheripka said.
 ''A lot of empty-nesters come in saying they are ready to trade down to an easier lifestyle,'' he added. ''Bottom line: We see a lot of people anxious to rent.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The ''In the Region'' article in New York and New Jersey copies last Sunday, about a surge in new rentals entering the northern New Jersey market, misidentified the city in which one development, 225 Grand, is located. It is Jersey City, not Hoboken.

HEADLINE: At City Ballet, Sweating Many Firsts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
THE choreographer Christopher Wheeldon strode into a New York City Ballet studio one recent afternoon for the first rehearsal of a new work. As an accompanist played the opening melody, he read the young principal dancer Tiler Peck a few notes about the 1941 Ginastera score ''Estancia,'' involving romance, horse wrangling and ranch culture. 
 ''So, with that in mind: wild horses and go!'' Mr. Wheeldon deadpanned.
 Yet, just an hour later the two had sketched out the beginnings of a phrase or two for her character. Ballet magic: what had been theoretical was now tangible. 
 Such has been the story at City Ballet for the last six months, as the company prepares for the opening on Thursday of what promises to be a landmark festival. Incorporating scenic design by the architect Santiago Calatrava, the festival, Architecture of Dance, features four commissioned scores and seven premieres by some of the biggest names in ballet: Mr. Wheeldon, Alexei Ratmansky, Wayne McGregor, Benjamin Millepied, Mauro Bigonzetti, Melissa Barak and City Ballet's director, Peter Martins. (Nacho Duato was to have been an eighth but canceled too late to be replaced.) 
 A single commission (often with an existing score) is reason to celebrate in any ballet company's season. The ambition, effort and cost involved in creating so much new work in such a short period is staggering. 
 ''Oh my God, that first hour,'' the City Ballet star Wendy Whelan said with a sigh when asked what it's like to create a ballet. (Ms. Whelan will dance in Mr. McGregor and Mr. Ratmansky's works.) ''It's like bubbly Champagne, a nervous excitement, and you never know where it's going to go.''
 Nor do you know how it's going to go; commissioning is a risky game. Still, that these seven new works exist at all is a significant achievement, especially in such dour economic times. (A fund-raising campaign to cover the $1.9 million cost of the festival is nearly complete.) 
 City Ballet is known simply as the House of Balanchine to many, a nod to the singular repertory he (and Jerome Robbins) created. What's less acknowledged is the company's unparalleled role as a driver of new choreography: Mr. Martins's American Music Festival in 1988; the Diamond Project, created in 1992 to support new work (so far, 54 ballets by 29 choreographers); and, since 2000, the New York Choreographic Institute. 
 ''I can't think of another director who has pushed as hard as Peter has to really try and build a new repertoire,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''He never gets enough credit for that. Especially when you consider somebody could be running City Ballet that only believes in those great ballets of Balanchine or Robbins. I don't think Peter is interested in running a museum.''
 Yet City Ballet is that too. And with new ballets being given premiers each week alongside repertory mainstays this season, preservation must be weighed against creation at every level. A March visit to the costume shop revealed a table full of rebuilt black bodices from Balanchine's ''Scotch Symphony'' next to an in-progress version of the glittery gown, designed by Gilles Mendel, that Jenifer Ringer will wear as the lead in Ms. Barak's work, a mini-Broadway spectacle complete with a script, 1940s Las Vegas setting and commissioned score by the teenage phenomenon Jay Greenberg. 
 After decades in which an abstract neoclassical model largely held sway, several of the new ballets are heavy on theatricality and narrative; and all indicate the wide array of influences that contemporary choreographers and dancers are drawing on in a ballet universe no longer dominated by the 20th-century modern giants. As Mr. Martins said, William Forsythe, ballet's biggest post-Balanchine innovator, is now the major influence on younger choreographers. It sometimes seems, he added, as if they are embarrassed to use recognizably balletic steps.
 It is a time of flux for City Ballet itself, with numerous recent promotions of young dancers and pending retirements of the old guard, including Darci Kistler, the company's last dancer hand-picked by Balanchine. Change comes, no matter how many longtime observers or older company members resist it.
 ''Whether people think: 'Oh, this is gone, and this is gone, and we'll never have that style again,' '' Ms. Whelan said in a dramatic voice. ''It will never be as if Balanchine is here. We have to just get over that. Sure I wish he was here. But I'm really glad we have the choreographers we have today.''
 Even as Mr. Martins cringed at the idea that American ballet is overly enthralled with Balanchine and his aesthetic (as the Washington Post critic Sarah Kaufman has suggested), he said he would like to believe that City Ballet remains at the forefront of change, as it did when Balanchine exploded ideas of what ballet could say and do. A potent symbol of experimentation, Balanchine is now also, as Mr. Wheeldon put it, ''an unattainable benchmark.''
 The Balanchine style can sometimes seem the ''only way for ballet to develop,'' Mr. Ratmansky added. ''And I'm sure it's not the only way.'' 
 Architecture of Dance offers a snapshot of what ballet looks like today. Mr. Martins envisioned the festival after Lincoln Center asked its constituents to consider special programming for its 50th anniversary. ''I began to think: What have we been about for the last 50 years?'' he said.
 Intent on a major international celebration, he and Faycal Karoui, City Ballet's music director, set about dreaming up happy marriages between composers and choreographers. Mr. Martins originally wanted to pair artists by their native countries, and this has somewhat transpired: Mr. Millepied is working with the French composer Thierry Escaich; Mr. Greenberg and Ms. Barak are American; Mr. McGregor and his composer, Thomas Ades, are both British; and Mr. Bigonzetti is working with his longtime collaborator and fellow Italian, Bruno Moretti. 
 But the Russian Mr. Ratmansky chose ''Namouna'' by the French composer Edouard Lalo; Mr. Wheeldon, a Briton, opted for the Argentine Ginastera; and Mr. Martins, a Dane, has commissioned (with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Los Angeles Philharmonic) a score by the Finnish-born Esa-Pekka Salonen, who will conduct all performances of the work.
 Calling City Ballet ''a temple for music'' because of its ties to innovative giants like Stravinsky, Mr. Karoui voiced relief (echoed by several of his colleagues) at a return to contemporary work after the company had focused on its money-making story ballets in the winter. After that season he said, ''I heard so many people say, 'That's great, but now we want to see something else.' ''
 Remembering the 1981 Tchaikovsky Festival, when Philip Johnson and John Burgee were commissioned to design a modular environment for the stage, Mr. Martins courted Mr. Calatrava. 
 ''I brought him a bottle of red wine -- I mean really expensive red wine -- to impress him,'' Mr. Martins said of a meeting at his office. They opened it. Mr. Calatrava dipped his fingers into his drink and began rapidly sketching figures of bodies in motion. (The sketch can be seen in advertisements for the festival.)
 ''It was an honor for me to be invited,'' Mr. Calatrava said, excitedly turning through the drawings at his Park Avenue office. Hardly a ballet fan, he nonetheless said he knew of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and the importance of its interdisciplinary collaborations for ''all of the arts.'' 
 For months City Ballet has been hard at work realizing Mr. Calatrava's designs (Mr. McGregor and Mr. Ratmansky opted out), which include painted backdrops and elegant fanning structures marked by his sweeping geometric forms. In late February everyone gathered in the David H. Koch Theater for the first installation, a series of movable gold discs that will float above Mr. Bigonzetti's ballet. 
 When the dancers arrived onstage for a dress rehearsal of the Balanchine classic ''Jewels,'' looking somehow exotic in their opulent, old-fashioned costumes for the ''Diamonds'' section, the technical director Perry Silvey joked that they could keep the discs. It was a strange but compelling collision of old and new.
 In various ways the festival choreographers are acknowledging City Ballet and its history. The Ginestera score for Mr. Wheeldon's work was originally commissioned by the company's co-founder Lincoln Kirstein. Mr. Bigonzetti described his ballet as a homage to the elite City Ballet dancers. And Mr. McGregor, famous for his immersive visual environments, is using a minimalist aesthetic championed by Philip Johnson as a visual starting point. 
 Yet they are also looking to the future.
 One of the responsibilities of any art form ''is that it absolutely stops repeating patterns,'' Mr. McGregor said after a long day in the studio, adding that ballet needed to honor other arts and contemporary dance as much as it venerated its past. 
 As a company ages, he continued, its members ''get further and further away from the process of creativity'' that so galvanized the founding choreographers. (It was, after all, Balanchine who said he hoped the future of ballet would look nothing like it did in his time.)
 Mr. McGregor, who comes from a modern dance background but is the Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, is, perhaps not surprisingly, most vocal on how to effect change in big institutions. It's not the dancers, he said pointedly, who hold onto the past, as proven by the gusto with which City Ballet performers attacked his knotty, aggressively physical phrases.
 This hunger for the new is especially present in the younger performers, who are heavily represented in the festival premieres. Ms. Whelan described her ascending colleagues as confident, ''gung-ho'' and unburdened by the past. It's a stark contrast, she said, to the company she joined as an apprentice in 1984, the year after Balanchine's death, which plunged her colleagues into a lengthy mourning period. 
 Tyler Angle, who joined the corps in 2004 and became a principal last year, said his generation took a different approach. The Balanchine dictate ''Don't think, dear, just do,'' for example, ''seems a lot less valid to us,'' he said. ''We want to explore and open it up in all the ways we think it can be opened up.''
 He is dancing in three premieres, including Mr. Wheeldon's ballet, which tries to tell a story without falling prey to typical story-ballet cliches. In rehearsals Mr. Wheeldon, like several other choreographers, repeatedly emphasized naturalism and a softening of academic steps. 
 ''We spend a lot of time here in general, in this position, yeah?'' Mr. Wheeldon asked a group of male dancers, holding his arms out rigid at shoulder height, the wrists perpendicular. Or, of a presentational open-armed gesture, ''Finishing here suddenly feels circa 1940.''
 There were chuckles and rolled eyes. Then all attention turned to Mr. Wheeldon, as he tried to conjure up the next step.

13 BANKERS
 The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown
 By Simon Johnson and James Kwak
 304 pp. Pantheon Books. $26.95
 Seldom in our 230-odd years as a country have Congress and the White House had the fortitude to impose on American bankers and financiers a set of regulations sufficiently stringent to prevent them from pushing us into destructive panics and recessions. And once again Washington may be demonstrating its lack of backbone. 
 As Simon Johnson and James Kwak recount in ''13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,'' the struggle to keep bankers in check goes back to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, with results that have usually been mixed. Given the leeway to undermine the economy, bankers and financiers have done just that. 
 To put it bluntly, as this book does: the efficient-market hypothesis does not work. It never has. Markets are not self-correcting. Left to their own devices, bankers at the biggest institutions can't seem to stop themselves from speculating with borrowed money until they inevitably crash the system. 
 Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, and Kwak, a former consultant for McKinsey & Company, tell this story in matter-of-fact prose. Even their discussion of derivatives is accessible to ordinary readers (most of the time). Their conclusion: during only one period over the past two centuries was government regulation sufficiently restrictive to rein in Wall Street and the bankers. ''The result,'' they say, ''was the safest banking system that America has known in its history.'' Johnson and Kwak are referring to the 50 years from the 1930s through the 1970s.
 Ronald Reagan, of course, brought us back to the efficient-market hypothesis with its faith in laissez-faire -- a faith embraced, to one degree or another, by all of Reagan's successors as well. Who needs government oversight when markets correct themselves, they agreed, and so they stood by as regulations disappeared or were canceled. Even the Obama administration, seeking to revive regulation, has not easily shaken off the old faith in markets -- and ''13 Bankers'' needles the president's team on this point.
 For example, the authors skewer Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, and thus Obama's chief economist. In 1998, while he was deputy secretary in the Clinton Treasury, he opposed the efforts of Brooksley Born, then running the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to regulate derivatives. Her efforts ''provoked furious opposition, not only from Wall Street but also from the economic heavyweights of the federal government,'' Johnson and Kwak write.
 Drawing on previously published accounts (this book's great virtue is its skillful synthesis of what is already on the record), Johnson and Kwak describe a phone call from Summers to Born that gives the book its title. ''I have 13 bankers in my office,'' he declared, ''and they say if you go forward with this you will cause the worst financial crisis since World War II.''
 No wonder derivatives remained unregulated. And in the end, they played a huge role in producing what was in fact ''the worst financial crisis since World War II.'' Summers was dead wrong. 
 But if the case against him and others is so obvious, why did Johnson and Kwak, who run an economics blog called The Baseline Scenario, fail to speak up before the crisis erupted? Johnson, in particular, has emerged as a critic only in the past two years. If only he had separated himself sooner from the legions of mainstream economists who insisted that bankers and markets would self-correct.
 Nonetheless, ''13 Bankers'' is persuasive penance -- a well-documented appeal to embrace once again Thomas Jefferson's skepticism of concentrated banking power. Or, as Johnson and Kwak conclude: ''The financial crisis of 2007-2009 has made Jefferson a little less out of fashion.''

HEADLINE: An Existential View of the Tea Partiers' Anger

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It's not really surprising that tea partiers are, on average, doing pretty well economically (''Doing Fine, but Angry Nonetheless,'' Week in Review, April 18). I suspect that the ''pain'' they feel is -- at the risk of sounding like the ''pointy-headed intellectual'' liberal that I am -- more existential than practical. They find themselves disoriented by their newfound alienation: from a youth culture to which they are increasingly distant, from their own dreams of middle-class uplift and of American worldwide hegemony, from a country that is increasingly multicultural and, yes, led by a progressive black president. 
 Those of us on the left are no strangers to alienation, since the dominant political culture of the United States has never reflected our desires and so we have habituated to a sense of exclusion. To my friends (and opponents) in the Tea Party movement, I say, welcome to the club ... just don't forget your party manners.
 David P. Barash Redmond, Wash., April 18, 2010
 The writer is a professor of psychology at the University of Washington, Seattle.
 To the Editor:
 Charles M. Blow's implication that the Tea Party does not welcome minorities is unfair (''A Mighty Pale Tea,'' column, April 17). The Tea Party may be largely white, but it hardly needs to discourage minority participation to have such a membership profile.
 African-Americans overwhelmingly support President Obama. They do so despite the criticism from some black leaders that Mr. Obama persistently refuses to address from a racial perspective the pressing issues that adversely and disproportionately affect the black community, including unemployment.
 The African-American community, to which I belong, has every right to take this stance. But it is unfair to ignore that, and then suggest that the Tea Party is racist.
 The evidence shows that African-Americans logically would exclude themselves from the Tea Party's ranks because they are satisfied with the policies of the current administration.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. THREATENS SEATS LONG HELD BY DEMOCRATS

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Jeff Zeleny reported from Ashland, Wis., and Adam Nagourney from Washington. Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
ASHLAND, Wis. -- Representative David R. Obey has won 21 straight races, easily prevailing through wars and economic crises that have spanned presidencies from Nixon's to Obama's. Yet the discontent with Washington surging through politics is now threatening not only his seat but also Democratic control of Congress.
 Mr. Obey is one of nearly a dozen well-established House Democrats who are bracing for something they rarely face: serious competition. Their predicament is the latest sign of distress for their party and underlines why Republicans are confident of making big gains in November and perhaps even winning back the House.
 The fight for the midterm elections is not confined to traditional battlegrounds, where Republicans and Democrats often swap seats every few cycles. In the Senate, Democrats are struggling to hold on to, among others, seats once held by President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Democrats are preparing to lose as many as 30 House seats -- including a wave of first-term members -- and Republicans have expanded their sights to places where political challenges seldom develop. 
 ''It's not a lifetime appointment,'' said Sean Duffy, a Republican district attorney here in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, where he has established himself as one of the most aggressive challengers to Mr. Obey since he went to Washington in 1969. ''There are changes in this country going on, and people aren't happy.''
 Mr. Obey, who leads the powerful Appropriations Committee, is one of three House Democratic chairmen who have drawn serious opposition. Representatives John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, who oversees the Budget Committee, and Ike Skelton of Missouri, who runs the Armed Services Committee, have been warned by party leaders to step up the intensity of their campaigns to help preserve the Democratic majority.
 These established House Democrats find themselves in the same endangered straits as some of their newer colleagues, particularly those who were swept into office in 2008 by Mr. Obama as he scored victories in traditionally Republican states like Indiana and Virginia.
 Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he would consider anything short of taking back the House a failure. Republicans say they have not recruited strong candidates in all districts, but both parties agree that Republicans are within reach of capturing the 40 additional seats needed to win control. Republicans also are likely to eat into the Democratic majority in the Senate, though their prospects of taking control remain slim.
 Democratic Congressional officials -- well aware that a president's party typically loses seats in midterm elections -- have long been preparing for a tough year. But that Mr. Obey here in Wisconsin and other veteran lawmakers like Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota suddenly find themselves in a fight reflects an increasingly sour mood toward the Democratic Party and incumbents.
 ''He's supporting the party line of the Democrats, which is not consistent with North Dakota,'' said Rick Berg, a Republican state representative from North Dakota who is challenging Mr. Pomeroy. ''In the past, we've been more conservative at home than the people we send to Washington.''
 Asked if this was a good time to be a Republican candidate, Mr. Berg laughed and said, ''I sure think so.''
 Mr. Pomeroy, who has served for 18 years as the state's only congressman, won two years ago with 62 percent of the vote. Now he is among the top targets of House Republicans and is fighting without the help of one of the state's incumbent Democratic senators on the ballot, since Byron L. Dorgan chose to retire.
 ''Some cycles are more challenging as a candidate than others,'' Mr. Pomeroy said. ''This should be in the range of challenging cycles.''
 Democrats worry that some lawmakers who have avoided tough races in the past could be at added risk of defeat because they are out of practice, slow on their feet and often reluctant to acknowledge the threat they are facing. The chairman of the House re-election effort, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, has called mandatory face-to-face meetings with vulnerable members to monitor their campaigns.
 In the Seventh District of Wisconsin, which covers 17,787 square miles from the middle of the state to Lake Superior, signs of Mr. Obey's service in Congress are found in new bridges, highway expansions and countless other projects. Yet there are fewer signs of Mr. Obey himself. At the Democratic Party office in Wausau, his hometown, campaign placards hang in the window for Senator Russ Feingold, but none for Mr. Obey.
 When asked to discuss his re-election bid, Mr. Obey declined, saying that it was too early to begin talking politics and that he was focused on his legislative duties. ''I have never met anyone who thought political campaigns were too short,'' he said.
 Mr. Obey, 71, was elected two years before Mr. Duffy, 38, was born. Mr. Duffy is widely seen as leading in the Republican primary -- his opponent is the candidate who lost to Mr. Obey two years ago by 22 percentage points -- and his race has drawn support from party leaders in Washington, Tea Party activists and Sarah Palin.
 He has been elected four times as the district attorney of Ashland County, but the attention surrounding him began in 1997 when he was on MTV's ''The Real World: Boston.'' He also is well-known here as a champion lumberjack sports competitor.
 He said he decided to challenge Mr. Obey because of his leading role in the economic stimulus bill, health care legislation and the growth of government. ''I know that I can have a serious impact on the direction of the country if I could take out Obey,'' he said.
 But Mr. Obey, who has a campaign balance of $1.4 million compared with $400,000 for Mr. Duffy, is also emblematic of a bright spot for Democrats: a financial advantage.
 Mr. Sessions, the Republican re-election committee chairman, acknowledged that his party might raise less money, but said Republicans would sweep away dozens of Democrats because of the searing intensity of their voters, which he said exceeded the conservative spirit of 1994. When Republicans won control of Congress that year, the tide claimed several top Democrats, including Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
 In the Senate, Republicans also are looking to make major gains, though their hopes of winning control were set back when Tommy Thompson, a former Wisconsin governor, decided against challenging Mr. Feingold, who is seeking a fourth term. Democrats control the Senate by 59 to 41 seats.
 To win the majority, Republicans would essentially have to run the table in races across the country: fending off Democratic challenges to seats being vacated by Republican incumbents in Kentucky, Missouri, New Hampshire and Ohio, and capturing 10 seats now held by Democrats. Even in this climate, Republican officials concede that an error-free year is unlikely. Republicans appear to have a shot at winning races in Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, North Dakota and Pennsylvania.
 They would also have to pick up the seats of decidedly more entrenched -- though not unbeatable -- incumbents, like Senators Barbara Boxer of California or Patty Murray of Washington.
 But the Republicans have suffered a series of setbacks that could complicate their efforts in the Senate. In Florida, the possibility that Gov. Charlie Crist might abandon the Republican primary and run as an independent could create a three-way race, putting a state in play that Republicans thought they would not have to worry about.
 Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that while he was expecting losses, he saw signs of a turnaround, including increased contributions and enthusiasm from core Democrats.
 ''I'm not euphoric -- don't misunderstand me,'' he said. ''I just get a sense that we are moving in a better direction. I don't think Republicans are taking either one of them, but I'm damn sure they are not taking the Senate.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 2, 2010 Sunday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the 2010 Congressional elections referred incorrectly in some editions to four Senate races that are among those the Republicans would need to win to gain control of the Senate. The contests in Kentucky, Missouri, New Hampshire and Ohio are for seats being vacated by Republican incumbents. Democrats will not be challenging ''four vulnerable Republican incumbents'' in those states.

GRAPHIC: MAPS: The House: According to an analysis by The New York Times, 26 Democratic seats are currently tossups, as opposed to only one Republican seat and two previously Democratic seats that are now vacant.
 The Senate: Four Democratic seats -- in Arkansas, Delaware, Indiana and Nevada -- are leaning Republican. Retirements have left Republicans defending seats in Missouri, New Hampshire and Ohio. (A18)

HEADLINE: Fight On, Goldman Sachs!

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
MAYBE Lloyd Blankfein was doing ''God's work'' after all. 
 When the Goldman Sachs chief executive made that tone-deaf remark to an interviewer in November, he became the butt of a million insults, the ultimate symbol of Wall Street's abdication of responsibility for its sleazy role in the Great Crash of '08. But now we've learned that Blankfein was actually, if inadvertently, on the side of the angels. It's his myopic, unrepentant truculence that left Goldman exposed to a Securities and Exchange Commission accusation of fraud that will be litigated in public rather than bought off in private. And it's that S.E.C. legal action that has, in a single week, radically transformed the politics and prospects for financial reform in America. 
 In just that week, the Party of No's intransigent campaign of obstruction and obfuscation went belly up. The Obama White House moved to get its act together with an alacrity lacking in its health care campaign, abruptly adding Thursday's New York speech to the president's schedule. The bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission at last issued its first subpoena -- to Moody's, one of the rating agencies that for a fat fee slapped AAA ratings on the toxic garbage Goldman packaged and sold to benighted suckers on the other end of a huge bet placed by a favored client, the hedge fund player John Paulson.
 Salutary as this rush of events is, it still adds up so far to just one small step for mankind. We don't yet know how many loopholes lobbyists will slip into the bill-in-progress. We don't yet know the outcome of the S.E.C. case, let alone what other much-needed legal pursuit of Wall Street may follow it. And we still don't know what, if any, true correction lies ahead for the financial sector's runaway casino culture -- much of it legal -- that turned a subprime-mortgage bubble in a handful of overheated American states into an international economic meltdown. 
 But before we get to those gloomy caveats, let's smell a few roses.
 The farcical spectacle of the Republican retreat has been particularly enjoyable. It was only last Sunday that Senator Mitch McConnell went on CNN to flog his big lie that the Senate reform bill somehow guaranteed bank bailouts -- a talking point long ago concocted for the G.O.P. by its favorite spin strategist, Frank Luntz. McConnell's House counterpart, John Boehner, was meanwhile waging a campaign to portray the Democrats as shills for Goldman, a major source of Obama donations and personnel. Never mind that the Bush White House chief of staff, Joshua Bolten, was a Goldman alumnus and that both McConnell andBoehner had voted for the very bailouts they now profess to abhor (a k a TARP) after a sales job by Henry Paulson, the Bush Treasury secretary who was Blankfein's predecessor as Goldman's C.E.O. 
 In another bit of hubris, McConnell boasted of a letter signed by his caucus pledging 41-vote unity to block the reform bill. But on Monday, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who had been negotiating with his Democratic peers in good faith, took to the Senate floor to start breaking ranks with his dear leader. The bill at hand, Corker said, was ''anything but'' a mandate for bank bailouts. On Tuesday, the House G.O.P. leadership distributed a spreadsheet publicizing Goldman's donations to Democrats, and this too backfired. Politico reported the next morning that Goldman's political action committee donated more money to politicians in March than in all of 2009, most of it to Republicans. The total take for Boehner was double that of Harry Reid's. 
 That afternoon Charles Grassley of Iowa, up for re-election this fall, became the first G.O.P. senator to vote with the Democrats on part of the pending package. Maybe someone showed him another spreadsheet -- a Pew poll finding that even in a divided America 61 percent favor financial regulatory reform. The unity pledge in McConnell's pocket was now worth as much as a mortgage-backed security.
 The White House's own shift last week, though far less momentous than the Republicans', was also promising. A year ago, President Obama had delivered an address labeling the financial crisis a ''perfect storm'' -- the term long favored by Robert Rubin, the discredited guru of bailed-out Citigroup and mentor to many on the White House economic team. At Cooper Union on Thursday, the president, while far from fiery, was no longer likening the calamity to a natural disaster beyond anyone's control. He chastised those in the financial sector who saw the free market as ''a free license to take whatever you can get, however you can get it.'' He was no longer describing Blankfein, sitting before him, as a ''very savvy'' businessman -- a compliment he had bestowed on him and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase just 10 weeks earlier.
 Still, the Republicans had half a point when they indicted the White House for being too close to Goldman and its brethren. The truth is that both parties are too often in hock to the financial sector, and both parties bear responsibility for the meltdown. In response to a question from Jake Tapper of ABC News last weekend, Bill Clinton was right to say that he and two of his Treasury secretaries, Rubin and Lawrence Summers, ''were wrong'' to leave derivatives unregulated. They deserve regulation, Clinton said, because ''sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency.''
 Those same people also make smart decisions without transparency -- smart for them, if not the country. Even if the reform bill does bring stringent regulation to derivatives -- a big if -- that won't rectify capitalism's worst ''innovation'' in our own Gilded Age: the advent of exotic, speculative ''investments'' that have no redeeming social value and are instead concocted to facilitate gambling for its own sake. Such are the Goldman instruments of mass financial destruction that paid off for John Paulson. In 2007 alone, according to Gregory Zuckerman in his book ''The Greatest Trade Ever,'' Paulson's personal take amounted to over $10 million a day, ''more than the earnings of J. K. Rowling, Oprah Winfrey and Tiger Woods put together.'' That ''financial alchemy,'' as Zuckerman calls it, explains why the finance sector's share of domestic corporate profits, never higher than 16 percent until 1986, hit 41 percent in the last decade.
 As many have said -- though not many politicians in either party -- something is fundamentally amiss in a financial culture that thrives on ''products'' that create nothing and produce nothing except new ways to make bigger bets and stack the deck in favor of the house. ''At least in an actual casino, the damage is contained to gamblers,'' wrote the financial journalist Roger Lowenstein in The Times Magazine last month. This catastrophe cost the economy eight million jobs.
 Lowenstein argued for a transfer tax on financial trading, a reform that has found favor with Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, if not our own Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. Equally compelling is the notion articulated by Ryan Avent, a blogger at The Economist, that ''public anger'' and ''hooting derision'' be increased to shame Wall Street into changing its ethos. This assumes, of course, that there is any capacity for shame. Perhaps the most productive tactic comes from Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, who is using his lame-duck residence in the Senate (as the appointee to Joe Biden's old seat) to demand that we root out the ''fraud and potential criminal conduct'' that ''were at the heart of the financial crisis.''
 To achieve this overdue reckoning will require action -- by the S.E.C., the Justice Department and any other legal authority that wants to get into the act. That no one at Lehman Brothers has yet been held liable for its Enronesque bookkeeping deceit is appalling. That we still haven't seen the e-mail and documents that would illuminate A.I.G.'s machinations with Goldman and the rest of its counterparties amounts to a cover-up. That investigative journalists have consistently been way ahead of the authorities, the S.E.C. included, in uncovering Wall Street's foul play is a scandal. If this culture remains in place, the whole crisis will have gone to waste. 
 As a reminder of the unchastened status quo, Blankfein remains the gift that keeps on giving. On Thursday, The Financial Times reported that he had been calling clients to argue that the S.E.C. case against Goldman would ultimately ''hurt America.'' The opposing point of view was presented by Ira Glass on his radio show ''This American Life'' this month. With reporters from the nonprofit journalistic organization ProPublica, it told the story of another hedge fund, Magnetar, that gamed the housing bubble. Bankers who worked on Magnetar deals walked away with their huge bonuses well before disaster struck -- or, as the program put it, ''bankers made money even when they were buying things that eventually blew up the bank.'' Not to mention the economy. And it was all legal.
 To award the audience a bonus, ''This American Life'' concluded with a Broadway song commissioned from a co- author of the satirical musical ''Avenue Q.'' Titled ''Bet Against the American Dream,'' it distills a complex financial saga to its essence: Those who shorted the housing market shorted the country. 
 Go online, listen to it and laugh. But the fact remains that those who truly hurt America are laughing harder still, all the way to the bank.

To the Editor:
 In ''Can't Cut Spending? Look Around the Globe'' (Economic View, April 18), Tyler Cowen was concerned about the effects of raising taxes on high earners once the Bush administration's tax cuts expire. 
 ''Higher taxes would discourage hard work,'' he wrote. 
 The implication seems to be that higher taxes on the wealthy would sacrifice the economic vibrancy and growth we desperately need to get us out of the ditch we're in. 
 Such taxes were reduced, of course, during the presidency of George W. Bush. Yet those years saw the creation of only a small fraction of the new jobs added during the previous eight. What happened? Russ Glisker

HEADLINE: Perils Remain Despite Recovery's Pace, I.M.F. Head Says

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The head of the International Monetary Fund said Saturday that the global economic recovery, while moving along faster than expected, was vulnerable to threats posed by long-term unemployment and unsustainable public debts. 
 ''After panic, action and relief is the phase of rebuilding,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the monetary fund, said at its spring meetings.
 Youssef Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian finance minister, who led a meeting of the fund's policy making committee, said, ''The worst is definitely behind us, but we are not out of the woods yet.'' 
 The I.M.F., which only a few years ago found itself defending its relevance, has assumed a new prominence and increased its lending capacity since the global economic turmoil began in 2007. It extended loans of $2 billion to Latvia and $16 billion to Hungary in 2008, and it is now expected to contribute as much as $20 billion to a bailout of debt-stricken Greece.
 The Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, met here with Mr. Strauss-Kahn; the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet; and the European Union's commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Olli Rehn.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who took part in the meetings, ''encouraged them to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support'' for Greece, the Treasury Department said in a statement. 
 Asked about the protests gripping Greece over the joint rescue plan by the I.M.F. and the European Union, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, ''The Greek citizens shouldn't fear the I.M.F. We are there to try to help them.''
 The I.M.F. also renewed a pledge to approve a redistribution of power that would lessen the emphasis on the wealthiest countries.
 Those nations have dominated I.M.F. decision making since the body was founded in 1944, but voting power, which is based on a system of quotas, has not shifted to match the growth of economies in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere.
 At the fund's spring meetings two years ago, the I.M.F. approved a plan for substantial changes in the voting system. To meet a January 2011 deadline, 112 countries representing 85 percent of total voting power need to accept the plan. But so far only 70 nations, representing 73 percent of voting power, have signed on. 
 The Group of 20 endorsed a proposal in October to redistribute 5 percent of the organization's voting power from the wealthiest countries toward emerging economies -- like those of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and developing nations.
 ''The goal is to achieve legitimate representation based on countries' economic weight in the world,'' Mr. Geithner said in a statement.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C.'s Seizure of Senate Candidate's Family Bank Further Complicates an Illinois Race

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Some Democrats had long worried that Alexi Giannoulias might not be their best hope of holding onto President Obama's former seat in the United States Senate, and then came word that federal regulators on Friday night had seized Broadway Bank, an institution here owned by Mr. Giannoulias's family.
 The move was not unexpected -- even Mr. Giannoulias, 34, who was a senior loan officer at Broadway before he was elected treasurer of Illinois, had said in recent months that it was likely to come to this. But the announcement added an enormous burden for an already difficult Senate race here: how to persuade voters to elect someone whose family bank collapsed, in part due to failed commercial real estate loans, at a time of bailouts, economic uncertainty and anti-banker sentiment? 
 Describing the developments as ''heartbreaking,'' Mr. Giannoulias made it clear to reporters on Friday night that he would press on in his campaign against Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican and five-term congressman from the suburbs.
 ''I have a renewed vigor and a new perspective on just how horrible it is out there for so many people,'' he said. ''It is that perspective which compels me to work harder, fight with even more passion, and make sure that the lessons my father taught me every day live on in this campaign.''
 Mr. Giannoulias, who in a February primary won the Democratic nomination for the seat now held by Roland W. Burris, a Democrat who is not running, suggested that his family's woes mirrored those of ordinary people and businesses everywhere during the financial downturn. So far this year, the F.D.I.C. has announced failures at 57 banks, including seven in Illinois on Friday night.
 But it was already apparent that Broadway Bank will be a constant refrain for Republicans -- who would love the symbolism of seizing Mr. Obama's former seat, not to mention adding one to their numbers -- from now until November.
 ''While years of risky lending schemes, hot money investments and loans to organized crime led to today's failure, it's a sad day for Broadway Bank employees who may lose their jobs due to Mr. Giannoulias's reckless business practices,'' a statement issued by Mr. Kirk's spokeswoman said.
 In recent years, Illinois voters have favored Democratic candidates. But political experts say this race appears tight, particularly because Mr. Kirk is viewed as moderate on social issues and because Democrats have been plagued by scandal (it was this very seat that Rod R. Blagojevich, the former governor, is charged with trying to profit from).
 For months, Broadway Bank has tormented Mr. Giannoulias. First came news in January that regulators were requiring the bank to raise $85 million. Then reports emerged of questionable deals, including a story by The Chicago Tribune that said the bank loaned $20 million to two felons when Mr. Giannoulias still worked there.
 Broadway Bank, with four branches here, was created by the family of Mr. Giannoulias almost three decades ago.
 The question now is how much help Democratic leaders will provide Mr. Giannoulias. Mr. Obama used to play basketball with Mr. Giannoulias and has been an ally, but some in the White House months ago tried to persuade at least one other person -- Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general -- to run for the seat.

HEADLINE: Why Should They Believe Us?

 BODY:
Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, the host of this June's Group of 8 summit meeting, said last week that ''if the G-8 is to remain credible, accountability is absolutely necessary.'' He is right. Leaders of the world's wealthiest nations can start bolstering their credibility by explaining how they plan to fill the $20 billion gap between the foreign aid they promised to send to developing countries and what they are actually giving. 
 This is not just an issue of morality. It is also one of strategic leverage. Rich industrial nations have promised even more aid to developing countries to try to persuade them to curb carbon emissions -- stop chopping down their forests and switch from dirty coal to cleaner fuels -- and tackle climate change. Given the G-8's track record, poorer nations are right to be skeptical. 
 In 2005, the rich nations pledged to increase development aid by $50 billion in real terms by 2010, to roughly $145 billion per year in today's money. Now the time has come and they are $20 billion short, according to estimates from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Of the $25 billion in additional aid promised to Africa, only $11 billion has been delivered. 
 Some countries are doing worse than others. Italian aid this year will be less than 40 percent of its target. Japan is delivering only $7 of each $10 it promised. Washington will meet its 2010 commitment but is falling behind its rhetoric. In 2002 it joined others to sign a declaration urging developed countries to raise aid levels to 0.7 percent of gross national product. In the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to ''double our foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012.'' 
 American overseas development assistance now stands at a little over $28 billion -- barely 0.2 percent of G.N.P. European donors and Canada are also lagging. 
 Aid is an essential component of any strategy to defeat terrorism, promote global security and combat global warming. The current offer to help poor countries deal with climate change is $10 billion a year until 2012 and $100 billion a year after that. Right now we doubt anybody will believe that.

HEADLINE: Green Economics

 BODY:
Paul Krugman surveys admirably the climate-change debate. Favoring cap and trade over direct carbon taxes, however, he ignores a critical variable. Once the caps have been disseminated by auction or (politically corruptible) direct allocation to the millions of emitters, how do we ensure that the emitters stay within their caps? Monitoring a cap system would be an administrative nightmare, evoking even more anger over big-government intervention in our lives. Despite the political antipathy, carbon taxes levied at the primary energy-source level make more operational sense. Aetna Professor Emeritus, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. F. M. SCHERER Aetna Professor Emeritus, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 
 Even if Krugman is right to advocate cap and trade, he misses the larger picture. Greenhouse-gas emissions aren't as important as population growth and sustainability. Population growth drives greenhouse-gas growth -- as well as almost every other macroproblem facing mankind and the planet. Unrestricted population growth is leading to the disappearance of nonrenewables and to an irreversible accumulation of solid, liquid and gaseous waste from industry, agriculture, humans and animals. We are only beginning to learn how many serious problems there are, e.g., the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It's curious that economists and environmentalists don't acknowledge that greenhouse-gas emissions are only one part of the larger havoc already wreaked by overpopulation. LOUIS HAROVITZ Staten Island
 Krugman makes an airtight argument for cutting carbon pollution now to avert economic and environmental catastrophe in our children's lifetime. The case for taking action -- by passing clean-energy and climate legislation -- is even more compelling when we consider three important benefits the article did not specifically address.
 First, by promoting investment in the next generation of energy-efficient cars, homes and workplaces, we can put two million Americans back to work. These are good-paying jobs for workers who have the skills we need now -- jobs that can't be outsourced or shipped overseas. Second, by developing the clean-energy technologies of tomorrow, we can lay the groundwork for decades of export-driven success in the fast-growing global marketplace for solar panels, wind turbines, hybrid cars and the like. Finally, we can cut our oil imports in half, largely by tapping crude oil stranded in aging American wells, through the emerging technology this legislation would encourage.
 As Krugman makes clear, we know how to curb climate change. And we know how to do it in a way that makes our economy stronger and our country more secure. We must find the political will to do so. FRANCES BEINECKE President, Natural Resources Defense Council New York
 Krugman's article is an enormously helpful analysis of the interface where economics and science meet. It was the first time someone explained the meaning of ''cap and trade'' in language that I could understand. I'm not sure I like the moral concept behind it, but at least I know what I'm talking about now when I debate it with others.
 I spend a lot of time in the Adirondack Mountains, where byproducts of Ohio River Valley cap-and-trade companies continue to cause acid rain to fall into once-pristine lakes and rivers. It doesn't seem right to give financial rewards to those who continue to pollute, and it grieves me that this flawed alternative may, in some sense, work quite well.
 Krugman notes that an altruistic concern for future generations is necessary to pass legislation that would limit emissions in a ''Big Bang'' manner. I share with him (reluctantly) the belief that such altruism has been lost in the nastiness of congressional partisanship. JED WAVERLY Providence, R.I.
 Krugman, like many others, draws the wrong lesson fromthe Clean Air Act's acid-rain-reduction program. Emissions trading had relatively little to do with that program's achieving its goals at a cost far less than expected. The key lay in another innovation. The Environmental Protection Agency allowed utilities the flexibility to achieve the reduction goals any way they wanted, and most utilities chose to switch to low-sulfur coal, a substantially cheaper alternative.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding a Town Hub From a Store's Ashes

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
PUTNEY, Vt. -- When residents saw flames shooting out of the Putney General Store in November, they were filled with an all-too familiar sense of dread.
 Stunned residents watched the store, which had been rebuilt after being severely damaged in an electrical fire in May 2008 but had not yet reopened, burn in a fireball that could be seen for miles. Then the improbable got even worse: the fire was declared arson. 
 ''It was definitely an emotional kick to the gut,'' said one resident, Lyssa Papazian. And the town was determined to hit back. 
 For residents of this bucolic town of 2,600 in southern Vermont, the general store was more than just a place to grab a cup of coffee or pick up a loaf of bread on the way home. For more than 200 years it had literally and figuratively been the town center, where people learned when babies were born and debated town issues while perusing the shelves or buying a hammer. Out-of-towners on their way to ski or see foliage would stop for sandwiches and penny candy and pose for photographs in front of the red wooden building.
 A group of older regulars who dubbed themselves the Viagra Club would sit inside -- or outside on lawn chairs if the weather was nice -- on Friday mornings to drink coffee, eat doughnuts and ''solve the problems of the world,'' said Ben Dow, a member of the group and the town's veterinarian. 
 Jeff Shumlin, a member of the Putney Historical Society, which bought the building months before the May 2008 fire and raised $200,000 to repair it, said, ''This place was the primary crossroads of our community.'' The building, built around 1796, was believed to have been the oldest general store in Vermont.
 After the second fire was put out and all that remained was a gaping, charred hole in the ground, there was no doubt, Mr. Shumlin and others said, that the store would rise for a third time. 
 ''We asked people whether, in this environment, we should rebuild, and every single person said yes,'' Mr. Shumlin said. ''Some stood up and said, 'We have to rebuild this store, because we can't let some twisted person dictate what this town becomes.' '' 
 A picture of a phoenix rising from the ashes hung on the chain-link fence that surrounds the hole, along with photographs of the store in annual Fourth of July parades and throughout the years. The phoenix picture was stolen earlier this month, an act that residents call another slap against the store. 
 ''It's very personal,'' Lorelei Smead said. ''It's almost like a death in this town. But when you have a death, you mourn and it's all done. This is like a rebirth. We're building, and it's coming back.'' 
 In less than six months, the Putney Historical Society has raised more than $800,000 through numerous state and federal grants, Internet donations, bake sales, concerts, corporate funds and unsolicited contributions to help rebuild the store. 
 The store's post-and-beam foundation, which will be constructed from donated local trees, is on schedule to be raised in July, and residents hope the store will reopen in December with fanfare and a party unlike Putney has seen. 
 ''It's like a town project,'' Mark Bowen, a logger who cuts the store's beams at a sawmill just yards from the site, said as he shoved a huge piece of red oak through a saw. 
 In many ways, he and others said, rebuilding the store was necessary to keep Putney on the map. While most concede that the recession played a part, many businesses near the ''G store,'' as some call it, have closed since May 2008, with many blaming their failure on decreased traffic since the store's first fire. The bookstore was the latest casualty. 
 ''The economic vitality of the town has really escaped us over the past few years,'' Mr. Shumlin said. ''It's a really inactive environment, and everyone has suffered.'' 
 Not Paul Mousel, who owns Mountain Paul's, a convenience store a few doors down from where the general store stood. Mr. Mousel said his business had boomed since the fires, which he said were tragedies for the town. 
 Mr. Mousel thinks the store should reopen for its historical significance, but feels that in a town with two other stores besides his own -- a food co-op and gas station market -- the building should serve some other purpose, like a hardware store. 
 ''There are a lot of other things this town needs that could be put in that space and be better for Putney,'' Mr. Mousel said as the lunch crowd started to gather around his store's deli counter. ''When the general store was open, we all sold basically the same thing.'' 
 Others say that it is not so much what is inside the store -- although it was pretty much anything and everything, residents said -- but the sense of place and community it brings to the town. The new store, Ms. Papazian said, will look almost exactly like the old one, but will be energy efficient and have larger windows to showcase the rushing Sackett's Brook, which lies parallel to the site.
 ''It's more than just the box,'' Ms. Papazian said. ''We'll build a new box, and it will look very nice.''
 But who will run what is inside is still up in the air. The historical society, which bought the store after the first fire, is having trouble finding a new operator for it and hopes that someone looking for a new business will come forward soon. 
 Putney also still bears the scars of the arson, a major crime in a town where people keep their doors unlocked at night. The case is still open, and a $15,000 reward was offered shortly after the fire. The reopening will go a long way toward healing, Ms. Smead said, as will an arrest. 
 ''Why would anyone do that?'' Ms. Smead asked over coffee at the Putney Diner, across the street from where the store stood. ''We have to reopen the general store. It's part of us.''

HEADLINE: Community College Tax On Ballot in San Mateo

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics for 25 years. He is the editor of the California Health Report at healthycal.org.

 BODY:
San Mateo County voters could soon become the first in California to approve a special parcel tax on property to help pay for community college education in the county.
 A June 8 vote on the issue is being closely watched in the Bay Area and across the state by other community college districts and by anti-tax groups. Both sides say the concept could become a model for districts struggling with their finances amid cuts in state spending brought about by the recession.
 The tax would cost the owners of each parcel of property $34 per year and raise an estimated $6 million to boost the district's $80 million budget. 
 ''We're doing something that would be the first of its kind,'' said Ron Galatolo, chancellor for the three-campus system that serves 40,000 students. ''Just because someone has not done it before does not mean we shouldn't try it.''
 Mr. Galatolo said none of the money raised by the tax would go toward administration. The proceeds would be placed in a separate fund and used to restore some of the part-time faculty, whose jobs the district cut to cope with a $24 million reduction in its budget.
 ''I am going to bring those faculty back and put them into the classroom,'' Mr. Galatolo said. ''We had 14,000 students on our waiting list last fall. There is a huge demand out there for our services. We're not providing the academic support they need because we don't have the resources.''
 Like districts across the state, San Mateo has been hit from two sides. The state has cut the district's financing even as more students want to take classes. Enrollment at community colleges typically climbs during recessions as people who lose their jobs seek retraining or simply bide their time. And with enrollment cuts and big tuition hikes at the University of California and California State Universities, many students who would have gone to four-year colleges in the past are now trying to enroll in community colleges instead.
 Patricia Dilko, a professor of early childhood education at Canada College in Redwood City and president of the district's academic senate, said many students she knows cannot get the classes they need to earn a two-year degree or transfer to a four-year college.
 ''Most of them are part-time already, and now they are looking at even longer times to get through,'' Ms. Dilko said.
 The district has carefully tailored its proposal to try to win the two-thirds majority required to approve the tax. The $34 amount was poll-tested and is well below the range of parcel taxes already imposed by more than a dozen kindergarten-through-12th grades districts in San Mateo County, which range from $78 to $290 annually.
 The levy would expire after four years. And property owners age 65 and older, who make up a large share of the electorate and are generally skeptical of higher taxes, could claim an exemption that would allow them to opt out of the tax.
 The proposal, known as Measure E on San Mateo County ballots, is supported by a coalition of education, community, labor and business groups, including the local Chamber of Commerce. It is opposed by anti-tax groups.
 Douglas A. McNea, president of the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, said his group opposed the measure in part because it would force local taxpayers to finance education for students from elsewhere. Unlike kindergarten-through-12th grade districts, where almost all the students come from within the district's boundaries, community college enrollment is open to anyone in California.
 ''You even have people from out of state and out of the country going to community colleges,'' Mr. McNea said. ''You are putting the burden on property owners to support something that is not necessarily benefiting them.''
 Mr. McNea said districts elsewhere in the Bay Area were watching the election and could well follow suit if San Mateo's measure succeeds. ''This would set a bad precedent,'' he said.
 But Erik Skinner, the vice chancellor for fiscal policy for the California Community Colleges, said state budget cuts had put all districts in a ''survival mode'' and forced them to look for creative solutions.
 ''This is something that we have heard several districts are exploring,'' Mr. Skinner said. ''If it passes, I don't think there is any question that it would attract a lot of attention.''

THE HEIGHTS
 By Peter Hedges
 295 pp. Dutton. $25.95
 The set-up of Peter Hedges' third novel, ''The Heights,'' is classic and promising. An attractive young couple, married with children, are roused from their quotidian rounds of diapers-and-drop-offs when a rich, beautiful stranger comes to town -- ''town,'' in this case, being the mediacentric, well-heeled, aesthetically unbeatable Brooklyn Heights, where the husband teaches history at an exclusive academy a lot like St. Ann's. Private school, real estate, a marriage at risk: what more could anyone want? 
 To tell this story, Hedges forgoes both the first-person voice and the third in favor of that more liberating option: the multiple first person (''first people''?). Each chapter announces who's talking: Tim; Kate; Tim; Kate. These two, of course, are the husband and wife, and Hedges splits the narrative more or less between them, with the stranger and a few other minor characters weighing in from time to time. But the voice that really controls the story belongs to Tim Welch, a good-natured guy with an unwritten dissertation and a healthy sex drive. Money is tight for the couple, so when Kate is offered a dream job, Tim takes a year's leave from Montague Academy to be a stay-at-home dad.
 I know what you're thinking: another acerbic gin-in-the-juicebox account of child care in stressed-out, knowledge-economy America. But this is not that book. ''The Heights'' does not have the caustic sting of, say, Tom Perrotta's ''Little Children.'' Although Tim and Kate start out barely able to pay the bills and living in 900 square feet compared with their neighbors' 5,000, no one in this book is embittered or desperate. ''The Heights'' is, in fact, a remarkably cheerful book; and as such, it suffers a bit from its own good will. Hedges (a screenwriter and director whose first novel was ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape'') really seems to like the Welches. Unpretentious, middle-income, still having sex -- why wouldn't he? But I found myself wishing he had upped the comic ante by sacrificing some of this couple's appeal. 
 I also wish he had settled on a tone. At one point Tim's father, a women's basketball coach at a Midwestern college, is busted for sexual harassment and loses his job. That could have played as domestic comedy or tragedy, but it instead comes and goes with no further implications for the novel. Meanwhile, Kate's new job -- for which she is, in a typically serendipitous turn, wildly overpaid -- is as the administrator of a foundation that gives money to jokily named charities like ''Adopt-a-Minefield'' or ''The International Breast Milk Project.''
 While we're on funny names, Kate's boss is ''Bruno Schwine,'' and the Welches' children attend preschool at ''R Kids Count Learning Center.'' But the playground mothers Tim comes to know have the synecdochical nametags we've learned to expect: ''Eager-to-Please Mom, Best-Dressed Mom, Grateful Dead Mom.'' The jokes in these names seem to emerge from two different novels, from two different comic traditions -- the one (Eager-to-Please Mom) fundamentally realist; the other (Bruno Schwine) over-the-top and slightly surreal. Comedy is so dependent on tone -- on the reader's knowing precisely how to take jokes, among other things -- that Hedges sacrifices the laughs by trying to have it both ways. 
 There is one motif running through the novel that Hedges knows just how to employ: the sex. Despite the split first-person narrative, ''The Heights'' offers a man's vision, sexually. Anal sex is a preoccupation, and when some women get together for a girls' night, they not only drink the customary margaritas but also (brace yourselves, now) watch a porn movie to learn how to satisfy their men with strap-on dildos. There's something frat and very funny in the frankness of these passages, which reveal the lustful male heart beating beneath the variegated facade of ''The Heights.''

HEADLINE: How Much Do You Know About Transportation?

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
Electronic clickers in hand, the Chicago metropolitan area's most influential transportation officials gathered on Thursday morning and took a quiz. Try out some of the questions:
 There were 8.1 million people in the Chicago region in 2002. How many additional people are expected to be here in 2040?
A. 1.3 million; B. 2.8 million; C. 3.1 million; D. 4 million. 
 How much do families who live in the region spend on transportation each year?
 A. $14 billion; B. $17 billion; C. $22 billion; D. More than $30 billion.
 How many governments are responsible for the region's transportation system?
 A. 247; B. 278; C. 325; D. 380.
 What percentage of unlinked trips (you don't stop to pick up a child or shop, etc., before reaching a final destination) in the Chicago region are made on public transportation?
 A. 6.9; B. 8.9; C. 19.5; D. 37.1.
 What percentage of C.T.A. train riders live in the suburbs?
 A. 11; B. 26; C. 34; D. 47.
 What percentage of Metra and Pace riders live in Chicago?
 A. 12; B. 25; C. 33; D. 50.
 What would the current state gas tax of 19 cents per gallon be if it had been indexed to inflation since it was last raised in 1990?
 A. 25 cents per gallon; B. 32 cents per gallon; C. 41 cents per gallon; D. 52 cents per gallon.
 Don't fret. The experts were all over the place. Indeed, two-thirds of a group of more than 100 got that first one wrong. By 2040, we should have another 2.8 million people, or a 34 percent increase.
 As for the other queries, the answers are:
 Families spend more than $30 billion, or 27 percent of their income, on transit.
 A dizzying 380 governmental units are involved in transit, including 284 municipalities, 83 townships, I.D.O.T., R.T.A., C.T.A., Metra, Pace and the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority.
 A mere 6.9 percent of unlinked trips are made on public transit.
 Twenty-six percent of C.T.A. riders live in the suburbs.
 Thirty-three percent of Metra/Pace riders live in the city.
 Your per-gallon gas tax would be 32 cents, instead of 19 cents, if indexed to inflation since 1990.
 The quiz was a warm-up act for a regional transportation summit on Earth Day, hosted by Paula Wolff, chairman of the toll highway authority, and featuring an appearance by Gov. Pat Quinn. It included the heads of Metra, Pace, the C.T.A., R.T.A., I.D.O.T., the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and many others.
 There is scant dispute on the importance of transportation. As Ms. Wolff framed it, it's the backbone of the regional economy. It affects where we live, where businesses locate, the air we breathe, time spent with families and our household finances.
 Of course, there is the craziness of the involvement of 380 governmental entities. Throw in city-suburban and Chicago-Downstate tussles over financing, as well as our dependence on the automobile and political cowardice over raising taxes, and the challenge is clear.
 Some attendees pointed with hope to voter passage of a St. Louis, Mo., County referendum in early April. It backed a sales tax increase for improvement and expansion of city and suburban mass transit.
 Voters passed that increase because they were convinced the investment would improve their local economy and quality of life. But I wonder how persuasive that argument would be elsewhere, particularly in a recession.
 ''Use crisis to test people's desire to pay money if they can see a clear plan that will reduce their cost of living,'' said Joel Rogers, a speaker at the event and a professor of law, political science and sociology at the University of Wisconsin who runs the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a policy center. ''Of course, it may destroy you politically,'' he said, drawing guffaws from attendees, and for good reason.
 Different jurisdictions don't trust one another and act ''like sick people trying to steal one another's medicine,'' he said. It's why no state has a unified plan when it comes to transit, land use, housing and energy, he told me later.
 ''The raw politics make it difficult to get the financing needed for a smart, regional transportation plan,'' said Bill Morris, a toll highway board member and a former state senator and mayor of Waukegan. ''It's fatal for a Democrat to call for higher taxes, and the first group which perceives it's shorted will yell.''
 It's too darn bad. C.T.A. pass in hand, I grabbed a Michigan Avenue bus and headed north.

HEADLINE: Pension Financing Shortfall Is a Threat on the Horizon for State

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING

 BODY:
In this Tea Party age, when thousands of people demonstrate nationwide against high taxes, the 15,000 people who rallied in Springfield last week tried a change-of-pace chant. ''Raise My Taxes!'' they shouted at the television cameras and any lawmakers who happened by. 
 The clamor over the state's estimated $13 billion budget deficit --and concerns over jobs and spending that prompted the protests -- tends to drown out discussion of an issue that economists identify as perhaps the biggest long-term threat to Illinois's financial health: The state's shortfall of at least $61 billion in pension funding and the lack of any realistic plan to catch up. 
In fact, the state's pension troubles are even more dire than the official figures would indicate, according to a review of pension data and other economic studies by the Chicago News Cooperative. Illinois, which sold $3.47 billion in securities so it could make its required contribution to pension funds this year, is laying plans to sell at least $4.6 billion more to meet its obligations for fiscal 2011 -- a move that is likely to jolt financial markets and many investors who thought years would pass before the state tried another sale of notes to cover its pension costs. Taxpayers ultimately will bear the burden as the need to pay for the bonds strains the state budget and threatens spending in other areas.
 To date, the state has provided only about 54 percent of the money necessary to meet its projected long-term obligations, according to a study by the Pew Center on the States. But economists who have studied the state's figures say Illinois's true obligation to retirees most likely is far larger than official estimates.
 The state legislature's Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability has put the shortfall at $61 billion. But a group of business leaders led by the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago estimates the actual figure at $79 billion, and Joshua D. Rauh, a Northwestern University economist and an expert on how states finance their pension systems, offers a much higher estimate: $166 billion in the largest three funds alone. 
 The fight over such a long-term problem has immediate consequences for the state. Illinois is borrowing billions of dollars to catch up on its pension shortfall, and the extra borrowing adds to the state's debt burden.
 Pensions are not the only area in which the state is failing to meet its long-term commitments to current and former employees. Illinois is $40 billion behind in covering retiree health care costs. In order to eliminate the shortfall -- which had gone unnoticed because the legislature did not require reporting by state health plans until recently -- taxpayers would have to lay out at least $550 million a year, according to Moody's Investors Service. 
 In the past, the pension and health-care shortfalls were largely overlooked by Illinois taxpayers and politicians. But not any longer: the state's pension problems, in particular, have become a major concern among investors, and a potentially potent issue as Springfield legislators try to agree on a state budget.
 ''Illinois is clearly at the top of the list in terms of states that have a funding problem for their pensions,'' said Susan K. Uhran, managing director of the Pew Center on the States. In a nationwide study, Pew found that Illinois's 54 percent funding of pension obligations is lower than any state in the nation. 
 Ted Hampton, a Moody's analyst, said, ''Not only do they have an under-funded pension relative to other states and a very weak financial situation, but they are struggling to make their statutorily required contributions to the pension plans, and they don't have the revenues to do it.'' 
 Moody's downgraded Illinois's credit rating in December and assigned a ''negative outlook'' in late March to a proposed state bond offering, in large part because of the pension problems. An upgrade announced earlier this year was the result of a change in Moody's rating system, not an improvement in the state's fiscal condition. 
 Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a tax policy and government research organization, said he was startled when he heard recently from David Vaught, the state budget director, that Gov. Patrick J. Quinn plans to issue up to $7 billion in new debt instruments, at least in part to pay for next year's $4.1 billion pension contribution.. 
 ''This is both fiscally irresponsible and very expensive,'' Mr. Msall said.
 Illinois first issued pension bonds in 2003, when former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich pushed through a $10 billion bond issue, the largest such deal ever, purportedly to help the state catch up on pension contributions. But nearly a quarter of the proceeds went to fill gaps in the state's budget.
 By 2007, the state's unfunded pension liability had grown back to the level it had hit prior to the $10 billion bond sale. Now, the state's taxpayers must pay interest of more than $540 million a year on those bonds and outlays will escalate sharply in coming years as the state must repay the borrowed funds. 
 Contributing to Illinois's pension troubles is a tendency to be overly optimistic when budgeting how the pension-fund managers will perform. 
 Today, Illinois is one of only five states that budgets for an investment return as high as 8.5 percent. Over the last 10 years, four of the state pension funds -- those representing teachers, state employees, judges and state lawmakers -- have averaged only a 3.89 percent return. Data for the state's university employees, representing about one-fifth of the state pension funds, could not be obtained.
 For the four pension funds, the returns on investment over the last decade have come in at less than half the forecasted amount -- a shortcoming that could have huge ramifications over time as state taxpayers are forced to make up the difference. 
 Even a small change in investment returns can have a huge impact on the long-term financial health of the state pension plans. But a recent change in the way Illinois reports investment results has shaken confidence in the state's estimates.
 A law passed last year allows the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability to report average investment results over a five-year period when estimating the state's pension shortfall. The technique, called ''asset smoothing,'' can have a large impact after a year like 2009, when the five state pension funds as a group lost 20 percent.
 Some pension watchers are crying foul over the practice. The issue caused a rift last year on the state's Pension Modernization Task Force, prompting a group led by the Civic Committee to issue a dissenting report, in part because of concerns that asset smoothing was enabling the state to provide misleading estimates of Illinois's unfunded pension liabilities. 
 Business leaders wrote in their report that asset smoothing ''cannot possibly justify false reporting'' of the state's pension shortfall. Instead of the $61 billion official figure, the dissenting group put the unfunded liabilities at $79 billion. 
 In 1995, the state began a 50-year plan to catch up on its legal obligation to make good on pension commitments to state employees. The target: 90 percent financing of the state's pension plans by 2045.
 Since then, the state has taken some form of ''holiday'' on meeting its obligations under the plan in at least four separate years. And required payments are expected to rise sharply next year because fiscal 2010 marked the end of a 15-year ramp-up phase toward much steeper annual contributions.
 Last month, the legislature adopted a program to permanently slow the growth of the state's pension liabilities. The program raises the retirement age to 67, and caps the top pension-eligible salary at $106,800. Instead of the guaranteed benefits offered to current employees, new hires will be offered only a defined-contribution pension plan.
 Mr. Rauh, from Northwestern, quickly dubbed the new law Illinois's ''irrelevant pension reform.'' Despite the change, Mr. Rauh estimated, Illinois's three largest pension funds will run out of money by 2018 if no further reform measures are enacted.
 Such an event, Mr. Rauh said, ''threatens to bankrupt the state on a 10-year horizon.''
 The reforms do not go far enough, Mr. Rauh added. For example, current employees have earned the pension benefits they have accrued up to this point, but it would be legal, he said, to reduce pension benefits for any future work.
 Without major reform in the near future, Mr. Rauh said, the state could face serious financial trouble. ''How many years,'' he said, ''before the capital markets say, 'Geez, these guys are close to running out of money.' ''

 BODY:
THE NEWS The five biggest banking companies in the United States reported a total of $17 billion in profits for the first quarter of 2010, by far their best showing ever. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Much of the gain came from proprietary trading, the risky business that got the big banks in trouble to begin with, and which they would have to spin off under President Obama's proposed regulatory overhaul. News of the profits was overshadowed by the government's charges that Goldman Sachs created securities that were secretly designed to fail, so that a favored customer could bet against them. 
 THE NEWS The Federal Reserve reported that it turned over $47.4 billion in surpluses to the United States Treasury in 2009, the most ever and a 50 percent increase over 2008. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The financial crisis has been a big moneymaker for the Fed (and thus for taxpayers). The huge volume of mortgage-backed securities and other assets that the central bank bought to assist government-arranged bank mergers and shore up the housing market are yielding much more than the Fed's usual low-rate loans to member banks. ''Central banking is a great business,'' joked one former Fed official. 
 THE NEWS Daniel Goldstein, above, the last holdout standing in the way of the giant Atlantic Yards redevelopment in Brooklyn, agreed to accept $3 million in return for surrendering his apartment and ending his active opposition. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Goldstein, who paid $590,000 for his condominium in 2003, became the standard-bearer for opponents of the $4.9 billion mixed-use project when he refused to move. If he had not reached a deal with the developer, Forest City Ratner, he faced eviction by the state government, which had lost patience with the delays and had condemned his property. 
 THE NEWS Travel insurers began paying what are expected to be tens of millions of dollars in claims from thousands of stranded travelers after flights to and from airports in Europe were grounded by an ash plume from an erupting volcano in Iceland.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though some insurers said the ash cloud was an ''act of God'' that is excluded from coverage, most treated it simply as bad weather and reimbursed stranded customers for nonrefundable tickets and up to $250 a day in expenses. About 30 percent of American travelers buy the insurance, paying $1.6 billion in premiums a year. 
 THE NEWS CBS and Turner Broadcasting agreed to pay $10.8 billion to broadcast the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament from 2011 to 2024.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The companies will carry the next 14 tournaments on four networks -- CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV -- and air each game nationally, ending CBS's regional coverage of early-round games. The deal is worth $71 million more annually than the $700 million average the association now gets. And there may be more games to watch: the field is expected to expand to 68 teams from 65, and N.C.A.A. officials would not rule out further expansion.

HEADLINE: Financial Reform: A View From the Electric Industry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Whose Side Are They On?'' (editorial, April 18): 
 As the providers of affordable electricity to consumers, America's electric industry enthusiastically supports increased transparency and broad reform of derivatives markets to help ensure against systemic risk and another financial crisis. To this end, we support mandatory reporting requirements on all derivative transactions to regulators.
 But if all commercial entities were forced to clear hedging contracts, as you suggest, the margin requirements necessary would tie up huge amounts of capital at a time when the industry is making investments to reduce carbon emissions and modernize the power grid.
 The increased costs of clearing would defeat the purpose of using derivatives to protect customers from price volatility and would instead increase their exposure.
 We urge Congress and the administration to recognize that financial reform can be crafted without the forced clearing of derivatives by those who do not pose a systemic risk.

HEADLINE: Same Game, Other Side of Tracks

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
 A HIGH school football field has a majesty, even when empty, all the more so in Texas, where the weekly game is a religious rite in which youthful striving collides with pride of place. Last November a lone worker was preparing one of those fields for battle, patrolling the pristine artificial turf of the Dillon Panthers with a can of weed killer for any strays sticking through the carpet. With its waiting, expectant stands, the field looked like almost like a television set. 
 Which of course it is, situated on a lot in an industrial part of Austin, near the airport. For four seasons this place has sprung to life not only with squads of players, but also with camera crews, production trailers and cast members of ''Friday Night Lights,'' a series that has become a fetish object for critics but has yet to have a winning season in the ratings. The show, about the fictional Texas town of Dillon, has survived only because of a novel business arrangement: DirectTV shares the production costs and in return gets first crack at showing the episodes before NBC. In a time of stagnating, even declining audiences, it's the kind of partnership that could win favor among television executives looking to finance serious drama. 
 ''Friday Night Lights,'' back for its fourth season on NBC beginning May 7, is based on Buzz Bissinger's 1990 nonfiction book of the same name about Odessa, Tex., and a 2004 movie directed by Peter Berg. And like the book and the movie, the TV series is only nominally about football. Friday night games are a narrative device, but the guts of the show juxtapose the soaring joys and hurts of family with the brutal, intimate charms of small-town life. While the network schedules are full of cops, doctors and lawyers, the people on ''Friday Night Lights'' teach, deliver pizza, sell cars, or if they aren't so lucky, collect welfare.
 That mix of triumph and struggle is apparent when you walk behind the magnificent bleachers of the Dillon Panthers and find another field, one that is just so much dirt interrupted by the occasional tuft of grass. The scoreboard for the East Dillon Lions is silent and hopelessly tattered, a totem of neglect that connotes defeat no matter what numbers go up on it. 
 On Season 4 of ''Friday Night Lights,'' this will be home field for Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler), who along with his wife, Tami (Connie Britton), a guidance counselor turned principal, is in a for a rugged year. Mr. Chandler and Ms. Britton have served as an anchor for a series in which the younger characters fight their way through academic and romantic travails but, as happens in life, eventually graduate. Season 3 ended with Taylor's ouster as coach of the Panthers and an offer for him to take over the Lions when the school district reopens East Dillon High, a school on the other side of the tracks, where making the team seems the least of a young man's worries. 
 Though the nation has supposedly gone beyond race with the election of a black president, the series's new season, as conceived by the show runner, Jason Katims, acknowledges that it continues to drive much of American civic life. Economic recovery may be in the air, but doesn't often knock on the doors of East Dillon. And the war in Iraq, rarely seen on television news, is very much a fact of life here, as Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), the Panthers' former quarterback, struggles to look after his grandmother while his father serves yet another tour.
 By putting the other side of town in the mix, Mr. Berg, who created the series after making the movie, said: ''I think we all understood by making this move we could move deeper into issues that manifest themselves in high schools all over the country. By really looking into things like race and financial status, it brought us closer to the center of some important arguments.''
 If all that sounds like homework, longtime fans of the show can rest assured that Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch), a Dreamsicle to most female demographics, is very much a (shirtless) presence; that Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) stops back to see him from college; and that the evil combo of the hotdog quarterback J. D. McCoy (Jeremy Sumpter) and his father (D. W. Moffett) remain hell-bent on using the Panthers to their own venal ends. 
 In November, at a school in southeast Austin that serves as a stand-in for Dillon High, Tami Taylor has the young McCoy step into the principal's office for a bit of a talking-to about his disrespect for anything save football. As she tells him she expects better of him, three cameras work the scene from every angle, a trademark of the show and of Mr. Berg.
 ''Each of the camera operators is a very important part of the crew and what we try to do,'' said Nan Bernstein, a producer on the series. ''The directors shape the scene, but the operators learn it, they know it, and they serve as a camera obscura, so that the viewer never feels back from the action, they are always in the middle of it.''
 The crew resets after a banging sound comes from another part of the school, where classes from Alternative Learning Center are under way. That most of the show is shot in Austin by a longstanding crew on actual locations, rather than sets, gives it a verisimilitude most network television does not approach.
 ''We can see America from here,'' said Michael Waxman, the in-house director and producer, standing outside and looking down the hill from the school. ''We don't have to work much on making it seem real.''
 Ms. Britton, having finished her scene after a small stumble -- ''Sorry guys, I've got to get my mojo back'' -- stepped outside to a picnic table and answered a few questions about why the show has found a small but frantic audience. 
 ''We are dealing in really primal stuff here,'' she said, ''winning and losing, being a mother, what it's like to be a husband trying to protect his family: these are very fundamental human experiences anyone can relate to. We look for small moments that mean a lot, that are resonant, and when that works, I think people really connect with it.''
 ''Friday Night Lights'' stands out in other ways too. In a television world in which network shows are full of speeches, ''Friday Night Lights'' embraces the silences.
 ''A lot of times on this show, it's about what we don't say, or what we are trying to say with our faces, not words, which is sort of how it works in life,'' said Jesse Plemons, who plays Landry, the quarterback who moves with Coach Taylor to East Dillon. ''I grew up in a small town near Waco, and this show is about the people I grew up with. It does it gracefully, not by beating you over the head with it.''
 While many have bemoaned that ''Friday Night Lights'' has had to struggle with bad time slots and a tenuous hold on survival, Mr. Bissinger, whose book provides the series with its DNA, sees it differently: ''I give NBC credit for staying with it. This is not a souped-up show, a show that doesn't spoof small-town life, that gets at the nuances, and it's shooting its fifth season. If you look at most of the rest of television, it's kind of amazing when you think about it.''
 Brian Grazer, an executive producer of the series and a partner in Imagine Entertainment, said the hybrid schedule for ''Friday Night Lights'' was a decent solution to the challenges of the television business: reining in rising production costs even as ratings and advertising dollars show little, if any growth.
 ''It is a model that has worked for us and probably one that might make sense for other shows,'' he said. ''It's a weird sort of algorithm. The ratings are not that high, but they are steady and it just made economic sense for NBC and DirecTV to go this route.''
 Last season 4.6 million people viewed ''Friday Night Lights'' either on NBC or on their DVRs within a week of the show's broadcast. Another critically lauded show with a small but dedicated audience, ''Damages'' on FX, was reported by Entertainment Weekly's Web site, ew.com, to be considering a similar deal: DirecTV would split costs with Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show. 
 Eric Shanks, vice president of entertainment at DirectTV, said he couldn't comment specifically, but added: ''We've had multiple conversations with people after our experience with 'Friday Night Lights.' This type of creative production scenario won't be prevalent, but could happen again. It's not necessarily a one-off.'' 
 As ''Friday Night Lights'' has progressed, characters have evolved. Landry was originally just a sidekick to the team's quarterback, but he has gone from geek to love interest for the show's hottie Tyra to accused murderer (long story, that, but it involves Tyra) to new kid in school. As happens on a show about high school, soon enough he will be gone. 
 ''It's a weird thing on so many levels and yet not that different than what happens to the characters on the show,'' Mr. Plemons said recently on the phone. ''You are here with everyone, and it becomes family, you make friends and grow to love it. We all sort of grew up on this show and then eventually, it's time to move on.''
 The leave-takings are tough to watch, because for some, small towns are great places to be from, but best taken in from the rear-view mirror. In fact, for a show with a football motif, there is a whole lot of emotion going on. Growing up, which the show is really about, is never easy on the people doing the growing and often lands hard on the people around them.
 And for all of the show's hotheaded teen romances, it is the chronic love affair called marriage that gets the most air time. The relationship between the Taylors reminds many of the best parts of marriage, in which the injury to the one is felt by both, and victories, sweet and fleeting, are held in common.
 This season Coach Taylor is trying to make football magic out at a school with no tradition and no resources, while his wife is principal at a moneyed school, where she ends up in the gun sights of prerogative and boosterism. For a few episodes it seems as if it might break apart Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, the real team at the center of ''Friday Night Lights.'' People who know the show know that won't happen, that it will end in a hug of some kind. It just won't be the kind of neat little hug audiences were expecting. 
 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 2, 2010 Sunday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the television series ''Friday Night Lights'' misstated the production titles of Michael Waxman and Nan Bernstein. Mr. Waxman is the in-house director and producer, not the first assistant director, and Ms. Bernstein is a supervising producer and unit production manager, not the series's production manager. Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the position that a character plays on the football team on which the show focuses. Landry (Jesse Plemons) is a kicker, not a quarterback.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DE CORDOVA, ARTHUR E.

 BODY:
de CORDOVA--Arthur E.,who was a New York Stock Exchange floor specialist for 30 years, and responsible for trading the IBM book, died in Sarasota, FL on April 16. He was 75. The cause was heart failure, said his son, Arthur E. de Cordova III. Mr. de Cordova was the fourth generation to work as a floor specialist in a family firm that originated as Alfred de Cordova & Co., in 1882. He was later joined by his younger brother, Eustace de Cordova Jr., until de Cordova, Cooper & Co. was purchased by Paine Webber in 1989. In 1914, IBM was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and assigned to Cyril de Cordova & Brother, who acted as market maker and managed all floor trading activity in the new stock. IBM became a bellwether stock as the company grew in the post WWII economic expansion, and their trading volume on the exchange soared. Mr. de Cordova assumed responsibilities for managing the IBM book from his father Eustace de Cordova in 1968, and remained the IBM floor specialist until 1989. "Arthur E. de Cordova and his firm were part of the proud history of IBM on the New York Stock Exchange dating back to its listing nearly a hundred years ago," said Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman. 
"Mr. de Cordova was IBM floor specialist at the NYSE during a period of tremendous growth and achievement for IBM and American business. The IBM company would like to extend our thanks for his years of service and our best wishes to his family and friends." Arthur Erroll de Cordova was born on July 23, 1934, in New York City. The family were longtime residents of Weston, CT, where they retained a family home until 1972. He attended the Unquowa School, and was graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1952. He was President of his fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, and after earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Hobart College in 1956, joined the United States Air Force, completing his service at Ladd Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska. He retired from the Air Force in 1960 with the rank of Captain. He soon joined de Cordova & Co., becoming a member of the New York Stock Exchange in March, 1961. He remained a member for 45 years until the NYSE's public listing in 2006. During his more than 30 years as an active member trading on the exchange, he also served as a NYSE Floor Governor and Director of the NYSE Luncheon Club. He is survived by his wife of more than 33 years, Jerri C. de Cordova, of Casey Key, FL. and Westport, CT, and a son, Arthur E. de Cordova III, of San Francisco, from a previous marriage to Carole Magner. In 2005, Hobart and William Smith Colleges awarded him a Doctor of Humane Letters in recognition of his long and enduring contributions to the school. "Arthur de Cordova was a valued alumnus who distinguished himself in the world of business and was a thoughtful and attentive graduate who nurtured and cared for his alma mater," commented Mark D.

HEADLINE: Obama's First Year

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In reviewing David Remnick's biography ''The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama'' (April 11), Garry Wills writes that Obama ''wasted'' his first year. But consider the mix of problems Obama inherited and the remedies initiated under his watch: a soaring unemployment rate, at last beginning to be tamed; financial markets formerly in the tank, now functioning again; the greatest economic downturn since the '30s, turned around so that now the economy is edging back to positive growth; two seemingly endless wars on foreign soil, now set on a new course, one showing signs of resolution. G.M. and Chrysler were in the tank; if they are around 10 years from now, look to Obama's decisive actions. There is today a strong possibility of Russia's and China's being on board for sanctions against Iran, something that seemed unlikely 18 months ago. Health care reform has been initiated. This is the short list. Is Wills's blindness willful?

 To the Editor:
 Garry Wills writes that as a politician, President Obama is ''a bit of a chameleon.'' The description -- a dismissive, sleight-of-hand smackdown, despite an effort by Wills to temporize with favorable qualifiers -- is not without precedent in American political history.
 President Herbert Hoover indignantly sought to tack the ''chameleon'' label on Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York, his Democratic opponent in the election of 1932. The label didn't stick, and the voters overwhelmingly rejected Hoover. While Roosevelt was elected three more times, Hoover seemed to spend considerable portions of his long post-presidential life nursing the hurts associated with his ouster after a single term.
 Also consider a few nonchameleon presidential nominees -- William Jennings Bryan (1896, 1900 and 1908), Barry Goldwater (1964) and George McGovern (1972) -- all decisively defeated by the American electorate. The closest we have come to a nonchameleon president in the contemporary era is Ronald Reagan. But recall, as was widely recognized at the time of his election in 1980, that Reagan's unabashed model of a successful political persona was none other than Franklin D. Roosevelt, who in reality was no chameleon.
 So much for evocative labels and categories, however pithy they appear on the printed page.

HEADLINE: An Unexpected Governor Takes an Unwavering Course

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- One night last week, Grant Woods, the former state attorney general, spent more than an hour on the telephone with Gov. Jan Brewer, a fellow Republican who was considering whether to sign into law the nation's toughest immigration enforcement bill.
 The governor listened patiently, Mr. Woods recalled, as he laid out his arguments against the bill: that it would give too much power to the local police to stop people merely suspected of being illegal immigrants and would lead to racial profiling; that some local police officers have been abusive toward immigrants; and that the law could lead to costly legal battles for the state.
 When he hung up, Mr. Woods knew he had lost the case. ''She really felt that the majority of Arizonans fall on the side of, Let's solve the problem and not worry about the Constitution,'' he said.
 Locking on a position, sometimes confounding members of her party, and letting the chips fall where they may have defined Ms. Brewer's style since she unexpectedly vaulted from secretary of state to governor 15 months ago when Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, left to join the Obama administration as homeland security secretary. 
 To the public, Ms. Brewer, 65, is a smiling, deeply tanned, affable ''cheerleader type,'' as one friend described her. She may fumble and grimace her way through news conferences, but she genuinely likes shaking constituents' hands and startling state employees on field visits by chatting them up.
 To aides and insiders, she is a meticulous political scorekeeper who may not grasp the finer points of policy -- opponents wonder if she is in the sway of consultants -- but sweats details like whether campaign volunteers have the right shirts on and relishes proving doubters wrong.
 Until now, she had rarely made waves -- supporters struggled to name one headline-grabbing thing she was known for before becoming governor -- despite spending more than 25 years in public service. And opponents wonder whether her coterie of aides has undue influence, noting she had never made immigration control a passion until it was clear that she was running for election.
 She did not even mention the border or immigration in her January 2009 inaugural speech, which focused squarely on the biggest problem on her hands, the imploding economy and a state budget in tatters.
 But Ms. Brewer in her short tenure may already be remembered for shaking up the political order, even before her decision on the immigration bill.
 First, to help close a $2.6 billion budget deficit and avoid harsh cuts, she shocked and angered the conservative flank that had buoyed her by pushing for a 1-cent increase in the state sales tax.
 Chuck Coughlin, a political consultant who worked on her transition team, recalled how Ms. Brewer, as she contemplated the tax increase last year, spent 20 minutes in a meeting explaining how she could not stomach expected deep cuts in education.
 ''She knew the tax was the only option on the table,'' Mr. Coughlin said. ''I told her she will have no friends, that not even the Democrats will help you because they want you to roast in the fire. But she did it.''
 The proposal, Proposition 100, goes before voters on May 18.
 Then, what is accepted as the country's most stringent immigration enforcement law, allowing the local police to stop and check the immigration papers of noncitizens and making it a state crime not to have them, was making its way through the Legislature.
 Legislators said Ms. Brewer, who is seeking a full term, was long prepared to sign such a bill, and her closest opponents in the primary all backed it. But her staff members hashed over the details with Senator Russell Pearce, a Republican who has made driving illegal immigrants out of the state his passion.
 Though not closely allied with Mr. Pearce, she took up his mantra that the law would help the police weed out criminals.
 ''Border-related violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state,'' she said on Friday after signing the immigration bill. ''We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of drug cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life.''
 Ms. Brewer said she had pushed for language that explicitly bars the police from racial profiling, though that failed to mollify civil rights groups who complained that Latino citizens would inevitably be harassed or mistaken for illegal immigrants.
 As Arizona secretary of state, Ms. Brewer supported Proposition 200, an initiative passed in 2004 requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.
 But as a more a business-oriented, ''country club'' Republican, she never made the issue a central theme.
 Paul Senseman, who has known Ms. Brewer for 16 years and is her spokesman (he declined to make her available for an interview), said her early years had been formative in forging a fiscally conservative, business-minded approach.
 Janice Kay Drinkwine was born Sept. 26, 1944, in Hollywood, Calif., and raised in Southern California for most of her young life by a single mother. Her father died at a young age, and her mother ran a dress shop where she and her siblings worked long hours.
 ''She got a very direct and deep appreciate for small business,'' Mr. Senseman said.
 Ms. Brewer is fond of invoking her parents' struggles in casting herself as unafraid of challenges. 
 She married John Brewer, a chiropractor, and settled in the Phoenix area in the early 1970s, faithfully attending her Lutheran church -- before announcing big decisions she often mentions that she prayed over them -- and attending meetings related to her three children's schools. That is where the spark of political activism was fired.
 ''She would come home and ask, who the hell are these people?'' Mr. Coughlin said.
 The Brewers had three sons, one of whom died in 2007.
 Ms. Brewer has spent the last 27 years in elected politics -- as a member of both houses of the Arizona Legislature over a 14-year span, as a Maricopa County supervisor, as secretary of state for seven years and as governor -- but she has rarely sought the limelight.
 State Senator Ken Cheuvront, a veteran Democratic legislator who has known her for 16 years, said he had initially dismissed her as an ardent, conservative partisan.
 But as governor, Mr. Cheuvront said, ''I am surprised she has become much more pragmatic.''
 He saw that in her decision on the tax increase and to an extent her decision to support the immigration bill, despite the negative attention from national civil rights, religious and immigrant advocacy leaders.
 ''She is in Arizona running for governor as Republican at a time when Republicans are being controlled by different, conservative factions,'' he said.
 Mary Rose Wilcox, a Democrat who served with her on the Board of Supervisors, said she had warmed to Ms. Brewer when they worked together to improve services to the homeless and the mentally ill.
 But, Ms. Wilcox said, political considerations were never far from her mind, and Ms. Brewer kept close score on who was supporting which piece of legislation. She has approved much of the socially conservative legislation, including abortion restrictions, promoted by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative research group.
 ''Jan has always been a tough cookie and very partisan,'' she said. ''I think what led her to this decision on the immigration bill was political, cold calculation. She felt the Hispanic community would not matter.''
 But Ms. Brewer's supporters said the decision was bound to be trouble for her no matter how she decided, either costing support in her primary if she vetoed it or generating the wrath of Latinos and moderates if she signed it.
 ''I know,'' said Mr. Woods, 56, the former state attorney general who is also co-chairman of Ms. Brewer's election campaign, ''that she struggled greatly with the decision.''

HEADLINE: Life After Bush

BYLINE: By MARK HALPERIN. 
Mark Halperin, editor at large and senior political analyst for Time magazine, is a co-author, with John Heilemann, of ''Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime.''

COURAGE AND CONSEQUENCE
 My Life as a Conservative in the Fight
 By Karl Rove
 Illustrated. 596 pp. Threshold Editions. $30
 NO APOLOGY
 The Case for American Greatness
 By Mitt Romney
 323 pp. St. Martin's Press. $25.99
 Karl Rove, George W. Bush's longtime chief adviser, was one of the most important players in American politics during the last decade. Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and current presidential prospect, aspires to be the most important figure in American politics during the next decade. Over the years, I have covered and interviewed both men and admittedly have found them rather difficult to decode, personally and sometimes professionally. Now, both have written best-selling books presenting their inspirations and influences -- books that, while not fully revelatory, offer far deeper insights than have ever been available before. 
 Rove's ''Courage and Consequence'' is perhaps the more expansive book, as he attempts to take on four separate story lines: an account of his early history and pre-White House career; a defense of George W. Bush's record and legacy; a refutation of what he calls the ''myth'' that portrays him as a mash-up of Lee Atwater, Machiavelli and Satan; and an acid retaliation against a covey of prominent Democrats. They include Barack Obama (he charges the president with showing ''audacious hypocrisy'' on immigration and claims that ''in private, he plays fast and loose with the facts and his accusations''), Al Gore (whom he calls ''one of America's most embittered politicians''), John Kerry (who he says projects ''barely hidden disdain for the hoi polloi'') and Ted Kennedy (whose questioning of Samuel Alito during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings, he writes, was ''ugly, unfair and despicable but seemed almost second nature to Kennedy''), as well as Joe Biden, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. A notable selection of Republicans -- Colin Powell among them -- and members of the media get hit, too. Rove unrepentantly employs tart language and occasionally selective facts when assailing his targets, even as elsewhere he criticizes those very weapons when used by his adversaries. 
 While he relates fresh and often engaging anecdotes about his years with Bush, it is the story of Rove's upbringing and rise in Texas politics that in many ways constitutes the most revealing portion of the book. Growing up in an itinerant middle-class family, he enjoyed reading, debating and sharing in his father's geological fieldwork, but his life was punctuated by sorrows -- chiefly, his parents' divorce and his mother's suicide. Early on, even before he dropped out of college, Rove developed a passion for politics that, coupled with a little luck, brought him into the orbit of the Bush dynasty when he was still in his 20s and ultimately led him to the White House.
 Students of practical politics should grab a highlighter and some Post-it notes when reading Chapter 4, entitled ''What Is a Rovian Campaign?'' Even if one disagrees with Rove's politics (especially if one disagrees with Rove's politics), there are some valuable nuggets about how to run winning campaigns. The most vital rule, Rove says, is often violated: ''A campaign must first be centered on big ideas that reflect the candidate's philosophy and views and that are perceived by voters as important and relevant.'' Had Hillary Clinton followed that particular Rovian directive, she might well be president today. 
 Throughout his long career, Rove has not been one to show much weakness. He does admit to a few errors, though, including the failure to defend Bush more aggressively over the rationale for the Iraq war when no weapons of mass destruction were found. Rove also shows some vulnerability when discussing his own tribulations; even his staunchest critics might feel a twinge at the scorching account of his family's ordeal during the C.I.A. leak investigation, as he tried to fend off prosecutors while his wife tried to ward off the press. Yet Rove is sure to ignite the frustrations -- or fury -- of many of his detractors with his fond and respectful portrait of Bush as a detail-oriented man of principle and accomplishment. Those still smarting over the repercussions of the Bush administration will be particularly annoyed by Rove's conclusion that Bush's ''achievements over eight years were impressive, durable and significant.'' 
 Still, ''Courage and Consequence'' is an entertaining and enlightening memoir, written by a man who is well aware he will continue to be a polarizing figure no matter where he goes from here. 
 In a party that has often picked its presidential nominees by primogeniture, Mitt Romney is now the front-runner for 2012 and presumably will hold on to that status for the foreseeable future. ''No Apology,'' however, is not a classic candidate-in-waiting book, since it lacks the standard treacly dose of intimate anecdotes meant to reveal the politician's softer side. Instead, even the few personal stories featured in its pages are intended to illustrate Romney's ideology and policy preferences.
 Romney, who ran for the Republican nomination in 2008, writes in the introduction that ''this book gives me a chance to say more than I did during my campaign'' about the issues that are important to him. As a candidate, he explains, he felt limited by the rigid formats of debates and advertisements. Romney's bigger campaign problems may well have been his failure to settle on a consistent message and his constant struggle to escape both the caricature of him as a flip-flopper and the suspicions surrounding his Mormonism. Romney deals not a whit with either his well-earned reputation for moving right on critical issues or the unique political challenges his Mormon faith represents. If he runs again, he will have to address both matters. It is striking that he chose not to do so here. 
 Despite his emphasis on policy, Romney offers no major new proposals, and often merely lists the pros and cons of the leading options for tackling some of the thorniest issues facing the country. But the book will be helpful to those unfamiliar with Romney's worldview and starched style, his impressive business background and strong family bonds. ''No Apology'' resonates with Romney's voice and manner, including his corny sense of humor, blunt patriotism and strait-laced formality. ''I am optimistic about America's future,'' he writes, ''because I've seen the heart of the American people.'' That he neglects to put forward significant new ideas is due in part to his old-fashioned instincts. He longs to restore many aspects of American life he remembers from childhood and believes that the solutions are already out there, just waiting for a competent conservative president to implement them. 
 The Romney who emerges from ''No Apology'' is the version some of his advisers hoped to promote in 2008: a steady, smart technocrat with a record of accomplishment in the private sector and a history of working across party lines. Taking a cue from George W. Bush's successful 2000 strategy, Romney now plays down the divisive social matters that tripped him up before, saying that the best course on issues like abortion and gay marriage might be just ''to agreeto disagree.'' 
 The book's title is drawn in large part from the conservative complaint that the current occupant of the Oval Office, in both words and attitude, is too quick to place blame on America. Throughout the book, Romney uses rhetoric clearly intended to woo the Fox News-Rush Limbaugh wing of the party, a group at present drawn to the magnetic Sarah Palin. ''It is an extraordinary moment we are in,'' Romney writes, ''when an American president is eager to note all of America's failings, real and perceived, and reluctant to speak out in defense of American values and America's contributions to the freedoms enjoyed around the globe.'' 
 Romney's primary worry is that America will become ''the France of the 21st century -- still a great country, but no longer the world's leading nation.'' He scores President Obama for what he casts as a failure to be sufficiently tough with China, Russia, terrorists and terrorist states, and for what he views as a host of misguided economic policies. Some of the book reads like an accessible lecture for bright college students, although Romney has a habit of repeating certain buzzwords to irksome effect. He may make no apology, but Romney's readers might require one for this typical turn of phrase: ''America is freedom, and freedom must be strong.'' 
 But the principal theme in the book is Romney's censure of Barack Obama, leveled in a less caustic fashion than Rove's, but still an overarching assault. He avoids personal attacks on the president but says that one of Obama's ''presuppositions is that America is in a state of inevitable decline'' and that his policies are ''the most harmful to the future generations of America.'' Even if Romney is not the Republican standard-bearer in 2012, he has formulated a sharp argument against the incumbent and, more than any other would-be challenger thus far, has laid down a clear road map for his party when things get rolling next year.

HEADLINE: The Insiders' Insider

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH. 
Mark Leibovich is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. He last wrote for the magazine about the Republican Senate race in Florida.

 BODY:
Before he goes to sleep, between 11 and midnight, Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, typically checks in by e-mail with the same reporter: Mike Allen of Politico, who is also the first reporter Pfeiffer corresponds with after he wakes up at 4:20. A hyperactive former Eagle Scout, Allen will have been up for hours, if he ever went to bed. Whether or not he did is one of the many little mysteries that surround him. The abiding certainty about Allen is that sometime between 5:30 and 8:30 a.m., seven days a week, he hits ''send'' on a mass e-mail newsletter that some of America's most influential people will read before they say a word to their spouses.
 Allen's e-mail tipsheet, Playbook, has become the principal early-morning document for an elite set of political and news-media thrivers and strivers. Playbook is an insider's hodgepodge of predawn news, talking-point previews, scooplets, birthday greetings to people you've never heard of, random sightings (''spotted'') around town and inside jokes. It is, in essence, Allen's morning distillation of the Nation's Business in the form of a summer-camp newsletter. 
 Like many in Washington, Pfeiffer describes Allen with some variation on ''the most powerful'' or ''important'' journalist in the capital. The two men exchange e-mail messages about six or eight times a day. Allen also communes a lot with Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff; Robert Gibbs, the press secretary; David Axelrod, President Obama's senior adviser; and about two dozen other White House officials. But Pfeiffer is likely Allen's main point of contact, the one who most often helps him arrive at a ''West Wing Mindmeld,'' as Playbook calls it, which is essentially a pro-Obama take on that day's news. (Allen gets a similar fill from Republicans, which he also disseminates in Playbook.)
 Pfeiffer tells Allen the message that the Obama administration is trying to ''drive'' that morning -- ''drive'' being the action verb of choice around the male-dominated culture of Politico, a three-year-old publication, of which the oft-stated goal is to become as central to political addicts as ESPN is to sports junkies. ''Drive'' is a stand-in for the stodgier verb ''influence.'' If, say, David S. Broder and R. W. Apple Jr. were said to ''influence the political discourse'' through The Washington Post and The New York Times in the last decades of the 20th century, Politico wants to ''drive the conversation'' in the new-media landscape of the 21st. It wants to ''win'' every news cycle by being first with a morsel of information, whether or not the morsel proves relevant, or even correct, in the long run -- and whether the long run proves to be measured in days, hours or minutes.
 In Politico parlance, ''influence'' is less a verb than the root of a noun. Politico's top editors describe ''influentials'' (or ''compulsives'') as their target audience: elected officials, political operatives, journalists and other political-media functionaries. Since early 2007, Allen's ''data points,'' as he calls the items in Playbook, have become the cheat sheet of record for a time-starved city in which the power-and-information hierarchy has been upended. It is also a daily totem for those who deride Washington as a clubby little town where Usual Suspects talk to the same Usual Suspects in a feedback loop of gamesmanship, trivia, conventional wisdom and personality cults.
 Allen refers to his readership as ''the Playbook community.'' He appeared wounded one morning in March when I suggested to him that his esoteric chronicle may reinforce a conceit that Washington is a closed conclave. No, no, he protested. Playbook is open, intimate. No one even edits it before it goes out, he said, which adds to his ''human connection'' to ''the community.'' Political insiderdom -- or the illusion thereof -- has moved from Georgetown salons or cordoned-off security zones to a mass e-mail list administrated by a never-married 45-year-old grind known as Mikey.
 ''He is part mascot and part sleepless narrator of our town,'' Tracy Sefl, a Democratic media consultant and a close aide to Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, told me by e-mail. ''He is an omnipresent participant-observer, abundantly kind, generous and just unpredictable enough to make him an object of curiosity to even the most self-interested. Everything about him is literary.''
 Allen darts through the political world much the way he writes Playbook: in abbreviated steps, more like chops. You can spot him from far away, his shiny head darting up and often straight down into his BlackBerry. He says he gets 2,000 e-mail messages a day, tries to answer all that are addressed to him personally, some while walking. He is always bumping into things.
 In 1993, Allen was covering a trial in Richmond, Va., for The New York Times (as a stringer) and The Richmond Times-Dispatch (which employed him). He found a pay phone, darted into the street and got whacked by a car. Allen composed himself, filed stories for both papers and then found his way to the hospital with a broken elbow. This is one of the many ''Mikey Stories'' that Washingtonians share with awe and some concern. A corollary are ''Mikey Sightings,'' a bipartisan e-mail chain among prominent people who track Allen's stutter-stepping whereabouts -- his showing up out of nowhere, around corners, at odd hours, sometimes a few time zones away.
 He bursts in and out of parties, at once manic and serene, chronically toting gifts, cards and flower arrangements that seem to consume much of an annual income that is believed to exceed $250,000. Allen -- who is childless and owns no cars or real estate -- perpetually picks up meal and beverage tabs for his friend-sources (the dominant hybrid around Mikey). He kisses women's hands and thanks you so much for coming, even though the party is never at his home, which not even his closest friends have seen. It is as if Mikey is the host of one big party, and by showing up anywhere in Washington, you have served the Playbook community and are deserving of the impresario's thanks (or ''Hat Tip'' in Playbookese).
 Allen also has a tendency to suddenly vanish. But then he will pop up on a TV screen a few minutes later. Or you then learn via e-mail that he is racing through O'Hare or via Playbook that he took an excursion to the circus (with ''Owen and Grace Gallo, ages 3 and 4, who especially liked: doggies on a slide'') or Maine (''where an eagle might grab one of your fish while you're focused on the grill'').
 Or that it's Mark Paustenbach's birthday, whoever he is.
 Allen was the first reporter hired by Politico's founding editors, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, when they left The Washington Post to start the Web site and newspaper in 2006. He is considered a Politico ''founding father,'' in the words of Harris, who, like VandeHei, tends to place great weight and mission onto the organization. Another construct (originating outside Politico) is that Harris and VandeHei are God and Jesus -- it's unclear who is who -- and that Allen is the Holy Ghost. When I mentioned this to Allen recently, he was adamant that it is meant to be facetious and that no one at Politico really believes that. Allen, an observant Christian, said the line could be misconstrued. But ''Holy Ghost'' does seem a particularly apt description of Allen's ubiquity and inscrutability. ''I get that what I do is a little elusive, ambiguous,'' Allen told me. ''I try to be a force for good. And I try to be everywhere.''
 I met Allen on a hot April night at the basement bar of the Hay-Adams hotel, across from the White House. I headed downstairs, and there he was, startling me in a back stairwell, reading his BlackBerry an inch from his wire-rim glasses. As we entered the bar, Allen greeted two Democratic operatives at a corner table and noted that his friend-source Kevin Madden, a Republican consultant, was at that moment on CNN.
 Allen's public bearing combines the rumpledness of an old-school print reporter with the sheen of a new-school ''cross-platform brand'' who has become accustomed to performing on camera. Every time Allen starts to speak -- in person or on air -- his eyes bulge for a split second, as if he has just seen a light go on. His mannerisms resemble an almost childlike mimicry of a politician -- the incessant thanking, deference, greetings, teeth-clenched smiles and ability to project belief in the purity of his own voice and motivations. He speaks in quick and certain cadences, on message, in sound bites, karate-chopping the table for emphasis. (His work is ''joyful, exciting,'' he says. It is a ''privilege'' to work at Politico with young reporters. ''I love this company. I love what I'm doing.'' And all that.) Over several discussions, Allen repeated full paragraphs almost to the word.
 ''The people in this community, they all want to read the same 10 stories,'' he said, table-chopping in the Hay-Adams. ''And to find all of those, you have to read 1,000 stories. And we do that for you.''
 As a practical matter, here is how Allen's 10 stories influence the influentials. Cable bookers, reporters and editors read Playbook obsessively, and it's easy to pinpoint exactly how an item can spark copycat coverage that can drive a story. Items become segment pieces on ''Morning Joe,'' the MSNBC program, where there are 10 Politico Playbook segments each week, more than half of them featuring Allen. This incites other cable hits, many featuring Politico reporters, who collectively appear on television about 125 times a week. There are subsequent links to Politico stories on The Drudge Report, The Huffington Post and other Web aggregators that newspaper assigning editors and network news producers check regularly. ''Washington narratives and impressions are no longer shaped by the grand pronouncements of big news organizations,'' said Allen, a former reporter for three of them -- The Washington Post, The New York Times and Time magazine. ''The smartest people in politics give us the kindling, and we light the fire.''
 By ''we,'' Allen is referring to either Playbook or Politico. But many influentials draw a distinction. They will work to get a little twig into Mikey's kindling and read him faithfully. Politico, however, is more fraught.
 Nowhere is Washington's ambivalence over Politico more evident than in the White House. The Obama and Politico enterprises have had parallel ascendancies to an extent: they fashioned themselves as tech-savvy upstarts bent on changing the established order -- of politics (Obama) and of how it is covered (Politico). They started around the same time, early 2007, and their clashing agendas were apparent early. On the day that Politico published its first print edition, Barack Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, walked into the campaign's offices and slammed a copy of the new publication on Dan Pfeiffer's keyboard. ''This,'' Plouffe declared, ''is going to be a problem.''
 Politico today remains a White House shorthand for everything the administration claims to dislike about Washington -- Beltway myopia, politics as daily sport. Yet most of the president's top aides are as steeped in this culture as anyone else -- and work hard to manipulate it. ''What's notable about this administration is how ostentatiously its people proclaim to be uninterested in things they are plainly interested in,'' Harris, Politico's editor in chief, told me in an e-mail message.
 That Politico has been so vilified inside the White House is itself a sign of its entry into ''the bloodstream'' (another Politico phrase). It is, White House officials say, an indictment of the ''Washington mentality'' that the city is sustaining Politico and letting it ''drive the conversation'' to the extent it does. In early March, Axelrod was sitting in his West Wing office, complaining to me about the ''palace-intrigue pathology'' of Washington and why he missed Chicago. ''I prefer living in a place where people don't discuss the Politico over dinner,'' he said.
 But morning is another matter, a solitary, on-the-go cram session in which Playbook has become the politicalmedia equivalent of those food pills that futurists envision will replace meals. ''Playbook is an entity unto itself, far more influential than anything in the rest of the Politico,'' Pfeiffer says.
 If, for example, Axelrod can't read the papers before rushing off to the White House, he will scroll through Playbook during his six-block ride to work and probably be safe in his 7:30 meeting. At this pivotal hour, Allen is the oddball king of a changing political and media order -- the frenetic epitome of a moment in which Washington can feel both exhilarating and very, very small.
 I should disclose a few things: I have known Mike Allen for more than a decade. We worked together at The Washington Post, where I spent nine years and where I came to know VandeHei and Harris. We all have the same friends and run into each other a lot, and I have told them how much I admire what they have achieved at Politico. I like them all.
 In other words, I write this from within the tangled web of ''the community.'' I read Playbook every morning on my BlackBerry, usually while my copies of The New York Times and The Washington Post are in plastic bags. When Allen links to my stories, I see a happy uptick in readership. I have also been a source: after I ''spotted'' Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner at an organic Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood last year -- picking up kung pao chicken with brown rice (''for Tim'') -- I dutifully e-mailed Allen with the breaking news.
 Playbook is a descendant of political synopses like National Journal's Hotline, ABC News's Note, and NBC News's First Read, all of which still enjoy junkie followings. But nothing of the ilk has embedded itself in the culture of Washington like Playbook -- to a point where if somebody in Pfeiffer's department is celebrating a birthday, he is sure to send word to Allen so that everybody in the White House will know.
 Allen sends out Playbook using Microsoft Outlook to a private mailing list of 3,000. A few minutes later, an automatic blast goes out to another 25,000 readers who signed up to receive it. An additional 3,000 or so enter Playbook from Politico.com, which adds up to a rough universe of 30,000 interested drivers, passengers and eavesdroppers to the conversation.
 Playbook started three years ago as a chatty ''what's happening'' memo that Allen sent to his Politico bosses. Eventually he started sending it to presidential-campaign officials -- the first outside recipient was Howard Wolfson of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Soon Allen would send it to non-Politico journalists, White House officials and, before long, anyone who asked. While most Playbook subscribers live around Washington, significant numbers work on Wall Street, in state capitals and at news and entertainment companies on both coasts. Major retailers (Starbucks) and obscure lobbies (Catfish Farmers of America) pay $15,000 a week to advertise in Playbook, a figure that is expected to rise.
 Readers describe their allegiance with a conspicuous degree of oversharing. ''I definitely read it in bed,'' Katie Couric told me. ''Doesn't everybody read it in bed?'' Margaret Carlson, a columnist for Bloomberg News and the Washington editor at large for The Week magazine, said in a video tribute to Allen for his 45th birthday party last June. (For the record, the Republican lobbyist and party hostess Juleanna Glover said in the video that she reads Playbook ''in my boudoir and while I'm blow-drying my hair.'')
 ''I'd like to thank the Lord for the many blessings he brings me,'' Allen said at the party. ''VandeHei thinks that's a reference to him.''
 ''You don't have to do anything else, just read Mike Allen,'' Bob Woodward declared in February on ''Morning Joe'' in one of those statements that jab squarely into the ribs of traditional newspaper purveyors. Allen harbors a deep fondness and knowledge of the newspaper industry he might be helping to kill. Peter Watkins, a former press aide for President George W. Bush, recalls that when he told Allen he was from Davis County, Utah, Allen's instant reply was, ''Oh, you must have read The Davis County Clipper.''
 Part of the appeal and the absurdity of Playbook is that it imposes a small-town, small-paper sensibility onto a big, complicated city -- Lake Wobegon with power. It is expressed in a dialect of ''Sirens,'' ''Shots'' and ''Chasers'' that might as well be Mongolian to 99.9 percent of the electorate. To skim Playbook is to experience Washington in the midst of an attention-deficited conversation that can bounce from the Congressional Budget Office's score of the health care bill to news of a ''state visit'' from Feldman's parents (Jud and Sunny) to an all-caps directive that we all ''ask Hari about his new puppy.'' And members of the Playbook community -- which includes a former president, two former vice presidents, C.E.O.'s and network anchors -- are assumed to know exactly who all these people are.
 Allen is a master aggregator, which leads some to dismiss Playbook as a cut-and-paste exercise. But that ignores Allen's ability to break news (even if by only 15 minutes), to cull from e-mail only he is receiving, to get early copies of books and magazines and to pick out the prime nugget from the bottom of a pool report. He has a knack for selecting the ''data points'' that an info-saturated clan cares most about and did not know when it went to bed. Playbook's politics are ''aggressively neutral,'' and Allen says his are, too -- he refuses to vote.
 Just as many sources talk to Woodward because they assume everyone is, the White House will leak early talking points to Allen because they know that, for instance, Dick Cheney seems to have made Allen the go-to outlet for many of his criticisms of the current administration. Like Woodward, Allen can be tagged with the somewhat loaded moniker of ''access journalist.'' Clearly the political and news establishments love him. The feeling is mutual and somewhat transactional. They use him and vice versa (''love'' and ''use'' being mutually nonexclusive in Washington). He seems to know everyone and works at it.
 Pfeiffer met Allen a decade ago. Over the years, Allen has sent Pfeiffer e-mail messages about things that he knew interested him (Georgetown basketball), just as Allen has served as a one-man Google-alert service for hundreds of friend-sources around town: news about the Redskins (to the Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell), about cuff links (to the Washington lawyer Robert Barnett, who collects them). I heard of a low-level economist who has met Allen only once or twice and yet receives from him forwarded wire stories about Asian currency.
 Before there was e-mail, Allen would do this by fax; before there were fax machines, he would drop off newspaper clips (or entire out-of-town papers) to his friends' doorsteps. ''He operates at such a faster speed than any of us and carries on many more relationships than any of us and so many more simultaneous conversations than any of us,'' Morrell says.
 ''The most successful journalists have their own unique brand and circle of friends,'' VandeHei, Politico's executive editor, told me by e-mail. ''This is the Facebook-ization of politics and D.C. The more friends or acquaintances you have, the more time you spend interacting with them via e-mail and I.M., the more information you get, move and market.'' VandeHei's conceit seems to equate Allen's circle of friends to a commodity -- exactly the kind of mutual back-scratching undercurrent that gives ''friendship'' in Washington its quotation marks. It also reflects Politico's penchant for placing itself at the vanguard of new media when in fact its business has been heavily sustained by ads in its print edition, distributed free in Washington. ''Playbook is D.C.'s Facebook,'' VandeHei concluded. ''And Mike's the most popular friend.''
 Allen spent his childhood in Seal Beach, Calif., in Orange County, the oldest of four -- two boys, two girls. He told me he had an apolitical upbringing but wanted to attend college near Washington. He enrolled at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., which he said seemed close to D.C. on a map. When he got there, Allen told me, he learned that the college was at least a five-hour Greyhound ride from the capital. He has told this story before, just the kind of recurring lore -- a fun tale, a bit dubious -- that surrounds Allen and that he surely cultivates. Until recently, the dominant spectacle of his cubicle at Politico's Arlington, Va., offices was a giant birthday card signed by many members of the Playbook community. It featured a color cartoon of Allen as the mythological Sphinx and loomed over the real version as he typed, and typed.
 People routinely wonder whether Allen actually lives somewhere besides the briefing rooms, newsrooms, campaign hotels or going-away dinners for Senator So-and-So's press secretary that seem to be his perpetual regimen. And they wonder, ''Does Mikey ever sleep?''
 The query tires him. He claims he tries to sleep six hours a night, which seems unrealistic for someone who says he tries to wake at 2 or 3 a.m. to start Playbook after evenings that can include multiple stops (and trails of midnight-stamped e-mail). He supervises four predawn Playbook offshoots -- Pulse (devoted to health care), Morning Money (financial news), Morning Score (midterm Congressional races) and Huddle (Congress) -- often writes multiple stories a week for Politico, speaks all over the country and makes relentless TV and radio appearances. I asked Allen if he slept during the day, and he said no.
 Allen has been spotted dozing in public -- campaign planes, parties -- clutching his BlackBerry with two hands against his chest like a teddy bear. He has also been seen asleep over his laptop, only to snap awake into a full and desperate type, as if momentary slumber were just a blip in the 24/7 political story Mikey is writing. ''I once called him with a client,'' Barnett told me in an e-mail message. ''He was sound asleep. I am convinced he did the interview fully asleep. Nevertheless, he got every quote right.''
 Allen delights in being the cheerfully frantic public man. He refers to himself interchangeably with Playbook. ''Playbook made our CBS hit this a.m. by slipping a Benjamin to a plow driver,'' Allen wrote to his readers on a snowy February morning. ''Thank you, Ray.''
 No shortage of friends will testify to Mikey's thoughtful gestures, some in the extreme. They involve showing up at a friend's son's baseball game (in South Carolina) or driving from Richmond to New York to visit a fraternity brother and heading back the same night (dropping off the morning New York tabloids to friends in Richmond). When Watkins lost his grandfather, Allen appeared at the funeral in Kaysville, Utah, and filed a ''pool report'' for Watkins's friends and family.
 He attends a nondenominational Protestant church and a Bible-study group. During the George W. Bush presidency, which Allen covered for The Post, he drew closer to some people in the administration through worship. ''He is one of the most thoughtful people I have ever met,'' Josh Deckard, a former White House press aide, says. ''Philippians 2:3 said, 'In humility, consider others better than yourselves,' and I think Mike exemplifies that better than anyone.''
 Yet even Allen's supposed confidants say that there is a part of Mikey they will never know or even ask about. He is obsessively private. He has given different dates to different friends for the date of his birthday. I asked three of Allen's close friends if they knew what his father did. One said ''teacher,'' another said ''football coach'' and the third said ''newspaper columnist.'' A 2000 profile of Allen in The Columbia Journalism Review described his late father as an ''investor.''
 It is almost impossible to find anyone who has seen his home (a rented apartment, short walk to the office). ''Never seen the apartment,'' volunteered Robert L. Allbritton, Politico's publisher, midinterview. ''No man's land.'' When sharing a cab, Allen is said to insist that the other party be dropped off first. One friend describes driving Allen home and having him get out at a corner; in the rearview mirror, the friend saw him hail a cab and set off in another direction. I've heard more than one instance of people who sent holiday cards to Allen's presumed address only to have them returned unopened. One former copy editor at Politico, Campbell Roth, happened to buy a Washington condominium a few years ago that Allen had just vacated. She told me the neighbors called the former tenant ''brilliant but weird'' and were ''genuinely scared about some fire-code violation'' based on the mountains of stuff inside.
 Allen is known as a legendary hoarder and pack rat. At The Post, enormous piles of yellowing papers, clothes, bags and detritus leaned ominously above his cubicle. While reporters are rarely neat freaks (I remember hearing rumors about Nixon-era sandwiches that are still being excavated from David Broder's office), Allen's work areas have been egregious. It got so bad at Time, where Allen was given his own office, that it became difficult to even open the door. His chair was raised at a crooked angle, as if it were not touching the floor, and the debris rose so high in some places that it blocked a portion of light coming through a picture window. Colleagues took pictures, as if the place were an archaeological site. It was disturbing to those who cared about Allen, especially after a photo of the office in a seemingly uninhabitable state made the rounds of the press corps and George W. Bush's White House.
 Friends and employers have taken on a kind of in-loco-parentis approach to some of Allen's needs -- making sure he fills out forms to get his press credentials renewed and encouraging him to slow down. Allbritton says he will sometimes ask Harris and VandeHei: ''Are you checking up on Mikey? Is he O.K.?'' Allen's bosses at The Post helped him to recover some of the thousands of dollars in unclaimed expenses that he accrued during the 2004 presidential campaign. Close friends have intervened with him on occasion, worried that he is working nonstop and looking dreadful and that his life appears in disarray. Allen thanks them and tells them not to worry.
 I asked Allen about his hoarding and clutter issues, and he wanted no part of the discussion. He assured me that the Internet had cured him. ''Everything is online now,'' he explained, smiling, never mind that he was terrorizing building-maintenance types long after the Internet was here.
 Allen has achieved a merger of life and work, family and Playbook. He is deeply committed to his mother, younger brother, two younger sisters and eight nieces and nephews scattered on both coasts. They make Playbook cameos. He describes Harris and VandeHei as his two closest friends. Both are fiercely protective of Mikey and are students of him. ''I've always felt he just, like, operates at levels that I couldn't even begin to fathom with my simple Wisconsin mind,'' says VandeHei, an Oshkosh native.
 A former editor at The Post told me that Allen today seems to have taken refuge in his status as a public ''brand.'' He deploys Playbook as a protective alter ego. It reminded me of something a senator said to me once -- that a lot of politicians are shy, private people and that they enter the business because it allows them to remain shy and private behind a public persona. In a recent phone call, I asked Allen what his hobbies were. He paused, went off the record and then came back with an unrevealing sound bite. ''I'm a well-rounded person,'' he said, ''who is interested in the community, interested in family, interested in sports, interested in the arts, interested in restaurants.'' I asked him what sports teams he roots for. ''I'm not gonna do that,'' Allen said. ''Playbook is ecumenical.'' He allowed that ''an astute reader of Playbook will notice frequent references to the Packers, Red Sox and Florida Gators.''
 At one point, I asked Allen if he would ever consider taking Playbook elsewhere. Surely he could sell the franchise for a sum that could easily exceed seven figures. (If Politico sells $15,000 in ads a week for Playbook, then Allen's newsletter alone brings an estimated $780,000 a year.) He was aghast at the question.
 Politico's offices are housed in the same place as Washington's ABC affiliate, owned by Politico's corporate parent, Allbritton Communications. They feel more like a television studio than a newsroom. Politico reporters dart to and from their ''hits'' at the newsroom's TV camera. Kim Kingsley, the Politico executive vice president (and a former Post colleague of mine) is a tireless promoter of Politico stories, its reporters and its brand.
 The publication has clearly exceeded the expectations of its founders and its naysayers. Copies of favorable press articles are framed on VandeHei's office wall, along with keepsakes from Politico's mainstream incursion (a photo of himself moderating a presidential debate on CNN). VandeHei was elected last year to the Pulitzer Prize board.
 Harris and VandeHei discussed the idea of starting an all-politics Web site while at The Washington Post. Harris, who is 46, had distinguished himself as a top-notch White House reporter during the Clinton years, while VandeHei, who previously worked at The Wall Street Journal and Roll Call, was an aggressive and ambitious beat reporter. Allbritton, the 41-year-old scion to a Washington banking and media empire, approached VandeHei in 2006 about running a new Capitol Hill publication. VandeHei told Allbritton about his and Harris's idea, which Allbritton agreed to back. VandeHei's wife, Autumn, coined the name Politico.
 Harris and VandeHei were bold in trying to lure journalistic ''brands.'' Their ''messaging'' brimmed with sports analogies and swagger. VandeHei told The New York Observer before the site's debut that he had e-mail messages from reporters ''begging for jobs'' and that Politico would ''show we're better than The New York Times and The Washington Post.''
 Their first target was Allen, an emerging presence on the Web at Time. Throughout his career, he has been known as an unfailingly fair, fast and prolific reporter with an insatiable need to be in the newspaper. ''The worst thing you could say to Mike Allen was, 'We don't have space for that story,' '' says Maralee Schwartz, the longtime political editor at The Post. ''It was like telling a child he couldn't have his candy.'' Allen also struggled to write the front-page analytical stories that were the traditional preserve of newspaper ''stars.'' Harris, who wrote many of these during his 21 years at The Post, says that the whirling production demands of today's news environment have caught up to Allen's sleepless, spaceless peculiarities.
 Before I covered politics, I wrote about Silicon Valley. Hearing Harris talk, I was reminded of the engineers at the height of the Web explosion in the 1990s -- socially eccentric geniuses who suddenly became the wealthy kings of the culture. Technology had caught up to their wiring. They often worked through several nights straight and never seemed to notice or mind. They were mostly male and single. The real prodigies appeared to achieve total synergy with the machines, just as Allen seems the perfect mental and metabolic match for today's news cycle.
 Politico's start-up culture tolerates idiosyncrasies better than more established businesses do, Allbritton told me. ''It's like you understand a little more,'' he said. ''We all have the wacky uncle.''
 VandeHei, who is 39, reminds me more of a venture capitalist these days. His mind appears to be constantly somersaulting with business models and management philosophies. A boyish-faced Packers fanatic, he is the more emotional and excitable half of the duo known as VandeHarris. He wears a chip on his shoulder plainly about established news organizations, and you sense that he takes the White House's apparent disregard for Politico personally.
 ''The Obama theory seems to be that The New York Times, big-name opinion writers and big shots on network news still largely shape how people think about policy, politics and news,'' VandeHei wrote to me in an e-mail message. ''It's why White House officials spend so much time on the phone with your reporters (N.Y.T.) -- and yet has had little effect on how the public sees the president.''
 By any measure, Politico employs several top-rank journalists, including the political writer Ben Smith, the Congressional reporter David Rogers and the political reporter Jonathan Martin. Allen has broken some of Politico's biggest stories. He reported that The Post was planning to hold paid salons for lobbyists at the home of its publisher, Katharine Weymouth, setting off a firestorm. During the 2008 campaign, he asked John McCain how many homes he owned (eight properties, and it proved a major embarrassment to McCain when he could not immediately answer).
 Politico's comprehensive aims can make it goofy and unapologetically trivial at times. A recent item by a Congressional blogger for the site consisted of the following: ''Lights are out throughout much of the Longworth House Office Building, a denizen tells me. UPDATE: They are back on.''
 The site's reporters are mostly young, eager to impress and driven hard. Predawn why-don't-we-have-this? e-mail messages from editors are common. Working for Politico is ''like tackle football,'' VandeHei reminds people, which might explain why most of Politico's best-known bylines are male. The main players have Little League nicknames (Vandy, JMart), use the same terminology and, strangely, share the same speech affect. I noticed that at least five of them (Allbritton, Harris, VandeHei, Allen and Martin), when trying to make a point, tended to elongate their vowels in a half-mouthed Midwesternish twang -- think Bob Dylan working a wad of chewing tobacco.
 In early March, a Web site called Xtranormal featured a spoof about life at the ''Politicave,'' starring computerized automatons of VandeHei and Allen (dressed in a superhero costume). After the VandeHei cartoon addressed Allen as ''Mike,'' Allen replied: ''Jim, for the last time, I am not Mike Allen. I am News Cycle Man, here to win the morning!'' Allen went on to inform VandeHei about ''that unpaid intern who is still crying about when you told her she would never make it in this business if she insists on taking bathroom breaks every day.'' The spot gave voice to a belief that Politico's cultlike mission demands a freakish devotion that only an action-hero workaholic could achieve. ''A page-view sweatshop'' is how one Politico writer described the place to me.
 Several current and former Politico employees were eager to relay their resentment of the place to me, though with a few exceptions, none for attribution. ''It's not so much the sweatshoppery itself that I minded,'' said Ryan Grim, a former Politico reporter who is now at The Huffington Post. ''It was the arbitrary nature of how it was applied.'' Kingsley, the Politico executive vice president, e-mailed me an unsolicited defense: ''In my experience, the people who whine about working at Politico shouldn't be at Politico,'' she wrote. ''They likely lack the metabolism and professional drive it takes to thrive here. For those of us who love a fast pace and a tough challenge, this place is a calling, not a job.''
 Harris readily acknowledges that Politico is ''not for everybody,'' and VandeHei said they have begun focusing their recruiting on New York, because ''the city produces reporters who are fearless, fast and ruthlessly competitive.''
 While journalism breeds a higher-than-average population of bellyachers, turnover was especially high at Politico in late March and early April -- five reporters and one editor announced they were leaving, including the White House reporter Nia-Malika Henderson (to The Washington Post), who had been the only African-American on a staff of about 50 reporters. ''The natural order of things'' is how Harris describes the departures. He said Politico is trying to ''mature from start-up mode'' in a number of areas, including diversity.
 Politico's gold standard is a reporter's ''metabolism,'' measured by speed, proficiency and the ephemeral currency of ''buzz.'' But Politico's buzz can also derive from provocative headlines placed atop thinly sourced stories. In February, for instance, Politico published a story about apparent tension between President Obama and Nancy Pelosi. The story -- bylined by Allen and Patrick O'Connor -- made its assertions based largely on a single anonymous source and was refuted or seriously played down by two on-the-record sources. Nonetheless, Politico played it big on its Web site, under the headline ''Family Feud,'' and multiple stories ensued on cable and online.
 More recently, Allen asked in his April 10 Playbook: ''Good Saturday morning: For brunch convo: Why isn't Secretary Clinton on the media short lists for the Court?'' By Monday, the convo had moved from the brunch table to ''Morning Joe'' (where the host, Joe Scarborough, advocated for her) and ''Today'' (where the Republican senator Orrin Hatch mentioned her, too). Later that day, Politico's Ben Smith quoted a State Department spokesman who ''threw some coolish water on the Clinton-for-Scotus buzz in an e-mail.'' By then, the cable and blog chatter was fully blown. The White House issued a highly unusual statement that Secretary Clinton would not be nominated. Politico then sent out a ''breaking news alert,'' and Smith reported that the White House had ''hurriedly punctured the trial balloon.'' End of convo.
 For what it's worth, Philippe Reines, a Clinton adviser, says that he told another Politico reporter the previous Friday that the chances of his boss's being nominated were ''less than none'' and added, ''Something being a sexy media story shouldn't be confused with truth.''
 Political operatives I speak to tend to deploy the word ''use'' a lot in connection with Politico; as in, they ''use'' the publication to traffic certain stories they know they could not or would not get published elsewhere. I was also struck by how freely VandeHei threw out the word ''market'' in connection with how newsmakers and sources interacted with Politico. ''If you want to move data or shape opinion,'' VandeHei wrote to me by e-mail, ''you market it through Mikey and Playbook, because those tens of thousands that matter most all read it and most feed it. Or you market it through someone else at Politico, which will make damn sure its audience of insiders and compulsives read it and blog about it; and that it gets linked around and talked about on TV programs.''
 By and large, the most common rap against Politico concerns its modeled-on-ESPN sensibility. While Harris and VandeHei say -- rightly -- that Politico has devoted lots of space and effort to, say, the health care debate, many of its prominent stories on the subject followed a reductive, who's-up-who's-down formula. (''No Clear Winner in Seven-Hour Gabfest,'' read the headline over the main article about President Obama's health care meeting.) Harris and VandeHei have clearly succeeded in driving the conversation, although the more complicated question is exactly where they are driving it.
 ''I've been in Washington about 30 years,'' Mark Salter, a former chief of staff and top campaign aide to John McCain, says. ''And here's the surprising reality: On any given day, not much happens. It's just the way it is.'' Not so in the world of Politico, he says, where meetings in which senators act like themselves (maybe sarcastic or short) become ''tension filled'' affairs. ''They have taken every worst trend in reporting, every single one of them, and put them on rocket fuel,'' Salter says. ''It's the shortening of the news cycle. It's the trivialization of news. It's the gossipy nature of news. It's the self-promotion.''
 Salter asked that if I quoted him, I also mention that he likes and respects many Politico reporters, beginning with Mike Allen.
 On a recent Friday night, a couple hundred influentials gathered for a Mardi Gras-themed birthday party for Betsy Fischer, the executive producer of ''Meet the Press.'' Held at the Washington home of the lobbyist Jack Quinn, the party was a classic Suck-Up City affair in which everyone seemed to be congratulating one another on some recent story, book deal, show or haircut (and, by the way, your boss is doing a swell job, and maybe we could do an interview).
 McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, arrived after the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie left. Fox News's Greta Van Susteren had David Axelrod pinned into a corner near a tower of cupcakes. In the basement, a very white, bipartisan Soul Train was getting down to hip-hop. David Gregory, the ''Meet the Press'' host, and Newsweek's Jon Meacham gave speeches about Fischer. Over by the jambalaya, Alan Greenspan picked up some Mardi Gras beads and placed them around the neck of his wife, NBC's Andrea Mitchell, who bristled and quickly removed them. Allen was there too, of course, but he vanished after a while -- sending an e-mail message later, thanking me for coming.
 In late March, we met for breakfast at Washington's Mayflower Hotel. He brought with him two recent copies of The San Jose Mercury News, because he knew I used to work there, and he had just been in the Bay Area. He became animated when discussing a long-ago reporting job in Fredericksburg, Va. His favorite story there was headlined, ''Hot Dog: A Meal or a Snack?'' The county board of supervisors was debating whether hot-dog sales should include a meal tax. ''Every single thing that I've written since then,'' Allen said, ''whether it's about a mayor or a governor or senator or president, it all boils down to, 'Hot Dog: A Meal or a Snack?' All great questions come from small questions.''
 Like a lot of reporters, Allen would much rather ask the questions than answer them. He led off with one: ''What's the most surprising thing you learned about me?''
 It was what I learned about his father, I told him. Gary Allen was an icon of the far right in the 1960s and 1970s. He was affiliated with the John Birch Society and railed against the ''big lies'' that led to the United States' involvement in World Wars I and II. He denounced the evils of the Trilateral Commission and ''Red Teachers.'' Rock'n'roll was a ''Pavlovian Communist mind-control plot.'' He wrote speeches for George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama and presidential candidate. ''Gary Allen is one of the most popular writers that John Birchites read and believe with a zeal that is nervous-making,'' wrote Nicholas von Hoffman in a 1972 Washington Post column. He wrote mail-order books and pamphlets distributed through a John Birch mailing list.
 None of Mike Allen's friends seemed to know any of this about his father, or they were diverting me with other monikers (like ''football coach,'' which he indeed was; Gary Allen coached a Pop Warner team that included Mike, who played center, badly). In an earlier phone interview, Allen said his mother was a first-grade teacher and his dad was a ''writer'' and ''speaker.'' After I mentioned his father at breakfast, Allen flashed a sudden, teeth-clenched smile that stayed frozen as I spoke. He had described his upbringing to me as nonpolitical. And maybe it was. People who knew Gary Allen, who died of complications from diabetes in 1986, described him as quiet and introspective. ''He was more outspoken in his writing,'' says Dan Lungren, a Republican member of Congress, who represented Orange County back then and knew the family. Lungren, who now represents a district that includes parts of Sacramento, said that the Allens hosted a meet-and-greet at their home for one of his early campaigns.
 I asked Mike Allen what it was like being his father's son. ''We have a very close family,'' he said slowly. ''I'm very close to all my siblings, and I'm very grateful to my parents for all the emphasis they put on education and family and sports and Scouts.'' He called his father ''a great dad.'' How did he make his living? ''I don't know the details of it,'' Allen said. He did some teaching, but Allen said he was not sure where or what age groups, whether elementary school or high school or something else. He had an office at home. ''To me, he was my dad. So that's what I knew.'' He says he never read anything his father wrote.
 After some fidgety minutes, I asked Allen how he became an Eagle Scout. His eyes softened and stopped blinking as much as they had been, and his voice took on the cadence of solemn recital. He uttered the Boy Scout Law: ''A scout is trustworthy,'' Allen proclaimed, ''loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.''
 I asked Allen if I could talk to his siblings. He said he would consider it and maybe set up a conference call but never did. I did not press. It felt intrusive. Nor did I want to overreach for a Rosebud. ''Life isn't binary,'' Allen said a few times at breakfast, in the context of whether a hot dog is a meal or a snack and later in the context of what his father was like. But I could not help being struck by the contrast between father and son.
 Gary Allen's writings conveyed great distrust of the established order. He saw conspiracies in both parties, despised Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger for their internationalism and the ''establishment media'' for enabling the ''communist conspiracy.'' Mike Allen traverses politics with a boyish and almost star-struck quality toward the assumed order. He is diligent in addressing leaders by proper titles, ranks, ''Madam Speakers'' and ''Mr. Presidents'' (a scout is reverent). Friends said he seemed particularly enthralled to be covering the White House during the Bush years and was spotted at all hours around the briefing room and press area.
 Allen views Playbook as a respite from the chaos and invective of the daily news cycle. And at the end of our discussion about his father, he made a point of ending on a sweet and orderly data point. After Gary Allen died, at 50, many of his former Pop Warner players filled the church in tribute. Allen said he recalled no talk of his father's political work at the memorial, but he will never forget one detail: a giant blue and gold floral arrangement in the shape of a football was placed onstage, a gift from the kids on Gary Allen's team, the Phantoms.
 One of the few times I can recall Allen stepping out of his friendly scoutmaster persona in Playbook was when he dismissed a Sunday column by the public editor in The New York Times as ''a bit of a snore.'' The column was about how reporters should not use The Times to, among other things, plug their friends. ''O.K., then!'' Allen wrote to conclude the item.
 Allen clearly plugs his friends in Playbook -- quoting from press releases announcing their new jobs (''Taylor Griffin Joins Hamilton Place Strategies as Partner''), referring to pal Katie Couric as a ''media icon,'' reporting that the model car built by Ethan Gibbs, the 6-year-old son of Robert Gibbs, finished second in the Cub Scouts' Pinewood Derby. Isn't part of the function of Playbook to plug Mike Allen's friends? ''I wouldn't agree with that,'' Allen told me. ''Playbook is to serve its audience and community, and we serve them by giving them information they need and want. If it were the way you describe it, people wouldn't read it.'' Recognition of a friend's milestone can also be a data point. People in this tiny world care if two of their own (say, the Democratic operatives Phil Singer and Kim Molstre) have a baby (''Introducing Max George Singer,'' Playbook, March 18).
 Allen's focus is customer service. He wants to ''spread joy'' as the Holy Ghost of the Almighty News Cycle. ''I am fortunate,'' he keeps saying. (Hat Tip: God.)
 In early March, I was meeting with Harris in his office when Allen walked in. He welcomed me, thanked me for coming and returned to his desk to finish a story or six. I visited his cubicle, but Allen was gone. His work area was notable for its lack of clutter -- there were a few small stacks of magazines and newspapers and a tray of mint Girl Scout cookies on the top of his terminal. To the left of his desktop was a picture of Allen standing upright and asking President Obama a question at a White House news conference.
 In the days leading up to a photo shoot for this article, Allen's work area became spotless, surfaces shining, befitting News Cycle Man. The poster of the cartoon sphinx had been removed. I kept asking Kingsley, ''Who cleaned up Mikey's room?'' but neither she nor Allen would say. All great questions come from small questions. And some just hang there, until they vanish.

HEADLINE: Pardon My French

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Paris
 ERIC ZEMMOUR, slight, dark, a live wire, fell over his own words, they were tumbling out so fast. He was fidgeting at the back of a half-empty cafe one recent evening near the offices of Le Figaro, the newspaper where he works, notwithstanding that detractors have lately tried to get him fired for his most recent inflammatory remarks about French blacks and Arabs on a television show. Mr. Zemmour, roughly speaking, is the Bill O'Reilly of French letters. He was describing his latest book, ''French Melancholy,'' which has shot up the best-seller list here.
 ''The end of French political power has brought the end of French,'' Mr. Zemmour said. ''Now even the French elite have given up. They don't care anymore. They all speak English. And the working class, I'm not talking just about immigrants, they don't care about preserving the integrity of the language either.'' 
 Mr. Zemmour is a notorious rabble-rouser. In his view France, because of immigration and other outside influences, has lost touch with its heroic ancient Roman roots, its national ''gloire,'' its historic culture, at the heart of which is the French language. Plenty of people think he's an extremist, but he's not alone. The other day Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, sounded a bit like Mr. Zemmour, complaining about the ''snobisme'' of French diplomats who ''are happy to speak English,'' rather than French, which is ''under siege.''
 ''Defending our language, defending the values it represents -- that is a battle for cultural diversity in the world,'' Mr. Sarkozy argued. The occasion for his speech was the 40th anniversary of the International Organization of the Francophonie, which celebrates French around the world. Mr. Sarkozy said the problem is not English itself but ''ready-to-wear culture, uniformity, monolingualism,'' by which of course he meant English. The larger argument about a decline of traditional values has struck a chord with conservative French voters perennially worried about the loss of French mojo.
 The issue is somewhat akin to Americans complaining about the rise of Spanish in classrooms and elsewhere, but more acute here because of France's special, proprietary, albeit no longer entirely realistic relationship to French. French is now spoken mostly by people who aren't French. More than 50 percent of them are African. French speakers are more likely to be Haitians and Canadians, Algerians and Senegalese, immigrants from Africa and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean who have settled in France, bringing their native cultures with them.
 Which raises the question: So what does French culture signify these days when there are some 200 million French speakers in the world but only 65 million are actually French? Culture in general -- and not just French culture -- has become increasingly unfixed, unstable, fragmentary and elective. Globalization has hastened the desire of more people, both groups and individuals, to differentiate themselves from one another to claim a distinct place in the world, and language has long been an obvious means to do so. In Canada the Quebecers tried outlawing signs and other public expressions in anything but French. Basque separatists have been murdering Spaniards in the name of political, linguistic and cultural independence, just as Franco imprisoned anyone who spoke Basque or Catalan. In Belgium the split between French and Dutch speakers has divided the country for ages.
 And in France some years ago Jacques Toubon, a former culture minister, proposed curbing the use of English words like ''weekend,'' although nobody paid much attention. The fact is, French isn't declining. It's thriving as never before if you ask Abdou Diouf, former president of Senegal, who is the secretary general of the francophone organization. Mr. Diouf's organization has evolved since 1970 from a postcolonial conglomerate of mostly African states preserving the linguistic vestiges of French imperialism into a global entity whose shibboleth is cultural diversity. With dozens of member states and affiliates, the group reflects a polyglot reality in which French is today concentrated outside France, and to a large extent, flourishes despite it.
 ''The truth,'' Mr. Diouf said the other morning, ''is that the future of the French language is now in Africa.'' There and elsewhere, from Belgium to Benin, Lebanon to St. Lucia, the Seychelles to Switzerland, Togo to Tunisia, French is just one among several languages, sometimes, as in Cameroon, one among hundreds of them. This means that for writers from these places French is a choice, not necessarily signifying fealty, political, cultural or otherwise, to France. Or as Mr. Diouf put it: ''The more we have financial, military and economic globalization, the more we find common cultural references and common values, which include diversity. And diversity, not uniformity, is the real result of globalization.''
 Didier Billion is a political scientist with an interest in francophone culture. He agreed. ''A multipolar world has emerged,'' he said when we met in his office recently. ''It's the major trend of our time, which for the first time is allowing every person on the planet to become, in a cultural sense, an actor on the world stage.
 ''I was in Iran two months ago. Young Iranians are very proud of their own culture, which is rich and profound. But at the same time they want a window onto the world through the Internet, to have some identity outside Iran, and the important point is that for them there is no contradiction between these two positions. I am very proud of being French, but 40 years ago the French language was a way to maintain influence in the former colonies, and now French people are going to have to learn to think about francophone culture differently, because having a common language doesn't assure you a common political or cultural point of view.''
 This may sound perfectly obvious to Americans, but it's not necessarily so to France's growing tea party contingent. The populist National Front party won some 20 percent of the vote in the south last month (less nationwide), despite Mr. Sarkozy's monthslong campaign to seduce right-wing voters by stressing the preservation of French national identity. Part of that campaign has been affirming a policy of cultural exceptionalism.
 A phrase born years ago, ''l'exception culturelle,'' refers to the legal exclusion of French cultural products, like movies, from international free trade agreements, so they won't be treated as equivalent to Coca-Cola or the Gap. But if you ask French people, the term also implies something more philosophical. In a country where pop radio stations broadcast a percentage of songs in French, and a socialist mayor in the northern, largely Muslim town of Roubaix lately won kudos for protesting that outlets of the fast-food chain Quick turned halal, cultural exceptionalism reflects fears of the multicultural sort that Mr. Zemmour's book touches on.
 It happens that Mr. Zemmour traces his own roots to Sephardic Jews from Spain who became French citizens while living in Algeria in the 19th century, then moved to France before the Algerian war. He belongs to the melting pot, in other words, which for centuries, he said, absorbed immigrants into its republican culture.
 ''In America or Britain it is O.K. that people live in separate communities, black with black, white with white,'' he said, reflecting a certain antique perspective. ''But this is not French. France used to be about assimilation. But since the 1970s the French intelligentsia has called this neocolonialism. In fact it is globalization, and globalization in this respect really means Americanization.''
 But of course colorblind French Jacobin republicanism has always been a fiction if you were black or Muslim, and what's really happened lately, it seems, is that different racial and ethnic groups have begun to argue more loudly for their rights and assert their culture. The election of Barack Obama hastened the process, by pointing out how few blacks and Arabs here have gained political authority.
 The French language is a small but emblematic indicator of this change. So to a contemporary writer like the Soviet-born Andrei Makine, who found political asylum here in 1987, French promises assimilation and a link to the great literary tradition of Zola and Proust. He recounted the story of how, 20-odd years ago, his first manuscripts, which he wrote in French, were rejected by French publishers because it was presumed that he couldn't write French well enough as a foreigner.
 Then he invented the name of a translator, resubmitted the same works as if they were translations from Russian, and they won awards. He added that when his novel ''Dreams of My Russian Summers'' became a runaway best seller and received the Prix Goncourt, publishing houses in Germany and Serbia wanted to translate the book from its ''original'' Russian manuscript, so Mr. Makine spent two ''sleepless weeks,'' he said, belatedly producing one.
 ''Why do I write in French?'' he repeated the question I had posed. ''It is the possibility to belong to a culture that is not mine, not my mother tongue.''
 Nancy Huston, a Canadian-born novelist here, put it another way: ''The world has changed.'' She moved to Paris during the 1970s. ''The French literary establishment, which still thinks of itself as more important than it is, complains about the decline of its prestige but treats francophone literature as second class,'' she said, while ''laying claim to the likes of Kundera, Beckett and Ionesco, who were all born outside France. That is because, like Makine, they made the necessary declaration of love for France. But if the French bothered actually to read what came out of Martinique or North Africa, they would see that their language is in fact not suffering.
 ''After the war French writers rejected the idea of narrative because Hitler and Stalin were storytellers, and it seemed naive to believe in stories. So instead they turned more and more to theory, to the absurd. The French declined even to tell stories about their own history, including the war in Algeria, which like all history can't really be digested until it is turned into great literature. Francophone literature doesn't come out of that background. It still tells stories.''
 Which may partly account for the popularity of francophone writers like Yasmina Khadra, the best-selling Algerian novelist, whose real name is Mohammed Moulessehoul. We sipped tea one gray day in the offices of the Algerian Cultural Center. A 55-year-old former Algerian Army officer who now lives in Paris heading the center, Mr. Moulessehoul writes novels critical of the Algerian government under his wife's name, which he first borrowed while in Algeria because the military there had banned his literary work.
 ''I was born into a poet tribe in the Sahara desert, which ruled for 800 years,'' he said, sitting erect and alert, still a soldier at heart. ''I read poetry in Arabic. I read kids' books in Arabic. But at 15, after I read Camus in French, I decided to become a novelist in French partly because I wanted to respond to Camus, who had written about an Algeria in which there were no Arabs. I wanted to write in his language to say, I am here, I exist, and also because I love French, although I remain Arab. Linguistically it is as if I have married a French woman, but my mother is still Arabic.''
 He quoted Kateb Yacine, the Algerian writer, who chose to write in French ''to tell the French that I am not French.'' Yacine called French the treasure left behind in the ruins of colonialism.
 ''Paris is still fearful of a French writer who becomes known around the world without its blessing,'' Mr. Moulessehoul said. ''And at the same time in certain Arab-speaking circles I am considered a traitor because I write in French. I am caught between two cultures, two worlds.
 ''Culture is always about politics in the end. I am a French writer and an Algerian writer. But the larger truth is that I am both.''
Correction: May 2, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Abroad column last Sunday, about the shift in francophone culture, described incorrectly the military service of the Algerian novelist Mohammed Moulessehoul, who writes under the pen name Yasmina Khadra. He went to military school at the age of 8 and later became an Alegrian Army officer in charge of counter-guerrilla activity for part of the country during Algeria's civil war. He did not fight against the French.

HEADLINE: A Yoga Manifesto

BYLINE: By MARY BILLARD

 BODY:
ZEN is expensive. The flattering Groove pants, Lululemon's answer to Spanx, may set Luluheads, the devoted followers of the yoga-apparel brand, back $108. Manduka yoga mats, favored for their slip resistance and thickness, can reach $100 for a limited-edition version. Drop-in classes at yoga studios in New York are edging beyond $20 a session, which quickly adds up, and the high-end Pure Yoga, a chain with two outposts in Manhattan, requires a $40 initiation fee, and costs $125 to $185 a month.
 You can even combine yoga with a vacation in the Caribbean, but it will cost you: in December, the luxurious Parrot Cay resort in Turks and Caicos has a six-night retreat with classes taught by the ''yoga rock stars'' (in the words of the press release) Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman. The cost? A cool $6,077.
 And is it surprising that yoga, like so much else in this age of celebrity, now has something of a star system, with yoga teachers now almost as recognizable as Oscar winners? The flowing locks of Rodney Yee. The do-rag bandanna worn by Baron Baptiste. The hyper perpetual calm exhibited by David Life and Sharon Gannon, who taught Sting, Madonna and Russell Simmons. The contortions (and Rolls-Royces) of Bikram Choudhury. 
 Yoga is definitely big business these days. A 2008 poll, commissioned by Yoga Journal, concluded that the number of people doing yoga had declined from 16.5 million in 2004 to 15.8 million almost four years later. But the poll also estimated that the actual spending on yoga classes and products had almost doubled in that same period, from $2.95 billion to $5.7 billion.
 ''The irony is that yoga, and spiritual ideals for which it stands, have become the ultimate commodity,'' Mark Singleton, the author of ''Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice,'' wrote in an e-mail message this week. ''Spirituality is a style, and the 'rock star' yoga teachers are the style gurus.''
 Well, maybe it is the recession, but some yogis are now saying ''Peace out'' to all that. There's a brewing resistance to the expense, the cult of personality, the membership fees. At the forefront of the movement is Yoga to the People, which opened its first studio in 2006 in the East Village on St. Marks Place, with a contribution-only, pay-what-you-can fee structure. The manifesto is on the opening page of its Web site, yogatothepeople.com: ''There will be no correct clothes, There will be no proper payment, There will be no right answers ... No ego no script no pedestals.''
 One more thing: There are no ''glorified'' teachers or star yogis. You can't even find out who is teaching which class when, or reserve a spot with a specific instructor. And that's exactly the way that Greg Gumucio wants it.
 LATE on an overcast Saturday earlier this month, just a little before sundown, Mr. Gumucio, the founder of Yoga to the People, was sitting on the rooftop of his East Village studio, surprisingly refreshed after a birthday party downstairs for his son, who had just turned 5.
 Propped on the ledge on a round pillow, his wavy, shoulder-length hair framed by the urban jungle backdrop of tar-covered roofs, Mr. Gumucio recounted his biography, and how it was linked with that of Bikram Choudhury, perhaps the most famous name in yoga today.
 ''The idea for Yoga for the People came to me because of Bikram,'' Mr. Gumucio said, explaining that he worked for Mr. Choudhury for six years, from 1996 to 2002, sometimes running teacher training for Bikram Yoga in Los Angeles, commuting from Seattle, where he was living. He channels Mr. Choudhury, one suspects not for the first time, talking with a raspy, slightly accented voice: ''Boss, do me a favor, take everybody's class and tell me what you think.'' Mr. Gumucio obliged, and when reporting back, mentioned one teacher whom he didn't like. Mr. Choudhury was not sympathetic. Just the opposite, telling Mr. Gumucio to, in essence, suck it up and go back to the class -- that the problem wasn't with the instructor, but with Mr. Gumucio himself. ''You are your own teacher,'' Mr. Gumucio said he was told. ''You are responsible for your own experience.''
 It was a revelatory moment for Mr. Gumucio. If the student was more important than the teacher, why was there such an emphasis placed on the individual instructors? Too often, Mr. Gumucio saw students stop doing yoga because they couldn't practice with a favorite teacher. Why not jettison that system? Why not just assign students to the next available teacher?
 A second revelation occurred in class when he was struggling to keep his body in a difficult position. ''I was sweating, my muscles shaking, in triangle pose, and Bikram was talking about how fast he was as a boy in Calcutta. How he could catch this dog.'' The situation was almost more than Mr. Gumucio could bear. ''In my mind,'' he recalled, ''I was thinking 'What is wrong with you. Stop this stupid story!' ''
 Later, Mr. Choudhury again dismissed his complaints, telling Mr. Gumucio that distractions were everywhere: ''Candle, incense, music, easy to meditate!'' Mr. Gumucio recalls being told. ''Try being calm and peaceful in your car when someone cuts you off.''
 Message learned. Yoga isn't about a pristine environment -- yogis can work downward dog to downward dog, no matter where they are, even if in a crowded, unadorned studio. ''Being able to do yoga with a foot in your face, that is a really powerful practice,'' Mr. Gumucio said. He would take that no-frills philosophy with him when he left Bikram in 2002, and a few years later (after a stint as a mediator in small claims court), in 2006, moved to New York to open his own studio. ''The first few months there were four or five people, but within three months, it really took off,'' he said.
 Today. Mr. Gumucio has three studios in New York (including two hot-yoga studios that charge $8 a class), one in San Francisco, one in Berkeley, Calif., and one to open later this year in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He has just signed a lease in Chelsea and is considering expanding to Austin, Chicago and Los Angeles. (But his philosophy of keeping a low profile seems to be working: a question to many students about what they think of Mr. Gumucio usually provokes little more than a blank stare and ''Who?'' )
 High volume is the key to his business model -- he says up to 900 people may go to a Yoga to the People studio in a single day, with perhaps half of them paying at least something in the form of a donation -- as well as an important part of his overall philosophy. ''I truly believe if more people were doing yoga, the world would be a better place,'' he said.
 LAST Sunday morning, the sun streamed through the windows of the clean airy loft on the second floor as the teacher, Haven Melynn, stood at the buzzer letting in students from the street. On a metal stand sat an empty tissue box. Some students dropped a donation into the box, others didn't. The students fit in one studio, and at prime times, the teacher will send any overflow up to the studio above, and then the studio above that.
 Mats are rolled out, a few inches apart, with no one under the illusion that it may be an empty class. The classroom holds about 60 students, and people are socializing, chatting about their late nights, where to get falafels, and upcoming art exhibitions. Music plays quietly in the background. No opening ''Oms.'' (''I like that there isn't any chanting, or big spiritual message,'' Layan Fuleihan, a college student, said afterward. ''I like that you make the class what you want.'') Instead, Ms. Melynn started off with slow movements to warm up, sun salutations, then quickly picked up the pace. Jammed, yes, but the yogis stuck to their own mats, boundaries defined, during a sweat-producing vinyasa class, flowing and moving, as the teacher cajoled people to make cathartic exhales of HAA-sss -- all to the sounds of a play list that includes Michael Jackson and the Dave Matthews Band.
 Yoga to the People isn't the only entity raging against the yoga machine. In New York, other studios are popping up, offering affordable, if not entirely donation-based, yoga. Do Yoga and Pilates, in TriBeCa, is donation-based; Tara Stiles, who has an iPhone app with Deepak Chopra, has opened Strala Yoga in NoHo, offering multiple class levels for $10 each. Yoga Vida NYC on University Place opened in January. Classes are small and it costs $10 drop in, $5 for students. ''Our studio isn't better or worse, it's just different,'' says Hilaria Thomas, yoga director of Yoga Vida NYC and a former instructor at Yoga to the People. ''Different energies.''
 Better-known rivals in the yoga world don't seem to take offense at this back-to-basic movement. ''I think the donation model is awesome,'' says Baron Baptiste. ''It's a balancing act. If someone has the means for what I'll call 'high end yoga,' like going on exotic retreats, they should enjoy it.'' He adds, laughing, ''I never know what the term rock star yoga teacher means. Someone like Iyengar, one of the most famous teachers in the world, is he a rock star? Is Iyengar the Bono of yoga?''
 Mr. Gumucio knows his niche -- ''the ABC's of yoga'' -- and that Yoga to the People has its critics. Its detractors say that classes are too big, that there isn't a lot of advanced alignment breakdowns, that the exclamation HAA-sss isn't the way you are supposed to breathe. He mimics a naysayer, sniffing: ''Oh, that's not yoga!'' He laughs and shrugs, a wordless: Who's to say what is yoga?

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about a back-to-basics yoga movement misstated the month that a six-night yoga retreat will be held at the Parrot Cay resort in the Turks and Caicos. It will be in December, not August.

HEADLINE: Africa's Role in the U.S. Slave Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Ending the Slavery Blame-Game'' (Op-Ed, April 23), Henry Louis Gates Jr. notes that African rulers and merchants were deeply complicit in the Atlantic slave trade. Despite Mr. Gates's contention that ''there is very little discussion'' of this fact, it hardly qualifies as news; today, virtually every history of slavery and every American history textbook includes this information. 
 Mr. Gates's point is that the African role complicates the process of assigning blame for slavery and thus discussion of apologies and reparations by the United States. I believe that apologies serve little purpose and that reparations are unworkable. But the great growth of slavery in this country occurred after the closing of the Atlantic slave trade in 1808.
 It was Americans, not Africans, who created in the South the largest, most powerful slave system the modern world has known, a system whose profits accrued not only to slaveholders but also to factory owners and merchants in the North. Africans had nothing to do with the slave trade within the United States, in which an estimated two million men, women and children were sold between 1820 and 1860.
 Identifying Africa's part in the history of slavery does not negate Americans' responsibility to confront the institution's central role in our own history.
 Eric Foner New York, April 23, 2010
 The writer is a professor of history at Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 It is true, as Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr. says, that many African monarchs were complicit in the heinous Atlantic slave trade. But the demand for reparations has less to do with the mechanism that delivered the African captives than what happened to them during the hundreds of years of working without compensation.
 The economic disadvantage of black workers extended beyond the long night of slavery into the iniquitous era of Jim Crow.
 A crime was committed against humanity, and the European nations, the United States and the African chiefs are all accessories. But the United States was the greatest beneficiary, and thus should be the main compensator.
 Herb Boyd New York, April 23, 2010
 The writer teaches African and African-American history at the College of New Rochelle and City College, CUNY, and is the author of 18 books.
 To the Editor:
 As Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr. points out, the role of Africans themselves in slave trading is one that is sometimes ignored by advocates of reparations. I fear, however, that in looking at the role of Africans in creating or sustaining the slave trade, we will make the same mistake that we make in trying to assess blame for international drug trafficking -- focusing too much on the supply side of trafficking.
 While it is true that without slaves having been provided to Europeans there probably would have been no large-scale trans-Atlantic slave trade, it is equally true that without the demand for African slaves in the West there could have been no large-scale slave trade.
 To use the metaphor of a modern-day kidnapping, the question becomes, Who is more culpable: the abductor who initially takes the victim, or the captor who obtains the victim and keeps him (and often his offspring) captive for generations?
 Lolita Buckner Inniss Cleveland, April 23, 2010

HEADLINE: Stop by Stop, Subway's Decline and Growth in 2009

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Every year, New York City Transit releases a station-by-station breakdown of ridership in the biggest subway system in the nation. Shake-ups are rare; the usual suspects -- Times Square, Grand Central Station -- routinely top the list, and last year was no exception. 
 But 2009 was a time of uncertainty and change, and a closer examination of life on the city's underground reveals a curious resemblance to the uneasy life above the surface. 
 Take the J line, which snakes across a rapidly developing stretch of Williamsburg and eastern Brooklyn: nearly every station along its length gained riders last year. Consider Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, a locus of corporate headquarters and high-end boutiques: amid a brutal economy, the number of passengers shuffling through its turnstiles dropped by more than 11 percent. 
 There was enormous growth at the Bowery station on the Lower East Side, a Manhattan entry point for workers heading home along the newly popular J, M and Z trains. And perhaps unsurprisingly, a station in the Financial District recorded the steepest drop of any in Manhattan. 
 Some of the trends seem intuitive. Ridership in Midtown, which has lost tens of thousands of jobs since 2008, dropped at more than twice the rate of the system as a whole. The station under the Citigroup building lost 9 percent of its ridership -- about the same as construction-plagued Newkirk Avenue in Brooklyn, where train service was disrupted for much of the year. 
 Other patterns may be unexpected. Ridership fell along Queens Boulevard, despite growing neighborhoods like Jackson Heights; it rose in Middle Village, Queens, which has lost population in recent years.
 Rides originating at the Mets-Willets Point stop, abutting newly built Citi Field, fell 8.5 percent, ranking among the biggest 25 declines. We knew the Mets had a rough season, but this bad? Ridership at the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx, where fans flocked until the end of the World Series, fell just 1.9 percent. 
 In all, the system had 1.58 billion rides last year, officials said, a decline of 2.7 percent from 2008. Transit officials are quick to attribute many of the changes to construction. Sometimes, they make a good case. The Q train stop at Avenue U in Brooklyn lost more than a fifth of its ridership last year after officials eliminated all Coney Island-bound service at the station. Meanwhile, a big increase occurred at the Avenue U station on the N line, a surge that officials attributed to riders who migrated west to avoid the trials of service changes. 
 Economists rely more on employment figures. Almost the entire Queens Boulevard line lost riders last year; at least one expert saw a correlation with fewer jobs in the construction business. 
 ''Queens is one of the boroughs that really benefited from the buildup and residential construction,'' said Martin C. Kohli, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''When that came to an end, that might have contributed to some of the reductions.'' 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Kohli noted that health care jobs grew last year, particularly in the Bronx, where ridership grew in Woodlawn and along Jerome Avenue and White Plains Road.
 Whatever the explanation for last year's patterns, ridership in 2010 is likely to be determined by one major factor: the severe cuts in subway and bus service that will be implemented in June. Some transit devotees worry that straphangers will abandon the system. 
 ''It remains to be seen whether people stay,'' said Andrew Albert, the chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council. He sounded a bit sad. 
 ''If they have interminable waits or have to change lines,'' Mr. Albert said, ''maybe they'll leave the system altogether.''

HEADLINE: Arizona's New Immigration Law Widens the Chasm Between Sides

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
MESA, Ariz. -- They stood a few miles from each other, but as far apart as heat and cold.
 Clutching a copy of a Spanish-language article on the tough new law making it a state crime for illegal immigrants to be in Arizona and requiring those suspected of being violators to show proof of legal status, Eric Ramirez, 29, still waited on a corner for work. He nervously kept watch for the police and wondered what his future held.
 ''We were already afraid, and I was thinking of leaving for California,'' Mr. Ramirez said as he waited on the corner in a heavily Latino enclave already drained of people by the recession and the fear of police harassment. ''We shop in their stores, we clean their yards, but they want us out and the police will be on us.'' 
 In a nearby neighborhood, Ron White, 52, said he felt a sense of relief that something was finally being done about ''the illegals'' -- whom he blames for ills like congregating on the streets, breaking into homes in his neighborhood, draining tax dollars and taking jobs from Americans. 
 ''I sure hope it does have an effect,'' Mr. White said of the new law as he packed his car with groceries. ''I wouldn't want to show proof of citizenship, but I also don't feel it is racial profiling. You are going to look different if you are an alien, and cops know.''
 Immigration has always polarized residents of Arizona, a major gateway for illegal immigrants. But the new law signed by Gov. Jan Brewer on Friday has widened the chasm in a way few here can remember.
 The law -- barring expected legal challenges before it takes effect this summer -- also gives the local police broad powers to check documentation ''when practicable'' of anyone they reasonably suspect is an illegal immigrant.
 It has already shaken up politics in the state, and it sets the stage for a rematch on a national debate between the punitive and the practical solutions to the nation's illegal immigration issue.
 But the arguments are less abstract in Arizona, home to an estimated 450,000 illegal immigrants and to the busiest stretch of illegal crossings along the Mexican border.
 While demonstrators massed at the Capitol, including a few thousand Sunday afternoon denouncing the law as unconstitutional and an open invitation for racial profiling, the undercurrents that gave rise to the bill pushed as strong as ever.
 The sponsor of the bill, a state senator and retired sheriff's deputy whose passion is to drive out the state's illegal immigrants and deter more from coming, lives here in Mesa, a Phoenix suburb that is the state's third-largest city.
 It has landed in the cauldron of debate, with a former police chief publicly warring with the county sheriff over the merits of his ''crime suppression'' sweeps a couple of years ago that focused on illegal immigrants.
 Mesa has grown blisteringly fast in the last few decades, to about 450,000 residents from 63,000 in 1970, with Southern California-style walled subdivisions and gated communities blanketing former farmland.
 The economy soared until recently, but the blitz of development proved unsettling to some. 
 Illegal immigrants flowed in, too, to tend the yards, fix the roofs and commit their share of crimes, though police officials have said at no greater rate than the rest of the population.
 About a fifth of the residents are Hispanic. But they live mainly in enclaves like Reed Park, a stretch of boxy apartment buildings dotted with ''for rent'' signs, bodegas blaring Mexican music and older homes. 
 This is Rosalia Minon's Mesa, and she fears it. Even before the new law, she and her fellow illegal immigrant neighbors did not venture out often for fear of being stopped by the police or immigration agents.
 Ms. Minon is struggling to make ends meet, because more employers than ever are asking for Social Security cards and checking their validity under a heretofore rarely enforced 2007 state law that provides penalties for employers who do not check. She prays every morning as she steps out the door, ''because we go out and we do not know if we are coming back.''
 Alfredo Hernandez-Garcia, 22, who is not a legal resident but is married to a woman who is, already lies low, fearing he will be deported and separated from his wife, who will soon give birth.
 ''This is going to tear apart families, and what good does that do?'' he said, relaxing at an apartment building near a park he rarely ventures into. ''What is the government here going to do if we all go and it affects the economy?'' 
 Like others, Mr. Hernandez-Garcia said the wait for legal authorization to immigrate from Mexico runs several years, sometimes even a decade or more. 
 ''And all the jobs are here,'' he said. ''There is nothing in Mexico, and now it is so violent. Who wants to go back?'' 
 The businesses catering to Latinos are suffering. At Mi Amigos, a bodega, the manager, Rigoberto Magana, glanced at the emptiness of the store at midday and said it was typical.
 ''Our business is way, way down, and so is everybody else's here,'' Mr. Magana said. ''Nobody comes out.''
 Just a short drive away, a subdivision encircles a golf course.
 This is Kent Lowis's Mesa, and he fears for it.
 ''This law might kick some of these immigrants out,'' said Mr. Lowis, 76, a retiree who has lived here for more than 30 years and does not like all the change. ''They vandalize the golf course, throwing flags in the ponds. Burglaries. There are too many immigrants. I get tired of seeing all these people standing on the corner.''
 Such sentiments propelled the bill through the Republican-controlled Legislature, with supporters listing well-publicized cases in which illegal immigrants committed rapes and shot and killed police officers.
 The sponsor, State Senator Russell K. Pearce, a Republican, said it would give the police a tool to weed out criminals before they act and help foster a climate of toughness that would discourage more immigrants from coming.
 Governor Brewer, a Republican, said as she signed the bill into law on Friday that she believed that a majority of Arizonans supported it, though there is no independent assessment of the assertion. A poll released two days before said that a majority of likely voters in Arizona supported the bill, but it used an automated telephone query that some pollsters find questionable and it was conducted before the heavy onslaught of news media coverage.
 No Democrats in the Legislature supported the bill, and only one Republican voted against it.
 While those opposed to the law are making the most noise, the quiet support can be found here, though some people are uneasy about being cast as anti-Hispanic and several people interviewed declined to be named out of concern they would be thought of as prejudiced.
 ''I don't want people to be afraid to come,'' said Pam Sutherland, who is a window manufacturer and a fan of the crime sweeps but is also concerned about the state's image. ''I just want them to do it legally.''
 For many, though, support for the law comes down to a way to vent frustration that, in their view, the federal government has not done enough to control immigration -- particularly in a state on the border where reports of drug busts, houses overcrowded with illegal immigrants and people dying in the desert trying to get here fill the airwaves.
 ''We can see Washington isn't going to do anything,'' Mr. White said. ''So why not Arizona? I think Arizona is the one state with the bigger problem with it.''

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Earn More, Early On, a Study Shows

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City may be one of the best places for men with college degrees to seek their fortunes -- at least until they reach their late 30s. After that, they might be better off in Atlanta or Dallas.
 That is one conclusion that can be drawn from a study of New Yorkers' earning patterns conducted by the city comptroller's office. The study, released late last week, estimated that a male college graduate in the New York metropolitan area would earn about $256,000 more over his lifetime than his peers in the rest of the country, while the ''New York premium'' for a female college graduate would add up to about $184,000. 
 But for the men, most of that advantage would be gained in the first 15 years of their careers, according to the study's author, Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the comptroller's office. Once they celebrate their 37th birthdays, the gap between what educated men in New York earn and what they would earn in some other big cities starts to close, Mr. Braconi said.
 By the time they are 57, they would be making more money if they worked in Dallas, he said. And by age 62, they would make just as much in Atlanta and only slightly less in Chicago, he found. (The other cities were chosen to represent other regions of the country.)
 ''My reaction when I computed these for the first time was, 'Gee that's got to be a fluke,' '' Mr. Braconi said in an interview. But upon further review, he said, he found a clear pattern of the wage gap closing as careers wore on.
 ''People in their 20s and 30s make considerably more money in New York at any given level of education than they do elsewhere,'' Mr. Braconi said. ''That's something we all kind of knew -- that there's a New York premium. What I certainly wasn't aware of is that it appears that the earnings differential ended later in the career.''
 The pattern has become more pronounced over time. He found that New Yorkers in 2008 were still earning significantly more sooner, but that their incomes were dropping off sooner and faster than they had been in 1990 and even in 2000.
 That finding also momentarily surprised Bernard Weinstein, an economist with the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University. But he noted that the trend fit with his personal experience since he left New York City for Dallas in the mid-1970s.
 ''The New York metro area is always sucking people in and spitting them out,'' said Mr. Weinstein, whose daughter works for an advertising agency in Manhattan. ''I've watched this cycle of all these kids moving to New York and 10 years later moving back to Dallas. You discover that you can find employment in Dallas or Atlanta at a roughly comparable salary, but in real terms it's a boost because the cost of living is much lower.''
 For women with college degrees, spending their entire careers in New York appears to be a more rewarding choice. Mr. Braconi found that, among women, the premium for working in New York is even larger and, although it also shrinks over time, it never disappears. Educated women in New York earn more than their counterparts in Dallas, Atlanta and Chicago throughout their lifetimes, he found.
 For an explanation, Mr. Braconi turned to Wall Street, a frequent suspect. But he said the pattern held even without the investment bankers and traders, who earn big salaries and bonuses early on and often retire rich before their hair turns gray. The notion that New Yorkers generally quit working earlier also did not appear to explain the disparities.
 He said more investigation would be required to determine if more pronounced age discrimination in New York was a cause. But, whatever the reasons, he said, the pattern could have significant public policy implications for the city at a time when baby boomers are on the downward slope of their earnings curves and many middle-age New Yorkers have lost their jobs and are taking longer than ever to find new ones.
 ''It may become a more well-known and troublesome kind of circumstance,'' Mr. Braconi said.
 Women in the metropolitan area might be more troubled by the wide gender gap in earnings. The study found that men between the ages of 43 and 47 were nearly twice as likely as women of the same age to be making more than $100,000 a year and three times as likely to have annual income of more than $250,000. More than half of all women in that age group in the region were making less than $40,000 a year, compared with about 40 percent of the men.
 That divergence may result from institutional barriers to the advancement of women, Mr. Braconi said, but it cannot be explained by men having more education.
 ''None of it can be accounted for by education because women now are better educated than men,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Poorer Nations Get Larger Role in World Bank

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of the World Bank agreed on Sunday to support a $5.1 billion increase in its operating capital, the largest increase in general financing since 1988, and to give developing economies a greater say in running the antipoverty institution. 
 Under the changes, China will become the bank's third-largest shareholder, ahead of Germany, after the United States and Japan. Countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Vietnam will also have greater representation. 
 ''We are grateful to our shareholding countries for this strong vote of confidence,'' the bank's president, Robert B. Zoellick, said at the conclusion of the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
 The bank's 186 members also agreed to support a reform package that calls for greater openness and disclosure of information and improvements in managing risks and measuring results.
 The World Bank has made $105 billion in financial commitments since July 2008 in response to the global economic turmoil. The new capital in essence allows the World Bank to maintain its programs at their level before the crisis.
 ''We could start to see this last year, at the time of our annual meeting, that unless we could get additional capital infusion, we wouldn't be able to continue this high lending volume,'' Mr. Zoellick said in an interview on Friday. ''And indeed, even coming out of the crisis, we would be in a position where we'd have to come back below precrisis levels.'' 
 In a Global Monitoring Report, released Friday, the bank reported that the economic crisis had slowed the pace of poverty reduction in developing countries. As a result of the crisis, 53 million more people will remain in extreme poverty by 2015 than otherwise would have, the report found. Even so, the report projected that the number of people in extreme poverty -- defined as living on less than $1.25 a day -- would be 920 million in 2015, a significant decline from the 1.8 billion in 1990. 
 Some developing countries sought a bigger capital increase, as other development banks have received. But the wealthier nations, which are squeezed, resisted such a move. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, said Mr. Zoellick had ''made a strong and compelling case'' for the money that was approved. He pledged to seek Congressional support for the United States' share of the capital increase, $586 million or about $117 million a year for five years. 
 ''For every dollar the United States contributes to paid-in capital for the World Bank, $26 worth of assistance is delivered,'' Mr. Geithner said Sunday. 
 Mr. Zoellick carefully devised the capital increase and voting changes to be adopted together. 
 The $5.1 billion in so-called paid-in capital, which the bank can use for day-to-day operations, will bring the bank's cash on hand to about $40 billion. Of the $5.1 billion, developing countries will contribute $1.6 billion in connection with a shift in representation that will give them 47.19 percent of voting power, up from 44.06 percent. The actions fulfill a pledge the bank's members made in Istanbul in October.
 In 2008, the bank's members approved a smaller shift of 1.46 percent of voting power to the developing countries from the wealthy ones and added a 25th seat on the bank's governing board, raising to three the number of seats for sub-Saharan Africa. 
 All told, the cumulative shift of 4.59 percent of voting power amounts to the greatest realignment in representation at the World Bank since 1988. 
 ''As the developing countries gain more shares, they have to pay for them,'' Mr. Zoellick said in the interview. ''Part of the good story here is a burden-sharing story.''
 The bank's members approved on Sunday an $86.2 billion general capital increase, bringing the bank's total subscribed capital, not counting about $26 billion in reserves, to $276.1 billion. But except for the $5.1 billion, that new money is ''callable capital,'' which resides with the member countries but can be drawn upon in an emergency. (The bank has never had to do so.) The callable capital lets the bank enjoy a top-notch credit rating and borrow at favorable rates. All but roughly $40 billion of the $276.1 billion is callable.
 The bank's members said it should redouble its focus on helping the poor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa; invest in agriculture and infrastructure; promote global ''collective action'' on climate change, trade and other priorities; combat corruption; and prepare for crises. 
 Mr. Zoellick, who served as the United States trade representative and then as deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said in the interview that the less wealthy countries were leading the global economic recovery, while the United States, Europe and Japan had rebounded more slowly. 
 ''A lot of growth is coming from the developing world, and so the financing we do in the developing world is now beyond charity and social solidarity -- it's a question of self-interest,'' he said. ''They have become sources of demand.''

HEADLINE: After 15 Months in Office, Policy vs. Politics for Obama

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Inside Washington, President Obama is savoring a springtime resurgence: signs of economic recovery, victory on health care, the upper hand in the financial regulation debate.
 Outside Washington, not so much. Polls show the president with job approval ratings of 50 percent or lower, as Democratic strategists brace for a thumping in the midterm elections.
 All of which tracks Mr. Obama's own critique of his first 15 months in office. The young politician who rocketed from nowhere to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on the strength of his personal appeal faults his inability to connect with ordinary Americans, not his ideology or presidential judgment. 
 ''I think the core decisions we've made have been the right ones,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview last week. ''The economy is in a much better place than it would have been if we hadn't made some of those decisions. I think on the foreign policy front, our basic approach has restored America's standing in the world.''
 Sitting for questions in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House, Mr. Obama identified political diplomacy as his greatest shortcoming so far. He contrasted his experience in the Oval Office whirlwind with his ability to control and drive home a message during his campaign.
 ''What I have not done as well as I would have liked to is to consistently communicate to the general public why we're making some of the decisions,'' he said. ''Because we've been so rushed over the course of the last year and a half, just issue after issue and crisis after crisis, we haven't been as effective.'''Unpopular' Decisions
 Politicians often blame struggles on communications. Deploying their megaphone differently is simpler than altering fundamental policy choices.
 In Mr. Obama's case, he has lost ground on a range of issues. A New York Times/CBS News poll this month showed majority or plurality disapproval of his handling of the economy, health care and the budget deficit.
 Mr. Obama faults the frenzied atmosphere surrounding his debut, which led him to help prop up Wall Street and the auto industry amid the risk of another Great Depression.
 ''We had an economy that was crashing,'' he said in the interview. ''We had to make some very fast decisions. Some of those decisions were very unpopular.''
 The president retains significant personal assets as he tries to better market his agenda for fellow Democrats and his own re-election in 2012. In the Times/CBS survey, solid majorities agreed that Mr. Obama understands ''the needs and problems of people like yourself'' and ''shares the values most Americans try to live by.''
 In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in January, 7 in 10 Americans gave him strong marks for ''being easygoing and likable.'' By 51 percent to 30 percent, respondents rated him highly for ''being honest and straightforward.''
 But just 38 percent credited him with sharing their positions on issues. And after the battle over Wall Street regulation, the policy terrain only gets steeper.
 A Bigger Deficit
 Mr. Obama's call for capping carbon emissions pits energy-state Democrats against environmentalists. The decision by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to leave talks on a bipartisan energy bill underscores the difficulty of surmounting a Senate filibuster.
 Immigration legislation could rally Hispanic voters, but also heighten risks for Democrats in competitive races facing defections by white independents. Prospects for enacting a comprehensive bill on immigration are even lower than on energy.
 A looming 2011 deficit-reduction debate poses greater dangers. In the interview, Mr. Obama declined to rule out a broad tax increase - even a European-style value-added tax - notwithstanding his 2008 campaign pledge to spare the middle class.
 ''The thing I didn't anticipate up until a few months before my election,'' he said, ''was the fact that we were going to be in such a deep crisis that I'd be inheriting a $1.3 trillion deficit.''
 Deferring choices until a deficit advisory panel offers recommendations in December, Mr. Obama expressed his commitment to cutting wasteful spending and his preference for protecting average-income earners. ''But at a certain point,'' he concluded, ''what we've got to do is match up money going out and money coming in.''
 To help make his case, he has adapted his strategy by traveling more outside the Beltway.
 ''One of the things we've been trying to do is to say, boy, let's get out of here more often,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Just talk to folks and listen to folks so that people get a better sense - not just that we're making smart decisions, but that we're also hearing them and their voices and what they're going through on a day-to-day basis.''
 Mr. Obama concluded: ''In the White House, you feel like you're in the proverbial bubble. And it's hard to break through.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: From the Mall To the Docks, Positive Signs

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Stephanie Rosenbloom contributed reporting from Paramus, N.J., Ashlee Vance from San Francisco, and Michael Parrish from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- The docks are humming again at this sprawling Pacific port, with clouds of golden dust billowing off the piles of grain spilling into the bellies of giant tankers.
 ''Things are looking up,'' said Dan Broadie, a longshoreman. No longer killing time at the union hall while waiting for work, instead he is guiding a mechanized spout pouring 44,000 tons of wheat into the Arion SB, bound for the Philippines. 
 At malls from New Jersey to California, shoppers are snapping up electronics and furniture, as fears of joblessness yield to exuberance over rising stock prices. Tractor trailers and railroad cars haul swelling quantities of goods through transportation corridors, generating paychecks for truckers and repair crews. 
 On the factory floor, production is expanding, a point underscored by government data released Friday showing a hefty increase in March for orders of long-lasting manufactured items. In apartment towers and on cul-de-sacs, sales of new homes surged in March, climbing by 27 percent, amplifying hopes that a wrenching real estate disaster may finally be releasing its grip on the national economy. 
 After the worst downturn since the Great Depression, signs of recovery are mounting -- albeit tinged with ambiguity. Despite worries that American consumers might hunker down for years -- spooked by debt, lost savings and unemployment -- thriftiness has given way to the outlines of a new shopping spree: households are replacing cars, upgrading home furnishings and amassing gadgets. 
 Many economists estimate that consumer spending -- which makes up some 70 percent of American economic activity -- swelled by 4 percent during the first three months of the year, more than the double the pace once anticipated. Some have nudged upward their estimates for economic growth to more than 3 percent this year.
 ''Consumers are showing extraordinary resilience,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''There's a lot of pent-up demand out there that is now being unleashed. The whole supply chain system is now being revitalized.''
 While few dispute signs of recovery across much of the economy, significant debate remains on how robust and sustained it will be. The lingering effects of the financial crisis have some economists envisioning a long stretch of sluggish growth.
 But recent months have delivered a stream of news bolstering the notion of a more vigorous recovery. Technology companies have racked up substantial sales. After a decade of painful decline, manufacturing is tentatively adding jobs. Retail sales increased by 9.1 percent in March at established stores compared with a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters, marking the seventh consecutive month of growth. Exports swelled in the first two months of the year by nearly 15 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department.
 Still, much of the improvement appears the result of the nearly $800 billion government stimulus program. As that package is largely exhausted late this year, further expansion may hinge on whether consumers keep spending. That probably depends on the job market, which remains weak. 
 ''The recovery is under way, and it's better than expected, but it hasn't become self-sustaining because the job market hasn't developed yet,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I don't think we're there yet.'' 
 In a sign of the anxieties still gnawing at households, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index this month plunged to a preliminary level of 69.5 compared with 73.6 in March.
 Still, even that number represented a substantial gain over the record low of 55.3 reached in November 2008. And many economists dismiss such surveys as indicative of what people think, as opposed to what they do. 
 What they are doing increasingly is shopping. 
 ''I'm certainly interested in spending now that the stock market seems so relaxed,'' said Dan Schrenk, an information technology consultant, as he stood outside a Best Buy store in the Portland suburb of Beaverton.
 Last year, Mr. Schrenk's income declined as local companies put off servicing computer systems. He and his wife cut back on dinners out and purchases.
 But in recent weeks, Mr. Schrenk's stock portfolio has expanded. He has picked up five new clients. 
 ''I'm feeling very optimistic,'' he said. ''People are just far more interested in spending money.''
 So, there he was, shopping for an iPad.
 On the other side of the country, at the Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, N.J., Marie Bauer, who sells clothing for a living, was feeling similarly emboldened.
 ''I'm working more now,'' she said. ''I bought myself a watch.''
 As John D. Morris, a retail analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wandered past stores like Gap and J. Crew on his weekly ''mall check,'' he spotted large numbers of women 25 to 45 years of age -- prime earning years.
 ''The mainstay of the mall is back,'' he said. ''That's your signal that we're in a more meaningful recovery with staying power.''
 A year ago, Columbia Sportswear, the Portland-based apparel brand, was turning away some retail customers whose finances seemed worrisome. Now, Columbia has one of its largest order backlogs.
 ''People saw that the world didn't come to an end,'' said Timothy P. Boyle, Columbia's president and chief executive. ''Maybe they just said, 'Hey, I can at least spend a little bit of money.' ''
 Spending power has been enhanced by a monumental reduction in household debt, which has shrunk by about $600 billion since the fall of 2008, according to Equifax credit data analyzed by Economy.com. That amounts to about $6,300 a household. 
 ''Household deleveraging is clearing the decks for better consumer spending going forward,'' said Mr. Zandi. Still, some economists note that many consumers are reaching into savings to finance spending, suggesting consumption could run out of fuel. 
 ''Look at employment and income,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist at the economic analysis firm, IHS Global Insight. ''It's glacial. If we don't get strong growth in employment and income, we're really just building this up as a house of cards.''
 The American savings rate climbed during the recession but has recently fallen. Among households in the top fifth of American incomes -- those earning $98,000 a year and up -- the savings rate dropped to 2 percent of income in the first half of 2007 and then spiked above 14 percent by the middle of 2008, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Economy.com. By the end of last year, the savings rate of this group had slipped back to 3.5 percent.
 Since the end of World War II, the first year after a recession tends to feature growth at roughly twice the pace of the decline during the downturn, implying a current pace exceeding 7 percent. Yet even optimistic economists assume the economy is growing at perhaps half that rate.
 ''I keep calling it a half-speed recovery, not the full-speed-ahead recovery that we typically get after deep, prolonged recessions,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
 But at a Porsche dealership in downtown Los Angeles, the sales manager, Victor Ghassemi, has seen sales rise by about 5 percent in recent weeks, a trend he attributes to rising stock portfolios.
 ''People get tired of holding on to their money, or just sitting at home and not doing anything,'' he said. ''People love to shop. And you take that privilege away from somebody, it lasts about a year. Eventually, people want to come back. They want to buy new merchandise, a new product, to make them feel really good about themselves.''
 The key question is whether this burst of consumption will prompt businesses to hire, adding paychecks needed to amplify economic growth and replace the eight million net jobs lost in the course of the recession.
 Optimists suggest this is already unfolding, pointing to the addition of 162,000 net jobs in March, the biggest surge of hiring in over two years. In this view, job growth amounts to a corrective after excessive layoffs during the worst of the crisis.
 ''You didn't fire people because you had a judicious plan about how to run your company,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG. ''You fired pell-mell, because you were afraid you were going to lose access to credit.''
 Now, he argues, companies are guided by a new anxiety that demands hiring: fear of missing out on the profits of fresh growth. 
 Still to come, he added, is a wave of spending from American businesses.
 ''They are awash in cash,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''They're in a position to step up spending across the board.''
 Technology companies are already benefiting from strong consumer growth. Sales of PCs rose more than 5 percent last year, trumping analysts' predictions of double-digit declines. 
 This month, Intel, the world's largest chip maker, reported its highest first-quarter revenue in history. Google added about 800 jobs over the first three months of this year, and Amazon has added 1,800. Intel plans to hire 1,000 to 2,000 employees this year.
 Silicon Valley is already cashing in on the return of Wall Street, as trading houses fold profits into new high-speed computer systems aimed at securing a competitive edge.
 Global trade holds promise. At the Port of Portland -- a major shipping point for commodities harvested as far east as the Great Plains -- the tonnage of goods swelled by 42 percent during the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier. Minerals like soda ash -- an important industrial ingredient to make glass and detergent -- increased by 93 percent.
 Activity here and at ports along the Pacific coast is generating business through related industries. Rail freight traffic was up nearly 8 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the Association of American Railroads. That has bolstered revenue for Greenbrier, a Portland-based maker of rail cars that was hard hit during the recession.
 At Diversified Services Inc., a truck repair business in Mira Loma, Calif., general manager Dave Pilarcik is contemplating hiring, as customers put their fleets back on the road.
 ''For the first time in a long time,'' he said, ''I've seen a little bit more movement.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Extradition Effort Strains Relationship With Jamaica

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY. 
Earlier versions of this article reported that the Jamaican government said it had been involved in the hiring of an American law firm. The government actually said it had not been involved. Earlier versions also mistakenly referred to Peter Phillips as Mr. Peters.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Christopher Coke's nicknames are numerous: General, President, Shortman, Dudus. But the one that American law enforcement officials say sums up his illicit activities best of all is simply Mr. Coke.
 Mr. Coke, 41, is accused of running a major cocaine and marijuana trafficking operation from one of the most rugged neighborhoods in Kingston, Jamaica, according to American law enforcement officials and a federal indictment unsealed last year. Proceeds from drug sales in New York and other major American cities have been used to funnel guns and cash from the United States back to a wharf that Mr. Coke controls adjacent to Tivoli Gardens, his stronghold on the west side of the Jamaican capital, the authorities say.
 No run-of-the-mill wanted man, Mr. Coke is also a powerful player in Jamaican politics, so much so that the State Department's attempt to extradite him has rattled relations between the United States and Jamaica. Mr. Coke is so influential that intermediaries managed to seek a resolution of his legal predicament directly with top aides to President Obama. 
 Jamaica has extradited many criminal suspects to the United States, 15 of them last year alone. But the United States' effort to extradite Mr. Coke in August created a dilemma for the governing Jamaica Labour Party and particularly the prime minister, Bruce Golding, who represents Tivoli Gardens in Parliament.
 Both of Jamaica's political parties have fostered ties with neighborhood gangs, who turn out the vote in exchange for political favors. Mr. Coke and his Shower Posse are linked with the Labour Party, according to American and Jamaican officials. The State Department has suggested that it is Mr. Coke's influence with top ruling party politicians that is impeding his extradition.
 ''Jamaica's delay in processing the U.S. extradition request for a major suspected drug and firearms trafficker with reported ties to the ruling party highlights the potential depth of corruption in the government,'' said a State Department counternarcotics report released in March.
 The Jamaican government is battling back. Mr. Golding has called the American extradition request flawed because the wiretapping of Mr. Coke by the Jamaican authorities that was the basis for the indictment was passed from a Jamaican police constable to the American government without proper approval. The Jamaican government has demanded that the Americans name the officer so they can charge him.
 Mr. Coke's lawyer, Tom Tavares-Finson, who is also a senator representing the governing party, is dismissive of the case against Mr. Coke, whom he describes as a father, legitimate businessman and community leader, not a hardened gang leader.
 ''I could not extradite a dog from the United States on this evidence,'' Mr. Tavares-Finson said. ''All his business enterprises are subject to the scrutiny of the Jamaican government. This is not some banana republic beyond the woebegone.''
 As for whether Mr. Coke has run afoul of the law in the past, Mr. Tavares-Finson said that, at most, he might have been arrested for smoking marijuana as a child. ''I have represented him for many years, and I have no knowledge of him having any criminal convictions in Jamaica,'' he said.
 Anxious to show that the government is not shielding fugitives, Mr. Golding has criticized the United States as not doing enough to quell the illegal trade in firearms into Jamaica. He has also proposed initiatives to control gangs and reduce crime. Last year, Jamaica had its bloodiest year on record, with 1,672 murders.
 Mr. Coke's legal fix harkens back to a similar case involving his father, Lester Coke. Known as Jim Brown, he was a leader of the Shower Posse, which was blamed in the 1980s for trafficking in drugs and killing those who got in its way. The United States had sought to extradite Lester Coke to face narcotics and murder charges, but he died in a mysterious fire in his prison cell in 1992 before he was flown away.
 Marching at Lester Coke's funeral was none other than Edward Seaga, the longtime Jamaican prime minister who was head of the Jamaica Labour Party, which was in the opposition at the time. The son has shown that his political might is just as strong.
 Last fall, a politically influential Jamaican lawyer, Harold Brady, hired on behalf of the Jamaican government the American law firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips to discuss ''political and economic matters'' with members of the Obama administration, according to documents filed with the Justice Department. Meetings were held with top White House and State Department officials.
 But after the controversy over the Coke extradition exploded, the Jamaican government said it had not been involved in the hiring of Manatt. The firm quickly canceled the contract. ''The firm was never employed by or did work for Christopher Coke,'' Monte M. Lemann, Manatt's general counsel, said in a statement. Peter Phillips, a lawmaker for the opposition People's National Party and the former national security minister, is pressing the government to clarify who exactly hired Manatt. ''It seems at minimum that the government of Jamaica lent their name to an effort to represent the interests of an accused person,'' Mr. Phillips said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Monday about an American effort to extradite a Jamaican political power broker to face charges of cocaine and marijuana trafficking misstated the Jamaican government's connection to the hiring of an American law firm that held meetings on the issue with White House and State Department officials. The Jamaican government said it had not been involved in the hiring of the firm, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips -- not that it had been involved. Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly at one point to Peter Phillips, an opposition lawmaker who pressed for the Jamaican government to clarify who had hired the firm. It was Mr. Phillips -- not ''Mr. Peters'' -- who said, ''It seems at minimum that the government of Jamaica lent their name to an effort to represent the interests of an accused person.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing Our Way to Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID A. PATERSON. 
David A. Paterson is the governor of New York.

DATELINE: Albany 

 BODY:
 NEW YORK'S financial problems are not overly complicated. The state is on track to spend a staggering $60 billion more than it receives in recurring revenues over the next four years. Simple arithmetic explains how we got to this point: Our expenses are consistently exceeding our income. We are headed off a financial cliff. 
 Anyone who has ever managed a household budget or a small business knows that there are only two ways to correct that kind of unsustainable budget imbalance: Cut spending or increase revenues. Borrowing accomplishes neither of those goals. It only imposes a burden on future generations without a corresponding benefit.
 Borrowing solves nothing.
 Unfortunately, that fact has been lost during the recent debate in the Legislature about how to eliminate our state's $9.2 billion current-year budget gap. 
 Borrowing may make the lives of Albany politicians easier. It may delay our inevitable day of fiscal reckoning past one more November election. But borrowing to help close our budget deficit, by itself, does not do a single thing to help improve our long-term fiscal condition. In fact, it makes an already bad situation worse. And it violates virtually every principle of responsible budgeting.
 Typically, when the state borrows money, it does so to build a long-term capital asset, like a highway or a hospital, that will provide a benefit to its citizens for decades to come. 
 By contrast, borrowing to finance the day-to-day cost of running state government is like getting a bank loan to buy your groceries. Or adding a new coat of paint to your house when the real problem is that your foundation is crumbling. It just papers over the problem.
 So we must not let discussions about borrowing distract us from addressing the root cause of our fiscal difficulties -- years of overspending. Confronting that structural budget imbalance between expenditures and revenues is the core objective of Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch's fiscal rescue plan, even though many have sought to focus solely on the plan's provision for borrowing over the next three years as a last resort. 
 Remember that every single dollar the state borrows has to be paid back with interest. Issuing bonds to help close our deficit would mean giving every New Yorker an extra tax burden -- a dysfunction tax -- for years to come. That would be on top of the nearly $6 billion that taxpayers already pay our creditors each year for the often irresponsible borrowings of the past, leaving less money to finance education, health care and other vital services.
 Making $2 billion in recurring spending cuts this year would save more than $20 billion over the next 10 years. Borrowing $2 billion would end up costing taxpayers about $2.5 billion over the same period.
 Let me be clear. I will not entertain a discussion on borrowing while the state continues to spend beyond its means. More cuts are needed before we can finalize this year's budget. 
 Those of us in Albany were elected to make difficult decisions. This may be hard in the short term, but it is the only responsible path forward if we want to emerge from this crisis and build toward a strong fiscal and economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Accounts, People and Miscellany

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Accounts
 Matrixx Initiatives, Scottsdale, Ariz., expanded its relationship with Cramer-Krasselt by awarding the agency's Chicago headquarters the duties to handle media buying for Zicam, the over-the-counter cold remedy. The assignment, with spending for 2010 estimated to reach $50 million, had been handled by Initiative, part of the Mediabrands unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The Phoenix office of Cramer-Krasselt was named in January to handle the creative duties for Zicam, which had been handled by another Interpublic agency, Lowe & Partners Worldwide, New York; Lowe resigned the assignment when it was merged with the Deutsch unit of Interpublic because of a conflict between Zicam and Tylenol creative assignments handled by Deutsch. 
 Minnesota State Lottery selected Olson, Minneapolis, as agency of record after a mandated review that takes place every three years. The assignment, with spending estimated at $7 million to $10 million a year, is for three years. The previous agency, which handled the assignment for six years, was Colle & McVoy, Minneapolis, part of MDC Partners. 
 OhioHealth, Columbus, Ohio, a health care system in central Ohio, consolidated its account and awarded it to Doner, Southfield, Mich., to handle assignments like creative work, digital ads and media planning and buying. Spending was not disclosed. Agencies that OhioHealth previously used included three based in Columbus: Engauge, Fahlgren and SBC Advertising.
 CMT, New York, part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom, chose Media Storm, New York and South Norwalk, Conn., to handle its media planning and buying duties, which had been handled by JL Media, Union, N.J. Spending was not disclosed.
 NBC Entertainment, Burbank, Calif., part of the NBC Universal unit of General Electric, selected Pitch, Culver City, Calif., as promotions agency of record, to help NBC introduce its programming for the 2010-11 season. Spending has not been determined.
 People
 John Taylor, director for client service at ZenithOptimedia, London, part of the Publicis Groupe, was promoted to a new post, worldwide chairman. Steve King continues as global chief executive.
 Steve Harding, chief executive for the Europe, Asia and Middle East operations of OgilvyAction, part of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of WPP, was promoted to chief executive at OgilvyAction. He had been one of five members of a management team who were sharing the running of the agency.
 Conway Williamson will join the New York office of Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, as chief creative officer. He will succeed Gerry Graf, who announced two weeks ago that he would leave to start an agency of his own. Mr. Williamson, known as Con, had been chief creative officer at the New York office of Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas; AdAge.com and Adweek.com had previously reported that Mr. Williamson was likely to be chosen to replace Mr. Graf.
 Will Schenck joined the Fairchild Fashion Group, New York, as vice president and chief revenue officer. He succeeds Lisa Howard, who left to join e5 Global Media, New York, as publisher of Billboard. Mr. Schenck had been publisher at Rolling Stone magazine, New York, part of Wenner Media. The Fairchild Fashion Group is part of the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance Publications.
 Miscellany
 WPP is forming a corporate trading division, the Midas Exchange, which will operate as part of its GroupM unit. The Midas Exchange will join the growing field of agencies that handle barter media, which involves the trading of merchandise and products for unsold commercial time and advertising space.

HEADLINE: Pulling the Reins (a Bit) on Hefty Salaries for Cultural Executives

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN and KATE TAYLOR; Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For years chief executives at many major cultural organizations in New York City enjoyed salary growth that was buoyed by a booming economy and rivaled that seen in corporate America. Compensation increases of 25 percent to 50 percent over five years were not unusual, and in some cases packages nearly doubled.
 Reynold Levy's annual compensation to run Lincoln Center topped $1 million. Carnegie Hall began paying Clive Gillinson more than $800,000. Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, earned $2.7 million in the year that ended in June 2008, including several one-time bonuses and the cost of his apartment in the tower beside the museum.
 But in the past 18 months these cultural executives and many others have frozen their salaries or taken cuts as arts budgets have shrunk. Mr. Lowry, for example, has twice agreed to salary reductions, and last year he received a package worth roughly half of what he took in during 2008. 
 ''Most people in senior leadership roles at cultural institutions are at or below where they were in 2008,'' said Jennifer Bol, a consultant at Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm. ''Growth in these compensation levels really stopped.''
 At the Metropolitan Opera the general manager, Peter Gelb, cut his $1.5 million compensation twice starting in December 2008 in response to declining donations, ticket sales and endowment, and recognizing that the opera's budget would have to shrink across the board.
 ''An example had to be set,'' said Mr. Gelb, whose compensation is now $1.3 million. ''As the head of the institution, I felt it necessary that it begin with me.''
 The New York Times surveyed dozens of arts organizations in New York City and elsewhere in the country, reviewed their federal income tax returns, and interviewed many of their managers and several leading compensation experts to evaluate how executive salaries have fared in the tumult of the recent recession.
 Those interviewed generally said any reductions were primarily a response to economic forces. But several noted the increased scrutiny these days of all nonprofit spending. The Internal Revenue Service guidelines are tighter this year; the charitable tax return was overhauled beginning with the 2009 filings, and arts organizations are increasingly being asked to validate the reasonableness of what their executives earn.
 ''We have made governance a much more formal topic,'' said Alan H. Fishman, chairman of the Brooklyn Academy Music, where the top people had their salaries frozen last year. ''The times demand it. Our board demands it.''
 Maxwell L. Anderson, a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, writes in the March-April issue of Museum magazine that the new tax-return form for charitable groups ''effectively stripped away the fig leaves of our cultural executives.''
 ''It is a foregone conclusion that excessive compensation and first-class travel will need convincing explanations from here on out,'' writes Mr. Anderson, who now runs the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
 Certain events also have drawn public attention to cultural compensation in recent years. Lawrence M. Small departed the Smithsonian Institution in 2007 amid revelations that he had spent its money on chauffeured cars, private jets and catered meals. The year before, the president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, Barry Munitz, resigned amid an investigation by the California attorney general's office into his travel and expenditures.
 Even after the recent salary jumps, though, cultural executives still generally earn less than their counterparts in the private sector who manage equivalent-sized organizations. Top pay for cultural executives typically runs from $300,000 to $500,000, which can include benefits and allowances. Occasionally institutions will also pay bonuses tied to performance or longevity, like the $3.25 million given in 2006 to Philippe de Montebello to recognize his 30-year service to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Compensation for executives at cultural organizations has long been something of a delicate subject. (A quarter of the groups surveyed by The Times declined to provide current salary information.) On the one hand, the executives are often highly educated people running important institutions that face complex problems. But they are also at the helm of nonprofit organizations that depend on the generosity of others and, often, on government support. And, as a group, the leaders are expected to be more concerned with elevated matters of beauty and the spirit.
 ''People who go into these careers are not that interested in money,'' said Jay W. Lorsch, a professor who studies governance issues at Harvard Business School.
 Mr. Gelb said he had earned four times as much as the president of Sony Classical record label before he came to the opera. ''I took this position at the Met not because of the salary to begin with, though I certainly realize my compensation running a nonprofit is on the high end,'' he said. ''But it's the largest performing arts company in the country, if not the world, in terms of budget.''
 Running an art institution can be glamorous, but it can also be grueling work that requires a capacity to manage budgets, buildings, programming, artists, contributors, audiences, trustees and public officials across a day that routinely stretches into nights of performances and donor events.
 Several board chairmen said that if someone can be found who can do all that, and do it well, it pays to retain that person, especially in tough times.
 The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington recently made clear just how much it values its president, Michael M. Kaiser. ''Michael achieved his maximum bonus that was permissible,'' said Stephen A. Schwarzman, the board chairman. ''The performance has been terrific.''
 Donations during Mr. Kaiser's nine years at the Kennedy Center are up 110 percent, Mr. Schwarzman said, and the center has had operating surpluses each year. So on top of his $940,000 salary, Mr. Kaiser earned a $150,000 bonus, as well as other benefits, for 2009. ''It reflects the magnitude of the kind of things he's doing and the competence with which it's being done,'' Mr. Schwarzman said. ''I think you have to tie this stuff with outcomes.''
 Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, where he is involved in setting Mr. Lowry's compensation, said: ''If you are lucky enough to have the best executive in the field, you should compensate the person accordingly. I think oftentimes boards are worried about the implication of a big salary and, frankly, I think that's a mistake, because if you want your organization to be well run, you've got to find the person who can accomplish it.''
 For similar reasons the Metropolitan Museum of Art did not cut the salaries of any of its top executives last year, even as it laid off more than 200 employees. ''We want to keep the best people -- it's very simple,'' said James R. Houghton, chairman of the Met board.
 Institutions sometimes try to recruit leaders, and they boost compensation as one of their tools. In 2006 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art lured Michael Govan from the Dia Art Foundation in New York to be its director; a big enticement was a compensation package worth roughly $1 million a year.
 ''He wasn't looking for a job,'' said Eli Broad, the museum's main benefactor. ''We wanted him, and we had to induce him to leave where he was, and the financial package was a major part of that inducement.''
 ''It's a market,'' Mr. Broad continued. ''You've got to be competitive.''
 Cultural organizations also function like teams, though, and several board chairmen said it was essential that chief executives understood the need to lead on the issue of cutting costs.
 Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library who plans to step down in the summer of 2011, enjoyed regular raises through 2008, then volunteered to freeze his pay in December of that year.
 At the Manhattan Theater Club the artistic director, Lynne Meadow, and the executive producer, Barry Grove, each took a 12 percent cut in 2008, according to the club's chairman, Peter J. Solomon.
 ''They're the owners, they're the proprietors, they get it,'' he said. ''Their goal is obviously to stay alive.''
 It is all very much a matter of doing the right thing, said Sarah James, a recruiter at Phillips Oppenheim, an executive search firm. ''People have been laid off,'' she said. ''Nobody wants to come across as inappropriate.''
 In Indianapolis, when his museum was trying to weather the downturn, Mr. Anderson proposed a novel alternative to a straight salary cut that the board accepted: ''I asked the board if it made sense for me to write a check to the museum -- $17,000 to the art museum -- instead of taking a percentage pay cut,'' he said in an interview. ''I could then talk to other donors and say, 'I know it's tight, but I just gave $17,000.' ''
 A chart accompanying the article included outdated information about the compensation package for Zarin Mehta, the president and executive director of the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Mehta's most recent compensation, for fiscal year 2010, is $807,500, which reflects a 5 percent pay cut taken by senior staff members last September. The $2.67 million figure in the chart was for the fiscal year ending in August 2008 and reflected his salary in addition to eight years of accumulated deferred compensation. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about compensation paid to executives of major cultural organizations in New York and some other cities referred incorrectly to pay received recently by executives at the Metropolitan Opera and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The $1.3 million cited for Peter Gelb, general manager of the opera, reflects his total compensation, including salary, benefits and other allowances; it is not just his salary. The salaries for top executives at the Brooklyn Academy were frozen during its last fiscal year, an academy official said. They did not receive modest raises during that period.
 The chart also misstated the year for the salary figures given for Timothy Rub, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art ($450,00) and George Steel, the general manager and artistic director of New York City Opera ($360,000). They are their current salaries, not their 2008 salaries. (Both worked at other organizations in 2008.)

HEADLINE: U.S. ELITE UNITS STEP UP EFFORT IN AFGHAN CITY

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER, HELENE COOPER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Kabul.

 BODY:
This article is by Thom Shanker, Helene Cooper and Richard A. Oppel Jr.
 Small bands of elite American Special Operations forces have been operating with increased intensity for several weeks in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan's largest city, picking up or picking off insurgent leaders to weaken the Taliban in advance of major operations, senior administration and military officials say.
 The looming battle for the spiritual home of the Taliban is shaping up as the pivotal test of President Obama's Afghanistan strategy, including how much the United States can count on the country's leaders and military for support, and whether a possible increase in civilian casualties from heavy fighting will compromise a strategy that depends on winning over the Afghan people. 
 It will follow a first offensive, into the hamlet of Marja, that is showing mixed results. And it will require the United States and its Afghan partners to navigate a battleground that is not only much bigger than Marja but also militarily, politically and culturally more complex. 
 Two months after the Marja offensive, Afghan officials acknowledge that the Taliban have in some ways retaken the momentum there, including killing or beating locals allied with the central government and its American backers. ''We are still waiting to see the outcome in Marja,'' said Shaida Abdali, the deputy Afghan national security adviser. ''If you are planning for operations in Kandahar, you must show success in Marja. You have to be able to point to something. Now you don't have a good example to point to there.''
 The battle for Kandahar has become the make-or-break offensive of the eight-and-half-year war. The question is whether military force, softened with appeals to the local populace, can overcome a culture built on distrust of outsiders, including foreign forces and even neighboring tribes.
 More than a dozen senior military and civilian officials directly involved in the Kandahar operation agreed to discuss the outlines of the offensive on the condition that they not be identified discussing a pending operation. But in general, the military under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the senior American and allied commander, has been willing to talk about operations in advance to try to scare off insurgents and convince the local population that their government and its allies are moving to increase security. 
 Instead of the quick punch that opened the Marja offensive, the operation in Kandahar, a sprawling urban area, is designed to be a slowly rising tide of military action. That is why the opening salvos of the offensive are being carried out in the shadows by Special Operations forces. 
 ''Large numbers of insurgent leadership based in and around Kandahar have been captured or killed,'' said one senior American military officer directly involved in planning the Kandahar offensive. But, he acknowledged, ''it's still a contested battle space.''
 Senior American and allied commanders say the goal is to have very little visible American presence inside Kandahar city itself, with that effort carried by Afghan Army and police units. 
 Stepped up bombings and attacks against foreign contractors, moderate religious leaders and public officials are viewed as proof that Taliban insurgents are trying to send a message to Afghan tribal leaders not to cooperate with the American offensive. Last Monday night, gunmen killed Azizullah Yarmal, the deputy mayor of Kandahar, as he prayed in a mosque in the city. 
 American and NATO officials are not eager to speak publicly about one of their biggest challenges: the effect of the continued presence of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Afghan president's brother and head of the Kandahar provincial council, whose suspected links with drug dealers and insurgents have prompted some Western officials to say that corruption and governance problems have led locals to be more accepting of the Taliban.
 And while allied officials say they will be relying heavily on Afghan forces to take the lead in securing the city, that same tactic has so far produced mixed success in Marja, where Marine Corps officers said they ended up doing much of the hard fighting. 
 To shape the arrangement of allied forces ahead of the fight, conventional troops have begun operations outside of Kandahar, in a series of provincial districts that ring the city. American and allied officers predict heavy pockets of fighting in those belts. Kandahar, according to a senior military officer, is ''infested'' with insurgents, but not overrun as was Marja. 
 The plan has echoes of the troop ''surge'' in Iraq, when additional American forces were sent to attack the insurgents who were operating in the belts outside the Iraqi capital, planning attacks, constructing roadside bombs and launching assaults.
 Other similarities to Iraq include the plans to woo local tribal leaders in and around Kandahar, similar to the way soldiers and Marines in Anbar Province courted the tribal Sunni sheiks in Iraq to fight insurgents. The United States and its allies in the Afghan government will try to unite local tribal leaders in and around Kandahar to turn in Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. As in Iraq, officials said, the strategy will include monetary incentives in the form of economic development money for local leaders and tribal officials who support the government's security efforts.
 As the military pace increases, the centerpiece of the offensive's political effort will be a series of ''shuras'' -- Afghan-style town hall meetings between tribal leaders and government officials to try to convince locals that they will get a better deal from the government than from Taliban administration. The aim of the shuras, said Mark Sedwill, the senior NATO civilian in Afghanistan, will be ''firstly to get their support for security operations to go ahead, and secondly, to identify their needs for security, governance and development.''
 The next step after the security operations and the shuras will be to roll out squads of Afghan civil administrators with Western advisers, who, in theory, will try to bring government services and resources to districts. This may be the most difficult hurdle, since there are doubts among Western officials about the ability of the Afghan government to supply an ample number of effective and qualified civil administrators.
 Rather than civil assistance, many residents fear only military action. Already in Kandahar, many locals view Afghan and NATO checkpoints and convoys as great a danger on the roads as Taliban bombs and checkpoints. 
 ''Instead of bringing people close to the government,'' cautioned Haji Mukhtar, a Kandahar Provincial Council member, more combat ''will cause people to stay further from the government and hate the foreigners more.''
 While the overt parts of the Kandahar offensive will begin in coming weeks -- several dozen platoon and company-size outposts for American and allied forces have already been constructed in recent weeks along the approaches to Kandahar -- military officials warn that securing the city could take months. Military commanders say their goal is to show concrete results by late summer or early fall, in advance of Ramadan and national parliamentary elections. 
 While the officials stressed that they will limit civilian casualties, an increase in operations will put more residents in the cross-fire. The fighting already under way in the province is putting at risk the sharp drop in civilian casualties that followed General McChrystal's orders to strenuously avoid them. Recent episodes of civilian casualties, including an attack on a bus, have undermined trust for NATO operations.
 Officers already are also preparing for a spike in attacks with improvised explosives. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has traveled to NATO capitals to offer allies access to American-made armored transport vehicles and a host of technology and surveillance measures to find and defuse roadside bombs.

HEADLINE: A Second Act for Indie Film

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
Only five years ago, the center of the still thriving independent film universe lay behind the green doors of a converted TriBeCa warehouse from which the Weinstein brothers, Bob and Harvey, ran Miramax Films.
 With their possible deal -- negotiations continued through last week -- to join investors in reacquiring Miramax, which they left in 2005, the Weinsteins are again in the middle of something.
 But it is not the business they once ruled.
 For more than a decade, the indie film movement centered in New York flourished, at times almost eclipsing the output of the mainstream Hollywood studios in terms of impact and accolades. But the financial collapse and the credit crisis had a deep impact on all of the movie world, which has responded with fewer expensive releases and safer bets. 
 And that new austerity has decimated the indie film business, ending with the collapse or downsizing of distributors like New Line Cinema, Picturehouse, Warner Independent Pictures, ThinkFilm and Miramax, all in the last few years.
 ''The world is different now,'' Richard Abramowitz, a new-wave film distributor, said last week. While he expressed regard for the Weinsteins, he said of the possible Miramax purchase, ''I don't see it as the kind of game-changer it might have been a few years ago. And I'll probably get chased down the street for saying that.''
 There are, however, signs of life. The struggling indie scene is getting a boost from fleet-footed, penny-pinching guerrilla operations that are trying to resuscitate the business by spending less on production, much less on marketing and embracing all forms of distribution, including the local art house and the laptop. 
 A result has been a flush of energy reminiscent of early days in the 1990s dot-com boom, with a touch of old-fashioned indie-film spirit thrown in.
 ''It reminds me of the early years of Miramax, where you had to be disciplined,'' Harvey Weinstein said. He declined in an interview on Friday to discuss his attempt to buy Miramax in partnership with the investor Ronald W. Burkle. 
 Indie experiments are being closely watched in the business because what happens in Hollywood often first happens in New York City. While many in Los Angeles continue to struggle with the studio system and the emerging intricacies of 3-D, New York has locked on a different challenge: how to wring even the tiniest profit from that enormous investment in smaller movies. 
 According to Mr. Weinstein and others, the New York-centered independent film world faltered largely because companies, flush with cash from a DVD boom that has since played out, put too much money behind too many films for an audience that was never large enough to absorb them in theaters. 
 At his own Weinstein Company, said Mr. Weinstein, the best model for an era of diminished expectations is ''A Single Man.'' 
 That film, written and directed by Tom Ford, took in only $9 million at the domestic box office. But the Weinstein Company acquired the rights for far less and held its promotions in check, rather than spending heavily to chase an audience, and Oscars, as it might have done only two or three years ago. Mr. Weinstein said the film would yield a return both for his company and for its producers. 
 Independent distributors that survived the great shakeout include Focus Features, a Universal Studios unit that is anchored in Manhattan, and Sony Pictures Classics, a specialty film label based in New York that has consistently released about 20 movies a year with a staff of just 25. Along with the survivors, there are some newly established companies, like Apparition. 
 For many of these companies, austerity is a given, and that means looking at digital distribution. 
 At Tribeca Enterprises, a sponsor of its namesake festival, the chief creative officer, Geoffrey Gilmore, in March joined the company's co-founder Jane Rosenthal and others to announce a new distribution unit focused on video-on-demand -- where the dollars are small, but the potential audience is vast. 
 Already, Rainbow Media, which operates IFC Entertainment, is feeding about 120 films a year to cable television systems, while perhaps 50 of those movies are shown in one or more theaters. The company, led by Joshua Sapan, also operates an independent theater complex. 
 Producers cannot recoup their investment from the marginal payout from on-demand showings, but a run on IFC's channels or those of other services brings recognition that helps increasingly entrepreneurial filmmakers make money on DVDs -- from foreign release, sales to airlines and, often, at screenings for political, religious or other groups, often with appearances by the writer, director and cast. 
 ''The business is coming back smarter,'' said Marian Koltai-Levine, a veteran of Fine Line and Picturehouse, who is now a marketing and distribution adviser through Zipline Entertainment. Zipline is one of the so-called garage companies run by alumni of the studios.
 Mr. Abramowitz's company, Abramorama, handles about 20 films a year, on marketing and budgets that are counted more often in tens of thousands of dollars than in tens of millions. Ten days ago, he helped the Producers Distribution Agency, a new company started by John Sloss, the past master at placing films like ''Napoleon Dynamite'' and ''Tadpole'' to older-style indies like Miramax, to bypass the big players by releasing a movie, ''Exit Through the Gift Shop,'' directly to a handful of theaters.
 The film, an eccentric documentary by the elusive street artist Banksy, took in about $391,000 in its first 10 days. Much of that was attracted by a low-cost Web campaign that drew young viewers so new to indie film that a disproportionate number arrived on Friday evening, thinking the movie, like a Banksy prank, was a one-night event.
 The attention surrounding the opening was enough to mark ''Exit'' as a potential winner. The trick will be to expand the theater audience without spending heavily on newspaper ads, a major expense for indie films in the past.
 Producers who routinely spent $12 million on a film five years ago are now being advised by Mr. Sloss and others to keep their budgets to a third of that.
 Thus, ''East Fifth Bliss,'' a romance directed by Michael Knowles, spent last week shooting in New York, with a budget of less than $2 million, a substantial boost from the state's tax incentive program, and a cast that includes Lucy Liu (''Charlie's Angels'') and Michael C. Hall (''Six Feet Under''). 
 For Sri Rao, a one-time Booz Allen Hamilton business consultant who now writes, produces and hopes to direct films from his base in New York and another in Philadelphia, a scaled-down indie world is simply a better place for low-cost operators like him to thrive.
 ''The independent film landscape is so different than it was, this is not the heyday of the '90s,'' said Mr. Rao. His Sri & Company has made a pair of Bollywood-style films, the second of which, ''Badmaash Company,'' is scheduled for release by Yash Raj Films of India next month.
 Mr. Rao's company is lean enough that it has no office at all unless a film is in production.
 ''It's an overhead-free world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Unite On Finance Bill, Pressuring G.O.P.

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; John M. Broder, Sewell Chan, Carl Hulse and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats said Sunday that they had bridged internal party differences and coalesced around a plan to tighten regulation of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that were a major factor in the 2008 economic crisis. 
 The proposed derivatives rules are an important part of the effort to strengthen regulation of the nation's financial system, and seem certain to anger some of Wall Street's biggest players. 
 The agreement among Democrats would combine overlapping proposals on derivatives by the banking and agriculture committees, and it raised the pressure on Senate Republicans, who said that they were still fighting for changes to the bill and planned to block the start of floor debate in a first procedural vote on Monday. 
 The desire by Senate Democrats to move quickly on the regulatory bill gained new urgency over the weekend, as party leaders said they would try to squeeze major immigration and energy bills onto a tight Congressional calendar, which will include efforts to pass a budget and the confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice. 
 Democrats had been divided over whether to tackle immigration this year, but they were galvanized last week by a tough new law in Arizona that many Democrats view as draconian. 
 But their new resolve has caused some tumult on Capitol Hill. Over the weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that if the Senate gave priority to the immigration measure, he would withdraw his support for a bill on climate change and energy, of which he is a main sponsor and partner with Democrats.
 Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, praised Mr. Graham's efforts at collaboration, in a sign that Democrats hoped to regain Mr. Graham's support.
 ''Everyone knows of Lindsey and my friendship and his serious efforts at solving the nation's challenges,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''Any Republican who tries bipartisanship faces political peril.'' He added: ''Their party's activists are all about opposition at all costs. This is not about what comes first.'' 
 Officials said the Democratic plan on derivatives included many tougher provisions put forward by Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas and chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, including one that is fiercely opposed by major banks because it would force them to spin off much of their derivatives business. The rules say any bank dealing in swaps, a popular and lucrative derivative, would be barred from the Federal Reserve's emergency borrowing window and also from federal deposit insurance.
 The agreement underscored the rising confidence among Democrats and the Obama administration that Senate Republicans could not hold ranks against the bill for much longer, given the high-stakes election year and the widespread public outrage at Wall Street. 
 Officials from Goldman Sachs, including its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, are scheduled to testify at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday. Regulators have accused Goldman of fraud, and Democrats plan to spotlight some of Wall Street's questionable business dealings and explore the company's role in the financial collapse. 
 Given the climate, both Republicans and Democrats have said they eventually expect Congress to approve the most sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system since the aftermath of the Great Depression, and new rules bringing greater transparency to the trading of derivatives are one of the bill's more crucial components. But final passage of the measure would come later rather than sooner if Republicans have their way. Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama said on Sunday that his party was still prepared to block debate of the bill as he fought for additional changes, including what he described as tight guarantees against future taxpayer bailouts of banks. 
 Mr. Shelby said that he was hopeful the two sides would reach an agreement but that he thought it unlikely that it would happen before the Monday vote. ''Will we get a bill by tomorrow? I doubt it,'' Mr. Shelby said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' But he added, ''I think we will get a bill.'' 
 Told that the two sides seemed close, Mr. Shelby said it wasn't clear. ''Inches sometimes are miles,'' he said.
 Mr. Shelby, and the banking committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who appeared together on the show, are scheduled to meet Monday afternoon. And some officials held out hope of a last-minute deal to move forward with floor debate.
 The agreement on derivatives was reached by Mr. Dodd and Ms. Lincoln. Both had called for most derivatives contracts to be traded on a public exchange and to be processed, or cleared, through a third party. 
 Each committee has some jurisdiction, the agriculture panel because it oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Treasury Department officials were also involved in the negotiations. 
 Some Republicans also support tighter derivatives rules. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, voted with Democrats in favor of the agriculture committee plan. And on Friday Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, signed a letter to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, urging him to include the agriculture panel's rules in the bill.
 With the work days between now and the November election melting away, Senate Democrats also hope to take up major energy legislation. The House approved such a bill last year. 
 But lawmakers are also scheduled to consider a budget and 13 annual spending bills and conduct a Supreme Court confirmation, making for a very challenging legislative environment in an already polarized election year.
 ''We've got a lot of work left on our plate between now and the end of the summer,'' Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said on CNN's ''State of the Union.'' ''I'm not sure where you find the time to deal with these other major issues.'' 
 Mr. Reid has accused Republicans of stalling the financial regulatory bill even though they support most of it.
 He has insisted that the Senate can take up immigration and energy bills despite the warnings from Mr. Graham that he would withdraw his support. 
 Mr. Graham found himself caught between his longtime interest in pursuing bipartisan cooperation on tough issues and pressure from the Republican leaders and the business community to oppose the Democrats' agenda.
 Other Democrats said that on immigration, Mr. Graham also appeared determined to prevent a legislative fight from becoming a factor in the Republican primary race of Senator John McCain of Arizona, his close friend. In that election, set for Aug. 24, Mr. McCain faces a challenge from former Representative J. D. Hayworth, a conservative. 
 Mr. Graham said he would pull out of the effort on energy if Democrats tried to push ahead first on immigration. 
 Mr. Reid has not made any firm decisions on which issue to address first, his spokesman, Jim Manley, said. ''The goal is to put together a bill you can take to the floor that enjoys broad bipartisan support,'' Mr. Manley said. ''The actions by Senator Graham are not going to help things. It's ridiculous to suggest you can only do one or the other.'' 
 Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that has been deeply involved with the energy bill, said that it was the duty of Mr. Reid and President Obama to get the effort back on track. 
 ''You can't get to 60 without leadership from the White House and Harry Reid's office,'' he said.

HEADLINE: W. Willard Wirtz , Labor Chief, Dies at 98

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
W. Willard Wirtz, an outspoken champion of the unemployed who was secretary of labor under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and was the last surviving member of the Kennedy cabinet, died on Saturday. He was 98.
 He died of natural causes at his home in Washington, his son Philip said. 
 An unabashed liberal who was labor secretary from 1962 to 1969, Mr. Wirtz expanded job-training programs, increased unemployment assistance for those who lost jobs to foreign trade, created literacy programs for workers and criticized construction unions' bias against blacks.
 His concern about the troubles older workers faced led to the passage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967. To fight unemployment, he proposed, unsuccessfully, changing overtime pay to double pay instead of time-and-a-half to encourage companies to hire more workers instead of heaping overtime on those already employed.
 Inspired by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's concern for the downtrodden, he said in an end-of-year quote in 1963 -- it became the Quotation of the Day in The New York Times -- ''May 1964 be a year when the great majority of Americans who are secure and busy think clearly of the minority who are not.''
 Mr. Wirtz led the Labor Department in an era when the federal government took a more muscular approach to managing the economy and organized labor was far stronger. He vowed not to spend most of his time as secretary intervening to resolve the era's many strikes and threatened strikes. He wanted instead to focus on helping the unemployed, the poor, the victims of discrimination.
 Nonetheless, he was pulled into myriad labor disputes, trying to resolve a New York City newspaper strike, helping head off a strike by machinists at Boeing and helping to resolve a nationwide rail strike.
 The current labor secretary, Hilda L. Solis, said Mr. Wirtz's work in implementing the anti-discrimination laws passed under Johnson helped pave the way for her to become the first Hispanic labor secretary.
 ''As President Johnson's general in the war on poverty, he initiated an array of programs to help at-risk youth, older workers and the hardcore unemployed,'' Ms. Solis said Sunday.
 Mr. Wirtz was nearly forced out when he clashed publicly with Johnson by speaking out against the bombing of North Vietnam. Johnson demanded that he resign in October 1968, but days later the president sent two aides to persuade him to stay, worried that Mr. Wirtz's resignation would embarrass the president and hurt Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic presidential nominee, in that year's election.
 ''For two or three years, I was very close to Lyndon Johnson,'' Mr. Wirtz told National Public Radio in 2008. ''And then in about 1966 or 1967, I began to have a feeling that his Vietnam War program did not make sense and should be stopped and wrote him to that effect. That was the end of the close relationship.''
 William Willard Wirtz was born March 14, 1912, in DeKalb, Ill., the first child of William Wilbur Wirtz and Alfa Bell White Wirtz. He used his middle name to avoid confusion with his father.
 He graduated from Beloit College in 1933 and from Harvard Law School in 1937.
 On Sept. 6, 1936, he married Mary Jane Quisenberry, who became chairwoman of Goodwill Industries in the 1970s. She died in 2002.
 Besides his son Philip, of Washington, he is survived by another son, Richard, of Knoxville, Tenn.; two sisters, Frances Weeks of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Kathryn Gude of McLean, Va.; and three grandchildren.
 After Harvard, Mr. Wirtz spent two years as a law professor at the University of Iowa, hired by Wiley Rutledge, then the dean and later a Supreme Court justice. He then taught law at Northwestern University, where one of his students was John Paul Stevens, later a Supreme Court justice.
 In World War II, he was assistant general counsel for the Board of Economic Welfare and later worked for the War Labor Board.
 He became an adviser and speechwriter to Adlai E. Stevenson, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956. In 1957, he became a partner in the Chicago law firm Stevenson, Rifkind & Wirtz.
 From 1946 to 1961, he often worked as a mediator and arbitrator. He became under secretary of labor in January 1961 and was appointed secretary in September 1962, the day after Kennedy nominated his predecessor, Arthur Goldberg, to the Supreme Court.
 After leaving government, Mr. Wirtz opened an office in Washington, doing some arbitration, becoming a trustee of the troubled Penn Central railroad and becoming president of the Manpower Institute, which pushed labor, industry and government to resolve workplace problems.
 In trying to help the nation's workers more than four decades ago, Mr. Wirtz faced many of the same challenges officials face today, among them automation and intensified global competition.
 In an article in The New York Times Magazine in November 1962, he recommended an upbeat response to such challenges: ''Tomorrow belongs to those who face the fact of change honestly, squarely, eagerly -- who go forward to meet it -- who see change as an essential quality of growth.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Monday about the former United States labor secretary W. Willard Wirtz misidentified, in some copies, the president who appointed him to that position in 1961. It was John F. Kennedy, not Lyndon B. Johnson. (As the article noted elsewhere, he continued to hold the post after Johnson became president.)

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Living on Brink, And Too Often in the Dark

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Waqar Gillani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LAHORE, Pakistan -- The Taliban may be plotting bombings, and the economy is on the brink. But these days, the single biggest woe tormenting Pakistanis is as basic as an electric light bulb. 
 Pakistan is in the throes of an energy crisis, with Pakistanis now enduring about 12 hours of power cuts a day, a grueling schedule that is melting ice, stopping fans and enraging an already exhausted populace just as the blast furnace of summer gets started.
 In an effort to stem that frustration, Pakistan's government held an emergency meeting last week, bringing together top bureaucrats from across the country. But instead of easing the problem, it aggravated it, ordering power-saving measures that seemed calculated to smother some Pakistanis' last remaining pleasures.
 ''They are playing a joke on us,'' said Amina Ali, the mother of a bride at a wedding hall that was under orders to close early as part of the new energy-saving restrictions. Her brother chimed in: ''The Pakistani people are a toy in the hands of the government.'' 
 The power failures could prove destabilizing if they go unchecked, analysts said. Pakistan badly needs its economy to expand to make space for its bulging young population, and chronic power cuts work against that.
 It is a concern for the United States, which is trying to help steady Pakistan's wobbly finances and keep its democratically elected government afloat. The Obama administration has pledged about $1 billion for energy over the next five years.
 The crisis is a snarl of unmet responsibilities, and untangling it will not be easy. It has a cast of guilty characters that goes back years: governments that are incapable of planning ahead; bureaucrats who take bribes; even ordinary people who steal about 30 percent of all the power produced. The tribal areas in the west, for example, have no meters and have never paid for power.
 The result is about $2 billion a year in energy that is generated but not paid for. Industry experts said they were skeptical the government had a way to close the growing gap between Pakistan's demand for power and the energy sector's ability to produce it. 
 ''There is nobody in Islamabad who is working on a coherent, integrated plan,'' said one industry executive who asked not to be identified because he did not want to be seen as being critical of the government. ''The discussion just keeps going in circles.''
 Which was why it seemed particularly galling when the government ordered stores to be shut at prime shopping time, 8 p.m., and wedding halls closed by 10. Weddings are important entertainment in Pakistan, and go on late into the night, with dancing, lights and finery.
 ''Should we just sit at home in the darkness and go to sleep?'' sputtered Ms. Ali, waiting outside the Mughal-e-Azam banquet hall, whose owners had been warned the night before that it should be closed by 10 p.m. One of the owners, Moazzam Ilyas, was nervously trying to coax the event along, even though at 9:45, the groom had still not arrived.
 Here in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, the power failures have been disastrous for small businesses. Ali Raza, a printing press owner, has watched his once-prospering label business sag as power cuts bite into printing time, delaying orders and frustrating clients.
 Late last year, he sold two large Swedish presses and fired half his 35-member staff. He has given up much of his upper-middle-class lifestyle, selling his Toyota, quitting his gym and limiting purchases of fruit and meat.
 As his life and business shrink, so does his determination to stay in Pakistan. ''I should move from here before I have nothing,'' he said, sitting in his office next to a blank computer monitor and motionless fan. ''Staying means committing suicide.''
 Poorer Pakistanis have it worse. In Lahore's old city, an ancient warren of narrow streets full of cavelike workshops for metal and leather, the sound of circular saws stops suddenly at 4 p.m. Candles are lighted. The only noise is the tapping of hammers.
 ''There's no income; we are very worried,'' said Mirza Arif Beg, 33, a metal polisher whose family business is collapsing. ''We feel helpless. Should we do crime?''
 Stealing electricity seems to be an option available mostly to those with enough money to afford a bribe. It also might require some relation to the storied meter men, who are paid a pittance but are reported to live well off the proceeds.
 ''They have big houses, big cars,'' said Muhamed E. Baderi, a plastic-tube maker who said he knew a metal-works company that regularly bribed its meter man to reduce its electric bill. ''They know the art of meter tampering.''
 Those who cannot afford to bribe have to pay or face being shut off. Muhamed Faqir, a 45-year-old buffalo farmer with five children, said he had to borrow from relatives to pay $50 in bills after his power was cut for eight days this winter.
 The energy industry was already beginning to spiral when the current government took office in 2008, and to a large extent, the problem is inherited. Even so, the government and President Asif Ali Zardari are the lightning rods for public anger, which has begun to bubble up in the form of protests in some places in Punjab.
 A basement full of cobblers in the old city, when asked to describe where they thought the crisis had come from, could come up with only curse words for their leaders.
 The opposition party, led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has played on that anger, trumpeting the crisis to score political points, analysts said, even though its government's record in the 1990s was no better.
 On Saturday, city government officials marched around Lahore's most important markets at 8 p.m., demanding that merchants shutter their stores. Men with sticks from the local trade union made the final argument for those who were slow to comply.
 ''We want to shop,'' said a woman glaring at the lowered gates of a shoe store. ''People don't get up early, and it's hot. Now I'll have to come back on Monday.''
 The restrictions look menacing, but few believe they will last. Follow-through has never been Pakistan's strong point, and the power-saving measures seemed unlikely to be an exception.
 When the groom finally arrived at the marriage hall, it was after 10 p.m., and Mr. Ilyas looked distressed. A thick river of guests inched into the hall for dinner, which had been ready since 7, as a marching band played behind them in the dark.
 But by 11, no one had come to shut the hall down. A basic truth about Pakistan had been revealed.
 ''It will be like this for 10 days, and after that will go back to the way it was,'' Mr. Ilyas said. ''This is the Pakistani way.''

HEADLINE: Wealth and Tradition Pull Qatar Toward Unhealthy Choices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar -- For such a small country, a finger of sand poking into the Persian Gulf from the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula, Qatar is a land of big numbers.
 It has the second highest per capita gross domestic product in the world and the third largest proven reserves of natural gas. But it also ranks high in some less enviable categories, having among the greatest prevalence of obesity, diabetes and genetic disorders in the world, according to international and local health experts.
 Native Qataris, who number only about 250,000 in a nation of 1.6 million, are suffering serious health problems that relate directly to a privileged lifestyle paid for with the nation's oil wealth, as well as a determination to hold onto social traditions, like having young people marry their cousins.
 ''We're talking serious obesity,'' said Dr. Justin Grantham, a specialist at Qatar's orthopedic and sports medicine hospital involved in a healthy-living pilot program. ''The long-term health consequences will be significant.'' 
 Like other oil-rich nations, Qatar has leaped across decades of development in a short time, leaving behind the physically demanding life of the desert for air-conditioned comfort, servants and fast food.
 While embracing modern conveniences, however, Qataris have also struggled to protect their cultural identity from the forces of globalization. For many here, that has included continuing the practice of marrying within families, even when it predictably produces genetic disorders, like blindness and various mental disabilities.
 ''It's really hard to break traditions,'' said Dr. Hatem El-Shanti, a pediatrician and clinical geneticist who runs a genetics testing center in Doha, the capital. ''It's a tradition carried from one generation to the next.''
 Qataris live in a nation no larger than the state of Connecticut where they are a minority among the more than a million foreign workers lured here for jobs. But their problems are not unique.
 Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia all share similar struggles with obesity, diabetes and genetic disorders, each suffering the side effects of an oil-financed lifestyle and a desire to hold on to traditions.
 Yet, even in this neighborhood, Qatar stands out.
 According to the International Association for the Study of Obesity, Qatar ranks sixth globally for prevalence of obesity and has the highest rate of obesity among boys in the Middle East and North African region. A recent article in the Qatari newspaper Al Watan said that local health experts predicted that within five years, 73 percent of Qatari women and 69 percent of the men would qualify as obese.
 Obesity is considered the most important factor in the development of diabetes and is a prime contributor to many other ailments, like hypertension. The International Diabetes Federation ranks Qatar fifth globally in terms of the proportion of people aged 20 to 79 with diabetes.
 The March of Dimes Foundation, a United States charity that focuses on trying to wipe out birth defects, listed Qatar as 16th globally for the incidence of birth defects per 1,000 live births. The chief cause of the problem in Qatar is consanguineous marriages, experts here said. Saudi Arabia ranked second globally.
 For all of these challenges, and for all of its wealth, Qatar has primarily focused on the treatment of diseases rather than on prevention. 
 Everyone here points to lifestyle and tradition to explain the nation's health crises. While it was once taboo to talk about the problems involved with marrying relatives, they are now talked about openly. There have been some discussions about premarital genetic screening, or genetic testing done at birth. But the tradition is so strong, no one has raised the prospect of curbing it. 
 ''You can't tackle the issue,'' said Moza al-Malki, a family therapist and writer. ''There are some big families, clans, they don't marry outside the family. They won't allow it.''
 The issue of obesity seems to run into the same wall of tradition, health experts here said.
 ''If you don't eat, it's considered a shame, and if you leave someone's home without eating it's a shame,'' said Abdulla al-Naimi, 25, who refers to himself as ''chubby'' but is noticeably overweight. ''Half of my family has diabetes,'' Mr. Naimi said. ''My mother has diabetes. Three cousins younger than me have diabetes. For me, I eat too much and I don't exercise.''
 He is also married to his first cousin.
 And Mr. Naimi happens to be the project director for the Healthy Lifestyle, a fledgling effort to try to shift from treatment to prevention. It is connected to the Qatar Foundation, founded by the emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. Mr. Naimi sees no irony in all this because in Qatari terms, his weight and his choice of a relative as a spouse are the norm, he said.
 He acknowledges that changing attitudes will be a slow process, at best. ''We are trying to change people's habits, just to get them to walk,'' he said, admitting that he himself never finds the time to exercise. 
 Walking is not popular in Qatar's heat. Average high temperatures in June and July are a very humid 106 degrees, and Doha, like many cities in the region, is not built for pedestrians. 
 To make matters worse, people here said that all of their social occasions were defined by eating. Traditional meals usually include rice, clarified butter and lamb. Because people often share large community platters, there is almost no way to keep track of portion size, people here said.
 ''We can't get together and not eat,'' said a 22-year-old Qatari woman who is a member of the Thani royal family. She asked that her name not be used to avoid embarrassing her immediate relatives.
 She said her family was typical. Of seven children, five had weight problems. One brother hit 265 pounds by the time he was 19. A younger brother, who is 10, weighs 125 pounds and is gaining weight so fast that he no longer fits in pants she gave him two months ago.
 She said the typical Qatari student skipped breakfast, then ate a snack and lunch at school. When students return home they are given another lunch, generally a heavy meal of rice and lamb. Later, they snack on cake and tea. And then at night they eat dinner, often fast food that is delivered. 
 ''I eat lunch, then I go visit a friend; I am so full, but they put a table in front of you and keep bringing food,'' she said. ''I cannot eat, but it's an insult.''
 Another more challenging problem, is attitude, said Nelda Nader, a dietician here. ''For the majority,'' she said, ''it is really quite normal to be obese.''

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Posts Strong Profit and Raises Outlook

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Caterpillar reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit Monday and raised its full-year sales forecast above Wall Street estimates, citing an improving global economy, especially in Asia and Latin America. 
 A rebound in most metal prices resulted in firm orders for much of the company's available 2010 production of large mining trucks and large track-type tractors, Caterpillar said. Some of its largest mining vehicles were sold out for the year.
 ''Economic conditions are definitely improving, particularly in the world's developing economies,'' Caterpillar said. But the company cut its outlook for 2010 housing starts in the United States by 20 percent.
 Caterpillar reported a first-quarter profit of $233 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $112 million, or 19 cents a share.
 Stripping out one-time charges, including tax expenses of $90 million related to the recently signed health care legislation, earnings were 50 cents a share, better than the 39 cents expected by analysts.
 Sales, including revenue from Caterpillar's financial services arm, fell 11 percent to $8.23 billion, pulled down by a 28 percent decline in its engine and turbine business. Analysts had forecast $8.84 billion.
 Caterpillar said it now expected a full-year profit of $2.50 to $3.25 a share on sales of $38 billion to $42 billion. The analysts' average estimates are for a profit of $2.69 a share and sales of $37 billion.
 Caterpillar, which laid off nearly 30,000 full-time and contract workers worldwide during the recent downturn, said it had begun adding to its payroll again.

HEADLINE: A Storm Over Arizona and Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration'' (front page, April 24):
 Arizona's new law giving local law enforcement the power to stop and arrest anybody suspected of being in the country illegally is a direct, frustrated response to a broken system.
 The State Legislature has effectively changed the political debate on immigration, making it nastier and meaner. Now it is personal. 
 ''Arrest them all and send them home'' seems to be the law's mantra.
 The law will encourage national discourse on illegal immigration, which on the surface seems to be a positive outcome, forcing the federal government to listen and take action.
 But it is naive to believe that specific groups will not be targeted in the enforcement of the new law. What constitutes probable cause to detain and question someone about his or her legal status? Would speaking Chicano English or having an accent render someone a ''suspected illegal alien''? If so, our country's commitment to diversity is at stake.
 Mauricio Pantoja Claremont, Calif., April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 It is difficult for me to understand how the same political party that considers it to be anti-American meddling when the government gets involved in providing a badly needed service like health care has now pressured the governor of Arizona into signing a law that requires people (or some people) to carry identity papers.
 Whenever I am abroad, I find the idea that the police can stop me at any time and demand identity papers to be very oppressive, and I am reminded to be grateful for our own freedom from such laws. I can't believe we could let this freedom slip away so lightly.
 Andrea Gara Mount Kisco, N.Y., April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As a 20-year resident of Arizona, I am appalled and embarrassed by the new anti-immigrant law. It is the latest in a series of Arizona laws that have historical parallels with measures enacted by other societies to make life as difficult as possible for despised minorities.
 As I looked at my Arizona license plate today, it occurred to me that ''Arizona: The Grand Canyon State'' no longer communicates what the state is about. ''Arizona: The Hate State'' says it better.
 Len Borucki Mesa, Ariz., April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''Come Back, John McCain'' (editorial, April 23) says that Arizona's new immigration enforcement law plays ''the rancid, dangerous game of portraying Latinos as criminals.'' Actually, the bill is colorblind, applying to all illegal aliens.
 And, as Title 8, Section 1325(a) of the United States Code tells us, entry without inspection is a misdemeanor the first time (six months maximum incarceration) and a felony if repeated (two years). In short, illegal immigration is a crime.
 Paul Nachman Bozeman, Mont., April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Of course Arizona's governor, Jan Brewer, signed the state's anti-immigrant bill (front page, April 24). Why? The majority of Arizona residents wanted her to. Immigrants, undocumented and legal, are blamed for crime, unemployment, crowded emergency rooms, pet overpopulation and every other social ill that comes to mind.
 It reminds me of Germany in the 1930s and how Jews were held culpable for Europe's problems. Arizona's Legislature shamelessly panders to the radical fringe in our state and snickers at those of us who seek common ground.
 For the first time since moving here from New York City in 1997, I am ashamed to call myself an Arizonan.
 Debra J. White Tempe, Ariz., April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 When my husband and I adopted our Colombian-born daughter as a newborn in 1989 (naturalized as an American citizen in 1991), we never imagined that on the eve of her turning 21 we would ever caution her against travel to any American state. How could we now not warn her off Arizona?
 Absent foresight to carry her American passport at all times, she might be detained and arrested on the basis of her appearance alone, despite Gov. Jan Brewer's disingenuous assurances to the contrary. I am ashamed that any state governor has threatened the safety and well-being of our daughter, however indirectly, and hope that national immigration reform assumes the immediate priority it deserves.
 Susan R. Bryan-Brown New York, April 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The simple question is, Will the law be equally applied? Brewer, hmm, sounds Canadian, maybe British. Would you please produce proof of citizenship, ma'am? (said in the most courteous law-enforcement tone of voice).

HEADLINE: Robots Working 5,000 Feet Underwater to Stop Flow of Oil in Gulf of Mexico

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Oil continued to pour into the Gulf of Mexico on Monday as the authorities waited to see if the quickest possible method of stopping the leaks would bring an end to what was threatening to become an environmental disaster. 
 Remote-controlled robots operating 5,000 feet under the ocean's surface were more than a full day into efforts to seal off the oil well, which has been belching crude through leaks in a pipeline at the rate of 42,000 gallons a day. The leaks were found on Saturday, days after an oil rig to which the pipeline was attached exploded, caught on fire and sank in the gulf about 50 miles from the Louisiana coast. 
 The robots were trying to activate a device known as a blowout preventer, a 450-ton valve at the wellhead that is designed to shut off a well in the event of a sudden pressure release.
 Officials had initially said that the operation, which began Sunday morning, would take 24 to 36 hours. But on Monday a Coast Guard spokesman said officials would keep trying as long as the efforts were feasible because ''it's the best option.'' The other options -- collecting the oil in a dome and routing it to the surface or drilling one or more relief wells -- would take weeks or even several months to execute.
 Wind has kept the spill from moving toward the coast. Officials said the spill had a 600-mile circumference Monday, but most of that was a thin sheen of oil-water mix. Only 3 percent of the area was crude oil with a ''pudding-like'' consistency, they said.
 The wind was expected to change direction by Thursday, however, and the spill's distance from the coast has not prevented a threat to marine life.
 On Sunday a crew from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service spotted three sperm whales in the vicinity of the spill. Planes that were dropping chemicals to break down the oil were told to steer clear of the whales.
 The chemicals, known as dispersants, can be as toxic to mammals as the oil itself, said Jackie Savitz, a marine biologist with a background in toxicity with Oceana, a Washington nonprofit group that focuses on ocean conservation.
 Ms. Savitz said environmental concerns were not alleviated by assurances that the spill was not yet a threat to the coast. ''There is a misconception that if water doesn't hit the beach it isn't dangerous,'' she said.
 Plans are moving forward to design a dome that could be submerged over the leaks, which are coming from a 5,000-foot pipeline called a riser that ran between the wellhead and the rig. The riser is now snaking along the ocean bottom.
 The dome would corral the oil and route it up to vessels to be collected. But Doug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production at BP, which was leasing the rig from Transocean and is required by law to pay for the cleanup, continued to emphasize the engineering challenges of such an operation at a news conference on Monday. 
 ''I must stress that this is state of the art,'' Mr. Suttles said, adding that the method had never been done at such depths. It would take at least two weeks to put into place, he said.
 More than 1,000 people are working on the spill, including officials from the Coast Guard, the federal government and BP. BP is also mobilizing rigs that would drill one or more deep wells nearby to push mud and concrete into the gushing cavity, an operation made all the more expensive and complex in the deep waters. That would take two to three months.
 The explosion and leaking of oil have underscored the risks and challenges that a new generation of oil pioneers faces plying for discoveries at such depths.
 While the causes of the accident on BP's rig, called Deepwater Horizon, may take months to determine, drilling down 10,000 feet or more is inherently risky because of the extreme heat and pressure at those depths.
 Holding down the pressure while drilling is one trick, and keeping the equipment from softening or bending is another, requiring engineers to develop extra thick steel, alloys and heavy insulation for the job.
 ''At these water depths and well depths, there is more that can go wrong,'' said Neal Dingmann, an analyst covering offshore drilling and service companies at Wunderlich Securities in Houston. ''You have much higher pressures and temperatures to battle.''
 BP and Transocean officials said the pressure that was building in the oil and gas reserve that the rig was drilling was not exceptional. But pressure was probably a factor if the accident was caused by a well blowout, as many experts suspect. 
 Oil companies have been drilling in deep waters for nearly 20 years, but it has become more popular over the last decade as rising oil prices made the practice more economical. Only 15 years ago, oil experts said gulf production was in a deep decline and oil companies were abandoning the area for Russia and the Caspian Sea.
 The gulf is now the source of a quarter of the nation's domestic production, and that share is likely to grow, especially with production in Alaska falling.
 Until last week's accident, the industry has had few recent spills in the Gulf of Mexico. Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at Rice University, noted that in the last 15 years there was not a single spill of over 1,000 barrels among the 4,000 active platforms off the shores of the United States.
 Ms. Jaffe said offshore drilling was considerably safer for the environment than the tankers used for importing oil.
 ''In all drilling you have the challenge of dealing with pressurization, and in the case of deepwater Gulf of Mexico that process is assisted by tens of thousands of super computers,'' she said. ''It's as technically challenging as space travel, but safer.''
 The question of safety may now become a political flashpoint, since the Obama administration announced recently that it wants to open more areas to offshore drilling. 
 On Monday, Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, and New Jersey's two Democratic senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, sent a letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to request a hearing on the accident, which left 11 workers missing and presumed dead. 
 ''The explosion, ensuing fire, and continuing spill raise serious concerns about the industry's claims that their operations and technology are safe enough to put rigs in areas that are environmentally sensitive or are critical to tourism or fishing industries,'' the letter said.

HEADLINE: Democrats, Republicans and the Role of Government

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Government War,'' by David Brooks (column, April 23):
 The ''stale, old debate'' about the Democrats as the big-government party and the Republicans as the small-government party rests entirely upon a false distinction. The two major parties both advocate significant roles for government: they differ merely on the areas of our lives in which they believe government should be involved. 
 The areas in which the parties advocate government involvement are, in fact, mirror images of each other. So Democrats generally want to regulate economic relationships and business ethics, while Republicans generally want to regulate personal relationships and individual morals.
 As usual, Republicans seem totally willing to perpetuate and manipulate an inaccurate characterization of the issues, and Democrats seem totally incapable of effectively framing the issues themselves.
 How long will we have only a choice between the stridently disingenuous and the weakly incompetent?
 John Glicksman Pittsburgh, April 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Which is it, David Brooks? Is it that ''history happened,'' or that Democrats ''decided to put the big government-versus-small government debate back at the center of American life''?
 Democrats made no such decision. They responded to circumstances -- a market-driven financial meltdown, two wars, a completely dysfunctional health care system -- and Republicans decided to oppose every administration initiative by dredging up all the old charges, everything from ''big-government liberal'' to ''Stalinist.''
 The Democratic responses to the crises they inherited may increase the size of government, but on the substance of the issues Republicans have proposed no reasonable alternatives. Their alternatives to health care reform were to simply allow more sick people to go without care and allow more of the dysfunctional status quo to persist; their alternative to financial reform is to demonize the bailouts they themselves initiated, and to oppose any regulation of the market behavior that caused the crisis in the first place.
 The return of the ''government war,'' as Mr. Brooks calls it, has nothing to do with any real growth of government, much less any real infringement of liberty -- it is a Republican strategy born of Republican failure.
 Financial deregulation was a disaster; leaving health care to the insurance industry has been a fiasco; tax cuts for the rich never trickled down ... and Republicans have nothing left but to harp on the ''old polarities.''
 David Berman New York, April 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks makes an astute point in commenting that the big-government-versus-small-government debate is stale. It leads us to realize that the issue was never big government versus small government. It was always good government versus bad government.

HEADLINE: Ex-Leader's Twin Declares Run in Poland

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Michal Piotrowski contributed reporting from Warsaw.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Despite facing long odds against a victory, Poland's former prime minister on Monday declared his candidacy for president in a special election to replace his twin brother, who was killed in a plane crash earlier this month.
 The official, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said he would carry on his brother's work and stand in his place as the candidate for the conservative Law and Justice Party in the June 20 election, according to a statement on the party's Web site. The early election was called after his twin, Lech, and 95 others, including dozens of top officials and generals, were killed in a plane crash in western Russia on April 10. 
 ''The tragically interrupted life of the president of the Republic of Poland, the death of the patriotic Polish elite, mean one thing for us: We must complete their mission,'' Mr. Kaczynski said in the statement. ''We owe it to them and we owe it to our fatherland. While immersed in pain and mourning, bound by the eternal memory of our loss, we are obliged to carry out their will.''
 Mr. Kaczynski's entry into the race, predicted by members of his party even before the state funeral for his brother and the first lady, Maria Kaczynska, on April 18, sets up an emotional campaign that will be bound up in Poland's worst tragedy since World War II. But opinion surveys show that Mr. Kaczynski will have a difficult time defeating Bronislaw Komorowski, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament and acting president, from the rival Civic Platform party.
 It was the latest chapter in the unusual saga of the twin brothers, who in 2006 and 2007 served as president and prime minister at the same time. Their efforts to uncover former Communists and suspected collaborators in government and the news media, and oust them from important positions, led to a deep polarization of politics. While they were staunch allies of the United States, skepticism toward the European Union often put them at odds with European allies.
 Most analysts had predicted that Lech Kaczynski would lose to Mr. Komorowski in the presidential election in the fall. The crash upended all expectations, moving the election forward to June and placing pressure inside the party on Jaroslaw Kaczynski to carry on in his brother's place.
 While the crash claimed the lives of politicians from several parties, it was Law and Justice that suffered the most, as lawmakers and top members of the president's staff traveled with him to a ceremony commemorating the massacre of more than 20,000 Polish officers in Katyn forest by Stalin's secret police during World War II.
 ''Poland is our common, great commitment,'' Mr. Kaczynski said in the statement, adding that he had the support of the family in making the decision. ''It necessitates, among other things, overcoming personal suffering and undertaking the task in spite of personal tragedy.'' 
 The deaths of so many prominent Poles prompted an outpouring of public grief that threw into question how voters would react when asked to replace Mr. Kaczynski. It vaulted Mr. Komorowski into the role of acting president, but at a moment when politicking and campaigning were deemed in poor taste.
 Yet the Civic Platform government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, hopes that a victory for Mr. Komorowski would allow the party to push forward its agenda. Mr. Tusk presided over a Polish economy that continued to grow as the rest of the European Union sank into recession.
 ''I would very much like for this campaign to be based not on emotions, especially bad, negative emotions, but to become a debate on the future of Poland,'' said Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska, a member of Parliament from Law and Justice who was named Monday as Mr. Kaczynski's campaign manager.

HEADLINE: Sudan's President Wins Election as Country Nears Vote to Split

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- Sudan's incumbent president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, handily won the country's first multiparty election in more than 20 years, according to results released Monday, offering a glimpse into the kind of lopsided contests that may continue if the nation splits in two next year as expected.
 Mr. Bashir received 68 percent of the vote, though many international observers said the election was marred by intimidation, gerrymandering and fraud. Right before the voting started in mid-April, several of the top opposition parties abruptly dropped out of the race, clearing a path for Mr. Bashir. 
 In southern Sudan, which is preparing to vote on whether to split off from the north and become its own country, the incumbent there, Salva Kiir, prevailed as well, winning 93 percent of the vote to remain president of that semiautonomous region.
 The results were neither surprising nor evidence of a sudden blossoming of democracy. But that does not necessarily mean the election was insignificant. It was essentially Step 1 of what could be a very messy divorce.
 Southern Sudan is expected to secede next year from Sudan, which could bring turbulence to the largest country in Africa, at nearly one million square miles. The southern Sudanese, who are mostly Christian and animist, have been chafing for independence from northern Arab domination since Sudan became independent in 1956, and have fought two long civil wars with the north since then. Some names for Africa's next country are already being floated. ''New Sudan'' is one of them. ''South Sudan'' is another.
 The elections that just finished were an important milestone on the road to the referendum, as laid out in an American-backed peace treaty in 2005 between Mr. Bashir's ruling party and the southern rebels.
 Whether the independence referendum will actually happen, or whether it may set off another war, remain serious concerns. Sudan has been racked by several bloody rebellions at the same time (the worst one was in the south, which claimed more than two million lives). And the track record of Mr. Bashir -- who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity, accused of playing ''an essential role'' in the bloodshed in Sudan's western Darfur region -- raises troubling questions.
 Many human rights advocates have argued that it was precisely because of these concerns that the Obama administration and other Western powers offered only restrained criticism of a disappointing election.
 Opposition officials said that Mr. Bashir, who seized power in 1989 in a coup, used just about every trick in the autocratic handbook -- intimidation, violence, bribery and monopolization of the state media -- to ensure he did not lose. And this was probably unnecessary. Because of Sudan's rapid economic growth, Mr. Bashir is quite popular among many voters, and not just urban dwellers. 
 But the prevailing wisdom among the Western powers seems to have been that avoiding a head-on confrontation with Mr. Bashir was the best way to guarantee that he did not fiddle with the referendum. 
 Analysts are already sketching the outlines of the two post-referendum Sudans, where democracy will probably be the loser and uncompetitive, predictable election results the norm. The net result, they argue, could essentially be two one-party states with even less democratic space than under the flawed coalition government that rules today.
 ''Autocracy is the expected outcome on both sides of the border,'' said John Prendergast, of the anti-genocide Enough project. 
 While Mr. Bashir's territory will shrink considerably if the southern third of the country splits off, he will face even less opposition within it. 
 Likewise, in the south, Mr. Kiir's party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which has led the fight for succession for decades and is now the junior partner in the national government, is expected to continue to dominate. Already, it has shown itself seemingly allergic to dissent, despite billions of dollars in aid money and democracy-building projects that the United States has pumped into southern Sudan. During the last several weeks, the S.P.L.M. was accused by election observers of harassing and beating up opposition candidates.
 Mr. Prendergast said that a few years ago, many people hoped Sudan was going to ''remake itself as a tolerant, fair and united state.''
 But Mr. Bashir's party ''slammed the door on this vision,'' Mr. Prendergast said. ''It has become a party of those newly enriched by the oil bonanza.''
 The fiercest custody battle in the coming split will most likely be over that oil, about 500,000 barrels a day; a drop compared with Saudi Arabia's output but enough to roughly double Sudan's per capita income in the last 10 years, though the benefits have hardly been shared equally. 
 The most productive oil fields in the country lie in southern Sudan or along the unresolved north-south border, which could become the new focus of attention now that the election is over. Few believe that Mr. Bashir, who used oil money to transform Khartoum into a clean, orderly and increasingly modern capital on the banks of the Nile, is ready to let go of this revenue stream.
 But Zach Vertin, an analyst for the International Crisis Group who lives in southern Sudan, argues that oil could also be the glue that keeps the two sides civil to each other.
 ''As both regimes rely so heavily on oil revenues, finding a suitable arrangement is a mutual interest and a matter of political survival,'' he said. ''Alternative export routes may be an option for South Sudan at some stage, but such alternatives will not be available overnight, and thus the parties will need each other in the interim.''
 Right now, north and south Sudan are tied together by a 1,000-mile pipeline that runs from southern Sudan to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, a physical sign of how reliant the two sides are on each other. 
 There is also the question about what independence portends for the continent. Some analysts worry that if Sudan splits in two, it could embolden separatist movements in other parts of Africa, something the African Union has been very sensitive about since its inception in the 1960s. 
 But the southern Sudanese say that is not their problem.
 ''The people of south Sudan have never wanted to be outside of Sudan; it has been the political system that has marginalized them,'' said John Duku, an S.P.L.M. representative in Nairobi. ''Nobody, I repeat nobody, can prevent us from having this referendum. The international community should realize this and save everybody a war.''

HEADLINE: Trip to the Midwest With Political Fortunes on the Line

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa -- President Obama is making an appeal to the legions of new voters who sent him to the White House, imploring them to preserve the Democratic majority in Congress. But party leaders have an even more pressing wish: that he help himself before he helps his fellow Democrats.
 For all the ways that Mr. Obama is working to brighten the outlook for Democrats in the midterm elections, perhaps none is more important than raising his own standing and repairing a frayed connection with voters who have grown critical of his presidency. 
 So on Tuesday, Mr. Obama is returning to the place his candidacy sprang to life, here in Iowa, for the start of a two-day trip to the Midwest. He is not planning to appear with Democratic candidates as he moves from city to city on the latest leg of his Main Street economic tour, but rather to talk -- and listen -- to factory workers, farmers and citizens he meets along the way.
 As the White House and Democratic Congressional strategists have come to realize, the political significance of the president's favorability rating goes well beyond what it means for Mr. Obama himself. Yes, he can help raise money, attract crowds and draw news coverage for candidates, but history suggests Mr. Obama has to increase his currency with the public if he wants voters to elect Democrats in the fall.
 ''Ultimately, he's our greatest asset,'' said Tom Miller, the Democratic attorney general of Iowa, who is on the ballot here in November. ''I think he could be a big plus by October, but that obviously remains to be seen.''
 It is not as though Mr. Obama is seen as a drag on the ticket -- he stands taller in polls than Congress as a whole -- but since Democrats control the levers of power in Washington, the electorate's bleak opinion of government is a problem for the party. Mr. Obama is trying to recapture his brand as he seeks to define himself again as a reformer, hoping to counter the anti-government, anti-incumbent sentiment that has poisoned the atmosphere for Democrats.
 Five days after delivering a speech about Wall Street, calling for stricter regulations in the financial system, Mr. Obama is set to deliver a working-class version of the same message here. The ''White House to Main Street'' tour, which opened late last year, was intended to provide a vehicle for the president to speak thematically about jobs and the economy, but the stops have been more sporadic than originally planned, victims of a crowded and evolving agenda that has included health care, energy and now perhaps even immigration.
 Here in Mount Pleasant, a southeastern Iowa town of 8,775 people that Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit on Tuesday afternoon, one topic came up again and again in conversations with residents on the eve of Mr. Obama's arrival. Vacant factories on the edge of town -- and the county unemployment rate of 10.3 percent, far above the state average of 6.9 percent -- provide a backdrop for the presidential visit.
 ''We need jobs out here,'' said Amy Cheney, 38, who works as a waitress by day and a bartender by night to support her two children, after losing her full-time job a year ago. ''Tell the president that we need jobs to make a living.''
 Ms. Cheney said she was excited by Mr. Obama's election, ''a fresh change for the country -- the first black president!''
 But she worries that the new health care law will require her to buy insurance, which she said she could not afford. ''Will they write me a ticket if I don't have it?'' she asked a reporter over lunch at de Brito Baking Bistro. 
 David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said it was precisely those types of stories and comments that the president was eager to hear, even if they were at odds with recent achievements by the administration in Washington. 
 ''They're not yet feeling like a recovery,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''I don't think it's surprising that people are not in all that positive of a mood, but I do think that things will get better.''
 The president's name may not be on the ballot in November, but his record is on the line. For the past 50 years, nearly without exception, the party has lost seats whenever its president's average approval rating in September and October before the election dropped below 50 percent.
 In recent weeks, the president's national job approval rating has hovered near -- or just below -- 50 percent. But the state-to-state fluctuation worries Democratic strategists who are running campaigns in the Southwest, the West or the industrial Midwest, where many polls suggest that Mr. Obama's disapproval rating is a few notches higher.
 The president is paying close attention to the midterm elections, his advisers say. In addition to his daily national security and economic briefings, he is given frequent political briefings, complete with the latest poll results, readouts from focus groups and updates on Democratic and Republican primaries.
 He sent a video message on Monday to his network of supporters, Organizing for America, saying the Democratic majority in Congress -- and his agenda -- depended on their roles in this year's midterm elections.
 ''If you help us make sure that first-time voters in 2008 make their voices heard again in November,'' Mr. Obama said, ''then together we will deliver on the promise of change, and hope, and prosperity for generations to come.''
 The president's visit, which will be followed on Wednesday by stops in Missouri and Illinois, has a secondary purpose. His advisers say that every trip to Iowa, the state that delivered his first victory on the road to the White House, fortifies Mr. Obama and recharges his batteries for the headwinds to come.

HEADLINE: In Wake of Immigration Law, Calls for an Economic Boycott of Arizona

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
A spreading call for an economic boycott of Arizona after its adoption of a tough immigration law that opponents consider racially discriminatory worried business leaders on Monday and angered the governor. 
 Several immigrant advocates and civil rights groups, joined by members of the San Francisco government, said the state should pay economic consequences for the new law, which gives the police broad power to detain people they reasonably suspect are illegal immigrants and arrest them on state charges if they do not have legal status.
 Critics say the law will lead to widespread ethnic and racial profiling and will be used to harass legal residents and Latino citizens.
 La Opinion, the nation's largest Spanish-language newspaper, urged a boycott in an editorial Monday, as did the Rev. Al Sharpton, and calls for such action spread to social media sites. The San Francisco city attorney and members of the Board of Supervisors said they would propose that the city not do business with the state.
 They followed the lead of Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who had urged conventions to skip the state, though other Democrats who oppose the law, including Mayor Phil Gordon of Phoenix, pleaded for people not to punish the entire state.
 Tourism and convention managers, struggling to rebound from the recession, said it was too soon to tell if the effort would have an impact, but some businesses said people were turning away from the state.
 At the Arizona Inn in Tucson, the manager, Will Conroy, said that over the weekend 12 customers canceled reservations or said they would not return to the state because of the law.
 ''This is a very scary situation that the police can now just come up to you for no reason and ask for papers,'' Joy Mann, a prospective guest who had previously stayed at the inn, wrote him in an e-mail message. ''My son is a construction worker and is very suntanned. I cannot ask him to join us there now, as I would fear for him.''
 Tourism officials said such accounts were not widespread, but they were concerned that the rancor was tarnishing the state's image and were mindful of the boycott in the 1980s that led to Arizona's officially observing Martin Luther King's Birthday after initially rejecting it as a holiday.
 ''Arizona tourism is currently in a very fragile state of recovery, and the negative perceptions surrounding this legislation are tarnishing Arizona's image and could easily have a devastating effect on visitation to our state,'' the Valley Hotel and Resort Association in Phoenix said in a statement.
 Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed the bill on Friday, calling it an important step toward public safety that would help control immigration and give the police a tool to root out criminals.
 She criticized opponents for not offering more solutions to problems related to illegal immigration and called the idea of a boycott ''disappointing and unfortunate'' at a time when the state is reeling from the recession and suffering from border-related crime that ''continues to harm our economy and stifle trade.''

HEADLINE: The White House's Republican Mainstay? Maybe Not

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Lindsey Graham makes no pretense about it. He wants to be where the action is.
 ''I'm in the center of a lot of important debates -- I like that,'' Mr. Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has carved out a role for himself as this city's resident maverick, said in an interview on Monday. ''I want to be a conservative who can put conservative principles in play on hard issues.''
 So Mr. Graham, a cherubic-looking 54-year-old, has been busy this year, reaching out to Democrats in an effort to broker deals on hot-button issues like energy and immigration and closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. As the rare member of his party who is consistently willing to cross the aisle, he has filled a niche once occupied by his close friend and mentor, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.
 Now, though, Mr. Graham's position as the go-to Republican for the Obama White House is in doubt. Over the weekend, he abruptly reversed course, backing out of plans to unveil a long-awaited bipartisan energy bill -- a high priority for President Obama. He has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday to urge the Senate Democratic leadership to put off debate on another of his priorities, an immigration overhaul. 
 Mr. Graham says he had received assurances from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, that energy would come first and accuses him of making a sudden push for immigration -- an effort Mr. Graham says will only divide the country -- to appease Hispanic voters in an election year. 
 ''I was mad, because they brought immigration up in the 11th hour,'' the senator said, adding, ''If you're going to do business with people, they've got to understand that you can push back.''
 His reversal has thrown official Washington into a tizzy, raising questions about his motives.Some Democrats whisper that he must be trying to spare Mr. McCain, who is facing a tough primary challenge from the right, an uncomfortable vote on immigration. Others openly surmise that Mr. Graham must have caved in to his Republicancritics.
 ''There has been enormous back pressure against the kind of bipartisan cooperation that Senator Graham has engaged in,'' Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's top economics adviser, said Sunday on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS. ''And that perhaps has made this a more complex situation and more difficult for him than it would otherwise be.''
 Mr. Graham says he has not caved in to anybody, but his cross-party cooperation has clearly come at a price. At home, passions are running high. Locals derisively call him ''Graham-nesty'' for his work on immigration. He has been censured by three chapters of the South Carolina Republican Party. At a town-hall-style meeting in Greenvillelast fall,constituents angrily shouted him down.
 ''You and Obama -- guilty of treason!'' one hollered.
 ''Why do you think it's necessary to get in bed with people like John Kerry?'' demanded another, referring to Mr. Graham's Democratic co-sponsor on the energy bill. 
 David Woodard, a former campaign manager for Mr. Graham who teaches at Clemson University, says Mr. Graham is ''in real trouble.'' Hogwash, says the senator, who won re-election in 2008 and does not face voters again until 2014. In an interview earlier this month in his Senate office, sipping from a bottle of Coke Zero (his beverage of choice), he sounded liberated.
 ''I'm in the mid- to high 60s, and my negatives are in the 20s,'' he said, referring to his job approval ratings. ''Now, what I've done is, I used to be in the 80s. But what's the use of being here if you can't move the ball forward?''
 A former military prosecutor with a clever wit and Southern charm, Mr. Graham comes off more like the boy next door than a United States senator. His snappy sound bites (he recently referred to Mr. Obama's health care bill as ''a Ponzi scheme'' on NBC's ''Meet the Press'') and willingness to buck his own party have made him a favorite on the Sunday talk show circuit.
 ''I like dealing with him because he makes me laugh,'' Carol M. Browner, Mr. Obama's top environmental adviser, said in an interview this month. ''He's kind of self-deprecating.''
 His easy manner belies a tough upbringing as the son of bar owners in the tiny town of Central, S.C. Mr. Graham's parents died when he was in college, leaving him responsible for his 13-year-old sister -- an experience that may also account for his independent streak, Mr. Woodard said. 
 ''Where a lot of kids at that age had parental guidance, he had to make his own decisions,'' he said.
 His ties to another onetime Republican maverick, Mr. McCain, date to the 2000 presidential race, when Mr. Graham defied the conservative wing of his party to support the Arizona senator. After Mr. Graham joined the Senate in 2002, the two became fast friends and international traveling buddies, often spending their Congressional recesses together traveling to various war zones. 
 The reasons for the bond are obvious; both are creatures of the military, and both like to have fun. Some say the ties may go deeper. At 73, Mr. McCain, is nearly 20 years Mr. Graham's senior. ''In some ways I think John is a father figure to Lindsey,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is close to both.
 Conservative blogs dubbed Mr. Graham ''McCain's Mini-Me'' -- a description his friends reject. As Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one of Mr. Graham's partners on the energy bill, said: ''He's a maxi-Lindsey. He's not a mini-anybody.''
 For Mr. Obama, who has struggled to keep his campaign promise to change the tone in Washington, Mr. Graham has been something of a godsend. Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, began cultivating the South Carolina senator even before Mr. Obama took office, inviting him in to talk about issues like Afghanistan and closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.
 The president, Mr. Emanuel said in a recent interview, views Mr. Graham as ''a gutsy guy.''
 But on Monday, as the White House tried to nudge Mr. Graham back into the fold, some Democrats were privately wondering how gutsy he really is. Mr. Graham says he still wants to work with the White House, adding, ''it's not over yet.''
 His legislative partners, like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who had been working with Mr. Graham on immigration, tried to sound optimistic. But asked what would happen next, Mr. Schumer responded with a sigh -- and a cryptic answer.
 ''Lindsey Graham is one of the most adept legislators I've met,'' he said, ''and he will figure out a way to solve these problems.''

HEADLINE: House Inquiry Finds That Employers' Write-Downs on Health Care Were Proper

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When major companies declared that a provision of the new health care law would hurt earnings, Democrats were skeptical. But after investigating, House Democrats have concluded that the companies were right to tell investors and the government about the expected adverse effects of the law on their financial results.
 At issue is a section of the law that eliminates a tax break available to companies that provide drug benefits to retirees as part of their insurance coverage. The tax change, expected to generate $4.5 billion of revenue over the next 10 years, will help offset the cost of providing coverage to the uninsured. 
 Within days after President Obama signed the law on March 23, companies filed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying the tax change would have a material adverse effect on their earnings.
 The White House suggested that companies were exaggerating the effects of the tax change. The commerce secretary, Gary F. Locke, said the companies were being ''premature and irresponsible'' in taking such write-downs.
 Representative Henry A. Waxman of California and Bart Stupak of Michigan, both Democrats, opened an investigation and demanded that four companies -- AT&T, Caterpillar, Deere and Verizon -- supply documents analyzing the ''impact of health care reform,'' together with an explanation of their accounting methods.
 The documents -- hundreds of pages of e-mail messages and financial worksheets -- include large amounts of data that substantiate the companies' concerns. They have reignited a battle over the law in Congress.
 Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, ''From a financial standpoint, from a purely economic standpoint, many companies would be better off discontinuing health care as a fringe benefit, paying the penalty and pocketing the savings.''
 In a memorandum summarizing its investigation, the Democratic staff of the committee said, ''The companies acted properly and in accordance with accounting standards in submitting filings to the S.E.C. in March and April.''
 Moreover, it said, ''these one-time charges were required by applicable accounting rules.'' The committee staff said this view was confirmed by independent experts at the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the American Academy of Actuaries.
 Mr. Waxman, the chairman of the committee, and Mr. Stupak canceled a hearing at which they had planned to question executives on the effects of the law.
 A tabulation by the United States Chamber of Commerce shows that at least 40 companies have taken charges against earnings that total $3.4 billion since the law was signed.
 ''Companies like AT&T, Verizon and a range of stakeholder associations are hopeful that the benefits of the new law will outweigh the costs,'' Mr. Waxman and Mr. Stupak said in a memorandum to committee members. ''But they cannot quantify the benefits until the law is implemented.''
 AT&T, which took a $995 million charge to reflect the impact of the health care overhaul, said it would be ''evaluating prospective changes to the active and retiree health care benefits offered by the company.''
 Under another provision, employers may be subject to financial penalties if they do not offer health insurance to employees. Documents provided to Congress by AT&T indicate that its medical costs in 2009 were $4.7 billion, divided about equally between active employees and retirees -- far more than it would pay in penalties if it did not provide coverage.
 Verizon said it was taking a $970 million charge against earnings because of the change in tax treatment of a subsidy it receives for retiree drug coverage. In addition, Verizon said it could be affected by a new tax on high-cost health plans that takes effect in 2018.
 ''Many of the plans that Verizon offers to employees and retirees are projected to have costs above the thresholds in the legislation and will be subject to the 40 percent excise tax,'' the company told employees. 
 In a general analysis of the new law, Verizon said, ''To avoid additional costs and regulations, employers may consider exiting the employer health market and send employees'' to state-run insurance exchanges, where people can buy insurance.
 A Caterpillar executive made a similar point in an e-mail message to colleagues, saying the tax changes could ''drive many employers to just drop coverage for retirees altogether, and let the government foot the whole bill.''
 Caterpillar, the maker of construction equipment, said Monday that it was taking a $90 million charge to earnings because of taxes resulting from the new health care law.
 In addition, according to documents provided to Congress, Caterpillar could incur new costs because the law eliminates lifetime limits on coverage, and certain children would be allowed to stay on their parents' insurance until their 26th birthday.

HEADLINE: Two Dance Visions in a Creative Pas de Deux

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
A theater merging with a choreographer's company? As the New York dance world puzzled over the unusual prospect of a union between the downtown presenter Dance Theater Workshop and Bill T. Jones's company -- one surprised former staff member of the workshop likened it to a merger of a museum and an artist -- new details have emerged about the proposal. 
 The executive directors of both groups now say the plan calls for an umbrella organization that would include Mr. Jones's troupe. The new brand -- with a new name and a new mission -- would link the 28-year-old company of Mr. Jones, who is known for work that tackles social topics like racism and AIDS, with an arts center that holds more than 110 performances annually by some 45 artists and companies.
 Under the proposal, which was reported by Crain's New York Business this month, the staffs of both groups would be combined, and a new board would be established. The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company has 26 full-time employees, including 10 dancers; the workshop has a full-time staff of 17. The merger requires approval by the boards of both companies. 
 Andrea Sholler, executive director of Dance Theater Workshop, and Jean Davidson, executive director of the Jones troupe, said they hoped to have a memorandum of understanding by early summer. While they declined to answer some questions and said financial issues were still being negotiated, they did say that the 45-year-old Dance Theater Workshop in Chelsea would maintain its commitment to contemporary dance.
 Mr. Jones's company would move ''under the umbrella of the new entity,'' Ms. Davidson said. It would perform at the center every other year, continue to tour nationally and internationally, and continue partnerships with other presenters to commission and premiere work. And although Mr. Jones has branched out into Broadway, directing and choreographing ''Fela!,'' and winning a Tony for choreographing ''Spring Awakening,'' he would continue to create work in partnership with presenters like the Lincoln Center Festival, the Ravinia Festival outside Chicago and Montclair State University in New Jersey. 
 Ms. Sholler and Ms. Davidson said financial concerns did not prompt the merger. The Jones company had a budget surplus of $90,000 at the end of the last fiscal year, Ms. Davidson said. Dance Theater Workshop, housed in a contemporary building that opened in 2002, has a debt of about $2.9 million because of its mortgage, Ms. Sholler said, adding, ''We're not in arrears.'' 
 Ms. Sholler said that she and Ms. Davidson had several ''organic'' conversations about possible partnerships among arts groups. Then last year Mr. Jones's company, through its participation in an EmcArts program that helps arts groups find new ways of working, was formally paired with Dance Theater Workshop to explore the feasibility of a strategic partnership in which they would share the Chelsea space. The two organizations are now working with the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which helps strengthen nonprofit groups, to develop a financial model for the merger and to determine its viability. 
 ''We're not in a rush,'' Ms. Davidson said. ''We're doing due diligence.''
 She added: ''For our company and for Bill, it's a new way of thinking about legacy. We've been looking for a space for many years. We looked at places in Harlem that didn't work out.'' 
 Mr. Jones, whose company lacks a permanent home, would rehearse at Dance Theater Workshop 12 to 16 weeks a year.
 Ms. Sholler said that both organizations were ''committed to artists' experimenting in the dance form,'' adding, ''We have no intention of changing our philosophy.''
 Carla Peterson, the workshop's artistic director, agreed, saying in an e-mail message that the theater's ''rigorous, diverse'' curatorial approach ''will only be strengthened.'' She added that the theater would continue to offer space to dance artists through a subsidized rental program. 
 Arguing that the proposed merger would ''serve artists in a deeper and more meaningful way,'' Ms. Davidson said, ''We saw an opportunity for two very like-minded organizations to come together and do something new in the field.''
 On that point those inside and outside the dance world agreed. ''I can't think of an artistic merger on this level,'' said John Wyszniewski, assistant director of communications for the School of Visual Arts and a former staff member at Dance Theater Workshop. ''I can't think of an example of taking a single-choreographer company and combining it with a pre-existing company. It's almost as if the Whitney merges with a famous artist.''
 ''There are just lots of questions,'' he continued, adding, ''People are concerned about the breadth of programs and opportunities.''
 Stanford Makishi, executive director of the Baryshnikov Arts Center in Manhattan, also said that the merger seemed unprecedented, although he added that there were many partnerships and collaborations between dance companies and other arts groups in a time of shrinking resources for the arts. 
 ''Those are two very different organizations with two very different missions as they exist now,'' Mr. Makishi said. ''They've thrived so vitally for so long because they are both needed, they were so necessary. Bill T. Jones is not a presenter and serves the vision of Jones. The Dance Theater Workshop has been at the forefront of supporting and presenting artists.''
 Some also expressed concerns about a merger's impact on the delicate ecosystem of dance in New York, where artists use different sites to experiment and hone their work. 
 ''If the merger happens, and they both keep their identities, that's fine,'' said Catherine Peila, executive director of Dance New Amsterdam, a nonprofit organization in Lower Manhattan that offers support and performance space for aspiring, emerging and established artists. ''But Bill T. Jones has this amazing personality, and it could become the Bill T. Jones curated forum,'' Ms. Peila said. ''DTW loses its personality for cutting-edge work.'' 
 Many name artists have come through the workshop, she added, ticking off a list that included Doug Elkins, Meredith Monk, David Dorfman and David Parsons. Mr. Jones has presented there, too, and is featured in a video on the Dance Theater Workshop Web site, dancetheaterworkshop.org. 
 Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce Theater in Chelsea, said that she had expected more merger discussions in dance, given the current economic climate, but that she was not aware of any others. Should a Jones/Workshop partnership with a new mission come about, she added, ''it could be quite interesting.''

HEADLINE: Off Wall St., Worries About Financial Bill

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mars, the maker of M&M's and Snickers, wants to make sure it can continue dabbling in the derivatives market to protect the price of sugar and chocolate for its candies. 
 Harley-Davidson is worried that its dealer-financed loans to bikers will fall victim to new federal financing regulations. And eBay is concerned about possible restrictions on PayPal, a subsidiary, in moving money in the Internet marketplace.
 Far afield from Wall Street, the intense debate over the overhaul of financial regulations by Congress is attracting some unlikely but powerful players. More than 130 companies from the manufacturing, retail and service sectors have retained high-powered lobbyists to weigh in on, and often oppose, the regulatory system being debated this week in Washington, according to an analysis of lobbying records by The New York Times. 
 The companies bear little resemblance to Goldman Sachs and the other Wall Street financial giants that have become the main targets of the legislation. The lobbying push by these other industries shows just how broadly the legislation could affect businesses. 
 It also illustrates what some critics say is legislation so loosely drawn that it may inadvertently cover a variety of companies that are involved in lending or moving money, even if they operate far from Wall Street and had little to do with the financial crisis. Some industries, like payday lenders, fear that the financial overhaul may be a backdoor way for Congress to regulate them, something they have successfully fought for years.
 Steve Adamske, communications director of the House Financial Services Committee, acknowledges that some House legislation would regulate payday lenders, which make short-term, high-interest loans to people who promise to pay in full with their next check.
 ''There is a fair amount of caution any time the federal government proposes new oversight,'' said Christopher Colwell, a lobbyist for Check 'n Go, a payday lender. ''We are trying to determine what impacts these proposals will have on business, intentionally or unintentionally.''
 While the legislation's backers in Congress insist that most nonfinancial companies have little to worry about, many of these businesses say they are deeply concerned that the sweeping provisions in the 1,400-page Senate bill, particularly the regulation of the derivatives market, the creation of a consumer protection board and rules on corporate government, could draw them in and affect their bottom lines. 
 For instance, auto dealers from 35 states are converging on their senators' offices this week to seek an exemption from legislation that would treat them as financial lending institutions subject to new federal regulations. 
 ''I don't think the level of concern could be any higher,'' David Hyatt, vice president for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said Monday. ''There's a sense of urgency. And we've got to raise awareness about why this doesn't make sense and why it's anticonsumer.''
 Like the automobile industry, many financial sectors unrelated to Wall Street are seeking exemptions -- or ''carve-outs'' as their Washington lobbyists call them -- to shield themselves from the impact of the new regulations. Unless a bipartisan deal is reached first, those exemptions are likely to be considered as amendments once the legislation reaches the Senate floor for a final vote, probably this week. 
 As Mr. Colwell, the Check 'n Go lobbyist, suggested, much of the concern from the private sector has focused on what the legislation could do, and disagreement is wide over what it actually would do.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee, said Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC that it was a ''red herring'' for opponents to suggest that the legislation would harm ordinary businesses and reduce the number of jobs.
 Most Congressional Democrats and administration officials would not comment on the record on Monday on the concerns of nonfinancial companies, partly because they said many parts of the legislative proposals were still under discussion in an effort to garner Republican support in the Senate. 
 ''The bill doesn't target those companies,'' said Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Senate financial services committee. ''It targets the financial companies, and it changes things for financial companies.''
 She said that opponents of the legislation from the Chamber of Commerce and elsewhere have sought to stir concerns and ''gin up everybody'' over what are often unfounded concerns about wider implications for businesses across the country.
 Legitimate or not, those concerns have taken hold across a wide swath of private companies, interviews show. From the Chamber of Commerce down to retail outlets and small manufacturers, the businesses have adopted a similar rallying cry: we didn't get the country into this mess, and we should not be penalized for it.
 Typical was a missive last week from the head of USAA, the military-based insurance company, imploring its customers to contact their senators with their concerns about the legislation. 
 ''Rarely in our 87-year history have we turned to USAA members to weigh in with elected representatives on an issue of great importance,'' wrote Joe Robles Jr., a retired general who is president and chief executive of USAA. ''But, we are now.'' He said the inclusion in the Senate bill of the Volcker Rule, proposed by the former Federal Reserve chief Paul A. Volcker, prohibiting financial institutions from engaging in proprietary trading, would unfairly harm the company's finances. ''USAA is not like the banks and other companies that helped bring down our economy,'' he wrote. ''We do not engage in the harmful practices this legislation seeks to resolve.''
 Besides the Volcker Rule, nonfinancial companies say they are particularly concerned about the creation of the consumer protection board, which they contend could subject many businesses to increased federal regulations. 
 Some colleges and universities, for instance, say that the broad definition of financial companies would mean new regulations and, ultimately, greater costs on some types of student loans. The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, in an update on its Web site, warned of the potential financial impact.
 ''We just don't know what all the implications are or how far, if any, the bills would go into institutions operations if they are defined that way,'' said Maureen Budetti, director of student aid policy for the association. ''We don't know anything about how a bank is regulated and wouldn't want to be grouped in with them.''
 Generating almost as much opposition in the private sector is the proposed regulation of derivatives, which are used by many manufacturers and producers, in areas including natural gas, food products and agriculture, to hedge their investments against losses. Business lobbyists are seeking to exempt more ''end users,'' manufacturers and others who invest in derivatives on assets they own, as part of the final Senate package so they will not have to post large amounts of collateral on their investments.
 Some publicly traded companies are concerned about a section of the Senate bill that would allow ''proxy access'' to corporate boards and, critics say, would make it easier for unions, hostile investors and others to gain seats on a company's board. 
 Thomas Quaadman, a senior official with the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has led efforts to scale back the legislation, said, ''We are engaged in a full-court press in terms of lobbying and education on Capitol Hill'' to make lawmakers aware of what the chamber sees as the dangers of the legislation. 
 ''If you take a look at the overall bill, there are significant impacts on nonfinancial companies,'' he said. ''We agree there needs to be increased consumer protection, but we think Congress needs to go about a different way.'' 
 On the regulation of derivatives, for instance, he said that ''end user'' manufacturers, who he said make up about 10 percent of the derivatives market, would face increased costs for investing in commodities essential to their products, whether it is chocolate for a candy maker or hops and aluminum for a brewer. ''And those costs,'' he said, ''are going to be passed on to consumers.''

A bitter seven-year legal struggle between an impoverished Indian tribe and scientists at Arizona State University reached a reasonable settlement when the university's regents agreed to pay $700,000 and to collaborate on other forms of assistance dealing with health, education and economic development. Left unresolved was the underlying question of how scientists can best obtain ''informed consent'' from patients whose education and command of English may be limited. 
 As described by Amy Harmon in recent Times articles, the struggle pitted a tiny tribe living deep inside the Grand Canyon, the Havasupai Indians, against Arizona State researchers who started drawing blood samples for genetic studies two decades ago. The researchers had been asked to help the Indians cope with a devastatingly high rate of diabetes that led to amputations and forced many Indians to leave the canyon for dialysis. 
 The researchers did look for gene variants that might cause diabetes, but also for genes linked to other conditions as well. The Indians, who stumbled onto this research years later, took offense at studies of schizophrenia and inbreeding, which they thought cast a bad light on the tribe. They also deplored research suggesting that their tribe's ancestors had come to North America from Asia and had not originated in the Grand Canyon as their traditional myths contended.
 Members of the tribe say they thought the research was aimed solely at diabetes, but the scientists clearly had broader goals in mind from the start, including research on schizophrenia. More than 200 tribal members signed a consent form stating that their blood could be used to ''study the causes of behavioral/medical disorders.'' That seems broad enough to cover almost all of the studies undertaken -- except the analysis of the tribe's migration route from Asia to this continent.
 In settling the case, after spending $1.7 million fighting it, the university's regents said they had ''long wanted to remedy the wrong that was done.'' For the future, it seems important that scientists make certain that any consent is truly informed and that they describe any research likely to offend the donors with great clarity, not bury it in vague language like ''behavioral/medical disorders.'' No scientists can foresee all the research pathways that might open up over a span of years, but if they keep the donors reasonably informed they can probably head off bitterness and litigation.

HEADLINE: Parties Dig In On Reform Bill For Wall Street

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and EDWARD WYATT; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans, united in opposition to the Democrats' legislation to tighten regulation of the financial system, voted on Monday to block the bill from reaching the floor for debate. As both sides dug in, the battle has huge ramifications for the economy and for their political prospects in this year's midterm elections. 
 Republicans said they were intent on winning substantive changes to the bill and accused the Democrats of rushing the most far-reaching overhaul of the financial regulatory system since the Great Depression. Both sides say they expect the overhaul eventually will be approved. 
 Democrats charged that Republicans were leaving the country at risk of another financial calamity and siding with wealthy corporate interests. The chief executive of one such firm, Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street powerhouse accused of fraud by federal regulators, is to testify Tuesday before a Senate committee.
 Sensing political momentum at a time of deep public anger at Wall Street, Democratic leaders said they would keep the regulatory bill on the floor -- and delay the rest of their busy legislative agenda -- to ratchet up the pressure on the Republicans. 
 Democrats said they believed the fight over financial regulation -- and signs of economic recovery in many parts of the country -- could help turn the tide of anti-incumbent sentiment that has them bracing for substantial losses in November. 
 President Obama joined in criticizing Republicans for refusing to begin debate, and urged them to ''put the interests of the country ahead of party.''
 ''We are as vulnerable as we are today in the waning days of April 2010 as we were in the fall of 2008,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, who is the primary sponsor of the bill. ''Nothing has changed, except, of course, jobs have been lost, homes have gone into foreclosure, retirement incomes have evaporated, housing values have declined.'' 
 Republicans, too, see major advantage in their stance, with the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, using the issue to bolster his overarching political argument this year: that the Democrats' one-party rule in Washington is detrimental.
 Mr. McConnell, in a floor speech on Monday, rattled off a list of major legislation that he said had not benefited Americans in the ways Democrats had promised, including the economic stimulus measures and the health care legislation. ''The days of taking the Democrats' word for it are over,'' he said. 
 The vote on Monday was 57 to 41, as Democrats fell short of the 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster of a motion to proceed. 
 One Democrat, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, sided with Republicans, apparently out of concern over a provision related to tightening the rules on derivatives trading that was of particular concern to Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company controlled by Warren E. Buffett and based in Omaha. 
 At the last minute, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, switched his vote to side with the Republicans -- a strategic maneuver that would allow him to call a repeat vote, which is expected on Tuesday. Two Republicans senators, Christopher S. Bond of Missouri and Robert F. Bennett of Utah, did not vote. 
 With the exception of Mr. Nelson's opposition, the result was expected: Republicans had warned for more than a week that they would block floor debate of the legislation. 
 In the days ahead, the fight in the Senate seems likely to hinge on a question raised forcefully in recent days by Mr. McConnell: Does the legislation still contain loopholes that could allow future taxpayer-financed bailouts of failed financial institutions? 
 Democrats say the bill is written specifically to prevent such bailouts, and have accused Republicans of blatantly misrepresenting the measure. 
 But Republicans insist government bailouts are still possible. They pointed to language, for instance, in a chapter on liquidating failed banks that established a ''strong presumption'' of losses for creditors and shareholders. Some Republicans say those losses should be mandatory. 
 Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said Republicans wanted to prevent a collapse like the one in 2008 but warned that Democrats were in danger of strangling the economy with excessive regulation.
 ''We shouldn't put in place a regulatory regime that overly reacts and, as a result, significantly dampens our capacity to have the most vibrant capital and credit markets in the world,'' he said. 
 After meeting briefly on Monday, Mr. Dodd and Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, reported no progress. 
 The bill, developed in months of talks between senators in both parties, would touch every aspect of the financial system. 
 It would authorize the government to shut down a financial institution deemed to pose a threat to stability of the system, using a $50 billion fund financed by big banks to help the failed company meet financial commitments while it is being wound down. 
 The bill would also establish a consumer protection agency intended to end predatory lending practices and require that consumers receive detailed information on mortgages, credit cards and other financing. It would provide new oversight of hedge funds and impose tough rules on the trading of derivatives, the financial instruments at the center of the 2008 economic crisis. 
 It would restructure the federal system of bank regulation, moving many small banks out from under the Federal Reserve, while providing shareholders of public companies with greater say in electing directors and an advisory role on executive pay. 
 The Republicans said there were numerous problems in the Democrats' legislation -- from the omission of provisions dealing with the mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to disputes over the specific language. They said the bill would give too much power to the new consumer protection bureau. 
 Republican aides on the banking committee said they were working to finalize their own version of a financial regulatory bill, but they said it was unclear when, or if, they would release it. 
 Mr. Nelson last week supported the new derivatives rules as a member of the Agriculture Committee, which shares jurisdiction on derivatives because it oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That bill would have exempted the holders of existing derivatives contracts from posting collateral or margin requirements. 
 But in the deal reached over the weekend among Democrats, that provision was removed, angering Mr. Nelson, Congressional aides said.

HEADLINE: A Crowd With Pity For Goldman

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Beverly Hills, Calif.
 It once was called the ''Predator's Ball,'' the annual conference held by Michael R. Milken where Wall Street's titans celebrated their victories. Now, more than two decades later, the hottest topic here is how one of the biggest predators -- Goldman Sachs -- looks to be one of the prey.
 Inside the halls of the Beverly Hilton, Mr. Milken, the onetime ''junk bond king'' of Drexel Burnham Lambert who fell from grace and has resurrected himself as a successful philanthropist, has turned his former Predator's Ball into a thought-provoking three-day event about the economy, politics, health care and energy. 
 The running narrative at Mr. Milken's confab is quite the opposite of the national mood: Many of the attendees seem to side, or at least sympathize, with Goldman, out of a belief that Goldman had done nothing wrong in helping clients place bets that the housing bubble was going to burst.
 ''I don't want to use the word childish ... but it's childish.'' That's how Kenneth Griffin, the founder of the Citadel Investment Group, described the Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to pursue a civil fraud case against Goldman for the firm's role in creating a subprime mortgage-related investment that turned sour, costing some investors more than $1 billion in losses. Mr. Griffin was standing in the corner of a ballroom at Mr. Milken's conference Monday saying that the Goldman case was politically motivated.
 ''I think that the disclosure around one transaction being the justification to vilify Goldman Sachs or to pass regulatory reform is just incredible,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''I think the Goldman Sachs case has clearly energized the Democrats with respect to passing the regulatory reform.''
 Marc Lasry, the founder of Avenue Capital, said of the mood in Washington, ''Everything is 20/20 hindsight -- you shouldn't have done this, you shouldn't have done that.''
 ''The government is going for the jugular,'' Meredith Whitney, a Wall Street research analyst who spotted the subprime bubble early, said between panels. ''Sadly,'' she said of Goldman's reputation, ''the damage is already done.'' She added that, while Goldman is now being singled out, ''everyone was in the same soup.''
 A subtext emerged during the first morning of the conference with some attendees drawing parallels between the aggressive stance of the government toward Goldman and the way Drexel and Mr. Milken were prosecuted.
 Many attendees are longtime friends and acolytes of Mr. Milken, including Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Management (and former Drexel man); Ted Turner, whose Turner Broadcasting was financed, in part, by Drexel, and Lewis Ranieri, the ''godfather'' of mortgage-backed securities. 
 Some have long felt that Mr. Milken, who popularized the junk bond market, was unjustly prosecuted, even though he ended up pleading guilty to six felony counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, paying $600 million in fines and spending 22 months behind bars. His firm, Drexel, went out of business.
 There is no comparison between the problems of Goldman, which faces a single civil charge, and those of Drexel years ago, which faced criminal charges. But the perspective from many here is that both wrongly became the subjects of inquisitions, though even juxtaposing the two feels a bit far-fetched and unfair, given the many differences. 
 ''I have to imagine that the people in that company are pretty sad that they are being compared to Drexel Burnham,'' Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of the $120 billion California State Teachers' Retirement System, said about Goldman. (And yes, Calstrs is a Goldman client.)
 Despite the constant chatter, most attendees quieted down around Mr. Milken himself. A group of executives discussing the Goldman and Drexel cases in the hallway Monday morning went silent as Mr. Milken, dressed in a bright orange tie and wearing a bright smile, passed by. Through his spokesman, Mr. Milken declined to comment.
 The prevailing view among the attendees is that Goldman got too big, too fast -- and too arrogant. Goldman's transformation from one of the oldest, most respected names where clients came first to an aggressive trading firm whose mission wasn't to avoid conflicts of interest, but to ''manage'' them, has become the poster boy for what went wrong on Wall Street. 
 Indeed, while some participants here were defensive about Goldman, there was also a sense that some relished what the case might do to a powerful competitor. Mr. Griffin, who is both a defender and client of the firm, still was quick to point out that, in his eyes, there is little reason Goldman (or Morgan Stanley) should be granted bank holding company status by the Federal Reserve, which helps them borrow money cheaply while still taking risks that investment banks do. ''We have two investment banks parading around as banks,'' he said. 
 Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, one of the world's largest money managers, was more circumspect about the vilification of Goldman and Wall Street.
 ''Because of the origins and the impact of the global financial crisis, we have now entered an historical phase in which most industrial country governments will restrain banks through the wide use of regulatory, tax and enforcement tools,'' he said. ''People can debate for hours whether this should happen or not. The fact is that it will happen.''
 While most agree that the system needs to be reformed, the worry, at least in Beverly Hills, is whether the reform will go too far -- in contrast to the rest of America, where many feel the reform won't go far enough.
 Mr. Milken, who has never been a big fan of regulation, recently offered his own answer to the problems plaguing Wall Street and the economy. His suggestion? We all need better -- and longer -- memories.
 ''Time and time again, problems emerge from a failure to heed the lessons of history,'' he recently wrote, ticking off a list of similar reasons for boom-and-bust cycles to the one we just experienced.
 ''America's future economic health depends on a more-careful reading of financial history.''

HEADLINE: Whirlpool Doubles Its Profit as Demand Revives

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation said Monday that its first-quarter profit more than doubled as sales of its appliances improved both domestically and overseas.
 Whirlpool, the world's largest appliance maker, raised its 2010 earnings forecast above Wall Street's expectations and its stock rose $9.98 or 10 percent, to $112.42 a share. 
 Whirlpool, which sells Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air and its namesake brand, did not say whether a federal rebate program to increase sales of energy efficient products helped sales but analysts largely expect it did.
 Last year's stimulus bill financed a $300 million program that offered rebates to buyers of energy-efficient appliances.
 Whirlpool said it earned $164 million, or $2.13 a share in the quarter, up from the $68 million, or 91 cents a share, it earned a year earlier and above the $1.33 a share that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected. 
 The company, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., said revenue rose 20 percent to $4.27 billion from $3.57 billion, topping estimates of $3.79 billion.
 Whirlpool now anticipates a 2010 profit of $8 to $8.50 a share, up from its earlier forecast of $6.50 to $7 a share and above analysts' projection of $7.08 a share.
 In the first quarter, revenue in North America grew 7 percent, to $2.3 billion as unit shipments of major appliances rose 6 percent. Whirlpool predicted unit shipments would rise 3 percent to 5 percent in the United States this year, up from a previous forecast for a 2 percent to 4 percent increase.
 European revenue increased 6 percent, to $739 million, with unit demand essentially flat.
 Latin American revenue jumped 65 percent, to $1.1 billion, mostly on higher sales volumes, increased productivity and the effect of a weaker dollar. The appliance maker anticipates appliance shipments to Brazil will grow about 10 percent in 2010, compared with an earlier outlook for a 5 percent to 10 percent rise.
 In Asia, revenue surged 60 percent, to $192 million. Whirlpool also raised its full-year unit shipment forecast for the region.

HEADLINE: We Have Met the Enemy and He Is PowerPoint

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the leader of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, was shown a PowerPoint slide in Kabul last summer that was meant to portray the complexity of American military strategy, but looked more like a bowl of spaghetti.
 ''When we understand that slide, we'll have won the war,'' General McChrystal dryly remarked, one of his advisers recalled, as the room erupted in laughter.
 The slide has since bounced around the Internet as an example of a military tool that has spun out of control. Like an insurgency, PowerPoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession. The amount of time expended on PowerPoint, the Microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts, graphs and bullet points, has made it a running joke in the Pentagon and in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 ''PowerPoint makes us stupid,'' Gen. James N. Mattis of the Marine Corps, the Joint Forces commander, said this month at a military conference in North Carolina. (He spoke without PowerPoint.) Brig. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who banned PowerPoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar in 2005, followed up at the same conference by likening PowerPoint to an internal threat. 
 ''It's dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control,'' General McMaster said in a telephone interview afterward. ''Some problems in the world are not bullet-izable.'' 
 In General McMaster's view, PowerPoint's worst offense is not a chart like the spaghetti graphic, which was first uncovered by NBC's Richard Engel, but rigid lists of bullet points (in, say, a presentation on a conflict's causes) that take no account of interconnected political, economic and ethnic forces. ''If you divorce war from all of that, it becomes a targeting exercise,'' General McMaster said. 
 Commanders say that behind all the PowerPoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion, critical thinking and thoughtful decision-making. Not least, it ties up junior officers -- referred to as PowerPoint Rangers -- in the daily preparation of slides, be it for a Joint Staff meeting in Washington or for a platoon leader's pre-mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of Afghanistan. 
 Last year when a military Web site, Company Command, asked an Army platoon leader in Iraq, Lt. Sam Nuxoll, how he spent most of his time, he responded, ''Making PowerPoint slides.'' When pressed, he said he was serious.
 ''I have to make a storyboard complete with digital pictures, diagrams and text summaries on just about anything that happens,'' Lieutenant Nuxoll told the Web site. ''Conduct a key leader engagement? Make a storyboard. Award a microgrant? Make a storyboard.''
 Despite such tales, ''death by PowerPoint,'' the phrase used to described the numbing sensation that accompanies a 30-slide briefing, seems here to stay. The program, which first went on sale in 1987 and was acquired by Microsoft soon afterward, is deeply embedded in a military culture that has come to rely on PowerPoint's hierarchical ordering of a confused world.
 ''There's a lot of PowerPoint backlash, but I don't see it going away anytime soon,'' said Capt. Crispin Burke, an Army operations officer at Fort Drum, N.Y., who under the name Starbuck wrote an essay about PowerPoint on the Web site Small Wars Journal that cited Lieutenant Nuxoll's comment. 
 In a daytime telephone conversation, he estimated that he spent an hour each day making PowerPoint slides. In an initial e-mail message responding to the request for an interview, he wrote, ''I would be free tonight, but unfortunately, I work kind of late (sadly enough, making PPT slides).''
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates reviews printed-out PowerPoint slides at his morning staff meeting, although he insists on getting them the night before so he can read ahead and cut back the briefing time.
 Gen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and says that sitting through some PowerPoint briefings is ''just agony,'' nonetheless likes the program for the display of maps and statistics showing trends. He has also conducted more than a few PowerPoint presentations himself.
 General McChrystal gets two PowerPoint briefings in Kabul per day, plus three more during the week. General Mattis, despite his dim view of the program, said a third of his briefings are by PowerPoint. 
 Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was given PowerPoint briefings during a trip to Afghanistan last summer at each of three stops -- Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif and Bagram Air Base. At a fourth stop, Herat, the Italian forces there not only provided Mr. Holbrooke with a PowerPoint briefing, but accompanied it with swelling orchestral music.
 President Obama was shown PowerPoint slides, mostly maps and charts, in the White House Situation Room during the Afghan strategy review last fall.
 Commanders say that the slides impart less information than a five-page paper can hold, and that they relieve the briefer of the need to polish writing to convey an analytic, persuasive point. Imagine lawyers presenting arguments before the Supreme Court in slides instead of legal briefs. 
 Captain Burke's essay in the Small Wars Journal also cited a widely read attack on PowerPoint in Armed Forces Journal last summer by Thomas X. Hammes, a retired Marine colonel, whose title, ''Dumb-Dumb Bullets,'' underscored criticism of fuzzy bullet points; ''accelerate the introduction of new weapons,'' for instance, does not actually say who should do so. 
 No one is suggesting that PowerPoint is to blame for mistakes in the current wars, but the program did become notorious during the prelude to the invasion of Iraq. As recounted in the book ''Fiasco'' by Thomas E. Ricks (Penguin Press, 2006), Lt. Gen. David D. McKiernan, who led the allied ground forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, grew frustrated when he could not get Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander at the time of American forces in the Persian Gulf region, to issue orders that stated explicitly how he wanted the invasion conducted, and why. Instead, General Franks just passed on to General McKiernan the vague PowerPoint slides that he had already shown to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary at the time.
 Senior officers say the program does come in handy when the goal is not imparting information, as in briefings for reporters.
 The news media sessions often last 25 minutes, with 5 minutes left at the end for questions from anyone still awake. Those types of PowerPoint presentations, Dr. Hammes said, are known as ''hypnotizing chickens.''

HEADLINE: Meet the Real Villain of the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By BETHANY McLEAN. 
Bethany McLean, a contributing editor for Vanity Fair, is writing a book about the financial crisis with Joe Nocera of The Times.

 BODY:
TODAY, we will have the pleasure of watching outraged members of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations fire questions at a half-dozen executives from Goldman Sachs. The firm first attracted anger for its return to making billions, and paying its employees millions, right after the financial crisis. And since the Securities and Exchange Commission this month charged Goldman with fraud over an investment tied to subprime mortgages, politicians have turned the firm into the arch-villain of the economic collapse. 
 But the transaction at the heart of the S.E.C.'s complaint is a microcosm of the entire credit crisis. That is, there are no good guys here. It's dishonest and ultimately dangerous to pretend that Goldman is the only bad actor. And the worst actor of all is the one leading the charge against Goldman: our government. 
 Each of the supposed victims here was, at best, a willing accomplice. Let's start with those who bet that the investment in question, Abacus 2007-AC1, would be profitable for them: a bond insurer called ACA Capital Holdings and a German bank named IKB Deutsche Industriebank. These companies allegedly didn't know that Goldman, in exchange for $15 million in fees, had allowed a client, the hedge fund manager John Paulson, to help design the investment in order to improve the odds that it would fail. 
 But there was nothing hindering ACA's ability to see that mortgages sold to people who probably couldn't pay weren't great investments. Meanwhile, the company's insurance arm was covering as many subprime mortgages as it could to increase its own short-term profits. In some ways, the ACA story is the A.I.G. story: The company thought it had found free money -- and basically bankrupted itself. 
 Similarly, the German bank advertised itself as a sophisticated investor, but didn't seem to have bothered to analyze the subprime-backed bonds it was buying. The bank just relied on the AAA rating and, not surprisingly, pretty much bankrupted itself, too. 
 Which brings us to the rating agencies that stamped over 75 percent of Goldman's Abacus securities with that AAA rating, meaning the securities were supposed to be as safe as United States Treasury bonds. They did the same to billions of dollars worth of equally appalling securities backed by subprime mortgages at other firms. Without the cravenness of the rating agencies, there would have been no Abacus, and no subprime mortgage crisis. 
 None of this excuses Goldman. Whether the transaction was legal or not, there's a difference between what's legal and what's right. Goldman, where I worked at a junior level from 1992 to 1995, has always held itself up as a firm that adheres to a higher standard. ''Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business'' is one of Goldman's 14 principles. There is no way to square this principle with the accusation that Goldman did not tell a customer who didn't want to lose money -- the very definition of a buyer of AAA-rated securities -- that the investment it was selling had been rigged to amplify the chances that it would, yes, lose money. 
 Transactions like this one open up a window into modern finance, and the view is downright ugly. This deal didn't build a house, finance a world-changing invention or create any jobs. It was just a zero-sum game that transferred wealth from what Wall Street calls ''dumb money'' (often those who manage the public's funds) to a hedge fund. It certainly belies what Lloyd Blankfein, the firm's chief executive, told me last fall: ''What's good for Goldman Sachs is good for America.'' Could the scary truth be that, at best, the success of one has nothing to do with the success of the other?
 Yet, in the end, it comes down to this: Goldman Sachs, ACA Capital, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and even the rating agencies never had any duty to protect us from their greed. There was one entity that did -- our government. 
 But it was the purported regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, that used their power not to protect, but rather to prevent predatory lending laws. The Federal Reserve, which could have cracked down on lending practices at any time, did next to nothing, thereby putting us at risk as both consumers and taxpayers. All of these regulators, along with the S.E.C., failed to look at the bad loans that were moving through the nation's banking system, even though there were plentiful warnings about them. 
 More important, it was Congress that sat by idly as consumer advocates warned that people were getting loans they'd never be able to pay back. It was Congress that refused to regulate derivatives, despite ample evidence dating back to 1994 of the dangers they posed. It was Congress that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment and commercial banking, yet failed to update the fraying regulatory system. 
 It was Congress that spread the politically convenient gospel of home ownership, despite data and testimony showing that much of what was going on had little to do with putting people in homes. And it's Congress that has been either unwilling or unable to put in place rules that have a shot at making things better. The financial crisis began almost three years ago and it's still not clear if we'll have meaningful new legislation. In fact, Senate Republicans on Monday voted to block floor debate on the latest attempt at a reform bill.
 Come to think about it, shouldn't Congress have its turn on the hot seat as well? Seeing Goldman executives get their comeuppance may make us all feel better in the short term. But today's spectacle shouldn't provide our government with a convenient way to deflect the blame it so richly deserves.

HEADLINE: Air Force Tanker Deal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your article about the French manufacturer European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company's decision to bid as the prime contractor for the Air Force's $35 billion tanker contract (''Boeing Faces Tanker Rival After All,'' Business Day, April 21) did not mention that the company's proposed tanker aircraft benefits from $5 billion in ''launch aid'' subsidies, which the World Trade Organization recently ruled illegal. 
 EADS will try to use this significant financial advantage to undercut its American competitor Boeing, just as the French company has done in the commercial airline industry since 1992, at the expense of tens of thousands of American jobs.
 President Obama has made enforcing corporate accountability one of the signature goals of his administration, recently attacking wrongdoing on Wall Street. Pentagon officials should take cues from the president by disgorging EADS's tanker bid of illegal subsidies.
 Handing a plum defense contract to a company that violates international trade laws simply rewards the bad corporate behavior that the president is trying diligently to stop. Moreover, it would unfairly outsource tens of thousands of American jobs in the midst of a recession.
 We should always encourage vigorous competition for federal contracts. But we should also insist that the competition be fair and that the competitors respect the rule of law.

HEADLINE: Credit Buoyed Housing, But Came at a High Cost

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Realtors, home buyers and sellers are rushing to complete sales agreements before the tax credit for home purchases expires this week. 
 Home buyers must have a deal by April 30 and close by June 30 to qualify for the federal tax break, up to $8,000 for first-timers and $6,500 for those merely moving to a different residence. 
 Though the Treasury Department and the real estate industry have termed the program a success, helping 1.8 million people buy homes, many tax policy experts say it has been singularly cost-ineffective: most of the $12.6 billion in credits through end of February was collected by people who would have bought homes anyway or who in some cases were not even eligible. 
 The credit has caused a surge in sales and has been widely lauded for helping to stabilize prices. In places like Lafayette, Ind., where the number of homes sold in March was up 48 percent over last year, real estate agents say they have been inundated with buyers like James and Aubrey Green, students at Purdue University, who said the credit had persuaded them to jump into the market.
 ''We were happy in our apartment, but $8,000 was just too much to pass up,'' said Mr. Green, 29, who shopped furiously with his wife for two months before signing a contract in March to buy a three-bedroom ranch. 
 ''We bid on a couple places that didn't work out,'' he said, ''but we always made sure we had a backup plan because we didn't want to miss the deadline for the credit. And when we finally agreed to a contract, it was this huge relief.'' 
 For every home buyer like the Greens, real estate agents say there are at least three others who collected the credit even though they would have bought without it. That means for each new buyer who was truly lured into the market by the credit, the federal government paid more than $30,000.
 In addition to legitimate buyers, tens of thousands of people who collected the credit were not qualified. An audit by the Treasury Department's inspector general released last year found that hundreds of millions of dollars in credits went to people who had not yet bought homes or who were not first-time home buyers, as the program initially required. 
 Hundreds of others who received the credit were not old enough to sign a binding contract, the audit found, with some as young as 4 years old. 
 ''There's a political appeal to offering government aid to homeowners because it affects a lot of people,'' said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, who now teaches at the University of Virginia. ''But if you weigh the cost and the results, you have to wonder whether it's a failure of imagination.'' 
 The home buyers' credit was actually an amalgam of three separate programs. It began in spring of 2008 as a $7,500 tax credit that taxpayers were required to repay on their tax returns over a 15-year period.
 After the financial crisis that fall and taxpayer anger over the hundreds of billions in bailout money being directed to banks and Wall Street firms, a broad subsidy for middle-class homeowners had wide political appeal. So Congress sweetened the plan -- dropping the repayment requirement and increasing the credit to $8,000 -- and included it in the economic stimulus bills. 
 Last November, with the residential market beginning to rebound, Congress extended the period for five months and added a $6,500 credit for existing homeowners looking to relocate.
 After the number of homes sold in January and February dropped to record lows, sales rose 6.8 percent in March from a year earlier, as buyers raced to cash in before the credit expired. Nearly half of all March home sales involved first-time buyers, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 ''It's true that a lot of people who got the credit might have bought without it, but they might have bought in 2012 or 2013,'' said Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, who worked for 30 years as an agent. ''This got them to buy in 2009 and 2010, when we needed to shore things up.''
 But the program was open to widespread misuse. The first two phases of the credit did not require taxpayers to prove that they had actually bought a house. The Treasury's inspector general found in October 2009 that the I.R.S. had allowed $139 million in credits to people who had not yet bought homes, and $479 million to taxpayers who were not first-time buyers.
 The I.R.S. resisted proposals to require proof that a home had been bought, with officials saying that the additional paperwork would be too onerous because it would prevent returns from being filed electronically. Tighter restrictions were nonetheless enacted: as of last fall, those claiming the credit were required to file a paper return and provide documentation that they had bought a house.
 I.R.S. officials say that examiners found more than 70,000 taxpayers who had improperly claimed the credit, but were unable to say how much money had been recovered. Frank Keith, an I.R.S. spokesman, said that given the complexities of the program, ''we did an effective job'' administering it.
 Some tax policy experts suggest that the federal government might have used the money more effectively by creating a program to help unemployed homeowners stave off foreclosure.
 ''If you tried to address the supply side of the housing market rather than the demand side, you could target your resources more effectively,'' said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. ''And you'd also have the benefit of helping to keep people from losing their homes instead of subsidizing people who were going to buy anyway.''
 But other economists say that, whatever its inefficiencies, the home buyers' credit had a valuable effect on the psychology of millions of Americans who were alarmed to watch their largest investment lose value.
 ''The tax credit helped to stanch the price declines, which had substantial benefit for the entire economy,'' said Mark Zandi at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''The home is still the largest asset on most people's balance sheet, so when prices are falling, nothing works for most families. But now people can take a deep breath and think clearly again.''

HEADLINE: Reaping Power From Ocean Breezes

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
More than 800 giant wind turbines spin off the coasts of Denmark, Britain and seven other European countries, generating enough electricity from strong ocean breezes to power hundreds of thousands of homes. China's first offshore wind farm, a 102-megawatt venture near Shanghai, goes online this month, with more in the pipeline.
 But despite a decade of efforts, not a single offshore turbine has been built in the United States.
 Experts say progress has been slowed by a variety of factors, including poor economics, an uncertain regulatory framework and local opposition. 
 When the Obama administration announces a decision this week on the most prominent project -- Cape Wind, off the coast of Massachusetts -- it could have implications from Long Island to Lake Erie. An approval from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar might well nudge the project to completion as the nation's first offshore wind farm. On the other hand, some developers say a thumbs-down could gut America's offshore wind industry before it ever really gets started.
 ''It is imperative that Cape Wind gets built -- we need the momentum,'' said Peter Giller, chief executive of OffshoreMW, an upstart developer with ambitions to build two 700-megawatt projects off the shores of New Jersey and Massachusetts.
 At least half a dozen offshore wind projects that could provide electricity for hundreds of thousands of customers have already been proposed in the shallow waters off the East Coast and the Great Lakes. Even more are in the paper-napkin stage, including a project that would place a bank of turbines about 13 miles off the Rockaway peninsula in New York.
 Although offshore wind farms are roughly twice as expensive as land-based ones, developers and advocates say offshore projects have several advantages. Sea and lake breezes are typically stronger, steadier and more reliable than wind on land. Offshore turbines can also be located close to the power-hungry populations along the coasts, eliminating the need for new overland transmission lines. And if the turbines are built far enough from shore, they do not significantly alter the view -- a major objection from many local opponents.
 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has estimated that about 90,000 megawatts of electricity could be extracted from offshore winds in United States coastal waters less than 100 feet deep, the easiest and most cost-effective depths. Most of that potential lies in New England, the mid-Atlantic and the Great Lakes.
 If the handful of American projects on the drawing board are built as planned, they would produce some 2,500 megawatts, according to the American Wind Energy Association, or about as much as two midsize nuclear power plants.
 The Cape Wind project would place 130 turbines, each 440 feet tall, over 24 square miles of Nantucket Sound at a likely cost of more than $1 billion.
 Opponents have argued that the venture is too expensive and would interfere with local fishermen, intrude on the sacred rituals and submerged burial grounds of two local Indian tribes and destroy the view.
 ''Cape Wind's oversized costs do not represent a reasonable return on the public's investment,'' wrote Joseph P. Kennedy II, the former congressman and president of the Citizens Energy Corporation, a Boston nonprofit group, in a letter to The Cape Cod Times in February. Mr. Kennedy's family owns property that looks out on the proposed wind farm site.
 ''Citizens Energy has been involved in alternative energy development for decades,'' Mr. Kennedy continued, ''but we do not include in our business model a plan to pick the public's pocket.''
 But proponents of the project, which include major environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, point to a February study by Charles River Associates, a consulting firm hired by Cape Wind's developers, suggesting that the project could save New England ratepayers $4.6 billion in energy costs over 25 years. They also say that the project has undergone two separate environmental impact analyses, neither of which found significant downsides.
 The governors of six East Coast states -- Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island -- last week called on Mr. Salazar to approve the project.
 But even if Mr. Salazar gave the approval, opponents of Cape Wind would probably continue to challenge it in court and the company would still need to strike a deal with a utility to buy the power.
 Jim Gordon, president of Energy Management, the firm heading the Cape Wind project, is weary but resigned. ''It's hard whenever you're a pioneer trying to do a first of a kind,'' he said. ''We always recognized that this would not be an easy path.''
 Despite Cape Wind's struggles, a small but determined wind industry has emerged elsewhere, proposing several ocean projects off the shores of New Jersey, Delaware and Rhode Island, as well as freshwater projects in the Great Lakes near Cleveland and Chicago.
 The industry got a boost last Wednesday when the Obama administration asked for formal expressions of interest from companies that might want to build wind projects off the Delaware coast.
 Still, many hurdles remain.
 Regulatory uncertainty has made offshore wind development a haphazard affair. It was only last year that the Interior Department approved final regulations for granting leases, easements and rights-of-way for renewable energy development in federal waters. Within three miles of the Atlantic coast, or on the Great Lakes, states have jurisdiction -- and some have not even begun the rule-making process.
 An even bigger impediment has been the high cost of building and maintaining turbines in a harsh marine environment, where equipment must be fortified to withstand crashing waves, hurricane winds, corrosive salt and, in the case of the Great Lakes, winter ice.
 The current price tag for a fully installed offshore wind system is estimated at $4,600 a kilowatt, nearly double the $2,400-a-kilowatt price for a land-based system, according to the U.S. Offshore Wind Collaborative, a coalition of public and private organizations and institutions promoting the industry.
 ''The reason there are no offshore wind farms in the U.S. has more to do with the fact that there are plenty of land sites yet to be developed,'' said Sam Jaffe, an energy analyst at IDC Energy Insights, a market research and consulting firm. ''Why on earth would you go offshore, which is more expensive, when you still haven't developed North Dakota?''
 In Rhode Island, a $200 million, 28.8-megawatt demonstration project being developed in state waters by Deepwater Wind was tripped up late last year when the local utility, National Grid, declined to enter into an agreement to buy power from the project, citing its ''unreasonable'' cost.
 After the governor, Donald L. Carcieri, intervened, National Grid agreed to buy the electricity for 24 cents a kilowatt-hour. But late last month, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission rejected the deal as too expensive for ratepayers, who would bear the cost.
 By comparison, production tax credits and other incentives have driven the cost of land-based wind power to less than 5 cents a kilowatt-hour in some places, and that's still more expensive than other sources like coal and hydropower.
 Despite the upfront costs, proponents say offshore wind power is worth it if it can reduce the reliance on carbon-intensive sources of electricity like coal.
 ''People should be cautious of thinking that protecting the viewshed protects the place,'' said Kert Davies, a research director with Greenpeace who has closely watched the Cape Wind venture. ''The truth is that every model shows that the cape and islands and Nantucket are going to be drastically different places if climate change continues apace.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HOLLAENDER, MARY MCMAHON

 BODY:
HOLLAENDER--Mary McMahon, born March 12th, 1925 died at her home on Saturday. Mary graduated magna cum laude from Fordham University. She went on to NYU's School of Retailing on a fellowship. 
By the time she received her master's degree, Macy's had already recruited her. At Macy's she quickly rose through the ranks and went on to have an illustrious career, rising to the level of senior vice president, one of a few women with that title. Mary was often called on to speak and loved to work with young people. Teaching at the Fashion Institute of Technology afforded her a way to mentor. Her interest in business was very broad, which is why she enjoyed her membership in the prestigious Economic Club. Mary laughed easily and had a warm and friendly smile. But those of us who knew her well, knew that her warmth was not a sign of weakness and that she had determination and tenacity in all that she did. Mary traveled extensively for business and developed many lasting relationships. On one business encounter in 1954 she met William Hollaender, another Macy's employee. They married a year later. Mary's home, like herself, were well known. She lived in the first "Cinderella" brownstone in Park Slope in Brooklyn, which was part of the beginning of the revitalization of Brooklyn and the Brownstone Revival Movement led by her dear friends the late Evelyn Ortner and her husband Everett. Mary's generosity, affable smile and infectious laugh will be missed. Left to mourn are Daniel McMahon, nephew, Susan Elchick, niece, both of Annapolis, MD, Kathleen Jones Silber, cousin, of Brooklyn, Richard Jones, cousin, of Manhattan and a host of close friends. Visiting hours are Wednesday from 2-5pm and 7-9pm at Joseph G. Duffy Funeral Home, 255 9th Street, Brooklyn, NY 718-499-8700. Mass of Christian Burial Thursday, 9:45am at St. Francis Xavier Church. Interment to follow at Greenwood Cemetery.

HEADLINE: Eager to Rebuild Willets Point, City Faces Legal Fight From Property Owners

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
It is one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's signature projects -- the sweeping transformation of Willets Point, a slice of Queens that has long been among the city's most neglected pieces of real estate. And a little over a year ago, it seemed like a done deal.
 The City Council approved the proposal, which would sweep aside the car-repair shops, junkyards and small factories in the shadow of Citi Field to make room for 5,500 apartments, parks, office buildings, stores, restaurants and a hotel.
 Many of the largest property owners agreed to sell to the city, and the city could use eminent domain to force out those who refused. 
 But a convergence of a Park Avenue lawyer known for toppling big projects, a sawdust maker bent on keeping the family business where it has been for decades, and a pair of highway ramps that exist only on paper threatens to doom Mr. Bloomberg's grand vision.
 The ramps, which would connect Willets Point to the Van Wyck Expressway, seemed like a minor detail at first and never came up during the noisy public hearings before the Council's vote. 
 But, as it turns out, they are critical to the project's survival.
 ''It's our smoking gun,'' said Michael B. Gerrard, a lawyer who helped lead the monumental battle to defeat Westway, a proposed underground highway along Manhattan's West Side that opponents said would have imperiled the striped bass population of the lower Hudson River. 
 Mr. Gerrard, a senior counsel at Arnold & Porter, is now banking on the ramps to kill Willets Point. He has mounted a legal challenge against the project on behalf of a group of small landowners in the area who joined forces and pooled their money to fight City Hall.
 The $3 billion project could generate 80,000 vehicle trips a day, and the ramps are meant to help move cars in and out. The city cannot use eminent domain unless the ramps are approved by the Federal Highway Administration and the state's Department of Transportation. 
 The Highway Administration ''has to consider whether new access will protect the traveling public,'' said Cathy St. Denis, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
 Steven C. Russo, a private environmental lawyer hired by the city to guide it through the ramps' approval, said that the ramps would improve traffic because they would give drivers more ways to get on and off the Van Wyck. 
 The city has bought or has agreements to buy 64 percent of the land in Willets Point from 22 of the area's 74 landowners, and it hopes to start work on the project next year. 
 But the 20 landowners represented by Mr. Gerrard are accusing the city in a motion filed in Manhattan Supreme Court of deliberately underestimating the volume of traffic the project would generate and playing down the difficulties in getting state and federal approval for the ramps. They want a judge to order the city to redo its environmental review. 
 ''We're beyond, 'Don't take my land.' We're done crying,'' said Jake Bono, 34, whose grandfather Jacob opened the family sawdust business, Bono Sawdust Supply, on 126th Place in 1933. ''We're out there to prove the city is wrong.''
 Besides Mr. Gerrard, the project's opponents also hired Brian Ketcham, a traffic engineer who filed the original lawsuit that scuttled Westway, and Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist who has helped defeat several high-profile Bloomberg initiatives, including the mayor's congestion pricing plan and his proposal to convert the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall. 
 They have seized on a pair of traffic reports prepared by the city and the reports' differing conclusions to make their case. One report, using calculations based on 2017 traffic projections, estimated that about half the vehicles traveling through Willets Point would use the proposed ramps to access the Van Wyck. The other report, using 2035 projections, estimated that about 15 percent of traffic through the development would use the ramps. 
 Mr. Russo said that the report finding a high number of cars using the ramps did not take into account that drivers might seek other ways in and out of Willets Point, while the other one did. ''To expect two models that are built under different criteria and assumptions'' to yield the same conclusions, Mr. Russo said, ''is just wrong.''
 The traffic reports are part of the city's final application for the ramps, which has yet to be submitted to the federal and state agencies, Mr. Russo said, adding that ''some of these numbers are going to change.'' 
 Traffic volume will be a critical factor that federal and state officials will consider when they decide whether to approve the ramps. 
 David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that the opponents are ''looking to create a false impression of uncertainty around a project that is going to clean up one of the most polluted sites in the five boroughs and generate thousands of jobs.'' 
 Few believe that Willets Point does not need help, but many opponents are angry at the way the city has pursued its plan. The owners of smaller businesses, in particular, are leery about how the city will help them find homes elsewhere.
 Mr. Bono is the third generation of his family to draw its livelihood from sawdust. ''The city says it will relocate the businesses, but who is going to want a sawdust factory in their backyard?'' he asked. ''If we leave here, that will be the end.''
 He and the other landowners who are part of his group, which calls itself Willets Point United, have spent nearly $2 million in their quest to stop the project. 
 Along the way, some of Mr. Bono's partners ultimately decided to reach deals with the city. So he has found new allies, knocking on doors and searching property records to find other owners. 
 He recruited people like Irene Prestigiacomo, 66, a former flight attendant who inherited her late husband's auto sales business, and Janice Serrone, 51, whose husband was killed by one of his workers at his auto glass business. 
 Ms. Prestigiacomo said that after her husband's death in 1989, the airline she worked for filed for bankruptcy, so she had to take over the business while raising their daughter, Jennifer. She divided the building and rented spaces to auto-repair shops and a deli, learning to negotiate leases and handle conflicts.
 ''Jennifer is graduating from law school in May, so I've accomplished my mission,'' she said. ''I want my tenants to have a chance to do the same right where they have been for years, where their clients can find them, where they've established themselves.''
 For Ms. Serrone's son, Vincent, who runs the business, Abco Glass, the fight is personal. ''This is my father's business,'' said Mr. Serrone, 21. ''It's his place. He started it and in some ways it's like he's still here with me. I'm not going to surrender.''
 As a veteran of many skirmishes over ambitious projects, Mr. Gerrard predicted that the back and forth over the ramps' approval ''could go on for years.'' 
 ''My clients are prepared to fight this all the way,'' he added. ''The existence of their business, their livelihood, is at stake. It's an all-or-nothing mission for them.''

HEADLINE: Deal on Redevelopment of Railyards May Still Be Weeks Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Related Companies, the real estate concern, appear to be weeks away from a final agreement on the long-delayed $15 billion redevelopment of the railyards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
 Under a deal unveiled Monday, Related would commit to the project with a $21.7 million down payment. But the company would not have to close on the project -- and therefore start paying the 99-year lease -- until after the city's real estate market improves.
 The arrangement addresses a sticking point in a negotiation that began in 2008, when the economy was still going strong. The deal had been delayed by protracted negotiations and the strains of the economic downturn, as financing for major real estate endeavors has dried up.
 Details of the plan, which must still be approved by both parties, were discussed on Monday at a meeting of the finance committee of the transportation authority's board. The full board will vote on the deal on Wednesday, and a spokeswoman for Related said she expected a signed contract within weeks.
 Under the plan, Related would commit to a 99-year lease on the 26-acre railyards for $1 billion, the original price. But three specific measures of the real estate market, including average prices for Manhattan co-op and condo sales, must be met before the company would be forced to close on its contract; in the earlier plan, Related would have had to close within 150 days of signing.
 ''It acknowledges the reality of the economic situation,'' said Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the authority. ''And it retains the value of a deal that was negotiated during the boom.''
 Members of the authority's board, who received details of the deal on Sunday, expressed frustration that they had no time to review the plan before being asked to approve it. ''I really feel that in these big developer deals we get the bum's rush,'' said Doreen Frasca, a board member. The finance committee issued no recommendation on the plan.
 After signing the contract, Related will still have to post another $21.7 million in the following 12 months. But the new plan allows the developer to post a promissory note in lieu of cash.

HEADLINE: Learning About U.S. Immigration With The New York Times

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH, KATHERINE SCHULTEN and MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: A comprehensive collection of resources including five ways to teach about current immigration issues; 40 related lesson plans and crosswords; links to Times multimedia on the topic; and links to useful materials around the Web. 

 BODY:
 Update: May 21, 2013 
In this post, we present six quick ways to teach about current issues in immigration as well as a list of nearly 40 immigration-related lesson plans, useful Topics pages and multimedia from The Times and rich resources from around the Web.
Teachers: Tell us how you teach immigration.
 1. Immigration reform: Students can research the issues related to immigration reform, including border security, the economic impact of foreign-born workers, and paths to citizenship for those who have entered illegally. Then, if you want to take the idea further, they can draft an immigration bill, debate provisions and take a vote.
 2. Immigration's impact on public schools: Use these interactive graphics to examine the impact of immigration on diversity in America's classrooms and study the growth in the number ofEnglish-language learners in American public schools. 
Inspect the statistics in your own school district and consider different perspectives about how young immigrants should be taught in public schools. Read an article and watch a video about the case of a Virginia school that teaches English-language learners in separate classrooms from native English speaking students. 
To explore the topic further, teachers can use this lesson with secondary students or this lesson for elementary students. 
 3. Who are today's immigrants? Listen to the personal stories of immigrants in the United States who work white collar jobs and read about how immigrants today are evenly distributed across the economic spectrum. Analyze a chart that illustrates the relationship between immigration and economic growth and another that shows which cities have the highest percentage of immigrants working in white collar jobs. Compare what you have learned about immigrants in the United States today to stereotypes about immigrants to the United States. 
Teachers may want to wrap up this examination of the lives of immigrants in the United States today using this lesson, which has students interview an immigrant in their community.
 4. Immigration past and present: Surf the Times's Immigration Explorer, read about who's coming to America today, and examine charts and graphs that illustrate contemporary immigration statistics. Students can also use a Times interactive map in which they can browse local data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, based on samples from 2005 to 2009.
Record what you find using the Coming to America handout (PDF). Teachers can have students explore these resources further using the "Coming to America" lesson plan. They might also do activities in this lesson plan about the American Dream, or in this lesson in which students write letters from imaginary immigrants to relatives in their countries of origin. 
 5. Immigration and your community: Explore the Times series Remade in America, which examines immigration through seven different lenses: schools, workplaces, hospitals, politics, businesses, social services and . 
Pick one of the lenses as a focus and examine the multimedia feature that accompany the article. Then use the Times' Immigration Explorer to find immigration data about your own community and add information about your own community to your findings. Or, split students into seven groups to investigate immigration from all seven lenses.
 6. Arizona's immigration law: In April 2010 Arizona passed a law aimed at identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants. The law was hotly debated because critics charged that it promoted racial profiling and discrimination against all Hispanics regardless of their citizenship status. Since then five other states adopted similar legislation patterned after Arizona's law. In June 2012 the Supreme Court issued a split decision upholding part of Arizona's law while blocking other parts. 
Investigate different perspectives on the law here,here and here. You might also examine President Obama's and Senator McCain's opinions of the law. And read what the Supreme Court had to say about Arizona's law, including dissenting opinions. 
Then, tell us what you think about Arizona's legislation and the Supreme Court's ruling.

HEADLINE: European Countries Are Cautioned to Be Even-Handed in Assisting the Airlines

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and NICOLA CLARK. 
Nicola Clark reported from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union warned governments on Tuesday against lavishing emergency aid on airlines to make up for losses from disruptions caused by the volcano eruption in Iceland. 
 But it proposed other measures to help them recover from the weeklong shutdown of air travel.
 The European Commission's own estimate of losses ranged from 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros ($2 billion to $3.3 billion), taking into account losses by airlines, airports and tour operators, said Siim Kallas, the European Union transport commissioner. 
 The International Air Transport Association last week estimated lost revenue for airlines from the stoppage to be $1.7 billion, but that was before adding in the cost of hotels and meals that airlines have paid for stranded passengers.
 Air traffic levels in Europe have been back to normal since Thursday, according to Eurocontrol, the agency responsible for coordinating European air traffic management. According to the agency, more than 100,000 flights were canceled from April 15 to April 22.
 Seeking ways to help airlines without giving one carrier an advantage over others, Mr. Kallas said that airlines should be allowed to expand their use of night flights to ensure that stranded passengers were returned home and backlogs of freight could be delivered.
 He also proposed temporarily easing the rules governing the way takeoff and landing slots were allocated at airports. Airlines are worried that the weeklong shutdown would affect the formula that is used to determine when an airline should lose a slot because it had failed to use it enough. 
 The European authorities offered the same relief after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in the United States, when flights were similarly disrupted. The North Atlantic routes are important to the profitability of many of Europe's leading carriers.
 Other measures to help airlines with short-term cash-flow problems could include temporarily deferring the so-called en-route charges normally paid by airlines to air traffic control, he said.
 But Mr. Kallas also warned European governments against doling out excessive amounts of emergency aid to air carriers that already were flailing before the crisis. ''Any support must respect a level playing field,'' he said. Financing ''must be granted on basis of uniform criteria,'' he said, adding that the competition authorities in Brussels would scrutinize such aid.
 The chief of the International Air Transport Association, Giovanni Bisignani, has suggested that European governments are responsible for the financial losses because they demanded unnecessary airspace closure.
 Anthony Concil, a spokesman for the transport association, said that many airlines were already using their allocated slots less before the ash cloud shut down air traffic because the economic downturn had reduced demand. Before the ash-related shutdowns, European airlines were expected to lose $2.2 billion this year, after a $3.5 billion collective loss in 2009, according to the association.
 The association has also been lobbying hard for government reimbursement of expenses for accommodation and meals that airlines had incurred in compliance with the European Union's so-called passenger bill of rights. The rules oblige any airline flying from European Union countries either to rebook the passenger and to pay for hotel stays and meals or to reimburse the passenger in full in the event of cancellations.
 But Mr. Kallas cautioned them against expecting too much. ''There is not a sack of money waiting somewhere for this kind of crisis,'' he said, adding that European transport ministers would discuss the proposals at a meeting on May 4 in Brussels.
 John Hanlon, a spokesman for the European Low Fares Airline Association, welcomed the commission's acceptance of the industry's case for compensation. But he expressed concern that the measures might allow governments to offer loans or loan guarantees to traditional carriers that were struggling even before the volcano erupted.
 ''We are totally for compensation, but it has to be specifically linked to verifiable costs incurred,'' Mr. Hanlon said. ''Loans and guarantees would appear to be the wrong mechanism for that.''

HEADLINE: Here to Aid His Family, Left to Die On the Street

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
He persuaded his father to bless his departure from their poor village in the mountains of Guatemala by laying out a plan. He would go to New York, work hard and save enough money to buy his family a bigger piece of land. 
 The young man, Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax, and his father, Juan Pablo Tale, kept in touch, and during the next eight years, Mr. Tale-Yax seemed, to his father, confident that he would fulfill his promise. 
 The last time they spoke, early this month, he told his father, ''I will get through the difficulties and carry out the plan,'' Mr. Tale recalled in a telephone interview from his hometown, a place called La Esperanza, Spanish for hope.
 What the father did not know was how far the plan was from becoming reality. 
 Mr. Tale-Yax, 31, made his living as a day laborer, and when the economy crumbled, so did his job prospects. He wound up homeless and took to drinking, but he hid his difficulties from his family and refused any offers of help, his older brother, Rolando, said. 
 A grainy surveillance video trained on a street in Jamaica, Queens, on April 18 captured the final moments of Mr. Tale-Yax's life: A couple argues, Mr. Tale-Yax comes to the woman's aid, the man stabs him in the stomach and runs away. 
 Helping a stranger was the last act of a broken man. 
 ''Sometimes alcohol made Hugo angry,'' said Rolando Tale-Yax, who lives in Jersey City. ''But he was a good person.''
 The video has made headlines across the globe, not for its brutality, but for the indifference it seems to convey. It shows Mr. Tale-Yax lying face down for more than an hour on a sidewalk on 144th Street, near 88th Road, as dozens of people walk past him. 
 Detectives took a photograph of his face and showed it to people in the area until they found someone who knew his first name and led them to his brother in Jersey City. They were still looking on Tuesday for the man who stabbed Mr. Tale-Yax and the woman whom he tried to protect. 
 To the day laborers who gather at 89th Avenue and 139th Street in Jamaica, a spot Mr. Tale-Yax frequented, he was something of a mystery -- a quiet man and a skilled carpenter who was there one day and then was not. 
 He walked by them some weeks ago, but held his head low and did not say a word, one of the men recalled. 
 Another said that he used to see him sleeping at a playground on 91st Avenue near the Van Wyck Expressway. 
 Rolando Tale-Yax, who is 38, said his brother told him that he was too embarrassed to concede defeat and go back to Guatemala. He found out that his brother was homeless when they bumped into each other at a niece's birthday party in Queens a couple of months ago. 
 By then, the younger Mr. Tale-Yax had moved from a shelter in Brooklyn to a shelter in Manhattan and then to the streets of Jamaica, where he was killed. 
 He was one of six children: Rolando and another brother, Edgar, came to the United States before him, though Edgar settled in Houston. 
 They are K'iche, one of the many Mayan people who live in the Guatemalan highlands. At home, they helped their father raise corn in a tiny plot that barely yielded enough for the family's survival. 
 To help their parents, they set their sights on the United States.
 ''Life is hard here, but you can accomplish things when you want it,'' said Rolando Tale-Yax, who works as a cook's helper when he cannot find work in construction. 
 The Guatemalan Consulate in New York will pay to repatriate Mr. Tale-Yax's body, as it has for other destitute Guatemalans who have died in New York, said Rosa Maria Merida de Mora, the consul general. 
 Mr. Tale-Yax's relatives and friends plan to gather on Wednesday at a small funeral home, La Fe, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, for a service. 
 Afterward, his body will make its trip home, reversing a trek that cost him $6,000 and took him 14 days to complete; he walked through Mexico into Texas. 
 His body will travel by bus to La Esperanza, where, his father said, he will be buried in the cemetery next to the church where he was baptized.

HEADLINE: Grand Makeover Is Set For Maryland Strip City

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Over the last century, Rockville Pike in Montgomery County, Md., has grown, unfettered and unplanned, into a sprawling strip city -- a hodge-podge of shopping centers, parking lots and gridlocked traffic that frustrates motorists and discourages pedestrians.
 But now, a grand makeover is planned for one section of the pike, which begins as Wisconsin Avenue in Washington and is officially State Route 355, that would create a pedestrian boulevard using the principles of the ''smart growth'' movement. Planners say it could be a model for transforming clogged suburban arteries into livable, walkable communities with denser development and less sprawl, an improved quality of life and a healthier tax base. 
 The project, called the White Flint Sector Plan, is a collaboration of major developers, planners, politicians and community groups whose interests are not often in sync. A partnership of six developers, normally competitors, got it off the ground.
 ''Developers got together three years ago and said 'We can't move forward unless we solve this traffic problem,' '' said Rodney A. Lawrence, a principal of the JBG Companies. JBG, based in Chevy Chase, Md., is completing a 24-story apartment tower and retail complex known as North Bethesda Market, which was begun under a previous plan but is in line with the new one. 
 The White Flint plan, which is expected to take 20 to 25 years to complete, aims to create a new destination where residents live, dine, work and shop, all within walking distance. All together, there would be 9,800 new residential units and 5.69 million square feet of commercial space.
 Developers will be allowed higher densities than current zoning permits, in return for providing more amenities and also by paying farmers in the county's 93,000-acre rural preserve to keep their land in agriculture. They would be required to finance infrastructure improvements through the creation of a tax district. 
 The county would seem to have the potential to support such a large-scale undertaking, with a population of nearly one million, up from 757,027 in the 1990 census. ''Montgomery County has really been a bedroom community until recently,'' said Stephen Z. Kaufman, senior partner in Linowes & Blocher, a real estate law firm in Bethesda, Md. ''Now it's really a linear city, and White Flint is one of those neighborhoods in the linear city.''
 The county council approved the White Flint plan March 23, but only after gaining the support of adjoining suburban neighborhoods worried about losing their leafy appeal among the new adjoining high-rises, which they feared would generate more traffic on their streets along with other urban problems.
 ''Some still don't want to see the scale of what's recommended, but not a majority,'' said Duchy Trachtenberg, a county council member who lives in Old Georgetown Village, a nearby 98-unit townhouse development. ''Most are satisfied it will be staged appropriately. People are yearning for a sense of community. They're really looking forward to development of the boulevard.'' 
 In fact, though, the plan is not expected to decrease traffic but to shift it by creating more parallel roads and cross streets, and by making driving less appealing than mass transit. There will still be six traffic lanes, but bus rapid transit will run along a median strip between two existing Metro rail stations, from which it is about a 25-minute ride to downtown Washington.
 Surface parking would be drastically reduced to 20 to 30 acres, from 161 acres today, while high-rise offices and apartment buildings will contain several levels of garage parking. 
 While it might seem folly to start such an ambitious plan in an uncertain economy, supporters say the time line works in their favor. ''The nice thing,'' said Evan Goldman, director of development for Federal Realty, one of the partners, ''is that it will be another year before we work out financing the infrastructure. That will allow the economy to improve before anyone has to pull the trigger.''
 But another obstacle may be that, despite the recession, many businesses along Rockville Pike remain very strong, said Mr. Lawrence of JBG. The challenge, he said, is ''to incentivize people to take down viable businesses to do something greater, to give enough density to terminate leases and take a big bet on the future.''
 The plan takes its name from White Flint Mall, which when it opened in 1977 was the Washington area's most fashionable shopping destination, featuring a Bloomingdale's and a Lord & Taylor. 
 The pike has long been a subject of citizen concerns. In 1895, county commissioners appropriated $2,000 for its improvement. The road was reported in bad shape again in 1911 when citizens clamored for more repairs at a cost of $25,000. That year, according to a report in The Washington Post of July 31, 1911, a driver received a ticket for going 30 miles an hour, a speed many motorists on the pike would be happy to reach today.
 North Bethesda Market, the JBG development, is directly across Rockville Pike from the White Flint Mall, and has 187 units in the residential glass tower, the tallest building on the pike and ''a model to show people what we're going to do,'' said Rollin Stanley, the county planning director. It will also have 210 low-rise units, a Whole Foods Market, an LA Fitness center, an Arhaus furniture store, 90,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, and a plaza adorned with sculpture. Rents would range from $1,570 for a studio to $4,540 for some three-bedroom units.
 Ms. Trachtenberg, raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said she was looking forward to the plan becoming reality. ''I grew up being able to walk to the bake shop, library, a few blocks to get on the train,'' she said. ''Having grown up in a city environment, I always tease my husband our next home will be an apartment overlooking Rockville Pike.''

HEADLINE: A Force or a Farce?

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- It has been reported that England's national soccer team will sleep in special tents to prepare for the altitude in South Africa, site of the coming World Cup.
 This undoubtedly came as a relief to many, given where a couple of high-profile players were said to be slumbering lately in scandals that cost defender John Terry his captaincy and his fellow defender Ashley Cole his marriage.
 If England was as entertaining on the field as it has been in the tabloid bedroom farces, it might have won five or six World Cups, not one, on distant home soil in 1966. Alas, succeeding national teams have never quite shouldered the consuming expectation and sensationalist culture that makes ''Footballers' Wives'' seem less like a soapy television drama than a gritty documentary. 
 Another World Cup approaches, with England opening against the United States on June 12, amid the usual blustery confidence and nervous concern. On one hand is the belief that as inventor of the game, England has a manifest destiny to win. On the other, there is fear that things will end achingly and prematurely in the quarterfinals, as they always seem to, more than likely against its historic rivals in war and soccer, Germany and Argentina, which eliminated England in three of its past five World Cup appearances. 
 The gnawing absence of another championship has become known as 44 years ''of hurt.'' Public hope and torment are best captured in the lyrics of ''Three Lions,'' a song reference to the English coat of arms worn on the national team's jerseys:
 Everyone seems to know the score
 They've seen it all before
 They just know
 They're so sure
 That England's gonna throw it away
 Gonna blow it away.
 Phil Cornwell, an actor, comedian and soccer pundit, said: ''We're hostage to the fact that we've won it before. We feel we should win it every time. The collision of hope and anguish, that's the appeal for me. Glorious failure. We thrive on that.''
 Unfulfilled expectation plays out against an evolving post-imperial, post-industrial national identity, said David Goldblatt, author of ''The Ball Is Round.'' As Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have gained more governmental autonomy in Britain, the sense of what it means to be English becomes more urgently tied to the national soccer team, he said.
 ''The BBC is British, the army is British, the Parliament is British, the royal family is British,'' Goldblatt said. ''Where do you express what is English? In the national football team. The Church of England and the opera are not the stuff of which nationalism is made.''
 A nation's hopes this year rest largely on the convalescence of forward Wayne Rooney, who has shed his impetuous youth and now uses his feet to score goals, not to stamp the genitals of opposing players, which got him ejected from the quarterfinals of the 2006 World Cup. That year England exited -- predictably enough -- on penalty kicks.
 Rooney is regarded as the second-best player in the world, behind only the wondrous Lionel Messi of Argentina, which infamously ousted England from the 1986 World Cup with help from Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal and again in 1998 after David Beckham was ejected. But Rooney, only just recovered from an injured ligament in his right ankle, has now strained a groin muscle. The country's self-assurance is also limping.
 ''The groin will be fine for the World Cup,'' Rooney said Sunday, speaking in the anatomical third person, adding that he hoped to play in Manchester United's final English Premier League match on May 9.
 ''No worries,'' he said, but this is a country where worrying about soccer is as much an obsession as playing it. Already, a torn Achilles' tendon has cost England the services of Beckham, the world's best free-kicking metrosexual.
 So far, Rooney's injuries have not summoned the hysteria of 2002, when Beckham broke a bone in his foot before the World Cup, former Prime Minister Tony Blair interrupted a cabinet meeting to comment and one tabloid asked readers to lay their hands on a full-size photo of Beckham's foot in hopes of speeding his recovery.
 Still, most people here accept that without Rooney at full strength, England has about as much chance of winning the World Cup as it does of winning the World Series.
 ''We're totally relying on one player,'' Cornwell said.
 England's fans and news media are often criticized for pressuring or tearing down star players as the World Cup approaches. There is much harrumphing that the celebrity culture of soccer has become corrosive.
 On Monday, Oliver Kay, the chief soccer correspondent for The Times of London, decried what he called malicious Internet gossip about an unnamed English star. His column received supportive online replies from readers, one of whom wrote, ''We're becoming a nation of cackling hags, waiting for the next victim at the guillotine.''
 And yet, some of England's biggest stars have brought their problems on themselves. Terry, who is married, was stripped of the captaincy of the national team in February after reports surfaced of his affair with a French lingerie model, who happened to be the estranged girlfriend and mother of the son of his England teammate Wayne Bridge.
 Bridge refused to shake Terry's hand the next time their club teams met, then removed himself from the national team, saying his presence would be divisive and distracting. Some applauded Bridge, but others criticized him for letting personal concerns override the professional ambition of winning a World Cup.
 Later, Terry inadvertently struck a security guard with his car, breaking the man's leg, after a match with Chelsea, his club team, and endured the fracturing of his own playing form. His tackling at Chelsea has grown malign, resulting in an ejection and a one-game suspension this month. Meanwhile, his father has been charged with dealing cocaine. Just a short time ago, Terry was expected to lead England at the World Cup. Now many consider him a liability.
 Cole, another Chelsea defender, has returned to health after breaking his ankle in February and is expected to start at left back in the World Cup. His marriage, though, is over, according to news accounts, which have portrayed Cole as a serial philanderer of near Woodsian ambition. The dissolution of the marriage was apparently complicated by mingled finances and unfortunate calligraphy. According to The Daily Mail, Cheryl Cole, a pop singer, had Mrs. Cole tattooed on the back of her neck.
 It did not help the turbulent betrothal that a topless model somehow ended up with photographs of what she said was a pantsless Cole on her cellphone, then naughtily reciprocated. Barry Glendenning jokingly wrote in The Guardian that the model ''received anteroposterior, lateral and oblique images of the Chelsea ace's cracked tibia. She replied with naughty snaps of her sternum, clavicle and lower cervical vertebrae during hours of dreary orthopedic exchanges.''
 The coach hired to bring order to this entropic bunch is Fabio Capello, an Italian. In addition to removing Terry as captain, Capello has banned cellphones at team meals, frowned on social networking sites and told the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport that he planned to keep the team hotel alcohol-free in South Africa, leaving many to wonder whether he will initiate spelling bees and sewing circles to soothe the boredom.
 ''I don't expect I'll be sending them to the nearby casinos,'' Capello told the Italian paper.
 Access to the players by their wives and girlfriends -- known by the acronym WAGS -- was to be limited to one day between each game, Capello has said. At the 2006 World Cup inGermany, the WAGS touched off a news media feeding frenzy with their shopping and partying. Capello has likened them to a virus, which he hopes will not be contagious in South Africa. Some, though, have wondered whether, by allowing sparse conjugal visits, he is treating his players more like prisoners than athletes. Tuesday, Capello said he was reconsidering.
 Writing in 2006 in ''The Thinking Fan's Guide to the World Cup,'' the novelist Nick Hornby lamented the old days of English soccer, the war imagery, the sustenance of blood and effort in overcoming a lack of style and talent. Referring to Beckham, he wrote: ''We'd still prefer to be bombing the Germans, but after 60 years, there's a slowly dawning suspicion that those days aren't coming back any time soon, and in the meantime, we must rely on sarong-wearing, multimillionaire pretty boys to kick the Argies for us. We're not happy about it, but what can we do?''
 This widespread sense of underachievement is overblown, however, according to ''Soccernomics,'' a book that applies economic principles to the sport. Given England's relatively small population, economic decline, shallow talent pool from an over-reliance on players from lower socio-economic classes and isolation until the 1990s from the soccer revolution in Western Europe, the national team performs as well as can be expected -- or even better, the book argues.
 It is often said that English players are thwarted in development because too many foreigners participate in the highly regarded domestic league. ''Soccernomics'' suggests the opposite: Too many English players are groomed in the rapacious home league, instead of in more relaxed leagues, and too often they are hurt, tired or unfocused by the time the World Cup arrives.
 In South Africa, Brazil and Spain will be considered the favorites. England, ranked seventh in the world, will attempt to defy recent history, hoping that the sun has not yet set on the so-called golden generation of aging players that includes Terry, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Rio Ferdinand.
 ''If England doesn't win, there will be a sense of if not now, when?'' said Simon Kuper, a co-author of ''Soccernomics.'' ''A lot of big names are coming to the end. There will be a sense that we are never going to do it in our lifetimes.''

HEADLINE: The Goldman Deal and the Housing Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, in the first paragraph of its complaint against Goldman Sachs, noted, ''Synthetic C.D.O.'s [collateralized debt obligations] like Abacus 2007-AC1 contributed to the recent financial crisis by magnifying losses associated with the downturn in the United States housing market.'' 
 In fact, this transaction may not have magnified losses and may have contributed to the more efficient allocation of capital. The hedge fund manager John Paulson obviously felt that interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages in Arizona, California and Florida were overpriced owing to a combination of the bullish attitude toward this paper by other investors and the possible excessively generous debt ratings of the related structured securities.
 If more participants in the market had done more of that sooner and in greater size, the dollar-amount ''bets'' on mortgages in those states with those characteristics would have increased dramatically and possibly exceeded the amount of the underlying mortgages.
 With investors having more long exposure to interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages in those states, it would have made it more difficult for packagers to place securities backed by similar mortgages in those states. This circumstance would probably have reduced the subprime lending on adjustable-rate and interest-only mortgages in those states earlier, which may have helped moderate the housing bubble and subsequent crisis in the financial markets.
 Viewed from this perspective, activity like that engaged in by Mr. Paulson may have contributed constructively to our financial markets and the United States economy. In the context of considering reform of our financial system, we should be careful about emotional reactions to short selling and derivatives, which for years have contributed to liquid and informed financial markets.

HEADLINE: Ford Makes $2.1 Billion, Its Fourth Consecutive Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company had its best quarterly performance in six years, earning $2.1 billion, and now expects to return to profitability this year, executives said on Tuesday.
 The first-quarter profit was the company's fourth consecutive quarterly profit and reflects how much Ford has managed to increase sales with new products. It also shows how deeply the company has shrunk operations by closing plants and eliminating tens of thousands of jobs.
 The last time Ford earned a quarterly operating profit of $2 billion, in 2004, automakers sold nearly 17 million vehicles in the United States. This year, Ford expects sales for the entire industry to be fewer than 12 million. Still, the company said on Tuesday that it planned to build 625,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada in the second quarter, 9 percent more than the first quarter and 39 percent more than the year-ago period. 
 Ford's momentum is building as Toyota suffers blows to its reputation for quality, and as Ford's domestic rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, seek to overcome the damage done by their bankruptcy filings last year. Industry analysts, however, said the roots of Ford's improved position run deeper than the current woes of its competitors.
 ''This is not from the work that they've done over the last three to six months,'' said Erich Merkle, an analyst and president of the consulting firm Autoconomy.com in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''This is the turnaround they've had in place for several years now. They're in a position where they invested during the downturn in product, and now as we come out of the recession they've got the hot product in hand.''
 Based on its first-quarter results, Ford said it expects ''solid profits'' and positive cash flow from its automotive operations for all of 2010, a year sooner than it had forecast. The net profit was equal to 50 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion, or 60 cents a share, one year ago.
 ''The basic engine that drives our business results -- products, market share, revenue and cost structure -- is performing stronger each quarter, even as the economy and vehicle demand remain relatively soft,'' the company's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a conference call. ''While we are pleased with our progress we do not underestimate the challenges ahead. Even as we see positive signs in the global economy, the recovery is fragile.'' 
 Revenue increased to $28.1 billion, up from $24.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009, during the heart of the recession.
 Volvo, the Swedish brand that Ford has agreed to sell to Zhejiang Geely of China, generated a $49 million profit on $3.5 billion of revenue, but those figures were not included in the company's results, Ford said. The year-ago figures do include Volvo.
 Ford, the only one of the three Detroit automakers to avoid entering bankruptcy protection last year, has earned profits totaling $6.2 billion in the last four quarters.
 Ford also continued a trend of surpassing expectations on Wall Street, where analysts had projected a first-quarter operating profit of 31 cents a share. Ford's actual operating profit, before taxes and $125 million in one-time charges, was 46 cents a share, or $2 billion.
 The company earned $1.2 billion from its automotive operations, compared with a loss of $2 billion in the first quarter a year ago. Its financing arm earned $828 million, compared with a $36 million loss. 
 The automaker earned $1.2 billion in North America, compared with a $665 million loss a year ago. 
 ''This is a more encouraging start to the year than we anticipated,'' Ford's chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, told reporters at Ford's headquarters.
 However, Mr. Booth said the company did not necessarily expect the next three quarters to be as strong as the first, particularly if an improving economy leads to higher interest rates later in the year. 
 ''It would be unwise to think of $2 billion as a running rate for the year,'' he said. (If subsequent quarters were similar, Ford would approach its 1999 profit of $7.2 billion, the most any of the Detroit automakers has earned in their history.)
 Amid a general market downturn, Ford shares fell 6 percent on Tuesday, to $13.57, after reaching a five-year high on Monday. Analysts said investors also reacted in part to Ford's guidance that it could face stronger headwinds in coming quarters. 
 Ford still has considerably more debt -- $34.3 billion at the end of March -- than cash, which stood at $25.3 billion. The company paid off $3 billion in debt this month, but Mr. Booth declined to discuss Ford's plans to pay down more debt. 
 Analysts say Ford undoubtedly was helped by Toyota's recallof more than nine million vehicles since November, though Toyota has been increasing pressure on Ford and others with big discounts on new cars. Ford has also improved its image as G.M. and Chrysler began borrowing billions of dollars from the federal government.
 Ford's share of the United States market rose to 16.6 percent in the first quarter, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago.
 General Motors plans to report its first-quarter earnings in May. G.M. executives have said they think a profit is possible this year, and the company paid off the last of its $6.7 billion loan from the federal government last week, though it remains owned in large part by American taxpayers. 
 Chrysler last week said it lost $197 million in the first quarter but that its operations were on pace to break even this year.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Young Hispanics Face Obstacles to Integration

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A snapshot of Hispanic youngsters -- the fastest-growing group in the United States by age and ethnicity -- concludes that the obstacles and inequalities they face today ''may hinder the broader integration of Latinos into U.S. society if left unattended.'' 
 If those problems are addressed, though, the authors of the study say, ''we can expect that over time Latinos will assimilate'' just as earlier immigrant groups did, with an accompanying rise in their social and economic status. 
 More than one in five American children are Latino. While 92 percent of them are citizens, 58 percent live with one or more foreign-born parents.
 The study, done jointly by the Population Reference Bureau and the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group, found that while most Latino children were growing up in two-parent households with at least one working parent, those households tended to be poor or low-income, and in neighborhoods that are socially and economically isolated from better-off families. 
 Unless current trends are reversed, the study says, by 2030, 44 percent of poor children in the United States will be Latino, compared with one-third today. 
 But in an interview, Patricia Foxen of La Raza, who co-wrote the study, suggested that the picture could brighten as Hispanics assimilated.
 ''Other research has found that there have generally been improvements on a number of indicators for Latino children, similar to immigrant groups who have integrated into the country -- improved socioeconomic indicators, educational attainment, college attendance, etc.,'' Ms. Foxen said.
 ''Nonetheless,'' she added, ''that research has also shown that there continues to be a substantial subgroup of Latino children who continue living in poverty, do not finish high school, get stuck in dead-end jobs, etc.''
 Ms. Foxen said poverty's legacy, discrimination, alienation and a general feeling of ''not quite belonging'' were to blame. 
 Hispanics are faring better in the nation's traditional gateway cities and worse in the South, where low-paying jobs in poultry processing, furniture making and commercial agriculture have drawn the most recent immigrants. In Alabama, nearly half the Hispanic children live in households where no one age 14 and older speaks English well, about twice the national rate. 
 The Census Bureau said Tuesday that the number of people who speak Spanish at home rose to 23.4 million from 1980 to 2007, a 211 percent increase.
 The share of Latino children living in single-parent families soared six percentage points to 38 percent since 2000, a larger increase than among blacks or whites. Still, Hispanic youngsters are less likely to live in single-parent families than blacks (38 percent compared with 65 percent). Hispanics who reach the ninth grade are more likely than blacks to graduate with a regular diploma (55 percent compared with 51 percent) and Hispanic men are less likely than black men to be imprisoned at some point in their lives (one in six, compared with one in three).
 The Latino child poverty rate is almost as high as that among blacks. But among children in low-income families making up to twice the poverty threshold, Latinos and whites were more likely than blacks to have parents who were employed. Among high school dropouts, 18-to-24-year-old Latinos made more than whites' or blacks' mean earnings ($12,647, compared with $8,373 and $10,025, respectively). 
 Latinos also have much lower infant mortality rates than blacks (although their teenage pregnancy rate is higher than that of other groups). 
 Titled ''America's Future: Latino Child Well-Being in Numbers and Trends,'' the report identified a few positive developments. While Hispanic children are more likely than whites or blacks to live with mothers who have not graduated from high school, since 2000 the share in that category plunged by 10 percentage points.
 In general, the report said, ''first- and second-generation Latino youth have worse educational and economic outcomes than children whose families have lived in the United States for several generations.''
 Still, third-generation youngsters born in the United States of American-born parents (concentrated in the Northeast, where more are likely to be Puerto Rican, and in the northern Midwest) fared worse in health and proportion of single parents than first- and second-generation Latinos. 
 The study did not differentiate between native-born and immigrant blacks, nor did it compare Hispanics by place of origin. But it cited the significance of regional differences, which sometimes were a reflection of when immigrants arrived and from where. 
 In Florida, with a large and more rooted Cuban population, 34 percent of eighth-grade Latino students tested below the basic level for math. In Alabama, a newer immigrant magnet, 51 percent did. 
 Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, said Hispanic young people should be a national public policy priority.
 ''Latino youngsters are household and community influencers who -- given their potential English-language fluency, familiarity with American culture and institutions and exposure to mainstream media -- are poised to lead the successful integration of Latinos into U.S. society,'' Ms. Murguia said.

HEADLINE: China Aims to Tighten Grip On Private Communications

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China is on the verge of requiring telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to halt and report leaks of what the government deems to be state secrets, the latest in a series of moves intended to strengthen the government's control over private communications.
 The proposed amendment to the state secrets law, reported Tuesday by the state news media, defines a state secret broadly and loosely as information that, if disclosed, would damage China's security or interests in political, economic, defense and other realms. 
 The amendment was submitted Monday to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, for a third reading, the final step before being signed into law. Few measures reach that point in China without being adopted.
 The wording of the amendment, as cited by the state-controlled newspaper China Daily, suggested that Internet and telecommunications companies would have to take a more proactive stance in identifying leaks of state secrets and their sources. The paper said companies must detect, report and delete unauthorized disclosures.
 But reports by the state-run news agency Xinhua seemed less definitive about whether the companies must independently scour online transmissions for forbidden information or simply cooperate with the authorities if they suspect transgressions.
 According to Xinhua, when companies discover leaks, ''information transmissions should be immediately stopped'' and the authorities alerted. It did not say how active companies must be in uncovering unauthorized disclosures.
 Reports in the state-controlled media did not say what penalties, if any, would be imposed if companies failed to comply.
 In a related move, the Chinese government on Monday posted on a government Web site a broad definition of what constituted a commercial secret, covering information related to strategic plans, management, mergers, equity trades, stock market listings, reserves, production, procurement and sales strategy, financing and finances, negotiations, joint venture investments and technology transfers.
 Four employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto were recently convicted in China of bribery and stealing commercial secrets from a state-owned company. Their prosecution inspired widespread concern in the international business community, partly because of the lack of clarity about what was considered to be a state or commercial secret in China.
 Several analysts suggested that the amendment to the state secrets law would have limited impact. Internet service providers and telecommunications companies are already expected to fully cooperate with state security investigations.
 In one well-known case, in 2005 a Chinese journalist was sentenced to 10 years in prison for violating the state secrecy law after the authorities obtained information from Yahoo about an e-mail message he sent regarding a confidential government document. Yahoo was later severely criticized in the United States for its role in the case, and one of its founders, Jerry Yang, eventually apologized to the journalist's family. 
 ''Obviously, it adds another tool that authorities would have to snoop on people,'' said Jeremy Goldkorn, publisher of Danwei.org, a Web site about Chinese media and the Internet. ''But I don't think anybody thinks that their communications are safe from the prying eyes of the government, whether it is text messages or any other form of communications.''
 Some Chinese legal experts have questioned whether the draft amendment contradicts the government's pledge to be more open and violates China's constitutional guarantees of privacy and freedom of communication. But one legal scholar cautioned against judging the amendment before the exact wording was made public.
 China's determination to control cellphone and Internet communications more closely has been increasingly obvious in recent months.

HEADLINE: Shares Tumble, Dropping Dow Below 11,000, as Greek Debt Is Downgraded

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Financial markets on Wall Street and in Europe were rocked on Tuesday after Greece's credit rating was cut to junk status by a leading ratings agency, deepening fears that a debt crisis in Europe could spiral out of control.
 The ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, downgraded Greece's long-term and short-term debt to noninvestment-grade status and cautioned that investors who bought Greek bonds faced dwindling chances of getting their money back if Greece defaulted or went through a debt restructuring. Earlier, S.& P. reduced Portugal's credit rating and warned that more downgrades were possible. 
 The downgrades, announced near the end of trading in Europe, overshadowed some positive corporate earnings reports and sent investors running for cover on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 Investors, worried about shock waves in the broader European economy, migrated away from the euro and pushed the value of the dollar and Treasury bonds higher. The cost of insurance against a Greek default rose sharply.
 The major indexes on Wall Street posted some of their sharpest declines in more than a month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 213.04 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,991.99. The broader S.& P. 500-stock index fell 28.34 points, or 2.34 percent, to 1,183.71. The Nasdaq composite index lost 51.48 points, or 2.04 percent, to 2,471.47. 
 In London, the FTSE 100 closed 150.33 points, or 2.61 percent, lower, at 5,603.52. The DAX in Frankfurt lost 172.59 points, or 2.73 percent, closing at 6,159.51. The CAC-40 in Paris fell 152.79, or 3.82 percent, to 3,844.60. 
 The euro fell more than 1 percent, to $1.3184 from $1.3383 late Monday. Gold prices surged, while the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose nearly a full point to 99 15/32 and its yield fell to 3.69 percent from 3.81 percent late Monday.
 Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said the downgrade of Greece presented a counterpoint to the scene in Washington, where current and former executives of Goldman Sachstestified before a Senate panel investigating Goldman's bets on the mortgage market. 
 The Senate hearing quickly turned into a confrontation as senators from both parties challenged Goldman officials over their aggressive marketing of mortgage-based investments at a time when the housing market was already headed into decline.
 An initial panel of four current or former Goldman officials insisted that they had done nothing to mislead their clients. Among them was Fabrice P. Tourre, a vice president at Goldman Sachs who helped create and sell a mortgage investment that figured in a fraud suit filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Tourre, who was named in the S.E.C. lawsuit, defended his role in the sale of the investment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Mr. Tourre declared: ''I deny -- categorically -- the S.E.C.'s allegation. And I will defend myself in court against this false claim.''
 Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, testified after the markets closed. 
 If the Goldman testimony represented a post-mortem of the recent financial crisis, Mr. Yardeni said, the ratings downgrade offered another signal of what could be the next crisis.
 ''This is a signal to the markets that the situation is deteriorating rapidly, and it's not clear who's in a position to stop the Greeks from going into a default situation,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''That creates a spillover effect into Portugal and Spain and raises the whole sovereign debt issue.''
 Among companies reporting positive earnings results were 3M, DuPont and United States Steel.
 In economic data, the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose 0.6 percent in February compared with a year earlier. The increase was the first annual gain since December 2006, but the figure did little to help the market as monthly figures showed declines.
 Consumer confidence showed a surprising gain. The Conference Board's index for April rose to 57.9, up from 52.3 in March and above the 53.5 forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters.

HEADLINE: Washington President Named to Run N.C.A.A.

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Mark A. Emmert, the president of the University of Washington, was named the president of the N.C.A.A. on Tuesday, concluding a seven-month search for the successor to Myles Brand, who died last September of pancreatic cancer.
 ''This is not just another job for Mark Emmert,'' Ed Ray, the president of Oregon State University and the chairman of the search committee, said at a news conference at the N.C.A.A.'s headquarters in Indianapolis. ''He has a commitment to intercollegiate athletics and to student athletes that runs deep.'' 
 Emmert, 57, has served since 2004 as president at Washington, his alma mater. A native of Fife, Wash., Emmert earned a bachelor's degree in political science, then a master's and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse. He has spent his entire career in higher education. He was the chancellor at Louisiana State University from 1999 to 2004 and before that was the chief operating and academic officer at Connecticut.
 ''Through his leadership, intercollegiate athletics have both flourished on the field and courts and have fully integrated into the mission of those campuses,'' Ray said.
 The choice of Emmert to lead the N.C.A.A. was seen as somewhat of a surprise, because he is not well known in college athletics circles, despite having held leadership positions at athletic powerhouses. Emmert is not on any N.C.A.A. committees, said Erik Christianson, an association spokesman.
 ''I don't know him except by reputation,'' said Walt Harrison, the president of the University of Hartford, who was a candidate for the position. ''I do know the search committee. I know them well, and I have every confidence that they picked a great leader.''
 Michael Adams, the president of the University of Georgia, who was considered a contender for the N.C.A.A. position, also praised the choice.
 ''I have known Dr. Emmert for most of our careers,'' he said in a statement. ''He is a very capable and effective president and will perform likewise in his new role at the N.C.A.A.''
 Ray said 32 finalists emerged from a pool of 100, with backgrounds that ranged from academics to the corporate world and government. Final interviews were conducted Tuesday, he said.
 However unexpected, the choice continues a philosophical shift that began in 2002 with the selection of Brand, a former philosophy professor who was then the president of Indiana University. Brand was viewed as a relative outsider to N.C.A.A. politics. He was also the first university president to lead the association, which created the position in 1951.
 Brand was hailed as a crusader who spoke forcefully on topics ranging from academics to gender equity. In 2004, he helped push through academic reforms that held colleges and universities accountable for the academic performance of their athletes.
 Emmert, who received a five-year contract, said that he intended to continue Brand's legacy and that although he had no specific plans, he intended to take the reforms a step further.
 ''That has been a highly successful initiation -- initial effort,'' he said. ''It's now starting to bear very important fruit. My intention is to continue that trend.''
 Another priority, Emmert said, is helping university presidents handle the increasingly high costs of college athletics, an issue that has taken on new urgency during the recession. He said each college needed to make its own choices, but ''what the N.C.A.A. can do is arm them to make those decisions as wisely and effectively as possible.''
 When a reporter asked Emmert's view on a playoff in the Bowl Championship Series, Emmert quipped, ''Do you have any controversial questions?''
 In 2008, Emmert told a Seattle Times reporter that he believed a playoff was inevitable and shrugged off arguments against it as illusory. But on Tuesday, he refused to tip his hand.
 ''Those are decisions that presidents of the institutions will make, not the N.C.A.A.,'' he said.
 Jim Isch, the interim president, will continue in that role until Nov. 1, when he is expected to return to his previous position as chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: Obama Tells Debt Commission 'Everything Has to Be on the Table'

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama told his bipartisan debt commission on Tuesday that ''everything has to be on the table,'' while the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested overhauling the nation's tax code to raise more revenue.
 The comments of the two men, one a Democratic president and the other a Republican appointee, reflected a growing consensus that the nation's debt is growing too large to control by spending cuts or tax increases alone. Yet even as the commission opened its first meeting, both liberals and conservatives were mobilizing to oppose one approach or the other. 
 Former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the panel's Republican co-chairman, warned the panel, ''The extreme right and the extreme left will savage our final product.''
 That assumes, however, that the commission will agree to one before its Dec. 1 deadline. Expectations are low given the party polarization, especially in an election year.
 Still, administration officials have suggested that should the commission reach a deadlock, Mr. Obama could adopt proposals left on the table.
 While Fed chairmen typically stick to monetary policy and shy away from advising elected officials about budget policy, Mr. Bernanke's remarks were the latest in his recent string of calls for elected officials to make ''hard choices'' soon, before debt threatens the economy's recovery and growth.
 ''Choices regarding Medicare, Social Security and other spending programs cannot be made in a vacuum but must be combined with decisions about how much revenue the government will raise and how it will raise it,'' he said. 
 Saying that taxes should be efficient, fair and easily understood, Mr. Bernanke said, ''The U.S. tax code does not satisfy these criteria and is in need of reform.''
 Republican opponents have been criticizing Mr. Obama's commission for just that reason, however, calling it a Trojan horse for a new consumption tax similar to Europe's value-added tax, or VAT. A news release from the Republican National Committee on Tuesday was titled ''Obama's 'Show Me the VAT' Commission.''
 The six Republican lawmakers on the panel said they would not rule out tax increases as a precondition. But most made clear on Tuesday that they would focus on what several called the nation's ''spending problem.'' 
 Representative Dave Camp of Michigan took pre-emptive aim at a value-added tax, saying, ''Washington has borrowed enough from the American people.''
 But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democratic leader, denounced suggestions of an administration VAT plan as the ''musings of right-wing cable shows.''
 He also admonished ''bleeding heart liberals'' to be open to program reductions to restore fiscal balance. An hour after the commission's meeting, however, several liberal activists held a conference call with reporters to press for additional spending to create jobs, lower military spending, higher taxes for the wealthy and no cuts in Medicare or Social Security. 
 Their views were perhaps best reflected on the commission by Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. She called for more spending on infrastructure projects and education, saying that ''balancing the budget or reducing the debt are, in my mind, not goals in and of themselves.''
 Mr. Obama met privately with the commission members at the White House before their meeting at an executive office building across the street. In the Rose Garden afterward, he told reporters that he had insisted that everything be on the negotiating table. That admonition, he has acknowledged, also obliges him to be willing to set aside a campaign promise that all but the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans would not see their federal taxes rise in his term. 
 The president said that he had inherited a deficit of $1.3 trillion in 2009, with debt projected to rise by $8 trillion over the decade, and that he had taken steps to restrain its growth despite a recession. But he conceded it was not enough to avert fiscal calamity.
 ''This alone will not make up for the years in which those in Washington refused to make hard choices and live within their means,'' said Mr. Obama, flanked in the Rose Garden by two of the city's veteran politicians, Mr. Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the commission's Democratic co-chairman and formerly chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. ''And it will not make up for the failure to level with the American people about the costs of the services that they value.''
 The commission also heard dire fiscal forecasts from Robert Reischauer and Rudy Penner, each a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. While Mr. Reischauer was named by Democrats in Congress and Mr. Penner by Republicans, they agreed that spending cuts and revenue increases were needed to bring down deficits because rising health care costs and an aging population are driving them to unsustainable levels.
 ''Don't waste time looking for silver bullets or new approaches that hold out the promise of painless sacrifice,'' Mr. Reischauer said. ''There are none to be found.'' 
 The 18-member commission includes 12 members of Congress, six each from the House and Senate, equally split between the parties. Mr. Obama named six other members, including the chairmen; none are current public officeholders and two are Republicans.
 While Republicans complain that Democrats have a 10 to 8 majority, Mr. Obama in his February executive order establishing the commission required that at least 14 members must approve any recommendations sent to Congress. That gives Republicans a veto.
 The commission plans to meet monthly. Three smaller groups will meet each Wednesday on specific areas -- taxes, spending on entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, and all other spending.

HEADLINE: Celebrating U.S. Future In Space, Hopefully

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- With rock music blaring, fifth graders count down from 10-9-8 to the rocket boosters' firing up, and blasting the computer-generated astronauts toward space. 
 ''Hey, the future looks good, huh?'' says Ken Larson, jumping to center stage at the new Exploration Space exhibition here.
 Mr. Larson's job is to inspire the next generation as much as he was inspired -- by his father, a reporter who befriended the first astronauts, and by his grandmother, one of the first 10 employees here at what one plaque calls ''the hot burning center of American dreams.'' 
 The center is cooling, though. The space shuttles are scheduled to retire this year and instead of replacing them with new rockets for a return to the moon -- the plan under President George W. Bush -- President Obama wants NASA to focus on the long-term challenge of reaching deep space.
 Simply put, the United States will no longer be sending its own astronauts through the stratosphere. Instead, they will hitch rides with the Russians until around 2016, when private companies start carrying NASA astronauts and other passengers into orbit. 
 That is, if Congress goes along. Several senators, including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, have already pledged to save the rocket program, Project Constellation, arguing it is vital for space, security and the economy. 
 Here at the Kennedy Space Center, the celebration of the future now comes with asterisks. At the visitor's center, for example, which draws 1.5 million people every year, caveats have been forced into an extravaganza built for maximum wow.
 Mr. Larson's script, for instance, now includes this lawyerly line: ''We can't confirm exactly where humankind's next steps in space are going to take us.'' 
 Explicit references to Project Constellation have mostly been stripped out, with a few telling exceptions, like the metal sign near a trash can in the food court. And the moon has gone from a hot goal to a hypothetical. 
 In the video games at the center of Exploration Space, those who joystick their way to a safe landing hear, ''As soon as NASA starts a lunar program again, we'll send you an application.''
 This is partly a product of unfortunate timing. Exploration Space, the most recent addition to the visitor's center, welcomed its first guests in December. 
 Two months later, the new Obama plan surfaced, forcing changes to Mr. Larson's script after what a spokeswoman described as ''tweaks to the messaging.'' 
 Sharon Foster, a no-nonsense fifth-grade teacher from Emerald Shores, Fla., said she had hoped for more. She recalled the rush of early space flight, of the ground shaking like sand on a busy clothes dryer, while she watched from nearby as American pioneers bolted toward the heavens. 
 Ms. Foster said she hated the idea of relying on others -- especially the Russians -- to get to the International Space Station. 
 Mostly though, she worried that her students would never share her own wide-eyed experiences.
 ''I don't know where we're going to get the inspiration for the children,'' Ms. Foster said in a visit last week. ''What are we going to do to get them excited to be engineers and pilots?'' 
 The visitor's center tries. There is a feel of don't-you-get-it admonitions in the 3D Imax movie that includes Leonardo DiCaprio's asking, ''Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our planet earth?''; and in the nine billboards at the entrance that tell visitors space exploration is ''a destiny, not a destination'' because ''it is the driving force of ingenuity'' that ''fuels our economy'' and ''creates the passion to pioneer.'' 
 Two weeks ago, the president told a crowd at the space center that he, too, was ''100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.'' He highlighted a proposed $6 billion increase in NASA's budget over five years, and plans to save local jobs by refurbishing the center's aging infrastructure. 
 But Florida's Space Coast seems to want more ambitious goals that can be packaged into excitement. Foreigners now make up 40 percent of the visitors at the space center, and Mr. Larson said they often knew more than Americans about the benefits of space exploration, from satellites to research on antibiotics. 
 As he prepared for another countdown, and another presentation about the future, Mr. Larson added, ''The thirst for knowledge just isn't there anymore.''

HEADLINE: In Greeting Iowa Voters, Obama Focuses on Finances

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
OTTUMWA, Iowa -- President Obama strongly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for blocking proposed legislation to tighten regulation of the financial system, vowing that he would ''not let this effort fall victim to industry lobbyists who want to kill it.''
 Mr. Obama, returning to the scene of one of his greatest political triumphs, the 2008 presidential caucuses, struck a populist theme at a town-hall-style meeting. 
 ''It's one thing to oppose reform, but to oppose even talking about reform in front of the American people?'' Mr. Obama said to cheers from the audience. ''That's not right.''
 In keeping up the drumbeat on overhauling financial regulation, Mr. Obama sought to increase pressure on Republicans, who Democrats believe are risking a political backlash in the November elections by appearing to favor Wall Street. But Mr. Obama made no specific mention of Iowa's own Senator Charles E. Grassley, who voted against bringing the legislation to the floor, possibly reflecting the hope among White House staff members that he might eventually vote for the bill.
 Mr. Obama's appearance here in Iowa, the first stop of a two-day tour of three Midwestern states, was intended to convince voters before the midterm elections that his economic policies were working despite the high unemployment rate. 
 Though Mr. Obama did not mention the elections on Tuesday, White House officials are keenly aware that for 50 years, the party that holds the White House has typically lost Congressional seats in midterm elections when the president's average approval rating in September and October dropped below 50 percent. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama's national job approval rating has hovered near, or just below, 50 percent.
 Part of Mr. Obama's campaign-style swing through the Midwest is meant to shore up those numbers. Advisers say he is paying close attention to the midterm elections and is receiving frequent political briefings, complete with the latest poll results.
 Mr. Obama's visit to Iowa, which began along the Mississippi River in Fort Madison, was steeped in nostalgia. If one of the most valuable currencies of a president is his time, his itinerary on Tuesday stood out. He did not merely fly in and out of the state -- as he does on most visits. Rather, he lingered for a daylong journey through four towns before spending the night at the same Hampton Inn in Des Moines that he called home during the presidential campaign.
 He made unannounced stops at an organic farm in Mount Pleasant and then at Jerry's Family Restaurant, where surprised employees greeted him euphorically. He had a slice of rhubarb pie and refused to let workers brew him a fresh pot of coffee, telling them, ''No, you can give me the old.''
 Mr. Obama's sojourn into the heartland was juxtaposed against the political theater going on in Washington at a Senate hearing into the mortgage practices of Goldman Sachs.
 Mr. Obama walked onto the stage at Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa in front of a crowd of about 2,000 people who had waited hours to see him. At the same time, the chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, walked into the Senate hearing room to face the lawmakers who had waited hours to see him. 
 But unlike Mr. Blankfein's cold reception in Washington, Mr. Obama was greeted by a crowd that leaped to its feet and gave a standing ovation when he mentioned the new health care law.
 ''It is good to be back in Ottumwa,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I missed you guys!''
 He joked that things had changed since the days he slogged through the state before the Iowa caucuses. ''The last time I was here,'' he said, ''I didn't arrive in a helicopter.''
 The president conceded that the rising level of the budget deficit ''keeps me up at night.'' But he extolled the benefits of the economic stimulus plan and took issue with his Congressional critics, who he said had tried to take credit for local projects even though they voted against the $789 billion measure last year.
 But not everyone was receptive. Matt Strawn, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, argued that the stimulus had not created long-term job growth. 
 In a call with reporters, Mr. Strawn said, ''Iowans also understand that piling further generational debt on our kids and our grandkids will only exacerbate the problem, not solve it.''

HEADLINE: Community Pacts Questioned in the Zoning Process

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suffered an embarrassment last December when the City Council rejected a major developer's plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars transforming an unused armory in the Bronx, the city's poorest borough, into a shopping mall. 
 The Kingsbridge Armory project collapsed -- and the Bronx lost the prospect of hundreds of jobs -- after the developer, the Related Companies, declined to require its tenants to pay a so-called living wage of at least $10 an hour and benefits.
 The wage minimum was one of several concessions sought by a coalition of 19 community, religious and labor organizations in exchange for supporting the project -- to be formalized in a pact known as a community benefits agreement, or C.B.A.
 The coalition argued that since the mall would get public subsidies, the workers should be able to earn enough to support their families. But Related said dictating to retailers what they must pay workers would make it impossible to find tenants or financing. 
 Over the years the Bloomberg administration's view of community benefits agreements has evolved from warm support in connection with a number of projects, including Yankee Stadium, to adamant opposition. In the case of the armory, the city said that community groups had been given ample opportunity to shape the document soliciting redevelopment proposals and that no benefits agreement was warranted. 
 Now, in a report that is likely to have considerable influence on policy makers, the New York City Bar Association has urged the city to stop allowing community benefits agreements to be part of the zoning approval process. The report warns, among other things, that the agreements could create an opportunity for corruption. 
 ''It is our recommendation that the city announce that it will not consider C.B.A.'s in making its determinations in the land-use process,'' the bar association said in the report last month. The report, which was in the works long before the armory proposal was defeated, also urged the city to declare that it would no longer play a role in ''encouraging, monitoring or enforcing the agreements.'' The report acknowledged that there was no way to prevent developers from making deals with community groups. But it said the city should get involved, if at all, only when the developer was seeking a public subsidy. 
 John C. Liu, the city comptroller, has formed a task force to examine community benefit agreements and other issues related to subsidized economic development projects. He said he understood why the bar association wanted to rid the zoning process of the agreements, but he said its approach was idealistic rather than practical. ''My emphasis is on what kind of mechanisms exist to make sure that the promised benefits are delivered,'' he said.
 Community benefits agreements have proliferated around the country in the last decade, easing the way for development projects. Many, like the one proposed for the armory, have emphasized wage minimums and local hiring. 
 As one member of Mr. Liu's task force, Julia Vitullo-Martin, put it, a ''new weird principle'' had been grafted onto the ''perfectly legitimate'' idea that a developer should try to mitigate the effects of gentrification.
 ''The original concept got lost,'' said Ms. Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, an independent research group. ''Why should the developer be responsible for the wages paid by retailers? That has nothing to do with the land-use process.''
 In recent years, city officials have opposed these private agreements on the ground that the city review process provides ample opportunity for community groups to seek concessions from developers. But previously, the Bloomberg administration championed or helped foster the agreements for projects like the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn; the Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, a Related Companies project; and the expansion of Columbia University.
 While acknowledging that many residents believe that the city's formal zoning process, known as the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, ''fails to adequately consider or protect their interests,'' the bar association report raised these and other questions about the private agreements: 
 Do the groups involved in the C.B.A. truly represent the community or are they simply seeking advantages for themselves? 
 Are they experienced enough to strike a good bargain with the developer, or will they sell out too cheaply? 
 Could benefits that require public subsidy -- like affordable housing, for example -- be awarded to a particular neighborhood to win acceptance of a project rather than on the basis of where these benefits are needed most? 
 ''Our feeling was that the process wasn't satisfactory from anybody's point of view,'' said Kenneth K. Fisher, a partner at Cozen O'Connor and chairman of the bar association's land-use committee. Mr. Fisher said the bar association was particularly concerned about the potential for corruption. Creating affordable housing might be a worthy goal, he said. ''But it's another thing for a council member to tell you which affordable housing group should be developing it,'' said Mr. Fisher, a former city councilman.
 In February, City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook was charged, among things, with helping a close associate win a contract to install boilers at Yankee Stadium. A Yankees spokeswoman said at the time that the boiler contract was ''of a type that had been encouraged by the community benefits agreement.'' Mr. Seabrook has pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
 The city has not responded formally to the report. But in an e-mail message, Janel Patterson, spokeswoman for its Economic Development Corporation, endorsed the principal recommendation, saying: ''The city should not be a party to community benefits agreements. The city works with the developer and the community board, as the recognized and appropriate community representative, through the public review process (Ulurp) to ensure that a project delivers benefits for the community directly related to the project.''
 But the Related Companies' lawyer Jesse Masyr said the agreements were ingrained in the land-use process and were not likely to be eliminated. ''I don't think it's reasonable to assume that this genie goes quietly back in the bottle,'' he said. ''A better approach would be to have rules and policies as to what are the appropriate ways to handle this.''
 Mr. Masyr said he did not object to agreements that required developers to plant trees, for example, or limit their hours of operation or try to hire local residents. A bigger problem -- and the potential for abuse -- occurs when the developer is asked to write a check, he said. In 2006, for example, the city asked Mr. Masyr to help the West Harlem Local Development Corporation negotiate a community benefits agreement for the Columbia expansion. He got the university to agree to give the community $76 million in cash. 
 Vicki L. Been, a professor of land-use law at the New York University School of Law, and the prime author of the bar association report, agreed that community benefits agreements were inevitable, but she said the government did not have to participate. ''I agree that developers will do everything they possibly can not to have the uncertainty and unpredictability of community opposition,'' she said. ''What can be stopped is the government's role in that, to the extent that developers felt like they were being told, 'You had better reach a C.B.A.before you come to the City Council.' ''
 Another of the report's authors, Ross F. Moskowitz, a land-use lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, said the city needed to address this problem to let developers know in advance what they would be expected to provide and to prevent the failure of another major project. ''Hopefully, what will come out of this debate is a process that will provide standards and certainty,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Deutsche's Profit Surges, But Forecasts Are Cautious

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Bank, the largest German bank, said on Tuesday that its profit rose by a third in the first quarter of 2010, well above expectations, driven by a revival in investment banking.
 Pretax profit for the quarter ended March 31 was 2.8 billion euros ($3.7 billion), compared with 1.8 billion euros a year earlier. Net income rose to 1.8 billion euros, versus 1.2 billion euros in the first quarter of 2009.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the bank to report net income of 1.33 billion euros. 
 Though the results beat estimates, Deutsche Bank shares closed 5.5 percent lower, at 52.42 euros, amid concern about the future effect of banking regulations, as well as cautious statements by top management.
 ''The economic environment clearly stabilized in the first quarter 2010, but is not without some remaining vulnerability,'' Josef Ackermann, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement.
 The bank came through the financial crisis better than many peers and was profitable throughout 2009. But Mr. Ackermann warned that ''there is still a large degree of uncertainty'' in the global economic outlook. Governments and central banks are unwinding stimulus measures, while many countries suffer from excessive budget deficits.
 In its quarterly report, Deutsche Bank disclosed numerous civil suits filed against it in the United States, in some cases related to its sale of securities tied to the American mortgage market. But Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, said it was not the focus of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as is its rival Goldman Sachs.
 Mr. Krause cautioned that the first-quarter results might not be an indication of how the bank would perform for the rest of the year. He also acknowledged concerns that proposed levies on risky bank practices could hurt profit.
 ''We hear a lot about taxation on banks right now,'' Mr. Krause said during a conference call. ''We'll have to wait and see what finally comes.''
 Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura in London, said in a note that the share price would be held down by such concerns as well as lackluster performance by divisions other than investment banking. He singled out the consumer banking and private wealth management units.
 ''Some of the classic businesses are clearly short of target,'' Mr. Krause acknowledged. But he added: ''We are recovering in all these businesses.''
 Net revenue in the quarter rose 24 percent, to 9 billion euros, compared with 7.2 billion euros a year earlier, the bank said. Its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, fell to 11.2 percent, from 12.6 percent at the end of 2009. The decline stemmed from the acquisition last year of Sal. Oppenheim, an ailing private bank. Deutsche Bank plans to repair Oppenheim's balance sheet and use the unit to strengthen its business aimed at the wealthy.
 Most of the quarterly profit came from the corporate banking and securities unit, which nearly doubled its pretax profit, to 2.6 billion euros, in the quarter, benefiting from a pickup in the global economy, as well as gains in businesses like bond issuance.
 Deutsche Bank also took fewer write-downs from assets that had lost value and did not need to set aside as much money to cover bad loans as in the year-earlier period. Provisions for credit losses fell by half, to 262 million euros.
 Lloyds Banking Group, one of several major lenders that Britain had to rescue during the financial crisis, said on Tuesday that it had swung back to profit because of improved trading and fewer provisions against bad debt.
 In a preliminary statement, Lloyds, the largest consumer bank in Britain, said it would report a profit in the first quarter and expected to maintain the trend through the year. No figures were given.

HEADLINE: Profit and Sales Rise at DuPont

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
DOVER, Del. (AP) -- The chemical maker DuPont Company continued its turnaround with a strong first-quarter performance, as business improved across all operating units and market regions. 
 The company also increased its full-year earnings forecast as it reported earnings of about $1.14 billion, or $1.24 a share, for the quarter ending March 31, up from $488 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Revenue totaled $8.48 billion, up 23 percent from $6.87 billion, for the corresponding period last year, as DuPont benefited from volume gains, price increases and positive currency effects. The resultsbeat expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who predicted a profit of $1.06 a share on revenue of just over $8 billion.
 The company had been relying on results from its agriculture and nutrition business while units that sold coatings and other products to the automotive and housing markets struggled during the recession. Those businesses had strong gains in revenue and operating profit during the first quarter.
 DuPont's strong first-quarter performance followed a turnaround in the fourth quarter of last year, when it swung to a $441 million profit from a $629 million loss in the final three months of 2008.
 As in the fourth quarter, demand increased in DuPont's performance chemicals unit for titanium dioxide in the first three months of this year.
 DuPont officials have said that demand for products such as titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in consumer goods, house paint and automotive coatings, often indicates whether the economy is growing or contracting, particularly in the short term.
 On Tuesday, DuPont cited a recovery in the automotive and industrial markets and moderate strengthening in construction markets for improved performance in its safety and protection unit, whose products include Kevlar aramid fiber and Tyvek house wrap.
 Overall sales volume increased by 19 percent, led by a 65 percent volume increase in the Asia-Pacific region.
 Performance among DuPont's various business segments was led by the electronics and communications unit, which reported a 60 percent increase in volume on strong global demand, led by the Asia-Pacific region, and increased demand for photovoltaics.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Casino

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans have concluded that screaming foul about the banking bailout and blocking financial reform is a clever strategy for the fall elections.
 This approach ignores some pretty basic history: that the banks imploded while Republicans held Congress and the White House; that President George W. Bush started the rescue; that many Republicans voted for the bailouts; and that they stabilized a financial system that was perilously close to collapse. 
 More important, it's a distraction from the very real reasons the nation needs to tighten the rules governing finance. They were on vivid display on Tuesday in a hearing room just down the hall from the Senate floor where Republicans voted the day before to block debate on a Democratic financial reform bill.
 Current and former Goldman Sachs officials tried to defend their practice of trading incomprehensible mortgage-based investments of little demonstrable economic value and enormous destructive capacity. Instead, they underscored why much of this work should be curtailed. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Goldman of defrauding clients by selling them a complex instrument without telling them it was designed so another client could bet against it. Testifying before the Senate subcommittee on investigations, Goldman executives denied withholding information. They insisted there was nothing wrong with selling mortgage-backed products while placing bets against them. 
 They called it ''risk management.'' Most people call it stacking the deck.
 We do not know whether Goldman broke the law, but we know this gambling is too dangerous. Banks like Goldman turned the financial system into a casino. Like gambling, the transactions mostly just shifted money around. Unlike gambling, they packed an enormous capacity for economic destruction -- hobbling banks that made bad bets, freezing credit and economic activity. Society -- not the bankers -- bore the cost.
 That's why objecting to financial regulation overhaul on the grounds that it might allow future bailouts is such a specious argument. 
 The bailouts, which many Republicans acknowledged were necessary at the time, cost taxpayers about $87 billion, or 1 percent of gross domestic product. The crisis cost more. Falling tax revenues, unemployment insurance for millions of jobless workers and a fiscal stimulus to stop the economy's slide is projected to boost the federal debt to more than 65 percent of G.D.P. next year. 
 Financial reform is needed to try to ensure such a crisis never happens again, and the bill cobbled together by Senate Democrats is reasonably tough. It would ban many -- unfortunately not all -- of the private, custom-made derivatives at the center of the financial meltdown and force most derivative trading onto open exchanges. Banks trading in custom-made products would have to build larger cushions of capital to protect themselves. 
 The bill would establish a consumer protection agency to stop predatory lending, impose new oversight on hedge funds and make it possible for regulators to dismantle big banks that were deemed to pose an imminent risk of failure. And it would create a $50 billion fund, by the nation's largest banks, to cover commitments of a failing institution that was being wound down. 
 Whatever Republican campaign mailings may say, the fund was designed to avoid bailouts. The bill's failing is not that it's too weak. It's that it could be stronger.

HEADLINE: Titans of Tangled Finances Kick Up Their Heels Again

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
In Lucy Prebble's ''Enron,'' the flashy but labored economics lesson that opened on Tuesday night at the Broadhurst Theater, money doesn't just talk. It sings. It dances. It puts on funny animal costumes. And of course it blows bubbles.
 Working overtime to make an entertaining spectacle out of the Texas energy company's world-rattling implosion in the early 21st century, ''Enron'' digs deep into the vaudevillian's trunk. Ms. Prebble and the director Rupert Goold, a showman to the marrow, have come up with an assortment of annotative visual images, designed to explain both the byzantine, corrupt accounting practices that did Enron in and the moral bankruptcy of the men who ran it. 
 Yet even with a well-drilled cast that includes bright Broadway headliners like Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie, the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirror financial practices isn't much more than smoke and mirrors itself. ''Enron'' is fast-paced, flamboyant and, despite the head-clogging intricacy of its business mathematics, lucid to the point of simple-mindedness. But as was true of the company of this play's title, the energy generated here often feels factitious, all show (or show and tell) and little substance. 
 The collapse of Enron was one of the great riches-to-rage business stories in American history, even if the public memory of it grows fainter with each succeeding accusation of large-scale financial misconduct. (Goldman Sachs, anyone?) Since the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, ruining many of its share-holding employees, various how-did-it-happen books have been published. There has been a full-length documentary (''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room'') and a made-for-television movie (''The Crooked E: The Unshredded Truth About Enron'').
 But the story of Enron had not, to my knowledge, been given the full-scale theatrical treatment. You have to admire the chutzpah of Ms. Prebble, the creator of the television series ''Secret Diary of a Call Girl,'' for daring to bring to the stage a tale of such tangled finances that it has defied the analytical powers of many a business journalist and academic.
 So far, Ms. Prebble's gamble has paid off. First produced at the Chichester Festival Theater in England, ''Enron'' transferred almost immediately to the Royal Court Theater in London and subsequently settled into what looks to be a long and comfortable run in the West End, where I first saw it. British reviewers have piled on the superlatives, admiring the show's thematic audacity, moral severity and all-out razzmatazz.
 Of course, British and American tastes don't always coincide in such matters, especially when the subject is American. It will be interesting to see if the Broadway ''Enron'' becomes as hot a ticket as the one in the West End, where during that show's intermission I heard youngish men and women discussing the characters' business strategies with the ardor of teenagers debating the plot twists of the ''Twilight'' movies.
 Still, to this American -- admittedly not a biz whiz -- it seems as if ''Enron'' made the same points so arduously and repeatedly that there isn't much room left for discussion. And in making those points, the show uses more signpost symbols than the collected works of John Milton.
 Ms. Prebble and Mr. Goold are a bit more literal-minded than Milton was. The play begins with three blind mice, in business suits, tapping their canes across the stage. Before the show is over you will have seen lawyers with kerchiefs over their eyes; accountants with ventriloquist's dummies; and a little girl, the daughter of the Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling (Mr. Butz), surrounded by floating bubbles as Daddy frets over stock prices. When, toward the end, a character steps to the edge of the stage to announce that she has ''the best metaphor'' for ''the values that define price,'' your instinct is to cry out, ''Please, not another metaphor!''
 The show does have proper characters, based on real people. At the center is Skilling, who metamorphoses from a nerdy, socially challenged man with a plan into an oil-slick master of the universe. The show traces his rise and fall via his relationships with his boss, Kenneth Lay (Gregory Itzin); his rival and occasional sex partner, Claudia Roe (Ms. Mazzie); and, most important, his protege, Andy Fastow (Stephen Kunken, excellent), the guy who pioneered the ''virtual reality'' accounting that transformed Enron into both a star of financial innovation and an empty shell.
 The dialogue among these folks tends toward the macho posturing and dirty language of locker rooms, with all of them, even Roe, being measured by the size of their testicles. But unless it is used to develop, rather than merely define, character, such language doesn't take you far. The only intriguing relationship is the one between Skilling and Fastow, which feels fraught with awkward homoerotic (and possibly homicidal) impulses.
 The design team -- which includes Anthony Ward (set and costumes), Mark Henderson (lighting), Adam Cork (sound) and Jon Driscoll (video and projection) -- keeps the stage pulsing with flashing colors, televised images of public figures like George W. Bush and Alan Greenspan, rainstorms of sparks (and, later, ashes) and the inevitable LED crawl of changing stock prices. Scott Ambler has choreographed several trader ballets, including a number with luminous ''Star Wars''-style sabers, to illustrate the devastating impact of the deregulation of electricity on California.
 Within the heat of the son-et-lumiere extravaganza, the performers keep their cool, though few engage your imagination. Mr. Butz, who can usually be relied on to perk up any show, loses a distinctive hold on Skilling once the character sheds his initial awkwardness. Ms. Mazzie doesn't have much to do except talk tough and wear tight clothes. Mr. Itzin lends a tasty, ambiguously sinister edge to Lay's paternalism.
 As the ever more obsessive Fastow, who becomes Enron's chief financial officer, Mr. Kunken charts a slide into near dementia with wit and clarity. Granted, he has the great advantage of appearing with the show's most inspired visual gimmick: a set of red-eyed, dinosaur-headed creatures called Raptors, the embodiment of Fastow's debt-consuming substructures in a phantom company.
 Come to think of it, it's Fastow's relationship with the Raptors, not Skilling, that is the show's most fascinating. The vision of Fastow -- a necktie wrapped around his head -- and his raptors in his inner sanctum, just before Enron goes boom, brings to mind a war-warped, jungle-fevered character out of ''Apocalypse Now'' or ''The Deer Hunter.'' It's a hilarious, scary image and one of the few in ''Enron'' that suggests the real heart of darkness meant to be beating at its center.

HEADLINE: Power From Trash ...

BYLINE: By NORMAN STEISEL and BENJAMIN MILLER. 
Norman Steisel was the New York City sanitation commissioner from 1978 to 1986. Benjamin Miller, the author of ''Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York, the Last Two Hundred Years,'' was the Sanitation Department's director of policy planning from 1989 to 1992.

 BODY:
IT'S been 25 years since the New York City Board of Estimate, under Mayor Edward Koch's leadership, approved a plan to reduce the need for putting municipal garbage in landfills by developing facilities to burn it to create energy. At the same time, the city took the first steps toward creating a recycling program. Since then, disposal costs have risen faster than inflation, and the need to find better methods of getting rid of wastes is even greater.
 That fledgling recycling program evolved into the effective system the city has in place today, but no waste-to-energy plants were ever built. Instead, in 2001, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani closed the city's last remaining landfill, and since then the city has sent every pound of nonrecycled municipally collected trash out of the city -- about 15 percent of it to a waste-to-energy plant in Newark, but most of it to destinations in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, Virginia and South Carolina. In such places, New York's waste despoils the landscape at a rate of 140 acres a year. 
 As New York City's garbage decomposes, it releases some 1.2 million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide and its equivalents -- primarily methane -- into the atmosphere. On top of that, the fuel it takes to haul 11,000 tons of waste hundreds of miles six days a week releases an additional 55,000 tons of greenhouse gas per year.
 When commercial waste collected by private carters is added to the total, hauling New York City's waste to landfills uses half as much fuel every year as the city's taxi fleet running 24/7. The combined annual greenhouse emissions from hauling and putting this waste in landfills amount to half as much as is released to produce the city's electricity. 
 Since New York began exporting its garbage, the Sanitation Department's budget has more than doubled, to $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year from less than $600 million in 1997. And in the past seven years, the costs of the city's landfill contracts have gone up more than $90 million, enough to pay 1,000 full-time firefighters, nurses or teachers.
 So what should we do? For starters, New York should try to reduce the amount of waste its citizens produce -- for example, by imposing a fee for collection of waste but not recyclables. Much of what remains could be recycled or composted; these are the most cost-effective and environmentally benign ways to deal with waste. But they cannot handle everything that people throw out. 
 The city's Solid Waste Management Plan calls for hauling the rest of the garbage away by train rather than by truck. But while trains use only a third as much fuel as trucks do, and produce only about a third of the emissions, they will still burn some 3.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases and cost tens of millions of dollars -- all to carry away New York's garbage every year.
 We can do better. The fraction of New York's garbage that requires disposal should be processed in waste-to-energy plants -- which not only produce energy but are also cheaper and less polluting than landfills. (The city's Newark contract is its least costly disposal arrangement, and it produces only one-forty-fifth of the greenhouse gases that putting the same amount of garbage in landfills would.) If all of the city's nonrecycled waste were sent to local energy recovery facilities instead of distant landfills, the city would save diesel fuel and generate enough energy to supply 145,000 homes -- thus avoiding the combustion of nearly three million barrels of oil to generate electricity.
 The main impediment to moving ahead on waste-to-energy plans has been a lack of political will. But Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in his final term and free of electoral constraints, has the opportunity to make new plans to build a sustainable waste-management system that could serve for decades.
 Since not all of the facilities could be built at one time, the plan could include a mix of both long-established technologies and some whose advantages are just beginning to be demonstrated. The most widely used kinds of waste-to-energy facilities -- mass-burn, steam-turbine electric generators that use waste for fuel (rather than gas, oil or coal) -- are typically relatively large. Newer kinds of facilities -- like those that subject waste to hot plasma to produce a synthetic fuel gas, or those that use anaerobic digestion to make methane -- could be built on smaller sites. 
 More than a decade ago, countries in the European Union committed themselves to stop burying anything other than inert materials (like broken glass and construction rubble) that are not easily recycled, biodegraded or burned. By immediately taking steps to do the same, New York City could reduce its use of costly landfills -- ultimately by 90 percent or more. It's the only responsible way for the city to manage its waste.

HEADLINE: Putting Chef's Whites Over Her Prada

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
CLICKETY-CLACK. Here was Donatella, coming through, charging into her new $2.5-million restaurant construction site. Donatella, nervelessly pushing past the yellow caution tape to traverse the splintery floor in nude-patent-leather four-inch Louboutins. Donatella, in short-short Prada silk. Donatella, pointing. Donatella, dishing. Donatella, certamente!
 No, not that other Donatella, the Versace one. This is New York's own Donatella Arpaia, the owner of Mia Dona and Anthos, both in Manhattan, and an owner, with Michael Psilakis, of Kefi in Manhattan and Eos in Miami. Her new 75-seat Neapolitan pizza restaurant -- to open in July at 184 Eighth Avenue, near West 19th Street -- is not just another of her partnerships with chefs like David Burke and Mr. Psilakis.
 It will be the ninth restaurant she has opened, and this time she is the executive chef, since ''the menu is developed, written and tested by me,'' she said. The name of the place? Donatella. 
 She clicked through a secret passageway into yet another restaurant space fronting at 263 West 19th Street. ''This will be DBar,'' she said -- the first Donatella lounge, to open in June. ''You can see there is a lot going on here.''
 And so much more going on in the whirl of Ms. Arpaia. Suddenly, many of her projects are landing in a cluster bomb of hype she calls ''coincidental.'' For starters, get some kiss-kiss as she celebrates her new book, ''Donatella Cooks: Simple Food Made Glamorous'' (Rodale Press). Tune in as she handles Meredith and Matt in a ''Today'' cooking segment. Anticipate a Food Network reality show on Donatella-the-restaurant-consultant, if the pilot clicks. Behold her cross-branding deal with Martini & Rossi to promote its prosecco and her book. Taste artisanal olive oil from the Donatella Food Collection.
 In the 12 years since she opened Bellini in Manhattan, her portfolio has spanned that of venture restaurateur, brass-knuckle dealmaker, video tummler and fashion plate. Now -- in the words of her new publicist, Charlie Dougiello -- she is ''taking off her high heels and trading them in for a hot oven.''
 Many chefs have left their steamy kitchens to emerge as restaurateurs, of course. Why, at 38, would she want to do the reverse? ''I didn't want to be the hostess all my life,'' she said. ''I'm so much more than that. This is the only way I'm going to grow.''
 Once upon a menu, it was enough to be an owner-celebrity, like Sirio Maccioni and Tony May. ''But to make it on television now, you need to be a chef,'' said the restaurant critic Gael Greene.
 Just in time. Ms. Arpaia's once-brilliant partnership with Mr. Burke foundered in 2008; her even more lucrative partnership with Mr. Psilakis is being disassembled piece by piece. Despite those speed bumps, despite even the recession, the Donatella Group, her company, had restaurant revenues last year of $13 million. She plows profits back into her ventures, and her only grand indulgence, she said, was the yellow Lamborghini Gallardo she bought to chase those market-crash blues. ''It was a brief moment of insanity,'' she said. ''My mother wants me to get rid of it.''
 True, some might be uncharitable enough to think of her as some sort of golem of food-buzz inflation. But she is an heir to authentic red-sauce royalty.
 For 35 years her father, Lello Arpaia, ran a Long Island classic, La Tavernetta in Woodmere, which begat Lello (1980) and Scarlatti (1984) in Manhattan (all now closed). Lello won two stars from Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times in 1982 for ''unusually good and elegant food.'' Mr. Arpaia's current restaurant, Fiorini, on East 56th Street, is two blocks from her own Mia Dona at East 58th Street. And four blocks away, her older brother, Umberto, presides over Cellini, on East 54th Street.
 Lello Arpaia, Mr. Maccioni and Mr. May, all Italian immigrants, were waiter captains at Oscar's Delmonico downtown -- and all founded restaurant dynasties with their children. 
 Ms. Arpaia's partner in Mia Dona, Mr. Psilakis, left last year, and she named herself executive chef, remaking the menu in her image. If that restaurant is her homage to la cucina povera -- the peasant cuisine -- of her mother Maria's native Puglia, the new place will be not only be a celebration of her father's Neapolitan roots but also a throw-down in New York's pizza wars.
 Its five-and-a-half-ton oven, with its volcanic-mud bricks and imported sand and cement, will be built on site by Enzo Coccia, a pizza sage from Naples. The space, she said, will be ''rustic luxe''; i.e., possessing rough-hewn solidity and va-va-voom -- ''a glamorous side.''
 After all, her universe is about not only brand extensions but also hair extensions. If her business dealings reveal her as the culinary incarnation of Carly Fiorina, she also dips into the walk-in closet of Carrie Bradshaw.
 ''It's a challenge, because she has to look glamorous for certain appearances,'' said Davide Torchio, a native of Turin, Italy, who cuts her hair. (Ms. Arpaia recently invested in his Manhattan salon.) ''But not too overdone at other occasions.''
 Overdone or not, there is a certain imposing Sophia Loren-itude to her 5-foot-8 1/2-inch presence, though she says that when she was younger, she was mistaken for Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock. She is now taken for but one celebrity. Herself.
 Such is Ms. Arpaia's comfort factor that when Silda Wall Spitzer stepped out in public for the first time after the scandal involving her husband, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, ''we went to lunch at Mia Dona, and it was like being at home,'' said Lloyd Constantine, a former senior Spitzer adviser and a longtime regular of Ms. Arpaia's restaurants. Asked whether Ms. Arpaia made diners think that she cares about them, Mr. Constantine said: ''No. She really cares about them. You can't fake that.''
 The chef Bobby Flay, who has known her a decade, said ''her presence is the key to the success of her restaurants.'' He added, ''Losing her behind the kitchen doors entirely would be a great loss.''
 Of her kitchen aspirations, Mr. Burke said that ''everyone wants to be a chef,'' but that doing so in a top-level restaurant ''is something that takes years and years of practice and experience.''
 But Ms. Arpaia insists she has paid her dues. Even as a little girl, she ''was always in the kitchen,'' said her brother, Umberto, adding that she soaked up the Puglian aesthetic on summer visits to her grandmother's farm in Toritto.
 She grew up in Woodmere near the family's hugely successful restaurant, La Tavernetta, which opened in 1970. ''They were the only Italians in Woodmere, since it was predominantly Jewish,'' said Bill Kaye, a retired lawyer and devoted customer.
 She recalled that ''my name was Donatella in a town where there were no Donatellas.'' She called herself Donna, ''trying to assimilate.'' 
 Unlike Mr. May, who owns SD26 with his daughter, Marisa, Mr. Arpaia discouraged his daughter's restaurant inclinations. ''I just didn't want my daughters to go into such an extremely hard profession,'' he said. 
 Her father ''made me think I wanted to be a lawyer,'' Ms. Arpaia said. She was admitted to the bar in 1997 but ''just hated it,'' so her legal career at a Park Avenue law firm lasted but four months.
 ''I have always been fearless in business,'' she said, and at 25 she rolled the dice with the entirety of her $200,000 trust fund to start up Bellini, where, she recalled: ''I faked it till I made it. I literally pulled customers in off the street.''
 The restaurateur Joseph Bastianich said that it was daunting ''to be a woman and an entrepreneur in this male-dominated business.''
 These days, the progeny of the Arpaia, Maccioni, May and Bastianich families may be envied by restaurant nonroyals. ''But the restaurant kids, we're not spoiled kids -- we work incredibly hard,'' Marisa May said. ''Donatella and I work all the time. Clearing tables? There is nothing we won't do.''
 Though Ms. Arpaia made money at Bellini, it was her five-year partnership with Mr. Burke at the former davidburke & donatella that ''put me on the map,'' she said. ''David gave me a name.'' In fact, she insisted that her name be ampersand-ed to his, and Mr. Burke agreed. She sold out her interest to him for more than $1 million in 2008.
 An irrepressible scene stealer, Ms. Arpaia seems effortlessly able to consume all news media oxygen with a blink of her big brown eyes. Several people involved in her business partnerships, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to suffer Donatella de-friending, said that the partnerships unraveled because the food-o-sphere gave more attention to her than to her chefs. 
 Mr. Burke said only that ''one child gets neglected, and it is hard to grow that way,'' adding, ''It's confusing to the employees, about where the commitment lies.''
 Ms. Arpaia acknowledged that ''I'm very driven'' and added, ''I'm a lot to take.'' She sighed. ''But I'm not a control freak -- I have to delegate to talented people. And I'm very warm. And I'm close to my family.''
 By 2006, when Ms. Arpaia partnered with Mr. Psilakis in Dona, she was ''the known person,'' he said, so ''her name was on the awning.'' Last year he stepped away from Mia Dona, and in March she also bought him out of the haute Anthos, where they had attracted a Michelin star, rare for a Greek restaurant.
 Ultimately, Mr. Psilakis said, they parted company in these two restaurants because ''it was time,'' adding, ''She was going in her own direction.''
 They still own Eos and Kefi together, but lawsuits are possible over the division of Kefi, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to publicly discuss them. Neither Mr. Psilakis nor Ms. Arpaia would comment.
 In one of those messy culinary joint custodies, Kefi and Eos are represented by her former principal publicist of six years, Jennifer Baum, while Ms. Arpaia's newer projects are handled by Mr. Dougiello, also a spokesman for Rachael Ray. Ms. Baum declined to comment on their partial separation, save to say that Ms. Arpaia ''always had her sights set on more.'' And, oh, that she wishes her the best.
 Ms. Arpaia said, ''I was developing a lifestyle brand, and I needed fresh eyes.'' 
 With so much upheaval in her business relationships, it is perhaps just as well that she insists that she has never dated a chef. That said, ''I love men, and men love me,'' she added, noting only that she is in ''a committed relationship.'' She has been ''a driven businesswoman,'' she said, but ''I've always wanted to become a mother. And will become a mother.''
 Well, there it is then. ''Anyone who doubts that Donatella can do something,'' Mr. Flay said, ''is taking a huge risk.''

HEADLINE: Argentina Opens The Tap for Malbec

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
FOR the last few years the wine business has been riddled with dire warnings and disastrous portents. In the United States and around the world, producers have struggled with the bad economy and the sluggish market. One slender segment, seemingly alone, has not only weathered the storm but also prospered: malbec from Argentina.
 How can this be? Easy. It's the right sort of wine at the right kind of price.
Argentina is pumping out a river of malbec, and it has been flying off the shelves at an astounding rate. Since 2005, shipments of Argentine malbec to the United States have quintupled, to nearly 3.15 million cases in 2009 from about 628,000 cases in 2005, according to figures from Wines of Argentina, a trade group. 
 While Argentine malbecs can run to much more than $100 a bottle, those aren't the ones flowing out of the stores. Sales have been pushed upward by demand for inexpensive bottles.
 Unlike European wines, whose prices have been driven up by the weakness of the dollar in relation to the euro, Argentine malbecs have benefited from the strength of the dollar against the Argentine peso. With prices remaining stable, many Americans see Argentine malbecs as great values.
 But what about the wines themselves? The wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of malbec from the Mendoza region, Argentina's leading wine-producing area. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Brett Feore, the beverage director at Apiary in the East Village, and Kristie Petrullo, the beverage director at Craft in the Flatiron district. 
 About two years ago, we did a tasting of malbecs costing $25 or less. We found those wines pleasing and amiable, and I have had no cause to think our opinion of malbecs in that price range would have changed. For this tasting, we set a price cap of $50 a bottle. That's clearly more than what most people are spending on malbecs, but we wanted to see what a higher price bought. 
 We did not forsake the lower end; 10 of the 20 bottles were $25 or less. So what do you get when you spend more? Well-made wines with a little more polish and sleekness than the cheaper bottles, for one thing, and a little more richness and intensity. 
 Over all, these wines were juicy and straightforward, emphasizing fruit flavors with occasional nuances. They were consistent, generally unchallenging and crowd-pleasing. In short, what's not to like?
 That really depends on your point of view. Malbecs' emphasis on soft, ripe fruitiness over more polarizing flavors and their velvety textures make them safe and reliable for people who may be unsure of their tastes. Some of the wines we opened were a little more ripe and jammy, while others were spicier and more linear. But these were small divergences in what was largely a uniform set of characteristics. 
 This leads us to the same paradoxical, underwhelming conclusion we reached after the last malbec tasting: part of the reason malbecs are so popular is that they are not displeasing. In other words, their consistent profile is a virtue, especially for people who do not appreciate being surprised or challenged by a wine. The genre itself has become a brand.
 ''Malbecs are bringing attention to wine,'' Kristie said. ''They make people who are not really interested in wine drink wine. They order malbec -- they don't really care which one.''
 From a marketing perspective, Argentina has achieved an enviable position. These days, malbec sings out Argentina as clearly as do grass-fed beef and Eva Peron. Forget that malbec was brought over in the 19th century from France, where it's still grown, primarily in Cahors and in the Loire Valley. Argentina owns it now.
 ''Argentina has done a really good job of positioning itself,'' Brett said.
 Of the 10 bottles costing $25 or less, only 4 made our list of 10 favorites. Our top five wines were all $36 or over. 
 Our No. 1 wine was the 2006 Alfa Crux from O. Fournier, an inviting, balanced wine that may seem a bit simple now but will, I think, gain in complexity over the next few years. The Alfa Crux comes from grapes grown in the Uco Valley, at an elevation of almost 4,000 feet. The Uco Valley is quite a bit south of Lujan de Cuyo in central Mendoza, the home of our No. 2 wine, the 2007 Vina 1924 de Angeles. The Vina 1924 was smooth and polished with pleasing floral and mineral accents enhancing its potent fruit flavors.
 The consistency we found in these wines applies, of course, to those we liked. We rejected bottles dominated by oak flavors and those that seemed manipulated, resulting in cloying, sweet wines with power but no more structure than grape juice. 
 Like our top two, the other wines we liked showed admirable balance, and just enough accents to the core of fruit flavors to keep our interest. Malbecs from two of the bigger names in Argentina showed well. The 2005 Vina Francisco Olive from Trapiche had bright, spicy flavors to offset its jamminess, while the 2006 Catena Alta from Catena Zapata was fresh, mellow and pure.
 As with all our top five, these wines are by no means inexpensive. Yet compared with, say, Napa cabernet sauvignons in a similar price range they are very good values. Our best value, at $23, was our No. 6 wine, the 2007 Signature from Susana Balbo, fresh with touches of spice and licorice. 
 As the outdoor cooking season gets under way in earnest, with its plethora of grilled and roasted meats, malbecs would make fine choices. I tend to think of them the way I did of zinfandels, before so many zinfandels became top-heavy with alcohol. They are likable and powerful enough in their own right. And if you served them slightly cool, as Florence suggested, well, then you have a fine summer party wine.

 Recipe: PAIRINGS
 To be tempted by Argentina is to dream of steak on a grill, and it's no accident that the meat echoes the density of the malbecs from Mendoza. Terroir, or sense of place, helps define character and flavor. Good beef delivers atight package of sweetness, earthiness and minerality, just like the best of these wines. 
 And what would beef in Argentina be without a slather of chimichurri, the iconic parsley-based green sauce? It is both sharply hot and herbaceously cool, especially with the addition of mint to play up the whiff of eucalyptus in the wines. In this recipe, though, the chimichurri is not really a sauce. It is meant to play a more intimate role, seasoning the steak inside and out. 
 My choice of steak is hanger, which often delivers an appealing funkiness, even when it is not from grass-fed beef like that in Argentina. 
 Chimichurri Hanger Steak
 Time: 45 minutes plus 3 hours' marinating
 1 cup packed flat-leaf parsley 
 1/2 jalapeno, seeded
 1 garlic clove
 2 tablespoons minced mint leaves
 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
 1/4 teaspoon crushed red chili flakes
 Salt and pepper, to taste
 Cayenne, to taste
 3 tablespoons panko
 1 hanger steak, about 2 pounds.
 1. Mince parsley, jalapeno and garlic and mix in a bowl with mint, oil and vinegar. Season with chili flakes, salt, pepper and cayenne until it has a kick. Reserve 3 tablespoons and add panko to rest.
 2. Butterfly steak with a sharp knife, slicing it not quite all the way through, so it opens it like a book. Lightly pound any thicker areas to make meat more uniform. Spread chimichurri-panko mix on one side of cut surfaces, fold other side over and fasten the edge with metal or wooden skewers. Coat outside of steak with reserved chimichurri. Chill 3 hours. 
 3. Light grill or broiler and, while it heats, allow steak to come to room temperature. Grill or broil steak to medium rare, about 6 to 8 minutes per side depending on heat. Let rest 10 minutes, remove skewers and cut in thick slices. 
 Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Gamble Sours for Horse Breeders in Kentucky

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The for-sale signs on horse farms are as common as the bluegrass and the limestone fences here, and breeders have grown accustomed to sending horses through the auction ring and feeling fortunate when they fetch half of their asking price -- or anything at all. The run-up to the Kentucky Derby is normally an exciting time for lawyers playing matchmaker between deep-pocketed clients and owners of can't-miss stallion prospects.
 No more. 
 ''The rails are quiet,'' said Mike Meuser, a Lexington lawyer who is usually in the forefront of such deals. ''Collecting, or trying to collect money, is the bulk of my business these days.''
 The bankers have disappeared here as well. Lending to buy horses, the grease in the deal-making machine for many years, has dropped 60 percent to about $400 million from an estimated $1 billion in 2007, according to the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association.
 The decline is no small matter here in bluegrass country, where horses, all kinds, are responsible for 100,000 jobs and $4 billion in economic impact, according to association figures, and are the cornerstone of Kentucky's $8.8 billion tourism trade. It is one reason the racing industry has lobbied for casinos in the state's racetracks, a position that would have been unthinkable not too long ago. 
 Kentucky is also the heart and soul of the nation's thoroughbred industry, and when it hurts, so do farms across the country.
 Over the past two years, for example, the number of mares bred nationally has dropped 20 percent, and the number of stallions standing stud has fallen even more, by 25 percent, according to The Jockey Club. Money bet on horse races, known as the handle, is off nearly 30 percent, to $12 billion in 2009, a major decline for a once-reliable source of revenue for local governments. 
 The economic decline of racing, however, will be on full display during this year's Triple Crown season. Eskendereya, who would have been the favorite for the Kentucky Derby but was pulled out with an injury, is owned by a bankrupt stable. The owners of Pimlico Race Course, the historic racetrack in Baltimore that hosts the Preakness Stakes, are going through bankruptcy. And the New York Racing Association said it might not have enough money to hold the Belmont Stakes this year; it is trying to get a loan from the state government.
 Dynamics similar to those that brought down subprime mortgages have been at work in the horse business: no-money-down lending and a breeding market based on the assumption of ever-rising prices. 
 ''We ignored the notion of supply and demand,'' said Arnold Kirkpatrick, president of the Lexington real estate firm Kirkpatrick & Company. ''We bred too many horses, overborrowed to do it, and are now caught trying to sell them to people who don't want them.''
 Gambling is the core of the thoroughbred industry. Commercial stallion farms spend millions on accomplished racehorses in the hope they will pass on their speed and class to future generations. Breeders pay up to $150,000 to mate a mare to these studs in the hope they can land a sales topper in the auction ring.
 Lately, however, horsemen have been betting their farms and losing. There are 265 farms of more than 20 acres for sale here in the four counties of horse country -- up from 199 listed last year -- and that is not counting the more than 60 ''pocket listings'' Mr. Kirkpatrick said he and his peers had not put on the multiple listings service.
 ''I've got 14 myself from people who want out, but don't want to scare their help or their clients by listing,'' he said.
 In 2004 Storm Cat, who has since retired, commanded $500,000 a mating, and his off-spring sauntered through the sales rings like royalty. One of his colts, Jalil, sold for $9.7 million at the Keeneland September sale in 2005. Last September, Storm 'n Indian, from Storm Cat's last crop, was the Keeneland sales topper at $2.05 million.
 ''Even if you're O.K. financially, you don't want to be flamboyant or ostentatious and spend money on a yearling,'' said Nick Nicholson, chief executive of the Keeneland Association, which has had a 50 percent drop in sales from more than $800 million in 2007. ''We have a minimum bid of $1,000, and we've seen more horses go through the ring and not get bid on at all than we ever had.''
 These days it is far cheaper to get a date with a blue-blooded stallion. The top of the market for stallions like Dynaformer is $150,000, according to BloodHorse.com. Smarty Jones, who nearly swept the Triple Crown in 2004, once stood for $100,000, but today he can be had for $10,000.
 Case Clay is president of Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Ky., which stands Dynaformer, Smarty Jones and 10 other stallions. He said that farms like his were being prudent about chasing the big horse. 
 ''Usually, we are all knocking on their doors and getting into bidding wars,'' Mr. Clay said. ''This year owners are calling us, and we are all sitting tight.''
 Mr. Meuser, the lawyer, said there had been warning signs the prices would not keep rising. In 2008, he said, some bigger farms like the Dubai-owned Darley were offering essentially 100 percent, no-money-down financing.
 ''They weren't asking to get paid until after they went through the sales ring,'' Mr. Meuser said. ''Now, with the market the way it is, no one is getting their money back.''
 There is a saying among horseplayers that a bad day at the track is better than a good day anywhere else. With the Derby set for Saturday, hope springs eternal for a horse to sweep the Triple Crown (only 11 have done so) and make the industry whole.
 Mr. Meuser, and others like him, would like to run down another big deal, but he said he thought horsemen needed to be realistic about their expectations.
 ''In years past, to put a stallion deal together for a Triple Crown winner was projected to be a $75 million price tag,'' he said. ''This year you're looking at $40 million tops, and it would take a lot of work to get it done.''

LENGTH: 848 words

HEADLINE: Summer's Heat Breeds Love, Loathing and Darwinian Competition

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
''Man will only become better when you make him see what he is like,'' Anton Chekhov wrote in one of his notebooks. Such a man emerges in ''Anton Chekhov's The Duel,'' a very satisfying and tonally precise English-language adaptation of an 1891 Chekhov novella. Set in a seaside town in the Caucasus, where Europe meets Asia against stark mountain ranges and the blue of the sky as it melts into the darker sea, the story turns on a handful of Russians during a sweltering summer. Amid this small world, there are moments of comedy, dark sentiments, invocations of Tolstoy and a generous attitude toward human frailties. 
 The film appears to have come out of nowhere -- it hasn't been making the usual rounds on the festival circuit -- so it's welcome news that it's been given a berth at Film Forum in Manhattan for its world premiere. It's the third feature by Dover Kosashvili, a Georgian-born Israeli who made a strong debut with his 2001 ''Late Marriage,'' about an Israeli man hiding his affair with a divorced mother from his domineering family. Once again, Mr. Kosashvili mixes moments of bitterness and laughter with strong dramatic passages, creating a social milieu in ''The Duel'' that is believably inhabited, consistently surprising and true-feeling in detail and sweep. (Its most unattractive feature is that ungainly title.) 
 The pivot point is an emotional and psychological triangle: a civil servant, Laevsky (Andrew Scott, appalling and appealing); his married mistress, Nadya (Fiona Glascott, a milky beauty); and a zoologist, Von Koren (Tobias Menzies, suitably rigid). The story gets going with Laevsky bitterly complaining about Nadya to an older friend, a doctor, Samoylenko (Niall Buggy). Laevsky claims to no longer care for Nadya, who, having left her husband, now inspires her lover's contempt or, perhaps, fatigue. Like a caged animal, he wants out and claws at Samoylenko as Von Koren watches and seethes, stoking his loathing for Laevsky. For his part, by cutting to Nadya during Laevsky's rant and capping the scene with a disapproving look from Von Koren, Mr. Kosashvili suggests that his own sympathies are divided. 
 There are no obvious heroes or facile villains in ''The Duel,'' which unhurriedly moves among the players in scenes that capture a mood, or serve as a quick character sketch, or function on both counts, as in a brief, early interlude in which Laevsky lies stretched across a sofa with a handkerchief over his face, seemingly napping. There's a window open near him, shedding light into the room, and you can almost feel the thick heat of the day, a sense of torpor, when Laevsky suddenly smacks a nearby table as if decimating a fly. It's a small, seemingly inconsequential moment, but the juxtaposition of indolence with sudden violence immediately creates a sense of character that will be borne out in later scenes. 
 The plot is as simple as those characters and their relations are complex. Laevsky begs Samoylenko to lend him money so he can flee, rubles that the doctor in turn borrows from Von Koren. The zoologist agrees, but only on the condition that Laevsky will send for Nadya. This impossible exchange -- a promise of freedom and its simultaneous refusal -- binds the three principals in this mini-drama like a rope, which only tightens as the story unfolds. As they're drawn closer together, they deepen into unhappier versions of themselves: Von Koren becomes inflexible, Laevsky turns hysterical, and Nadya grows increasingly desperate. When Von Koren, a proponent of Darwin, spits out that only the more perfectly developed survive, you might wonder how anyone here could.
 Mr. Kosashvili, working from Mary Bing's sensitive, economic screenplay and with the fine cinematographer Paul Sarossy, makes the most of the story's social environment, gently underscoring its claustrophobia. Everything, including the clothing and the similarly oppressive rooms with their Oriental rugs and heavy furniture, creates a sense of human-made entrapment that feels at odds with the surrounding natural world. (Laevsky sweats like the condemned, while Von Koren remains arid in body and deed.) Mr. Kosashvili doesn't push his contrasts too hard or overplay the interludes of drama. He observes and moves on, as when one character discovers an adulterous liaison, a scene that in another movie might be played for melodramatic excess but here is underplayed because the hurt needs no amplification. 
 ANTON CHEKHOV'S THE DUEL
 Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Dover Kosashvili; written by Mary Bing, based on the novella by Anton Chekhov; director of photography, Paul Sarossy; edited by Kate Williams; music by Angelo Milli; production designer, Ivo Husnjak; costumes by Sergio Ballo; produced by Donald Rosenfeld and Ms. Bing; released by High Line Pictures.

HEADLINE: Profiting From Low Interest Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''You're Welcome, Wall Street,'' by William D. Cohan (column, April 20), exposes perhaps the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of our nation. 
 He makes clear that the extraordinary profits being reported now by the country's major financial institutions result primarily from the artificially low interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve over the past year.
 These low interest rates deny America's savers, particularly seniors on fixed incomes, the benefit of real market-determined interest rates on their life savings. The same financial institutions that almost singlehandedly destroyed our economy borrow on a leveraged basis hundreds of billions of dollars from the Fed at these unprecedented low interest rates and in turn ''earn'' tens of billions of dollars in profits not by lending these funds to America's businesses, but by lending these borrowed funds to the United States government, thereby earning an absolutely risk-free spread of about 2.5 percent.
 What should have been billions of dollars in interest earned by everyday Americans who had the fiscal discipline to provide for the proverbial rainy day now wind up in the hands of those institutions that caused the recent calamity, and into the pockets of the overpaid executives who guided their institutions into the shoals.
 One can only wonder what will happen to our body politic when Americans come to understand how their pockets continue to be picked to the tune of billions of dollars by the least deserving players in our nation's economy.

HEADLINE: Washington President Named to Run N.C.A.A.

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Mark A. Emmert, the president of the University of Washington, was named the president of the N.C.A.A. on Tuesday, concluding a seven-month search for the successor to Myles Brand, who died last September of pancreatic cancer.
 ''This is not just another job for Mark Emmert,'' Ed Ray, the president of the University of Oregon and the chairman of the search committee, said at a news conference at the N.C.A.A.'s headquarters in Indianapolis. ''He has a commitment to intercollegiate athletics and to student athletes that runs deep.'' 
 Emmert, 57, has served since 2004 as president at Washington, his alma mater. A native of Fife, Wash., Emmert earned a bachelor's degree in political science, then a master's and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse. He has spent his entire career in higher education. He was the chancellor at Louisiana State University from 1999 to 2004 and before that was the chief operating and academic officer at Connecticut.
 ''Through his leadership, intercollegiate athletics have both flourished on the field and courts and have fully integrated into the mission of those campuses,'' Ray said. 
 The choice of Emmert to lead the N.C.A.A. was seen as somewhat of a surprise, because he is not well known in college athletics circles, despite having held leadership positions at athletic powerhouses. Emmert is not on any N.C.A.A. committees, said Erik Christianson, an association spokesman.
 ''I don't know him except by reputation,'' said Walt Harrison, the president of the University of Hartford, who was a candidate for the position. ''I do know the search committee. I know them well, and I have every confidence that they picked a great leader.''
 Michael Adams, the president of the University of Georgia, who was considered a contender for the N.C.A.A. position, also praised the choice. 
 ''I have known Dr. Emmert for most of our careers,'' he said in a statement. ''He is a very capable and effective president and will perform likewise in his new role at the N.C.A.A.''
 Ray said 32 finalists emerged from a pool of 100, with backgrounds that ranged from academics to the corporate world and government. Final interviews were conducted Tuesday, he said. 
 However unexpected, the choice continues a philosophical shift that began in 2002 with the selection of Brand, a former philosophy professor who was then the president of Indiana University. Brand was viewed as a relative outsider to N.C.A.A. politics. He was also the first university president to lead the association, which created the position in 1951. 
 Brand was hailed as a crusader who spoke forcefully on topics ranging from academics to gender equity. In 2004, he helped push through academic reforms that held colleges and universities accountable for the academic performance of their athletes. 
 Emmert, who received a five-year contract, said that he intended to continue Brand's legacy and that although he had no specific plans, he intended to take the reforms a step further. 
 ''That has been a highly successful initiation -- initial effort,'' he said. ''It's now starting to bear very important fruit. My intention is to continue that trend.''
 Another priority, Emmert said, is helping university presidents handle the increasingly high costs of college athletics, an issue that has taken on new urgency during the recession. He said each college needed to make its own choices, but ''what the N.C.A.A. can do is arm them to make those decisions as wisely and effectively as possible.'' 
 When a reporter asked Emmert's view on a playoff in the Bowl Championship Series, Emmert quipped, ''Do you have any controversial questions?'' 
 In 2008, Emmert told a Seattle Times reporter that he believed a playoff was inevitable and shrugged off arguments against it as illusory. But on Tuesday, he refused to tip his hand. 
 ''Those are decisions that presidents of the institutions will make, not the N.C.A.A.,'' he said.
 Jim Isch, the interim president, will continue in that role until Nov. 1, when he is expected to return to his previous position as chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: 3M Raises Its Profit Forecast After a Strong Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The 3M Company, which makes products ranging from Post-it notes to protective films for iPads, raised its outlook for the year on Tuesday after reporting first-quarter earnings rose 80 percent on strong sales in Asia. 
 The company, based in Maplewood, Minn., now expects earnings of $5.40 to $5.60 a share, excluding a charge related to the new health care law. It forecast $4.90 to $5.10 a share previously.
 3M is benefiting from a broader global footprint and sales of a myriad of everyday products. The company makes films for LCD TVs and hand-held devices like the iPad; more than 1,000 products for cars, including abrasives and paint finishings; and a number of health care products including inhalers and stethoscopes.
 3M earned $930 million, or $1.29 a share, compared with $518 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time charge related to tax changes in the new health care law, first-quarter earnings were $1.40 a share. Revenue rose 25 percent, to $6.35 billion.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $5.94 billion.
 Sales growth was strongest in emerging economies. Sales climbed 54.1 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes China. Sales in all six 3M business segments grew by double-digit percentages.

HEADLINE: A Bank Tax As Insurance For Us All

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Washington
 The financial regulation bill before the Senate has the potential to do a lot of good. But it also has at least one major flaw: it would not do enough to prevent taxpayers from paying the bill for a future crisis.
 What would? A tax on banks. The International Monetary Fund has started pushing for a bank tax, and a tax has also become part of the debate in Britain's election campaign. In this country, however, the subject has taken a back seat to issues like derivatives regulation and the Goldman Sachs case. Those other issues are important, but they are not as central to minimizing the damage from the next crisis.
 To understand why, let's take a glimpse into the future. Imagine the year is 2020, and a major financial firm is collapsing. 
 The financial regulation bill that President Obama signed back in 2010 was meant to deal with just such a problem. It gave regulators something called ''resolution authority.'' They could seize a dying firm, wipe out its shareholders, fire its top executives and keep it operating until its surviving parts could be sold off in an orderly fashion. Now, in 2020, the regulators are preparing to use that authority for the first time. 
 But as they dig into the details, they realize they are facing a raft of problems. One of the biggest is that the firm has 70 percent of its assets abroad (roughly the share of Citicorp's business that was overseas in 2009). Washington can't simply seize assets held in London, Shanghai or Moscow.
 So ultimately, the regulators are left with the same choice that arose in 2008: bankruptcy or bailout. Regulators can let the firm fall apart suddenly and risk the kind of collateral damage that the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers caused. Or they can spend billions of taxpayer dollars propping up the firm, as was the case with A.I.G. It's a miserable choice.
 You also can be pretty sure which of the two options tomorrow's policy makers will choose: bailout. History -- in the form of the Great Depression and, more recently, Lehman -- argues against the idea of liquidate, liquidate, liquidate, as Herbert Hoover's Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, advocated. The downside, of course, is that taxpayers end up paying for Wall Street's sins.
 Obama administration officials insist that the reregulation plan will prevent this outcome. They note that both the Senate and House bills will give regulators more authority to monitor financial firms. Banks will also be required to hold more cash in reserve, which will give them a bigger cushion when some investments do go bad. The rules for resolution authority, meanwhile, will be written with international cooperation in mind. 
 And maybe time will prove the administration correct. But a good number of economists and banking experts are worried. They think the odds of a future bankruptcy-or-bailout dilemma will remain uncomfortably high even if reregulation passes.
 For starters, there are the cross-border problems; in the midst of a crisis, governments may have trouble cooperating. Then there is the fact that the regulators have never before tried to shut down anything as complex as a multibillion-dollar financial firm. ''It's really hard -- really hard,'' says Robert Steel, who worked on the financial crisis in the Bush Treasury Department and later was chief executive of Wachovia. ''Anyone who says they know exactly what we should do is overconfident.'' 
 Another former top government official adds, bluntly, ''Don't kid yourself into thinking that if J. P. Morgan were on the rocks, it would disappear.'' 
 Above all, no one knows what the next crisis will look like. So no one can be sure exactly how to prevent it. In all likelihood, Wall Street will eventually figure out ways around technocratic rules -- and technocrats -- and create trouble that today's proposals don't anticipate. 
 The beauty of a bank tax is that it acknowledges as much. Financial firms play a vital role in a market economy. But they also have a long record of causing crises, be it the South Sea bubble of 1720, the Panic of 1873, the Great Depression or our own Great Recession. A bank tax is akin to an insurance policy that taxpayers would require Wall Street to hold. The premiums on that policy would keep Wall Street from making big profits in good times while foisting its losses on society in bad.
 The current Senate bill includes a kind of bank tax, but it has all kinds of problems. It would initially collect only $50 billion from firms and then set the money aside to pay the costs of future bailouts. Other crises have cost far more than $50 billion. 
 For this reason, the Obama administration prefers a postcrisis tax. The White House has proposed a so-called TARP tax, to raise at least $90 billion over the next decade and cover the costs of the 2008 bailout fund (the Troubled Asset Relief Program). But this idea has its own flaws. It does not leave any money for future busts. It assumes Washington will always be able to recoup those costs later, which doesn't sound like a great bet.
 The I.M.F. prefers a permanent tax, for the good reason that the risk of crises is permanent. ''The challenge is to ensure that financial institutions bear the direct financial costs that any future failures or crises will impose -- and maybe somewhat more, given all the other costs that bank failure can impose on the economy,'' Carlo Cottarelli, the head of the I.M.F.'s fiscal affairs unit, wrote last weekend. The tax wouldn't go into a dedicated bailout fund. Its purpose instead would be to discourage too much risk-taking and, over the long term, help offset any bailout costs.
 Because the tax would be calculated based on a firm's holdings, a small local bank or a larger bank with billions of dollars in safe consumer deposits might pay nothing. A leveraged investment bank would surely be taxed. 
 The TARP tax, in its technical design, would be similar. And Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, told me recently that he was open to the idea of the tax's becoming permanent. ''There is a very good argument you should put a fee on finance, like a tax on pollution,'' he said.
 Yet the administration -- nervous about upsetting the fragile support in Congress for financial reregulation -- has been afraid of making the tax part of the broader bill. That strikes me as a mistake, given the tax's importance. Obviously, though, if Congress passes a bank tax in a separate bill later this year, it will work out the same in the end.
 There is some reason for optimism, too. Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told Politico this week, ''I don't think there's much doubt that there will be a bank tax.'' Why? The tax is not just about punishing banks. 
 The federal government, remember, is facing a huge deficit. To pay it off, Washington will need to make spending cuts and raise taxes. Can you think of a better candidate for taxation than an industry that made huge profits during the boom and then helped cause the bust that has sent the deficit soaring?

HEADLINE: For Democrats, Bankers Are a Handy Foil to Pressure G.O.P.

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Politicians like nothing more than a convenient foil, and Democrats locked in a stubborn impasse with Republicans over new rules to govern Wall Street believe they have found a gold-plated one in Goldman Sachs.
 Democrats say the convergence of their push for an overhaul of financial regulation and a prominent federal securities case against the prestigious investment firm is a matter of coincidence, not planning. 
 But they have seized on emerging details about Goldman's wheeling and dealing -- recounted in a marathon bipartisan questioning of top executives from the firm on Tuesday during a televised Senate hearing -- to put pressure on Republicans. 
 ''If the disclosures at these hearings are not the final nail that persuades the American people to demand this be done now, I don't know what would be,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. ''To bet against your clients, to bet against your country, all for the sake of big profits. The timing is serendipitous but it should increase the pressure on Republicans.'' 
 Even as current and former Goldman executives defended themselves against charges of pillaging the economy, Democrats forced another procedural vote on the Wall Street regulatory measure. They knew they would come up short but were intent on juxtaposing the image of millionaire bankers parrying suggestions of greed and malfeasance with Republican determination to at least slow a bill calling for tighter regulation. Democrats said they would keep calling for votes to make their point. 
 ''Republicans will have more opportunities to show whose side they are truly on,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader.
 If nothing else, the civil case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Goldman has given Democrats a chance to highlight a cast of purported villains, embodiments of the forces that led to the financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession and faces at which the nation's angry populist impulses could be directed. 
 For hour after hour on Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans interrogated Goldman's mortgage men, including the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and Fabrice Tourre, the employee named in the S.E.C. complaint, putting them on the spot over Wall Street's questionable conduct at a legislatively propitious moment. 
 None of the Goldman executives have been found to have done anything wrong, but some Democrats were ready to place them in the same role played in past financial crises by high-fliers like Charles Keating, Michael Milken and Ken Lay, all of whom came to personify the excesses of the moment.
 The hearings were the culmination of a Democratic strategy to take full advantage of the opportunity created by the S.E.C. civil case. 
 Top Democrats said it helped to put a face on an economic calamity that is as complicated as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation. But the real impact of the Goldman Sachs inquiry seemed difficult to gauge when it came to Republicans.
 While Senate Republicans joined Democrats in pounding on the Goldman executives at the hearing and expressed comparable outrage over what they described as blatant conflicts of interest in the structuring of Goldman deals, they confidently trooped over to the Senate floor to vote again to block the bill. 
 They accused Democrats of trying to force through a partisan measure, sought to raise new questions about the measure's reach beyond the titans of Wall Street and noted that many Democrats had benefited more from Goldman campaign contributions than Republicans.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said he did not believe Republicans would pay a political price for their resistance to the legislation, even with the Goldman case playing out in the background, as long as Republicans could make the case that they were trying to achieve a better end result.
 ''What happens on Monday or Tuesday versus what happens later is something largely lost on the general public,'' he said. 
 Some Democrats, despite being aghast at Goldman's evident willingness to bet against investments it was selling to other clients, said it was in some ways inequitable to single out Goldman when they might have just been the biggest and best at what became a Wall Street routine.
 ''They were all doing this,'' Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said. ''This was lemminglike.''
 Other Democrats said privately that the party needed to be careful in how far it goes in portraying Goldman Sachs as the chief bad guy in the financial collapse given the firm's major presence on Wall Street, as well as in the world's financial markets. Some Republicans have suggested that the Goldman developments are too much of a coincidence, implying that the S.E.C. lawsuit and Senate hearing were all elements of an orchestrated effort to provide momentum to the Wall Street overhaul and help Democrats break the Republican unity against the measure. 
 Administration and Congressional officials strongly deny any such coordination and note that the investigative committee headed by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, has been looking into the underlying causes of the financial crisis for months.
 Still, Democrats were not about to let such a prime opportunity pass.
 Moments after Republicans blocked debate on the bill for a second time, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, took the Senate floor to note that she had been following the Goldman Sachs hearing.
 ''Goldman Sachs will have their day in court,'' she said. ''But the allegations against the firm cry out for greater transparency at giant Wall Street banks.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Reject Finance Bill Again, And Offer a Plan Of Their Own

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Eric Lichtblau and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans thwarted the Democrats' efforts to overhaul financial regulation for a second day on Tuesday and floated an alternative proposal with some crucial differences in the regulation of consumer lending. 
 The plan would also tighten regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants, provisions that were not included in the Democrats' proposal.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, warned that the Democrats' bill would reach deep ''into every nook and cranny of American business,'' and tried to portray his party as a protector of Main Street from the unintended consequences of a bill aimed at fixing problems on Wall Street. 
 Democrats again accused the Republicans of demanding that the parties resolve all of their differences in closed-door negotiations before bringing the bill to the Senate floor for amendment -- a process in which the Democratic majority enjoys a decisive advantage.
 The Democrats' second floor defeat, which was expected, came as a Senate investigations panel opened hearings on Goldman Sachs's actions in the 2008 financial crisis. 
 For their part, Republicans pushed back on efforts by Democrats to portray them friends of Wall Street and business as a whole, intent on blocking tighter regulation.
 While the Republican alternative was intended to draw contrast with the Democrats' approach, it also revealed many areas of broad agreement, potentially bolstering the Democrats' argument that the remaining differences could be worked out quickly and that there was no reason for delay.
 Like the Democrats' bill, the Republican proposal would provide for the liquidation of a troubled financial company, but paid for by the company's creditors and its shareholders, rather than by a resolution fund financed by the largest banks, which the Democrats' bill would create. 
 Like the Democrats, the Republicans would establish a consumer protection agency to deal with financial companies, but they would limit its powers to regulate smaller banks and nonfinancial companies. 
 Mr. McConnell and Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, said their biggest substantive objections to the Democratic proposal related to the provisions for a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent body to be located within the Fed, which would regulate credit extended to the public by banks, credit card companies and other institutions.
 The Democrats' bill gives broad powers to a consumer protection agency to regulate almost any business that extends credit, meaning that companies like car dealers and professionals like orthodontists who allow customers to pay over time could be subject to a new regulatory and supervisory regime.
 ''I thought, and I think most Americans thought, this was all about Wall Street,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''But as you look at the bill closer and closer, you see it is mostly about Main Street.'' 
 Mr. McConnell said the Republicans' actions were intended to allow negotiations to continue between Mr. Shelby and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking panel.
 Republican aides said that the credit provisions of the bill were written so broadly that many business-to-business transactions that are made on credit could be regulated by an agency structured to focus on consumers. 
 Jim Manley, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, called the Republican alternative, ''a weak, watered-down bill, which leaves the consumer protections in shambles.''
 A second Democratic attempt to advance its bill, which was approved by the Senate banking committee in March, received 57 votes -- short of the 60 needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and move forward with debate. In opposition were 40 Republicans and Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska.
 Another vote on a measure to bring the Democrats' bill to the Senate floor is scheduled for Wednesday. 
 The Democrats are betting that by losing a series of votes to bring the bill to the Senate floor, they can portray the Republicans as obstructionist. But the tactic risks alienating centrist Republicans who support aspects of the legislation and may be willing to vote to allow the debate to go forward. 
 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who participated in the hearing examining Goldman Sachs, told reporters that Democratic leaders were impeding bipartisan talks by calling for repeated procedural votes without agreeing to Republicans' requests for changes to the bill.
 Mr. Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, said that he voted against his own party's measure because he believed that its proposed retroactive regulation of derivatives was unconstitutional. 
 That concern was raised to him by representatives of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's investment company, which is based in Omaha and maintains billions of dollars in derivative positions. 
 Mr. Nelson's vote against his fellow Democrats raised questions about whether his personal holdings in Berkshire Hathaway influenced his position. In his most recent financial disclosure statement, filed last year, Mr. Nelson reported owning $1.5 million to $6 million in Berkshire Hathaway, his largest investment in any single company. 
 Mr. Nelson's financial connections to Berkshire Hathaway were reported in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. 
 Jake Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Nelson, said Mr. Nelson's stock holdings had nothing to do with his vote against the financial reform bill.

HEADLINE: Failure Is Not An Option

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
China is having a good week in America. Yes it is. I'd even suggest that there is some high-fiving going on in Beijing. I mean, wouldn't you if you saw America's Democratic and Republican leaders conspiring to ensure that America cedes the next great global industry -- E.T., energy technology -- to China?
 But, before I get to that, here's a little news item to chew on: Applied Materials, a U.S. Silicon Valley company that makes the machines that make sophisticated solar panels, opened the world's largest commercial solar research and development center in Xian, China, in October. It initially sought applicants for 260 scientist/technologist jobs. Howard Clabo, a company spokesman, told me that the Xian center received 26,000 Chinese applications and hired 330 people -- 31 percent with master's or Ph.D. degrees. ''Roughly 50 percent of the solar panels in the world were made in China last year,'' explained Clabo. ''We need to be where the customers are.'' 
 And what kind of week is America having? After months of heroic negotiations, Senators John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joseph Lieberman had forged a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill that, while far from perfect, would have, for the first time, put a long-term fixed price on carbon -- precisely the kind of price signal U.S. industry and consumers need to start really shifting the economy to clean-power innovations. The bill was supposed to be unveiled on Monday, but it was suddenly postponed because of Graham's justified fury that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, had decided to push immigration reform first -- even though no such bill is ready -- in a bid to attract Hispanic voters to revive his re-election campaign in Nevada.
 After all the work that has gone into knitting together this bipartisan bill, which has the support of key industry players, it would be insane to let this effort fail. Fortunately, on Tuesday, Reid was hinting about a compromise. But, ultimately, the issue isn't just about introducing a bill. It's about getting it passed. And there we are going to need the president's sustained leadership.
 President Obama has done a superb job in securing stimulus money for green-technology and in using his regulatory powers to compel the auto industry to improve mileage standards to a whole new level. But he has always been rather coy when it comes to when and how much he will personally push an energy/climate bill that would fix a price on carbon-emitting fuels. Without that price signal, you will never get sustained consumer demand for, or sustained private investment in, clean-power technologies. All you will get are hobbies.
 The president clearly wants this energy bill to pass, but his advisers are worried that because the bill will likely result in higher electricity or gasoline charges, Republicans will run around screaming ''carbon tax'' and hurt Democrats in the midterm elections. I appreciate the president's dilemma. But I don't think hanging back and letting the Senate take the lead is the right answer. This is a big leadership moment. He needs to confront it head-on, because -- call me crazy -- I think doing the right and hard thing here will actually be good politics, too. 
 I'd love to see the president come out, guns blazing with this message:
 ''Yes, if we pass this energy legislation, a small price on carbon will likely show up on your gasoline or electricity bill. I'm not going to lie. But it is an investment that will pay off in so many ways. It will spur innovation in energy efficiency that will actually lower the total amount you pay for driving, heating or cooling. It will reduce carbon pollution in the air we breathe and make us healthier as a country. It will reduce the money we are sending to nations that crush democracy and promote intolerance. It will strengthen the dollar. It will make us more energy secure, environmentally secure and strategically secure. Sure, our opponents will scream 'carbon tax!' Well, what do you think you're paying now to OPEC? The only difference between me and my opponents is that I want to keep any revenue we generate here to build American schools, American highways, American high-speed rail, American research labs and American economic strength. It's just a little tick I have: I like to see our spending build our country. They don't care. They are perfectly happy to see all the money you spend to fill your tank or heat your home go overseas, so we end up funding both sides in the war on terrorism -- our military and their extremists.''
 Much of our politics today is designed to make people stupid, confused and afraid of change. The G.O.P. has been particularly egregious on energy and climate. I believe if you talk straight to the American people on energy and climate, they will give you the right answers, and, ultimately, the support needed to trump the vested interests and lobbyists who have kept us addicted to oil. Obama has all the right instincts on this issue. He just needs to trust them. If he brings his A-game to energy legislation, Americans will follow -- and then maybe we can have a good century.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Battles in Two Rings

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY; Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even before the first question was leveled inside the Senate chamber, Tuesday was going to be uncomfortable for Goldman Sachs.
 But then the questions kept coming -- and coming and coming.
 Through the day and into the evening, Goldman Sachs officials met with confrontation and blunt questioning as senators from both parties challenged them over their aggressive marketing of mortgage investments at a time when the housing market was already starting to falter.
 In an atmosphere charged by public animosity toward Wall Street, the senators compared the bankers to bookies and asked why Goldman had sold investments that its own sales team had disparaged with a vulgarity.
 ''The idea that Wall Street came out of this thing just fine, thank you, is just something that just grates on people,'' said Senator Edward E. Kaufman Jr., a Democrat from Delaware, said. ''They think you didn't just come out fine because it was luck. They think you guys just really gamed this thing real well.'' 
 But throughout a subcommittee hearing lasting more than 10 hours, current and former Goldman officials insisted that they had done nothing to mislead their clients. Time and again, the senators and the Goldman executives, among them the chairman and chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, seemed to be talking past each other.
 Among the Goldman retinue was Fabrice P. Tourre, a vice president who helped create and sell a mortgage investment that figures in a fraud suit filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Tourre defended his role in the sale of the investment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Mr. Tourre declared: ''I deny, categorically, the S.E.C.'s allegation. And I will defend myself in court against this false claim.''
 Senate investigators are building on the S.E.C. case, which accuses Goldman of defrauding investors in a transaction called Abacus 2007-AC1.
 The hearing was held against the backdrop of a debate about overhauling financial regulation. During the questioning, senators highlighted the need for greater openness and questioned the ethics of the financial sector.
 At one point, the Goldman witnesses were asked what they would change in the regulatory system.
 ''Clearly some things need to be changed,'' said Daniel L. Sparks, a former partner and head of the mortgage trading department in the Goldman Sachs Group, who was one of the four initial witnesses.
 Steering away from financial jargon, the senators tried to put a human face on the questioning. Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, declared that more transparency was needed ''so we don't end up hurting the little guys out there on Main Street.''
 A Republican member, Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine, turned from one witness to the next as she asked repeatedly whether they felt a duty to act in the best interest of their clients. Only one of the four witnesses she questioned seemed to affirm such a duty outright.
 In what almost added up to a light moment, Senator Mark L. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, said the public wanted to know what went wrong and ''how we can fix it,'' adding that Americans feel that Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis. ''People feel like you are betting with other people's money and other people's future,'' he said. ''Instead of Wall Street, it looks like Las Vegas.''
 Senator Ensign said he took offense at the comparison, saying that in Las Vegas the casinos do not manipulate the odds while you are playing the game. The better analogy, he said, would be to someone playing a slot machine while the ''guys on Wall Street'' were ''tweaking the odds in their favor.''
 The gap between Wall Street and the rest of the country was a recurring theme, with senators occasionally pointing out how much Goldman, and indeed the witnesses, had profited as the overall economy was headed for a plunge.
 Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, mentioned during her questioning that she was trying to ''home in on why I have so many unemployed people'' and lost money in pensions.
 The questioning Tuesday put the Goldman witnesses on the defensive, with the senators expressing exasperation that they were deliberately dodging questions or stalling for time.
 It was at 10:01 a.m., one minute late, when the session began with opening remarks from subcommittee chairman, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. The public galleries, accommodating roughly 100 people, were full and included four people dressed in mock striped prison jumpsuits who jeered at the Goldman officials.
 ''How do you live with yourself, Fab?'' one shouted as Mr. Tourre was ushered out of the chamber after his testimony.
 A tone of confrontation was set at the beginning, with Senator Levin's opening remarks. He said the questioning would focus on the role of investment banks in the financial crisis, and particularly on the activities of Goldman Sachs in 2007, which ''contributed to the economic collapse that came full blown the following year.''
 While the hearing had ramifications for the entire sector and the activities of lenders to make more money from risky mortgage loans, Senator Levin added, it was focusing on Goldman as an ''active player in building this mortgage machinery.''
 He said that while the S.E.C. suit and the courts would address the legality of its activities, ''the question for us is one of ethics and policy: were Goldman's actions in 2007 appropriate, and if not, should we act to bar similar actions in the future?''
 In addition to Mr. Tourre and Mr. Sparks, Goldman executives testifying included Joshua S. Birnbaum, a former managing director in the structured products group trading, and Michael J. Swenson, another managing director in that group.
 A second panel included David A. Viniar, executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Craig W. Broderick, the chief risk officer.
 At one point Mr. Viniar prompted a collective gasp when Mr. Levin asked him how he felt when he learned that Goldman employees had used vulgar terms to describe the poor quality of certain Goldman deals. Mr. Viniar replied, ''I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail.''
 Senator Levin then berated Mr. Viniar for not saying that he was appalled that Goldman employees even thought their deals were of poor quality, much less put it in e-mail. Mr. Viniar later apologized.
 As the hearing stretched into the evening, Mr. Blankfein, Goldman's chief, entered the chamber with an almost angry demeanor. In a brief prepared statement, he held tight to Goldman's defenses.
 Later, asked if he knew the housing market was doomed, Mr. Blankfein replied, ''I think we're not that smart.''
 Mr. Blankfein was asked repeatedly whether Goldman sold securities that it also bet against, and whether Goldman treated those clients properly.
 ''You say betting against,'' Mr. Blankfein said in a lengthy exchange. But he said the people who were coming to Goldman for risk in the housing market got just that: exposure to the housing market. ''The unfortunate thing,'' he said, ''is that the housing market went south very quickly.''
 Senator Levin pressed Mr. Blankfein again on whether the his customers should know what Goldman workers think of deals they are selling, and Mr. Blankfein reiterated his position that sophisticated investors should be allowed to buy what they want.
 Mr. Blankfein was also pressed on the deal at the center of the S.E.C. case. He said the investment was not meant to fail, as the S.E.C. claims, and in fact, that the deal was a success, in that it conveyed ''risk that people wanted to have, and in a market that's not a failure.''
 To which Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, replied, ''It's like we're speaking a different language here.''

HEADLINE: Agency Owes Millions to City, An Audit Finds

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
The agency responsible for economic development under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has failed to turn over to the city more than $125 million in payments, taxes and fees, according to an audit conducted by the city comptroller to be released on Wednesday.
 The comptroller, John C. Liu, said the agency, the Economic Development Corporation, had hoarded money it earned through leases on buildings in Times Square and the sale of city properties and had improperly held money in a dormant account. 
 Under a contract with the city, the agency was supposed to turn over the money to the city's general fund, Mr. Liu said. ''The E.D.C. should fork it over,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
 In examining one of New York's most powerful agencies, which is involved in projects in places like Coney Island in Brooklyn and Willets Point in Queens, Mr. Liu said he found a lack of transparency and loose internal controls. ''It has become a powerhouse agency, but we have very little understanding of what comes in and out of it,'' he said. ''You cannot see anything that is going on.''
 The audit represents a stinging critique of an agency that under Mr. Bloomberg has swelled in the size of its budget and in its importance as the primary vehicle for an aggressive development agenda. According to the audit, the agency collected inadequate rent from landlords, overpaid a contractor and approved unsubstantiated payroll records.
 City officials took strong exception to the audit, setting up a potential clash with Mr. Liu, whose office must approve the corporation's contract with the city every year.
 In a detailed two-page rebuttal, the development agency defended its practice of keeping certain money, citing a supportive opinion from the city's Law Department. The rebuttal belittled the comptroller's findings, noting that the audit had found a ''tiny fraction'' of imprecise accounting by the corporation by amounts like 0.2 percent, 0.03 percent and 0.34 percent.
 ''We're doing more in the last few years because the administration is focused on economic development and we're the agency that carries out that vision, from investing in underserved neighborhoods to generating programs that help businesses and create jobs,'' said David Lombino, a spokesman for the corporation. ''We are carrying out our mission in a transparent manner, hosting public hearings and open meetings, disclosing our financials with the city on a quarterly basis, and submitting our audited financial statements to the comptroller's office every year and posting them on our Web site.''
 The corporation is a nonprofit organization with a president appointed by the mayor that offers financing, tax exemptions and other development programs.
 Mr. Bloomberg has made the collection of money he believes is owed to the city a priority. A few months ago he accused the departing Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, of maintaining unregistered bank accounts outside the city's financial review process. 
 Mr. Morgenthau denied it, and the city later acknowledged that it also had thousands of unregistered accounts. But in March, Mr. Liu faulted Mr. Morgenthau's office in an audit, saying it exhibited a ''lack of transparency.'' The finding was largely seen as a vindication of Mr. Bloomberg's initial complaint. 
 This time, though, Mr. Liu pointed the finger at Mr. Bloomberg. The development corporation audit suggests that Mr. Liu, who built his campaign last year around opposition to Mr. Bloomberg's overturning of term limits, plans to use his office as a counterweight to the mayor.
 Mr. Liu, who served as a city councilman from 2002 to 2009 representing Flushing, Queens, made a name for himself as a persistent critic of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Mr. Bloomberg. 
 After his election last fall, Mr. Liu seemed to take aim at Mr. Bloomberg when he said that residents ''long ago decided there would be no king or monarch in New York City.'' He has since sought the authority to oversee revenue projections for the city, traditionally a mayoral power. He has also pledged to use his office to ferret out wasteful spending at City Hall, especially on no-bid contracts that he says have exploded under Mr. Bloomberg.
 Mr. Liu, 43, an actuary who once worked at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, has given his auditors their own department and elevated its leader, H. Tina Kim, who oversaw the audit of the development corporation, to the new title of deputy comptroller for auditing. Mr. Liu also said he was focusing attention on the Education Department, whose overhaul Mr. Bloomberg considers a cornerstone of his tenure. 
 The audit found that the Economic Development Corporation did not hand over $98 million in lease payments from developers in a Times Square project, whose tenants include Conde Nast and Reuters; $16 million in proceeds from the sale of city-owned property in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens; and $10.6 million from the dormant fund.
 The comptroller found smaller examples of what he said were waste and mismanagement. The corporation improperly accounted for more than $861,000 in loans intended to help small businesses. In one case, the agency gave $338,928 in excess energy credits to businesses as part of a cost savings program it operated with Consolidated Edison.
 After reviewing 411 time sheets for workers at the corporation, auditors found that 183 were processed without proper documentation and 127 could not be substantiated. But all the workers were paid in full, the audit found.
 In its rebuttal, the agency said its auditors had found nothing improper in the loans described in the audit. Regarding payroll, the agency said no employee had been overpaid and it had adopted a new time-sheet system. 
 Addressing energy credits to businesses, the agency said less than 1 percent of the accounts ''do appear to have been over- or under-billed.'' All told, Andrew Brent, a Bloomberg spokesman, said the city supported the agency's position.
 Still, Mr. Liu said he planned to conduct four follow-up audits. ''I don't think their arguments hold up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: BP Posts Big Gain for First Quarter

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- BP, the British oil company, said Tuesday that its profit more than doubled in the first quarter, helped by higher oil prices.
 Profit rose to $6.08 billion from $2.56 billion in the first quarter of last year. The results beat some analyst expectation, setting the tone for other large oil companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, that are reporting later this week. 
BP benefited from a crude oil price that almost doubled in the first quarter as the global economy slowly recovers from recession. Oil prices averaged about $78 a barrel at the beginning of this year, up from about $40 a barrel last year.
 The earnings announcement comes as BP attempts to stem an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico that resulted from an explosion at a rig off the coast of Louisiana earlier this month. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead.
 Tony Hayward, the chief executive, had focused on improving BP's safety record since a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery in 2005 tarnished its reputation. Mr. Hayward has flown to the area to supervise the recovery efforts even though the accident is unlikely to hurt BP's production because the deposit at the rig was relatively small.
 Mr. Hayward said earlier he plans to increase output by as much as 2 percent a year over the next five years. BP announced in September the discovery of a giant oil field several miles under the Gulf of Mexico. The company estimated it could take three or more years to begin extracting oil because it is so deep and only a relatively high oil price would make the exploration profitable.
 Oil prices recovered again in the past year after falling from a record of $147 in 2007. The current oil price of about $80 a barrel has made some exploration projects viable again for oil companies, which had focused on expanding natural gas production in the meantime, some analysts said. Gas prices climbed alongside those for oil but not as fast.
 Uncertainty about the future of supply of oil as demand rises has continued to push up the price. Governments of some exporting countries have limited access for foreign oil companies to reserves, while the economic recovery in much of the world has increased demand.
 Royal Dutch Shell is scheduled to release its first-quarter figures on Wednesday followed by ExxonMobil on Thursday and Chevron and Total on Friday.

HEADLINE: Immigration: Complex Test For 2 Parties

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Ottumwa, Iowa, and Carl Hulse and Ashley Southall from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator John McCain of Arizona took to the Senate floor the other day to embrace a tough new Arizona law giving the police the authority to detain people they suspect are illegal immigrants. Mr. McCain, long an outspoken champion of giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, is facing a primary challenge this summer from a conservative who backs tough immigration measures.
 This week, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, abruptly announced that the Senate would take up an immigration bill to address both enhanced border security and citizenship, even in the face of daunting odds. Mr. Reid also faces a tough re-election battle, and his advisers believe that Hispanic voters in Nevada could prove key to his re-election. 
 The immigration flare-up that has engulfed Washington has emerged as a political challenge for Republicans and Democrats alike as they struggle to deal with the complexities and emotions of an issue that is scrambling party and geographic lines.
 On Tuesday, two prominent Republicans in Florida, another state with a big immigrant population -- Jeb Bush, the former governor, and Marco Rubio, a candidate for the Senate -- expressed reservations about the Arizona law, even as other Republican lawmakers supported it. 
 In the short term, Mr. Reid's vow to tackle immigration legislation this year could hurt some Democrats in the fall elections, causing problems with voters who view immigrants as competition for tough-to-find jobs and illegal immigration as a drain on social services, analysts from both parties said. That could especially be a problem for first- and second-term Democrats representing blue-collar states particularly hard hit by the recession.
 But the Republican Party could face long-term risks if it is identified with legislation cracking down on illegal immigration at a time when Hispanic voters are emerging as an increasingly large and engaged part of the American electorate. The Arizona law has enraged many Hispanic groups, who see it as a form of racial profiling.
 ''Immigration is the most explosive issue I've seen in my political career,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was a senior adviser both to Mr. McCain and to President George W. Bush, who also supported giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
 ''This is an issue on which Republicans salivate over short-term gains without much thought to the longer-term damage it will do the party,'' Mr. McKinnon said.
 But, he said: ''Arizona may force the Democrats' hand to push for immigration reform. Unfortunately, an election year is the worst time to move good public policy on this issue.''
 Both parties agree on the need for better border security. But each also has to balance how to deal with illegal immigrants already in the United States against the desires of powerful constituencies. These include Hispanics who would like to see many illegal immigrants given a chance to become legal, employers who rely on the cheap labor they provide and working-class voters who see undocumented workers as threats to their jobs and wage levels.
 For all the recent talk about moving ahead on an immigration bill, it appears unlikely that Congress will act this year, especially since no Senate Republican now seems willing to work with the White House on the issue. Mr. Reid said he would bring up energy and climate change legislation first, leaving it unclear whether the Senate would have time to tackle immigration this year.
 And there is no evidence that Democrats have the votes to get anything through. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has been the leading Republican advocate for changing immigration laws -- filling a gap left by Mr. McCain -- announced the other day that he would not support acting on immigration this year. He said Mr. Reid was making a mistake in trying to push something through.
 The Arizona law has brought the issue to the fore more than any other factor. President Obama has denounced it, as have many civil liberties groups and a smattering of Republicans. In an interview with Politico on Tuesday, Jeb Bush said: ''It's difficult for me to imagine how you're going to enforce this law. It places a significant burden on local law enforcement and you have civil liberties issues that are significant as well.'' 
 To a certain extent, the White House has reason to be glad Mr. Reid is pushing an issue of such concern to Hispanics, a critical part of Mr. Obama's base in states like Nevada in 2008 and a group Democrats hope to energize in the fall. Even if no bill gets through the Senate, the Democrats can highlight their support for dealing with the issue.
 ''It's easy for Democrats to demagogue and try to use this as a wedge issue,'' said Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''It's a very sensitive subject. A third of my constituents in Texas are Hispanic.''
 ''But what I've found is that my relationship with them is not based on a single issue,'' Mr. Cornyn added.
 Mr. Obama, traveling through Iowa on Tuesday, said that the Arizona law amounted to harassment and that it raised the urgency for a new national immigration policy. But he said any plan needed to have bipartisan support. ''The only way it's going to happen is if Democrats and Republicans come together and do this,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 But the obstacles to passing legislation are substantial, particularly at a time of high unemployment and violence on the Mexican border involving drug dealers. 
 ''I think it's going to be extremely difficult for an immigration bill to pass this year,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana.
 Some Democrats said the prospects for a legislative deal might be better in 2011, particularly if the jobless rate drops and Hispanics continue to mobilize and grow as an electoral force.
 ''We're going to work very hard to get comprehensive immigration reform as soon as possible,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 leader of the Senate.
 Mexico Warns Citizens
 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -- Mexico warned its citizens living in or traveling to Arizona that they could be ''harassed'' there because of its new immigration law.
 The foreign ministry issued a statement saying that Mexicans there should contact their consular representatives if they are unlawfully detained. ''Until it is clearly defined under what criteria, when, where and who the authorities will check, you should assume that every Mexican citizen could be harassed and questioned without cause at any moment,'' the statement said.

HEADLINE: Apple Buys A Start-Up For Its Voice Technology

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Apple continued its migration into Google's turf on Wednesday with the acquisition of Siri, a mobile application that allows users to perform Web searches by voice command on a cellphone. 
 Siri, a start-up based in San Jose, Calif., describes itself as a virtual personal assistant for the iPhone and the iPod Touch. For example, Siri users can speak commands like ''find a table for two at 9 tonight'' or ''send a taxi to my house''; using GPS and speech-recognition technology, the application translates the commands and uses search algorithms to find answers. For results, Siri worked with several companies, including Citysearch, OpenTable and Taxi Magic. 
 An Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, declined to comment on the specifics of the Siri deal. ''Apple buys smaller companies from time to time but doesn't comment on products or plans,'' he said. 
 Norman Winarsky, vice president of licensing and strategic programs at SRI International, a research lab that helped develop the application, confirmed the sale but declined to disclose any financial details of the transaction. Mr. Winarsky described the sale of Siri, which was released as a mobile app in February, as ''a great event for us in terms of our impact on the world.'' 
 Before its sale to Apple, Siri raised a total of $24 million from investors, including Menlo Ventures and Li Ka-Shing, a Chinese billionaire who has also invested in Facebook.
 Apple may eventually hope to offer an alternative to Google's search service on the iPhone, the iPod Touch and the iPad, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. Google has made large investments in voice command search, location-based search and advertising and in visual recognition search.
 ''Apple is trying to break ties to Google,'' Mr. Golvin said. ''Rather than have search in the browser, users would have a more relevant search application to use.'' 
 Apple has acquired several smaller companies over the last few months as part of a larger effort to gain an edge on rival mobile companies. Most recently, Apple bought Intrinsity, a company that makes a speedy computer chip for mobile devices that uses very little battery power while processing graphics, video and other images. In January, Apple acquired Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company.
 ''This is as much about keeping this good technology away from Google as it is about wanting it for themselves,'' Mr. Golvin said.

 BODY:
COLE NAHAL and Garrett Bowser may not have fully thought through the implications of withholding rent on their Broome Street two-bedroom for the last few months. Or was it magical thinking that prevented these two interior designers from deducing the fallout? In any case, three days after their eviction this month, the two were putting a positive spin on matters.
 ''We're homeless decorators!'' Mr. Nahal announced, pointing to the rental truck parked on the Bowery that held all their worldly possessions. ''Though if I can get this stuff sold, maybe we can get another place.''
 In the meantime, Mr. Bowser added, ''we have to do something or we'll go crazy.'' 
 That ''something'' is a peculiar -- if energetic -- strategy for staying busy in a down economy. For the past year, as their interior design business has dwindled, the two have been staging old-fashioned ''happenings'' in other people's homes, many of which they decorated, and photographing the results. These images, posted on Facebook, represent loosely choreographed stories acted out by a gaggle of new and old friends whom Mr. Nahal and Mr. Bowser have dressed in costumes created from the remnants of their decorating business (fabric-sample loincloths or laminate-sample necklaces, for example) and Mr. Bowser's former life as an event producer (gaffer's tape and plastic wrap from the tents at Bryant Park have become mini-dresses, draped on a carapace of snow fencing). 
 The purpose of these shenanigans? 
 ''It's a way to keep making stuff,'' Mr. Nahal said, and a way to self-promote when the chips are down. Facebook affords them a parochial sort of fame, and maybe, he added, they could make a book of all the photos. It is also, he said, an attempt to connect to New York's hoary nightlife scene -- from Max's Kansas City to the Limelight -- by reaching out to characters associated with it from the 1960s to the 1990s and inviting them to participate. It is an aspect of the city's past that Mr. Nahal and Mr. Bowser have romanticized. ''I wish I'd been here when the club kids were big,'' said Mr. Nahal, who is 30 and grew up in England. 
 Their last event unfurled rather chaotically on a recent Saturday at Collective Hardware, a gallery and events space on the Bowery. The story they were photographing, as outlined earlier by Mr. Nahal, went something like this: the marriage of some gay superheroes is interrupted by a villain who takes some or all of the wedding party hostage in a time machine that travels back to the 1980s. The wedding ceremony is eventually celebrated in the future, at a service attended by some mummies. Or something like that. 
 Joseph Ian Henrikson, director of the Anonymous Gallery on the ground floor of Collective Hardware, had taken pity on the homeless designers and agreed to open the place to their cast, about 30 New Yorkers ranging in age from their early 20s to 64 (the 64-year-old was Leee Black Childers, the early Warhol-era rock 'n' roll photographer and manager -- of Sid Vicious, Johnny Thunder and others -- and a nightlife veteran). Afterward, Mr. Nahal and Mr. Bowser planned to shoot a scene at the 54th Street apartment of Dennis Rolland, an interior designer Mr. Nahal once interned for. 
 Midday, the cast careered in and out of Collective Hardware as Mr. Nahal and others tweaked costumes, adding fringes of duct tape. He and Mr. Bowser had made a living room and ''church'' with their furniture on the second floor. What was left in the truck -- a gray wool 1950s modern-style sofa that folded out into a bed; a painting by Kimyon Huggins, a friend; and assorted tchotchkes -- Mr. Bowser was arranging into a bedroom vignette. 
 Tucking a gilded twig into a pot of dirt, Mr. Bowser, 39, noted that he had left $2,500 worth of Taschen books at their old apartment. ''But it's nice to start over, it's not a bad feeling,'' he said. 
 They met over five years ago, when Mr. Bowser, who is from California, put an ad on Craigslist looking for a ''friend with a loft and a dog.'' (Mr. Bowser has a retriever named Harley.) The two dated and broke up almost immediately, after which they moved in together, platonically, and started a business as ''artist-stroke-designers,'' Mr. Nahal said. ''We're not just interior designers. We like to conquer space.'' 
 For a while, they had decorating clients, mostly bankers, they said, in New Jersey, Manhattan and Brooklyn. But by late 2008, their design business had largely dried up, Mr. Bowser said: ''It happened so much sooner for us.''
 They kept spinning, hoping that activity might somehow lead to revenue. They hosted cooking parties in their $3,500-a-month loft, Mr. Nahal said, ''but we ended up not charging because the guests were our friends.'' 
 They had a meeting with an agent at William Morris. To be marketed as what, exactly? 
 ''He was going to help us figure that out,'' Mr. Bowser said.
 And they collaborated with artist friends on installations in galleries as well as other people's apartments, including Colin Lively's, which they decorated for free. (Why? Mr. Lively, a society hairdresser, ''has a lot of wealthy clients,'' Mr. Nahal explained.)
 And when their money ran out, rather than moving to a cheaper place, they simply stopped paying rent, Mr. Bowser said, because ''we want to stay in Manhattan.'' For now, they are staying with friends.
 Upstairs at Collective Hardware, the ''actors'' were milling about, smoking and shivering in their plastic wrap. Mr. Childers remarked: ''This is what happens when you're retired. They dress you up, and you go into your second childhood.'' Purple Pam, a nightlife fixture who has played the villain in the six previous installments, wore purple dreadlocks, a shimmering purple petticoat and a black bustier.
 Then Mr. Rolland arrived, having driven straight from his 40th high school reunion in Reading, Pa. He brought Amish cheese and other snacks for the cast members, which was good because they had had only vodka since noon, and it was 3 p.m. 
 All at once, the crowd congealed into a tableau, illustrating a marriage proposal. Then it was off to Mr. Rolland's, a complicated maneuver given the number of people and the fact that the outfits were not exactly subway-appropriate. As the crowd poured into his tiny, beautifully finished apartment, Mr. Rolland set out snacks and more vodka. Somebody turned on the stereo -- Madonna's ''Holiday'' -- and the crowd began to dance in the front hall, which has lavender Venetian plaster walls and a pair of torsos made from pink paillettes. The apartment looked like an underwater grotto as imagined by Dorothy Draper.
 Jennifer Gnisci, a playwright, was jumping on Mr. Rolland's bed, which has a fantastical Hollywood Regency headboard. You wished she would stop. Valerie Geffner, a statuesque blonde, drifted by. ''I want to give you my pop opera,'' she said, handing out a CD. A glass broke. 
 Mr. Bowser wadded a handful of police tape into a bow and held it up to his ear. ''Is that too much?'' he asked. ''Last time I was here I broke a $500 Baccarat crystal glass. A piece of tape wound around it and pulled it to the ground. I felt terrible. Don't you feel terrible when someone is nice, and you break something nice, and you can't pay for it?''
 You are brave, someone said to Mr. Rolland.
 He smiled and shooed them out the door and on to their next scene.
 ''I am brave,'' he said. ''That's what the decorating editors always used to say.''

HEADLINE: Senate Democrat Charges Racism Inside the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Since he became a state senator in 2003, Kevin S. Parker has been charged with punching a traffic enforcement agent and scuffling with a photographer for The New York Post.
 A former staff member has accused him of shoving her and breaking her glasses. And the senator drew a firestorm of criticism last year after he described Gov. David A. Paterson in not-so-delicate terms as a drug-abusing adulterer.
 Mr. Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat, found himself again at the center of a fracas on Wednesday, after declaring that Republican lawmakers were white supremacists. 
 What at first appeared to be an impolitic outburst by a lawmaker known for his volatile temperament was quickly becoming a political liability for Senate Democrats at a time when they can ill afford another controversy involving one of their members.
 Democrats enjoy a threadbare one-seat majority in the Senate and will face several tough challenges from Republicans in November.
 Seizing on Mr. Parker's remarks, Senate Republicans called for him to be censured. Dean G. Skelos, the Senate minority leader, said Wednesday that Mr. Parker was unfit for office and threatened that Republicans would move to discipline him if John L. Sampson, the Senate Democratic leader, did not.
 ''I am calling on Senator Sampson and every member of his conference to repudiate Senator Parker's comments,'' Mr. Skelos said, adding that Mr. Parker's comments were ''disturbing, disgraceful, disruptive and reprehensible.'' 
 But the Democratic leader declined to condemn Mr. Parker or distance himself from the senator's comments. In a statement, Mr. Sampson said the fuss over Mr. Parker was a distraction from the severe economic problems facing the state.
 ''Enough with the finger-pointing, name calling and heated rhetoric,'' Mr. Sampson said. ''New Yorkers want results. I need members in both parties to step back and focus on what's important: balancing the budget, creating jobs and providing property tax relief.''
 Republicans also drew parallels to a scandal involving a Democrat accused of violent behavior: Hiram Monserrate, the Queens Democrat who was expelled by the Senate this year after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault charges for dragging his companion down a hallway during an argument. 
 At the time Mr. Monserrate was charged, Democrats were slow to repudiate him or his alleged behavior. 
 Of the 32 Senate Democrats, 8, including Mr. Sampson, voted against Mr. Monserrate's expulsion -- a point Republicans have made when criticizing Senate Democratic leadership.
 ''We saw this reaction with Senator Monserrate, where Senator Sampson actually voted not to expel him despite the overwhelming sense on both sides of the aisle that he needed to leave the Senate,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for Senate Republicans. ''So we are not surprised.''
 Mr. Parker's comments on Wednesday followed his eruption on Tuesday morning during a confirmation hearing for a member of the state power authority. Mr. Parker angrily objected to a remark by Senator John A. DeFrancisco, a Republican from the Syracuse area, who said black people were not the only ones to suffer discrimination. The nominee for the power authority was black, as is Mr. Parker.
 ''John, you are totally out of order,'' Mr. Parker shouted. ''How dare you?''
 The senator who was chairman of the hearing, Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn, threatened to have Mr. Parker removed, to which Mr. Parker angrily shot back: ''O.K., then get somebody to remove me. Bring people up.''
 Mr. Parker, who is expected to face trial this year on a felony assault charge stemming from an altercation with a photographer for The Post, went on the radio station WWRL on Wednesday morning to explain his outburst. During that interview, he compared Republicans to white supremacists. ''There's only one kind of racism that's functional in the world, and that's white supremacy,'' he said. ''And that's what John DeFrancisco and a lot of the Republicans are.'' 
 In a separate interview with The New York Times in his Albany office on Wednesday, Mr. Parker was unapologetic. He repeated comments from his radio interview, claiming that he did indeed believe that many Republicans were white supremacists.
 ''I stand by that,'' he said. ''The reality is that racism is a power dynamic and it's done by groups. This doesn't mean that every single person in the Republican conference of the State Senate is, you know, a racist. I think there are some that are.''
 During the interview, Mr. Parker appeared calm and unperturbed by the backlash over his remarks. But just before he invited a reporter in, he could be overheard shouting about the episode, claiming that his enemies were using it to embarrass him. When a member of his staff called the senator to let him know a reporter was waiting just outside his door, he quickly stopped shouting.

HEADLINE: State Senator Is Accused Of a Scheme To Underpay

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Two years ago, Shahking Gomez was unemployed when his job search led him to the Soundview HealthCare Network, a group of nonprofit health clinics in the Bronx operated by the State Senate majority leader, Pedro Espada Jr.
 Mr. Gomez said he was promised a job as a janitor as long as he completed a short training program. What he said he spent two weeks doing was working all day: sweeping, mopping, cleaning the front sidewalk of a clinic and disposing of medical waste. 
''There was no training whatsoever,'' said Mr. Gomez, 30, who lives in the Bronx. ''They just handed me a mop and bucket and told me to get to work. After the two weeks they gave me a personal check for $200 and a certificate of completion, and then they basically sent me on my way. They told me there was no permanent work.''
 Mr. Gomez was not the only one who was duped by Mr. Espada's clinics, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo's office filed a civil suit against Soundview, Mr. Espada and Mr. Espada's son Pedro G. Espada, accusing them of setting up a sham training program as a way to grossly underpay janitors -- some as little as $1.70 an hour.
 The suit, the second filed by Mr. Cuomo's office against Mr. Espada in recent days, claims that over five years, at least 100 workers were told that by becoming trainees, they would win jobs at Soundview health clinics. Instead, they were sent away with checks that amounted to a fraction of the minimum wage and were replaced by other trainees. 
 The accusations were the latest blow for Mr. Espada, who has sought to portray himself as a man of the people and an advocate for underpaid workers, including migrant farm workers. But janitors in his training program made an average of $1.87 an hour and as little as $1.70 an hour, the suit alleges. The federal minimum wage is $7.25.
 ''The job training program was a sham,'' Mr. Cuomo told reporters during a news conference in Manhattan. ''There was no training. There was no program.''
 ''These people are vulnerable, desperate, needy people, who go for help, who go for training, who are trying to better themselves to get a better life for themselves and their families,'' he added, ''and they're exploited by Mr. Espada.'' 
 Mr. Espada, as he has done before, responded to the latest charges by attacking Mr. Cuomo, accusing him of throwing ''political stink bombs'' and labeling himself the victim of a ''political assassination.'' Mr. Cuomo was trying to divert attention, Mr. Espada said, from questions about his looming entrance into the race for governor. 
 ''This is not a sham training program,'' Mr. Espada said. ''This is on-the-job training where they go through a two-week period with a supervisor to the various sites, and there's a whole curriculum and a training program.'' 
 Mr. Espada added that the trainees received a stipend, but no hourly wages. 
 But Mr. Gomez said he was simply put to work like any other janitor. 
 ''He was just taking advantage of desperate people like me who are looking for work,'' he said. Adding insult to injury, he said he received a worthless document at the end of the program, a ''Certificate of Completion of Healthcare Maintenance Internship.'' 
 A week after his training session ended, Mr. Gomez said he walked by the clinic, saw two new janitorial trainees and struck up a conversation. 
 ''They were doing basically the same thing I was doing,'' he said. ''I spoke with them, and they had the same story as I did. They had been told the same thing.''
 Mr. Gomez later complained to the Better Business Bureau. His complaint made its way to the attorney general's office, which made him available for an interview. 
 Mr. Cuomo filed a much broader suit against Mr. Espada last week, accusing him, along with his family and political aides, of looting more than $14 million from Soundview, using the network as a ''personal piggy bank'' to pay for expenses like $20,000 worth of sushi and $50,000 to maintain a Bronx apartment, even though the suit said Mr. Espada actually lives in Westchester County, outside his legislative district.
 Mr. Espada also arranged for a $9 million severance package that, if paid out, would bankrupt the clinics, according to the suit. Mr. Cuomo said criminal charges against Mr. Espada were a strong possibility. 
 The suits have led to verbal volleys between the two men. 
 Mr. Espada called Mr. Cuomo the ''prince of darkness'' in a recent television interview. Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday that Mr. Espada was a ''person who knows the laws, knows the regulations as an elected official, who is flagrantly violating the state law when it comes to a not-for-profit.'' 
 Mr. Espada faces an array of problems. He and Soundview are also under investigation by federal prosecutors and the Bronx district attorney's office.
 Mr. Gomez, meanwhile, only recently found a full-time job: working at a pharmaceutical company as a janitor.

HEADLINE: Sprint Nextel Posts Wider Loss

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone service provider, posted a wider first-quarter loss on Wednesday but said customer defections had slowed. 
 Analysts were encouraged that the company, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., slowed the loss of valuable long-term customers and posted an increase in the number of budget-conscious customers who paid in advance. 
 ''People were looking for it to show improvements and it did,'' said Kevin Roe, an analyst at Roe Equity Research. ''There's still a lot of heavy work ahead of them but they're moving in the right direction.'' 
 Sprint lost 578,000 contract-signing customers in the quarter, an improvement from a loss of 1.25 million a year earlier, and better than the 623,574 drop expected by analysts.
 Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint's chief executive, said the company's progress came at the expense of its bigger rivals. 
 ''That's the biggest driver in their reduction, Sprint's improvements.'' Mr. Hesse said in an interview. He added that Sprint's progress was even more impressive because of signs that the overall growth of the contract market was slowing.
 Mr. Hesse said cancellations by contract customers would decline in the second quarter from first-quarter levels. He did not give specific targets but said the decline would come from an increase in the percentage of customers buying multiple services.
 Sprint's net loss widened to $865 million, or 29 cents a share, from $594 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Mr. Hesse said Sprint planned to broaden its service offerings for customers who prepaid for calls.
 Prepaid customers are currently the main growth segment in the wireless market as users increasingly look to economize.
 Sprint shares rose 17 cents, or 4 percent, to close at $4.26.

HEADLINE: The Hand-Me-Down Home

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
IN the annals of intergenerational friction, there are some familiar sources of disagreement: sex, money, music and what on earth you're going to do with your life. Then there are the truly contentious subjects -- like the fireplace tiles that used to be in Carla Weisberg's apartment on West 12th Street in Greenwich Village.
 Ms. Weisberg, a 47-year-old textile and wallcovering designer, grew up in the apartment, a duplex in a four-unit building that her parents bought in 1960, before she was born. Six years ago, after her mother died suddenly and her father's health began to decline, she moved back to the place where she used to build forts and play hide-and-seek, while her father moved into the ground-floor unit. And so began the delicate undertaking of turning her parents' home into a space she could live in as an adult, a home for herself and her husband.
 It is fairly unusual for someone like Ms. Weisberg to move into her parents' home after her parents have moved, but some family therapists and elder-law lawyers say that it may happen more often as the population ages, for both practical and emotional reasons. 
 ''With the economy and 78.2 million baby boomers coming of age'' as senior citizens, said Gail Thoen, a psychologist and licensed family therapist in Minneapolis who has worked with families in these situations, ''this transaction will become more and more common.''
 In some cases, the arrangement enables the older generation to find a quick and trustworthy buyer for a home that must be sold. In others, it simply grants some peace of mind during a tough period of transition.
 Morris Klein, an elder-law lawyer in Bethesda, Md., noted that a provision of Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for nursing home care for many middle-class families, allows ailing parents to give their home to children who have cared for them in certain situations. ''Some of the cases I've had, there did seem to be an emotional component,'' he said. ''It's an attachment to the family home, knowing that someone will be living there that they know -- just feeling at peace that the house is in good hands.'' 
 But for the younger generation, the transition can be fraught. Amy Goyer, 49, is AARP's ''family expert,'' and has built a 25-year career as an authority on intergenerational issues. Her professional experience did little to prepare her, however, for the feelings that surfaced when she took over her parents' home, she said. Ms. Goyer moved from Washington to Chandler, Ariz., a suburb outside Phoenix, last year to help her aging parents make the transition from the four-bedroom house they have owned since 1981 to a two-bedroom apartment in a senior living facility, and she is now making plans to buy the house and live there.
 ''I knew they needed to sell the house to make the finances work,'' she said. ''I knew it would sell for less than they owed on it. I needed a place. So it just made sense.'' 
 Still, she added, ''The act of moving from my little bedroom, which was the guest room, to my parents' bedroom was really hard. It's strange. There's a certain element of feeling guilty. Not guilty because I did anything wrong, but sort of like survivor's guilt.''
 Ms. Weisberg found that when you make changes, you are messing with memories. And as Ms. Thoen, the family therapist, warned: ''Old childhood issues, they will be stirred up -- be prepared. Either consciously or unconsciously, you came of age in that house. Sigmund Freud would just love to analyze this.'' 
 Ms. Weisberg, an only child, had a close and loving relationship with her parents. But as so often happens, she had different tastes. Moreover, she was involved in a serious relationship, one that was likely heading toward marriage, and she wanted her husband-to-be, Jon Stamell, to feel that the home was his as well. 
 She had a plan: She intended to keep at least one or two things in each room that belonged to her parents, out of respect for the life they had lived there. But there would also be structural and aesthetic changes, ''to make the place more ours.''
 The apartment, which has 15-foot ceilings and striking windows, was filled with sculptures, paintings, antiques and other treasures her parents had collected over the years. (Her mother was a sculptor and designer; her father ran his own advertising agency.) Ms. Weisberg and Mr. Stamell, who were married several months after they moved into the apartment, were aiming for a simpler feel. They stripped some decorative molding, removed a beam and false wall her father had built and got rid of a custom china cabinet with panels of antique glass that her parents had bought.
 When her father, an affable man, came up for a look during the construction, he said, ''Well, you've ruined it.''
 Ms. Weisberg was crushed. Yet, she noted: ''If it had been my mother, I would have expected worse. She would have been beside herself.''
 One of the things that upset her father, Bob Weisberg, the most were the gold-and-blue tiles with lions around the fireplace. He and his wife, Martha, had bought them on a trip to Spain and Morocco before Carla was born. Ms. Weisberg and her husband had removed them and replastered the fireplace, leaving it a simple white, with no tile at all. Bob Weisberg was furious.
 For his part, Mr. Stamell said, he tried to steer clear of the conflict: ''I'd generally stay out and let them fight it out. And they could really fight. I think he was frustrated at times by what she was doing. She was kind of erasing his past.''
 Ms. Weisberg said she understood that feeling, particularly since her father was entering the early stages of dementia and having increasing difficulty negotiating stairs at the time. ''My father was experiencing all kinds of losses of his autonomy,'' she said. ''I tried to not take it personally.''
 Today the apartment is a blend of Ms. Weisberg's textiles and wallcoverings and a few of her parents' cherished possessions, including a Peter Cooper rocking chair and a French bronze clock that hangs beside the fireplace, and her father's unhappiness has long faded.
 Upstairs, though, the master bedroom is almost unrecognizable -- intentionally so. ''It's a little odd to sleep where your parents used to sleep, but we changed the space enough that it felt fresh,'' Ms. Weisberg said, and even moved the entrance.
 As for the fireplace tiles, her father saved some and a friend made a side table out of them, so he could have a keepsake of the old apartment.
 FOR Linda Harvey, it was essential to transform her parents' house in Evanston, Ill., not just on the inside but on the outside as well. 
 Ms. Harvey's parents, Monte and Sophie Levinson, bought the house in 1973, when Linda was in first grade. In time, college and adulthood took her far away -- to Iowa, Washington and London. She married, and eventually she and her husband, Mark, moved back to the area for professional reasons. They lived first in Chicago and then, after she became pregnant with their second child, fell in love with a house in Evanston three blocks from her parents. Despite some concern about the proximity, they bought it and moved in.
 Soon after, Ms. Harvey's mother received a diagnosis of breast cancer, and it became increasingly apparent that the big house was becoming too much for her parents to maintain. But the prospect of selling a home that held more than three decades' worth of family possessions was daunting. 
 Ms. Harvey and her husband talked. It's a wonderful house, she recalled saying. It's bigger than what we have now. You already love the neighborhood and the community. Why don't we buy it ourselves?
 They did, but agreed ''to do a few things immediately to make it our own home,'' she said, beginning with altering the facade.
 ''When I drive up to the house, I need to have something visually that cues me that it's not the same house,'' Ms. Harvey, now 43, said. The answer turned out to be replacing a single-pane window above the front door with a bay window, adding a new roof with copper flashing and replacing the garage doors. 
 There were more changes inside. The stone floor that stretched from the front door back to the kitchen became hardwood, and they broke through the wall between the kitchen and breakfast room to open up the space.
 Ms. Harvey recalled the pride she felt when her mother, weak from chemotherapy, came to see the changes in the midst of the construction. ''She said, 'Ah, I always wanted to do that.' '' 
 But, she added, ''My father, not so much.''
 Dr. Levinson, a retired physician, recalled his shock and consternation. ''You're going to punch a hole between the kitchen and the breakfast room?!'' he said, recounting his reaction in an animated voice. ''Why are you going to do that??''
 It didn't stop there: ''You're going to put a huge TV over the fireplace?! What on earth for?''
 ''You know what?'' he added. ''It proved to be the right thing for their young family.''
 A couple of years ago, Ms. Harvey's daughter, then 9, was poking around in the basement and popped open a closet door that had been painted shut. Inside she found a trove of 1970's playthings -- a troll doll with pink hair, Archie comic books, some neon art -- ''all this stuff from a clubhouse my brother and I had put together years ago,'' Ms. Harvey said. ''I'd forgotten it existed.'' The girl was delighted and immediately turned it into a clubhouse of her own.
 That continuity is symbolized most powerfully by the one room that did not change. The dining room looks almost exactly as it did in Ms. Harvey's childhood, with the same table, chairs, rug and buffet. But one difference is notable: When the extended family gathers, Dr. Levinson no longer sits at the head of the table -- Mark Harvey takes that place. ''It's his house now,'' Dr. Levinson said.
 MS. HARVEY'S memories of her childhood home were largely happy ones, but Jody Costello's were not -- at least not by the time she moved back there. 
 Ms. Costello grew up in the Point Loma district of San Diego in a stucco house with a panoramic view of San Diego Bay. Her family and most of her neighbors were Portuguese. They grew grapes in the backyard, and her grandfather made wine and stored it in the cellar.
 Ms. Costello is now in her 50s. Her father died in 1995, and several years ago she moved her mother, who suffered from a variety of health problems, to an assisted-living facility. The house was falling into disrepair, and Ms. Costello and her husband, Don, decided to fix it up so they could bring her mother back for her final years. At the same time, they decided to build an addition so they could move in and be there for her as well.
 What followed was a renovation nightmare involving massive leaks, mold, a lawsuit against the contractor and an eventual settlement. Meanwhile, her mother's health slipped further. She eventually came home, but five days later she died.
 Ms. Costello, who worked in medical sales, was stuck with a half-finished renovation and a home filled with upsetting memories. She hated the house. Her father had died there. Her mother had died there. The mold brought on by a botched construction job had made her ill. She hated to be there, but she knew the place was in no condition to sell. She and her husband had no choice but to finish the renovation and live there for a while.
 To exorcise the sadness associated with the house, she knew she had to transform the way it looked. And so, she said, ''I became obsessively crazy over color.''
 White reminded her of the walls in the rooms where her parents had passed away, and the drywall she had lived with during the endless renovation was white, as well as the suits worn by the men who had removed the mold. 
 So, she took painting classes and Venetian plaster classes. Went to Las Vegas for a week and learned techniques from a man who had done some of the big Vegas hotels. 
 Now, two opposing walls in the master bedroom are a deep red, burnished and waxed Venetian plaster. Ms. Costello did the work herself. ''It was cathartic for me,'' she said. ''I threw out my rotator cuff because I was sanding some drywall. I was insane.'' The other two walls are dark yellow with flecks of sage, purple and antique gold.
 Downstairs, the living room is done in purples and sage green. There's a harlequin pattern on two walls, and a wall of solid purple. Hallways and other rooms are done in golds, siennas and rusts with faux finishes. Even the toilets and sinks are colored -- in deep blue, hunter green and burgundy.
 ''This makes it my home,'' Ms. Costello said. ''This makes it me.'' 
 Recently, a cousin who hadn't been to the house in nearly 20 years came to visit. She walked in the door and stopped cold. ''She said, 'My God, this is not the house I remembered,' '' Ms. Costello said. ''I said, 'Mission accomplished.' ''

HEADLINE: Ratings Agencies Are Overrated

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Why do markets still pay attention to what rating agencies have to say? After their appalling record predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, it is astonishing and sad that investors still seem to quake when Standard & Poor's reduces Greece's rating to junk status and downgrades Spain's.
 A Martian would find it hard to understand why anybody gives any credence at all to S.& P. and its rivals. It's not just that they were pumping up the subprime market. For example, the agencies gave a AAA rating to Abacus, Goldman Sachs's synthetic collateralized debt obligation, after smart investors saw trouble in the market. 
 They were late in spotting the wave of corporate debt defaults in the early part of the century. And they have been dilatory in calling attention to the current sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Even after S.& P.'s downgrade of Spain, Moody's and Fitch, the other big agencies, are still rating the country's debt at AAA. Ratings agencies are consistently behind the curve.
 So why do they still wield influence? There are at least two reasons. One is because they are embedded in the way markets operate. Some investors are allowed to buy only investment-grade securities. That means they have to sell securities when they are reduced to junk. Similarly, ratings are used in determining the risk in a bank's balance sheet and how much capital it must set aside.
 Ratings are also often used when deciding how big a haircut is required when banks and investors pledge collateral. One saving grace in the euro zone crisis is that the European Central Bank has stopped saying that only the highest-rated sovereign debt can be pledged as collateral. But ratings are still far too entrenched.
 The other reason why markets pay attention when the agencies bark is what could be called the megaphone effect. S.& P. and Moody's may not be the smartest observers in the market, but they do make a big noise. It's a bit like shouting fire in a crowded theater. The agencies aren't the first to spot the problem, but they sure help create a panic.
 It is high time regulators and investors dethroned them from their privileged status.
 Move Fast, Big Oil
 Multinational oil groups could be late for another shale party. They've paid for their tardy arrival to the shale gas business. Yet oil shale deposits, though not as big, could deliver quicker profits. The danger for the majors once again is waiting so long that the independents can name their price.
 Squeezing oil from nonporous rock is harder than extracting smaller gas particles. But the same drilling techniques that produced the shale gas revolution are now squeezing oil from shale. Once worthless rock in North Dakota, the Bakken shale, is now estimated to contain up to 4.3 billion barrels of oil, according to the United States Geological Survey.
 Harold Hamm, the billionaire founder of the independent oil group Continental Resources, says he believes that new discoveries have doubled this base. Shale has already been responsible for the first rise in oil production in the United States since the 1970s.
 This should be enough to make the oil majors take note. As latecomers to the shale gas event, they were forced to pay top dollar to team up with gas pioneers or enter into lopsided joint ventures. True, shale gas offers much larger reserves altogether, with the equivalent of around 106 billion barrels of oil. But oil shale investments may deliver superior returns for the foreseeable future.
 Abundant gas and scarce oil mean that energy firms now get paid over three times more for the energy content of oil than for the energy in gas. With easy-to-extract oil in short supply, shale-based oil is looking like the pick of the bunch among unconventional sources. Canadian sands break even at an oil price of $70 a barrel or so, compared with $50 or less for oil shale, according to PFC Energy, an energy consultant.
 The cost of admission to the oil shale club is rising fast. The shares of early birds Continental and EOG Resources have far outpaced their rivals. Both stocks have risen about 15 percent this year, against a 5 percent fall for Chesapeake Energy, a shale gas specialist. Big oil may have to act quickly to avoid arriving late again.

HEADLINE: Cape Cod Residents Don't Expect One Ruling to End Long Fight

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
HYANNIS, Mass. -- The federal government may have described the Cape Wind project as a fait accompli, but Ian Parent does not expect to see turbines in the water or run the panini maker at his restaurant with electricity generated in Nantucket Sound any time soon. 
 ''I bet this goes on for another five years,'' said Mr. Parent, the owner of La Petite France Cafe, as he unwrapped cheese behind the counter on Wednesday afternoon. 
 Word that the federal government had approved a permit on Wednesday for Cape Wind Associates to build a 130-turbine wind farm off the coast here barely caused a ripple in Hyannis, where the installation will be visible from parts of the town, including a popular beach and many houses. 
 After a nine-year battle over the proposal, most here thought the decision would lead to even more years of litigation and waiting. 
 ''I don't think it's over yet,'' said Rob MacNamee, 42, a lawyer from Barnstable, Mass. ''It's been going on for how long? All the stickers for and against have washed off the cars, and the signs have blown down.'' 
 The fight has dragged on for so long that many find themselves on both sides of the issue. That is, they now support the development of renewable energy, but just not here. 
 ''I'm 100 percent for alternative energy, but just not in Nantucket Sound,'' Mr. Parent said. ''There's no guarantee that the electricity will be cheaper. And once you put those windmills out there you can never take them away.''
 Many in Hyannis, where the wind that would one day power the turbines whipped around rain and hail on Wednesday, thought the decision was to be expected from the Obama administration, which has dedicated billions of dollars to alternative energy sources. 
 Allen Rencurrel, a ship captain, speculated that the administration had deliberately waited until after the death in August of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, one of Cape Wind's biggest opponents, to make its call. 
 ''Now that Teddy's gone, that's the only way they got it approved,'' Mr. Rencurrel said from the deck of the Seafox, which harvests clams in beds near the site where the turbines would rise. 
 Mr. Rencurrel said he worried that the turbines would interfere with the routes he takes to some of his clam beds and challenge both experienced captains and recreational boaters. 
 ''I feel sorry for the pleasure boaters out there -- they're inexperienced and are going to be running into these things,'' he said.
 Yet with unemployment high and affordable housing hard to come by, some here suggest that the construction and operations jobs could well make up for what might be lost in a vista. 
 ''There's a desperate need for work here,'' said Steven Spagnohe, 46, a musician from Hyannis. ''There's a lot of skilled laborers and mechanical people out of work, and this would help.''
 Mr. Spagnohe said that people opposed to the project are ''old money'' who ''don't want to lose tradition'' while he sees Cape Wind as a step forward for the country's energy policy. 
 ''We're going to get more electricity,'' he said. ''It's a great opportunity for the United States, for America and for the Cape.''

HEADLINE: Study Shows Extent Of 'Invisible Work' By Family Doctors

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
A new study detailing the uncompensated work burden on family doctors points to the need to change how they are paid, medical experts say -- particularly as the new health care law promises to add millions more patients to the system. 
 Family doctors make up the embattled front line of the nation's health care system. They earn about half the money of specialists who focus on treating particular ailments or parts of the body. That is a reason less than 10 percent of medical school graduates choose so-called primary care, which includes general internists and pediatricians. 
 Worsening shortages of family doctors were being predicted even before the recent health care legislation, which opened the door to an estimated 30 million newly insured people who will begin making appointments for checkups and other care.
 ''There is already enormous pressure on primary care, and more is coming,'' said Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, a professor of family medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
 Comparatively modest salaries and rising patient numbers are part of the challenge, medical experts say. But so is the breadth of the unpaid work performed by family doctors. A study published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine measured that problem precisely, using computerized patient records and reporting systems to track all the tasks done in a five-physician practice over a year.
 Family doctors are paid mainly for each visit by patients to their offices, typically about $70 a visit. In the practice in Philadelphia covered by the study, each full-time doctor had an average of 18 patient visits a day. 
 But each doctor also made 24 telephone calls a day to patients, specialists and others. And every day, each doctor wrote 12 drug prescriptions, read 20 laboratory reports, examined 14 consultation reports from specialists, reviewed 11 X-ray and other imaging reports, and wrote and sent 17 e-mail messages interpreting test results, consulting with other doctors or advising patients.
 The article is the statistical answer to its title, ''What's Keeping Us So Busy in Primary Care?'' The study, Dr. Bodenheimer said, ''really quantifies the huge amount of invisible work in primary care.''
 The study, medical experts say, also suggests the direction of changes needed if family practices are to flourish and more effectively improve the health of patients and contain costs. It starts, they say, with compensating doctors for work other than patient visits. Such work includes preventive care and helping patients manage chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, cancer and asthma, which account for most of the nation's health care spending.
 The new health care legislation includes Medicare payments for preventive health and programs intended to encourage family doctors to assist patients in improving their overall health. And last year's economic stimulus package included $19 billion in financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to accelerate the adoption of electronic health records. 
 Digital patient records, experts agree, can help coordinate and improve care, though using the technology in doctors' offices is often difficult and time-consuming.
 The Philadelphia practice made that difficult but worthwhile transition to electronic health records in 2004, said Dr. Richard J. Baron, the author of the journal article. His office is also part of a pilot project that compensates doctors for preventive and disease-management work, not just office visits. That program, begun in 2008, is sponsored by large insurers in the area and some local providers of Medicaid services.
 The program, Dr. Baron said, has increased the revenue for his practice by about 15 percent a year. ''It's been a lifeline that provides us support to do the things we've been trying to do to keep our patients healthier and out of the hospital,'' he said.
 Similar pilot programs across the country have produced encouraging results so far, reducing total health care costs for patients with chronic conditions by 5 percent to 20 percent, according to Dr. Paul Grundy, an I.B.M. health expert who is president of the Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative, a group of large employers, health care providers and insurers.
 Dr. David Blumenthal, the Obama administration's national coordinator for health information technology, said the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine was ''full of important lessons for primary care and for the nation's health system.'' 
 In an e-mail message, Dr. Blumenthal said the study showed ''the enormous strain'' on family doctors, but also ''a pathway toward escaping at least some of those burdens: the electronic health record combined with changes in workflow and payment.''

HEADLINE: Labor Protests Outside Egypt's Parliament Test Government

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Laura Kasinof contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Day after day, hundreds of workers from all over Egypt have staged demonstrations and sit-ins outside Parliament, turning sidewalks in the heart of the capital into makeshift camps and confounding government efforts to bring an end to the protests.
 Nearly every day since February, protesters have chanted demands outside Parliament during daylight and laid out bedrolls along the pavement at night. The government and its allies have been unable to silence the workers, who are angry about a range of issues, including low salaries. 
 Using an emergency law that allows arrest without charge and restricts the ability to organize, the Egyptian government and the ruling National Democratic Party have for decades blocked development of an effective opposition while monopolizing the levers of power. The open question -- one that analysts say the government fears -- is whether the workers will connect their economic woes with virtual one-party rule and organize into a political force. 
 This week, with blankets stacked neatly behind them, at least four different groups were banging pots, pans and empty bottles and chanting slogans. There were factory workers, government workers, employees of a telephone company and handicapped men and women. The group of handicapped people said they had been there for 47 days, demanding jobs and housing.
 ''If we get our rights, we will leave,'' said Gamal Sharqawy, 42, a government worker who said that he and about 200 others had spent 22 days on the pavement. His demand was for a pay raise. He earns $18 a month.
 ''We will take our rights,'' he said with a blend of despair and determination.
 While political demonstrations are still dealt with harshly, the government's approach to labor protests has been to negotiate, offering raises and back pay to get workers off the street.
 ''The current wave of protests is erupting from the largest social movement Egypt has witnessed in more than half a century,'' wrote Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford and principal author of a report on Egypt's labor movement for the Solidarity Center, a labor-financed advocacy group in Washington. The report said that 1.7 million workers engaged in 1,900 ''strikes and other forms of protest'' from 2004 through 2008.
 The government has tried to define workers' complaints as pocketbook issues, analysts said, hoping that if specific demands are met, workers will disband without blaming those in charge and without adding political change to their list of priorities. 
 For a time, that seemed to work.
 ''The government realizes the most important thing is to ensure these protests are kept at a wide distance from the political opposition elite, because then it will not gain momentum,'' said Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.
 As evidence, he said the leaders of the state security agencies had held negotiations between protesters and the government, often pressing ministries to meet workers' demands. ''They think this is a way to contain protests, but what happened is the workers have come away empowered,'' Mr. Bahgat said.
 Workers say they have learned that if they stage job actions in their factories, as they used to do, they will be dealt with harshly by the police. But if they make noise on the streets of Cairo, the government will relent.
 Surrounded by barricades and the police 24 hours a day, the demonstrators have turned the sidewalks into a revolving door of protests. Nearly every work sector has appeared at one time, including tax collectors, who struck for three months. About the only group that has not is the security force.
 The workers' protests and their implications have become a hot button topic here in part because parliamentary elections are coming up. The intensity of the discussion has been stoked by the government's newest and most problematic opponent, the former director of the United Nations nuclear agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who has publicly made the case to link the economic plight of average Egyptians with the lack of democracy and political accountability.
 Mohamed Abdellah, a leading member of the governing party and former longtime member of Parliament, said that he was not worried because he saw the protests as a positive sign that Egyptian civil society was evolving.
 ''It means that society is more dynamic,'' he said, though he said that some of the workers' demands were ill conceived. ''People are claiming what they want, and raising their voice -- this is a good signal.''
 But there are other indications that the leadership's tolerance is beginning to fray. This month, Hassan Nashaat al-Qasas, a member of Parliament and of the governing party, was quoted in the news media as calling on the Interior Ministry to shoot the protesters: ''Instead of using water hoses to disperse them, the police ought to shoot them; they deserve it.'' 
 In a speech on Saturday, a national holiday, President Hosni Mubarak seemed to respond to the protesters. While insisting that the nation had come a long way economically, he acknowledged that there were still significant problems and poverty, a concession for a leader who has been in power for nearly 30 years.
 Then Mr. Mubarak appeared to signal he would not tolerate much more.
 ''I sincerely welcome the interplay in the society as long as it abides by laws and the Constitution, and is intended to realize the interest of Egypt,'' he said. ''This interaction should not turn into a conflict or a confrontation and we have to be aware of such a turn.''
 But his words went unheeded on the streets outside Parliament. Near the chamber of the upper house of Parliament, where hundreds of people were gathered, employees from a yarn factory had set up a model coffin, saying it represented the Egyptian worker. Khalid Jaraj, 40, a father of three small children, said he worked for a factory that had run out of cash and had not paid him his salary of $110 a month for three months. 
 Amira Mahmoud, 25, jumped up from her place on the sidewalk to explain that, yes, she wanted to see the root of the workers' problems solved. ''We want a solution, and that is democracy,'' she said.
 But, she added, what she needed first was some money to survive.
 ''There is not enough money, not enough money for us to live,'' she said as a crowd assembled.
 Over Ms. Mahmoud's shoulder, Fouad Whaba, 35, shouted: ''We will die. We will die.''

HEADLINE: Life Sentence Is Debated For Meat Plant Ex-Chief

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
In a final chapter to the long aftermath of a 2008 immigration raid at a kosher meatpacking plant in Iowa, a federal court in Cedar Rapids heard arguments on Wednesday over the sentencing of Sholom Rubashkin, the former chief executive.
 Mr. Rubashkin was in charge of the Agriprocessors plant in Postville, Iowa, when immigration agents landed in helicopters to detain nearly 400 illegal immigrant workers. In November, Mr. Rubashkin was convicted of 86 counts of federal bank fraud in connection with loans to the company. 
 Prosecutors, citing Mr. Rubashkin's ''blatant lawlessness, utter lack of remorse, his egregious and repeated attempts to obstruct justice,'' have asked Judge Linda R. Reade to impose a life sentence. 
 The proposed sentence startled legal experts around the country. In a letter written to Judge Reade on Monday, six former attorneys general, one former solicitor general and more than a dozen former United States attorneys criticized ''the government's extreme sentencing position'' and the ''potentially severe injustice'' that could result.
 The former Justice Department officials questioned the interpretation by Stephanie M. Rose, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, of the federal criminal sentencing guidelines that would apply to Mr. Rubashkin's white-collar crime.
 ''We cannot fathom how truly sound and sensible sentencing rules could call for a life sentence -- or anything close to it -- for Mr. Rubashkin, a 51-year-old, first-time, nonviolent offender,'' they wrote. The letter is signed by Janet Reno, William Barr, Richard Thornburgh, Edwin Meese III, Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach, all of whom served as attorney general. 
 The prosecutors' proposal is consistent with tough criminal charges they pursued against immigrant workers and other managers at Agriprocessors, once the nation's largest producer of kosher meat. Nearly 300 workers served federal prison sentences of five months for identity theft, and several human resources managers and floor supervisors were convicted of felony charges of harboring illegal immigrants. 
 The raid was one of the Bush administration's most high-profile enforcement actions, and became an emblem of its strategy of using criminal charges in immigration cases. The Agriprocessors company collapsed, and the plant was shut, resulting in a loss of hundreds of jobs in Postville, a small-town outpost in Iowa for Orthodox Jews. 
 The Obama administration has not conducted conspicuous raids, with officials saying they wanted to avoid the severe economic impact and the breaking up of immigrant families that sometimes resulted. 
 After prosecutors won a decisive conviction in Mr. Rubashkin's financial fraud trial, they dismissed all charges against him for employing illegal immigrants. Both government and defense documents depict Agriprocessors under Mr. Rubashkin as a chaotic enterprise continually teetering on the edge of financial failure, its accounts in disarray and Mr. Rubashkin taking bank loans to cover gaps and losses.
 In court papers supporting the maximum sentence, prosecutors said Mr. Rubashkin used $300,000 in Agriprocessors' funds to pay his credit card bills, $200,000 to remodel his Postville home and $25,000 for jewelry. Prosecutors argued that he ''was living a rich lifestyle using Agriprocessors' money.'' 
 They said Mr. Rubashkin had defrauded First Bank Business Capital, a St. Louis bank, by fabricating fake collateral for loans. He ordered employees to create false invoices and ''directed millions of dollars to be laundered through a secret bank account'' in the name of Torah Education, prosecutors said, causing more than $26 million in losses to the banks.
 A defense lawyer, Guy Cook, said Mr. Rubashkin had been a poor manager who was overwhelmed by trying to sustain the business founded by his father, Aaron Rubashkin. 
 ''His only intent was to keep the family kosher business in operation,'' Mr. Cook said Tuesday. ''There was never any intent to steal or cheat or rob anyone.''
 Orthodox Jewish leaders have led a campaign in support of Mr. Rubashkin, and more than 16,000 people signed a petition from a Jewish Web site to Judge Reade. 
 ''People believe in him because the mission of Agriprocessors was to provide an important means for Jews to become closer to their connection to God,'' defense lawyers wrote in court papers. Many Jews believe the charges against Mr. Rubashkin were ''attacks on kosher slaughter,'' they wrote. 
 Defense lawyers have asked Judge Reade to impose a six-year sentence. They said the sentence urged by prosecutors is greater than the punishment for Bernard Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive.
 Mr. Rubashkin's trial on state charges for labor abuses, including hiring child labor, starts Tuesday. Some 10 immigrant workers have received temporary visas as witnesses to testify in those cases.
 Federal prosecutors held 35 other immigrants in the United States as material witnesses for Mr. Rubashkin's immigration trial. When the immigration charges were dismissed, the immigrants were ordered to leave the country by March 31.

HEADLINE: Buoyed by the Fed's Stance, Investors Push Shares Higher

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks pushed past concerns over a widening European debt crisis and closed higher on Wall Street on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve reassured investors that the economy was improving and left interest rates untouched as predicted.
 Standard & Poor's cut the debt rating of Spain on Wednesday, the third European downgrade in two days. Greece and Portugal were marked down on Tuesday, setting in motion a global flight from equities to fixed-income investments, particularly those in United States dollars.
 As the euro fell to a one-year low, European leaders scrambled to control market instability springing from the Greek debt crisis and to stave off contagion. Investors want to see some stability emerge from a timetable on a proposed bailout plan for Greece. On Wednesday, Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said the government could present draft legislation on such a plan as early as Monday. 
 But much still depends on negotiations with Greece over the terms, which could conclude by the end of this week.
 ''The market is looking for some stability that they can grab onto, that this is not getting out of control,'' said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer, McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''How they handle Greece will dictate how they deal with any weaker units out there. Portugal is on the fringes, and you have Italy and Ireland sitting out there. Maybe they are not as bad, but maybe they will need some support as well.''
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.28 points, or 0.48 percent, at 11,045.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a gain of 7.65 points or 0.65 percent, at 1,191.36, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 0.26 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,471.73.
 The market has been grappling with fears that financial troubles in Europe might spread. But Spain's downgrade was not expected to have as much of an effect as that of Greece, which ''basically forces the hand of a lot of portfolio managers who cannot hold junk or high-yield debt,'' said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global.
 ''Double A is not the end of the world,'' said Mr. Kalivas, referring to Spain's new credit rating. ''And it does not force people to rejigger their portfolios or put a lot of Spanish debt on the market looking for a home.''
 If anything, Mr. Kalivas said, the Spanish downgrade would ''give a little tailwind'' to the talks to aid Greece. 
 European stocks closed mostly lower.
 In the United States, investors had been waiting for cues from the Federal Reserve on the economy, and in the afternoon they got what they expected. Although the Fed said there were still constraints on household spending, it did not change its basic characterization of the economic recovery or of its expectations for inflation, which it maintained was ''likely to be subdued for some time.'' As expected, it kept short-term interest rates near zero.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 19/32, to 98 28/32, and the yield rose to 3.76 percent, from 3.69 percent late Tuesday.
 The market is continuing to rely on corporate earnings for economic signals. Financials and energy shares were higher, while the consumer discretionary sector slipped.
 Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Investments, said it appeared more companies were profiting by increasing revenue, a transition from earlier quarters when they raised profits by cutting costs.
 ''The large story here in our opinion in that the first-quarter earnings reports are confirming that we are in a powerful profits recovery,'' Mr. Smith said.
 Comcast, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical were the latest companies to exceed earnings expectations.
 Dow Chemical rose $1.76, or 5.85 percent, to $31.83. Comcast rose 35 cents, or almost 2 percent, to $18.81. Northrop Grumman rose $1.49, or 2.2 percent, to $68.67.

HEADLINE: F. E. Dominy, Who Harnessed Water In the American West, Is Dead at 100

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Floyd E. Dominy, a child of the Dust Bowl who pursued his dream of improving nature and human society by building vast water projects in the West -- steamrolling over pristine canyons, doubtful politicians and irate conservationists -- died on April 20 in Boyce, Va. He was 100.
 His family announced the death. 
 Even before he became the longest-serving commissioner of the federal Bureau of Reclamation (1959 to 1969), Mr. Dominy, as a rising bureaucrat, showed a knack for persuading senators and representatives to push ahead with massive dams in the arid West. 
 Marc Reisner in his 1986 book, ''Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water,'' said Mr. Dominy cultivated Congress ''as if he were tending prize-winning orchids.''
 Mr. Reisner quoted an official in the Interior Department, of which the Reclamation Bureau is a part, as saying, ''Dominy yanked money in and out of those congressmen's districts like a yo-yo.''
 Mr. Dominy, who was not an engineer, worked his political and administrative magic in completing the Glen Canyon, Flaming Gorge and Navajo Dams in the upper Colorado River basin, and the Trinity River part of California's Central Valley Project, among many others. The projects stored and regulated water flow, generated electric power and created lakes for recreation. They enabled crops and cities to sprout from the desert.
 But they also sometimes drowned thousands of years of Native American history, and millions of years of natural history -- not to mention destroying fish habitats. David Brower, the founding director of the Sierra Club, called his own acceptance of the Glen Canyon dam -- in return for the bureau's pulling back on another -- his greatest failure.
 Mr. Dominy took the opposite view in a speech in North Dakota in 1966, calling a Colorado River without dams ''useless to anyone.'' He added, ''I've seen all the wild rivers I ever want to see.''
 Michael L. Connor, the current head of the bureau, said in a speech in 2009 that the agency had 472 dams, and was the nation's largest water wholesaler, serving 31 million people. Sixty percent of the nation's vegetables and a quarter of its fruit and nuts are grown with ''Reclamation water,'' Mr. Connor said.
 The sheer size of this plumbing empire has long caused friction with politicians from other regions, as well as sparked concern among White House budget hawks. Mr. Dominy argued forcefully that fruits and vegetables grown during the winter months improved the health of all Americans, and that reservoirs created by the bureau attracted more vacationers than national parks.
 He could even ascend to lyricism, as he did in describing Lake Powell, which the Glen Canyon Dam would create in 1966. In a book distributed by the Bureau of Reclamation called ''Lake Powell: Jewel of the Colorado,'' he wrote, ''Dear God, did you cast down two hundred miles of canyon and mark, 'For poets only'? Multitudes hunger for a lake in the sun.''
 Mr. Brower countered that the lake's pre-emption of natural habitat could also ultimately affect multitudes. ''A thousand people a year times ten thousand years will never see what was here,'' he said.
 Floyd Elgin Dominy was born on a farm in Adams County, Neb., on Dec. 24, 1909. His family lacked an indoor toilet. He graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in agricultural economics, briefly taught school and then became an agricultural extension agent in Wyoming. He hit upon the idea of helping farmers build small dams to store water for their livestock, and built 300 in the county.
 ''That was more than in the whole rest of the West,'' he said in an interview with Mr. Reisner. ''I was a one-man Bureau of Reclamation.''
 During World War II, Mr. Dominy helped establish instant farms to provide food for miners and loggers dumped into foreign jungles to harvest critical materials for the war effort. After the war, he returned to Washington, went to a phone booth and called the Reclamation Bureau. He had a job in three hours, Mr. Reisner said.
 Mr. Dominy's rise in the bureau was rapid. After starting in 1946, he became assistant commissioner in 1957, associate commissioner in 1958 and commissioner in 1959. He did not behave like a cookie-cutter bureaucrat. Mr. Reisner called him ''freewheeling and reckless,'' while Mr. Connor chose the phrase ''larger than life.''
 Mr. Dominy's wife of 53 years, the former Alice Criswell, died in 1982. He is survived by his daughters, Janice DeBolt and Ruth Swart Young; his son, Charles; eight grandchildren; 23 great-grandchildren; and one great-great-granddaughter.
 Mr. Dominy was proud of his role in lubricating the development of America's West. One thing he did question in an interview with The Sacramento Bee in 2002 was the government's selling water so cheaply that there was little incentive to conserve.
 ''It almost staggers my mind when I fly over Phoenix,'' he said, ''and see all those swimming pools.''

HEADLINE: Bid for Right to Sign Ballot Petitions in Secret Stirs Skeptics on the Supreme Court

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A request that the Supreme Court create a new First Amendment right to keep secret the names of people who sign ballot petitions met with intense skepticism at the Supreme Court on Wednesday from justices across the ideological spectrum. 
 Justice Antonin Scalia, for instance, derided the idea as ''touchy-feely.'' 
 ''The fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount of civic courage,'' he said. ''And the First Amendment does not protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls when you exercise your political rights.'' 
 The argument in the case, the last scheduled in the term and probably the last of Justice John Paul Stevens's tenure, was lively and wide-ranging, with the justices kicking around analogies with unusual gusto.
 While the justices appeared unlikely to adopt the sweeping rule requested by the petitioners, several left open the possibility that proof of potential harassment in particular cases could warrant secrecy.
 The case arose from a failed effort to overturn a Washington State domestic partnership law known as the ''everything but marriage'' act. Protect Marriage Washington, a group that supports traditional marriage, sued to block release of the names of the more than 130,000 people who signed petitions to put the measure on the ballot. The group said disclosure would probably result in ''threats, harassment and reprisal.''
 James Bopp Jr., a lawyer for the group and two anonymous individuals, argued that Washington's open records law ran afoul of the First Amendment in requiring that the names of petition signers be disclosed. 
 Justice Stevens asked a single set of questions, about whether disclosures might encourage worthwhile debate.
 Mr. Bopp called that ''a very marginal interest.''
 Justice Scalia jumped in. ''What about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them?'' he asked. ''Is that such a bad thing for democracy?'' 
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that at least some forms of retaliation, notably economic boycotts and picketing, were constitutionally protected. ''It's a First Amendment activity,'' Justice Kennedy said.
 In testy exchanges with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mr. Bopp conceded that petition signers give up some expectations of privacy, that their signatures may not indicate a political point of view and that disclosures of such names are a commonplace occurrence in some 20 states.
 ''The sponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these lists'' of names, Justice Ginsburg said. ''They use them for fund-raising purposes. So that would be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one side. Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses these lists?''
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Bopp said.
 Justice Ginsburg added, drawing on Mr. Bopp's briefs, that signing a petition could mean one of three things: support for the ballot measure, support for the idea that the issue in question should be put to a vote or an effort to placate a pesky solicitor.
 Mr. Bopp denied endorsing the third view, prompting Justice Ginsburg to read a snippet from one of his briefs saying that people may ''simply sign to avoid any further discussion with a petition circulator.'' That caused Mr. Bopp to reverse course.
 Justice Scalia suggested that even secret ballots in ordinary elections were a matter of legislative choice rather than constitutional principle. For the first century of the nation's existence, he said, voting was public. 
 Attorney General Robert M. McKenna of Washington, who was defending his state's open records law, said the question was an open one.
 A number of news organizations, including The New York Times Company, filed a brief in the case, arguing that the petitions should be treated as public records.
 Only Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. appeared consistently sympathetic to the argument in favor of secrecy. He pressed Mr. McKenna about just how much information the government could collect and disclose.
 Mr. McKenna said it depends, later adding that the names of people who signed similar petition forms in Arkansas, Florida and Massachusetts were made public without incident.
 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. appeared skeptical of adopting an across-the-board First Amendment principle requiring secrecy. But he did suggest that courts could address particularly fraught situations case by case without adopting a general rule applicable to all petitions.
 On the broader point, though, Justice Scalia seemed to capture the mood of the court. ''You are asking us,'' he told Mr. Bopp, ''to enter into a whole new field where we have never gone before.''

HEADLINE: A Congressional Grilling for Goldman

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Goldman Sachs on the Defensive as Senators Ask Blunt Questions'' (Business Day, April 28):
 The Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Goldman Sachs is essentially defining the fine line between ethically abhorrent and illegal. How the courts ultimately rule is anyone's guess. But most perturbing to me was how little attention is being paid to a big loser from Wall Street's actions: the American saver.
 TARP and other money funneled to Wall Street has been largely paid back. The biggest and most hidden subsidy of all has not. Interest rates are near zero. They are at such a level so banks, like Goldman, can make money by using this almost-free money and investing in AAA-rated Treasuries yielding 2 to 4 percent more than their borrowings. 
 Savers are the ones financing this by forgoing normal interest rates, but they will never get their day in court. If Goldman owes anyone, it's not the ''sophisticated'' institutions that bought their risky mortgage products; it's the citizens who didn't have a choice in bailing out entities like Goldman.
 Michael Lebowitz Bethesda, Md., April 28, 2010
 The writer is a principal of Absolute Investment Management..
 To the Editor:
 The refusal of Lloyd C. Blankfein and other Goldman officials appearing before the Senate's investigating subcommittee to acknowledge any wrongdoing on their part in precipitating the Great Recession calls to mind another Lloyd from a different yet similar era.
 In 1894, the American Gilded Age reformer Henry Demarest Lloyd published his magnum opus, ''Wealth Against Commonwealth,'' a searing indictment of John D. Rockefeller and his Standard Oil monopoly. The book's pointed title resonates powerfully again in this second Gilded Age.
 As demonstrated by their self-enriching, socially ruinous actions, and even more tellingly and baldly by their subsequent unapologetic defense of them before a panel of exasperated senators, for Mr. Blankfein and company, wealth need pay commonwealth no heed.
 Gregory L. Kaster St. Peter, Minn., April 28, 2010
 The writer is a professor of history at Gustavus Adolphus College.
 To the Editor:
 The type of financial duplicity of which Goldman Sachs is accused is similar to the discredited practices by many investment firms during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. It seems to me that the solution is simple.
 An institution that sells a given position (long or short) to a client should be forbidden from taking the opposite position for its own portfolio. It strikes me as reprehensible if not unethical for a company to earn a commission by promoting a certain transaction, and then take the opposite position for its own portfolio because it believes that the latter is a superior position.
 Attorneys, actuaries and other professionals are not permitted to represent clients on both sides of an issue (except in rare cases and only with full disclosure to both parties). Investment firms should be similarly prohibited from doing so.
 Roy Goldman Louisville, Ky., April 25, 2010
 The writer has been chief actuary and chief financial officer of various insurance companies. 
 To the Editor:
 Goldman Sachs has manipulated our economy for its own benefit. It's not a coincidence that former Goldman employees hold some of the most influential monetary positions in our country and abroad.
 The architect of the bailout was a former Goldman chief executive, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was able to funnel trillions of our dollars to his friends on Wall Street. An earlier treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, spent 26 years at Goldman and later became chairman of Citigroup, which got a $45 billion taxpayer bailout from Mr. Paulson. The heads of the Canadian and Italian national banks are Goldman alums, as are the heads of the World Bank and the New York Stock Exchange.
 Goldman has found a loophole in the system of Western democratic capitalism, because even in a society governed by free markets, organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy.
 Emily Mandler Fairfield, Conn., April 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The fact that Goldman Sachs initiated short positions against investments marketed and held by the firm is neither illegal nor unusual. A form of hedging, it has been a Wall Street practice for generations.
 Purchasers of the mortgage-related securities in question were hardly neophytes. Moreover, the required disclosure material accompanying the transactions was subject to Securities and Exchange Commission preapproval.
 While the Goldman investigation is politically expedient, it's misguided and unjust.
 Arnie Mori Fairport, N.Y., April 25, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I agree with Bethany McLean that Congress bears a major part of the blame for our current financial crisis (''Meet the Real Villain of the Financial Crisis,'' Op-Ed, April 27).
 My concern is that unless we achieve true reform of campaign financing and attempt to level the playing field between the public interest and the special interests, abuses will continue.
 Since 1989, Goldman Sachs has donated more than $30 million toward federal campaigns, which puts it among the 10 biggest contributors.
 I do not know if the Securities and Exchange Commission will prevail in its civil fraud suit against Goldman. What I do hope is that Goldman will lose its case in the court of public opinion and that the public's outrage will apply pressure for our political leaders to end the cozy relationship between Wall Street and Congress.
 John A. Viteritti Southold, N.Y., April 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Perhaps this would be a good time to sell Goldman Sachs stock short.

HEADLINE: Yellen Is Expected to Be Nominated as Vice Chairwoman of the Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will nominate Janet L. Yellen on Thursday to be vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and fill two remaining seats on the central bank's board of governors, officials said Wednesday evening.
 News of the nominations came hours after the Fed's open market committee decided to keep short-term interest rates near zero and maintained, as it has for nearly a year, that rates would stay at that level for ''an extended period.''
 Ms. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is a leading macroeconomist and a former Fed governor, but the two other nominees, Peter A. Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Sarah Bloom Raskin, the Maryland commissioner of financial regulation, do not have backgrounds in monetary policy. The White House floated all three names last month, but delayed the nominations pending a review of the candidates' backgrounds. 
 After its meeting Wednesday, the central bank disclosed nothing about when or how it would reduce the size of the $2.3 trillion balance sheet it accumulated as it acquired mortgage-backed securities to prop up the housing market, suggesting that it had no plans to start selling the assets anytime soon.
 Concluding a two-day meeting, the Fed's policy-making panel voted to keep the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent, the ''exceptionally low'' level it has been at since December 2008.
 While a few Fed policy makers have raised doubts about the wisdom of sticking with the unusually low rates for too much longer, others have pointed to the 9.7 percent unemployment rate to argue that the Fed is still a long way from needing to tighten the supply of credit. 
 Members of the panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, said at their previous meeting, in March, that the ''extended period'' language did not mean anything specific, and that the Fed could act at any time if it thought conditions warranted it. 
 In a statement, the committee offered glimmers of a rosier economic assessment. The committee found that the labor market ''is beginning to improve,'' a change from the last meeting, when it said the market was ''stabilizing.'' 
 It stated that the growth in household spending had ''picked up recently''; in March, such spending was merely ''expanding at a moderate rate.'' And it concluded that housing starts, described as ''flat'' in March, had ''edged up but remained at a depressed level.''
 The Fed did not change its basic characterization of the economic recovery, which it continued to describe as moderate, or of its expectations for inflation, which it maintained was ''likely to be subdued for some time.'' 
 Ms. Yellen, 63, would replace Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn, a 40-year Fed stalwart who plans to retire in June. Ms. Raskin, 49, is a former lawyer for the Senate Banking Committee, and Mr. Diamond, who turns 70 on Thursday, is an authority on Social Security and pensions. 
 If confirmed by the Senate, they will join the Fed as it strives to return to normal after making emergency loans and scooping up assets to bolster an economy stricken by the financial crisis. Mr. Obama has already named one Fed governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, and renominated the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to a second four-year term.
 On March 31, the Fed completed buying $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, an action that helped keep home loan rates at near-record lows. But now the central bank has to figure out what to do with all of those assets.
 If the Fed were to do nothing, and wait for the underlying mortgages to be paid and for the securities to roll off its books, the unwinding would take decades. 
 Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, urged in speeches this month that the Fed consider selling $15 billion to $25 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month. He said that carrying mortgage-related assets on its books for a long period would expose the Fed to interest rate risks.
 Two other regional Fed presidents, Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond and Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, have also said they think that asset sales will not disrupt the still-fragile housing market. 
 Other Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, have said that asset sales are a viable option but not necessarily the best one. 
 Laurence M. Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said that any decisions about selling the securities should not be made too hastily. 
 ''Nothing too bad would happen to let them roll off slowly,'' he said. ''The Fed is not in business to make savvy investments to increase its net worth. That's pretty secondary to the broader impact on the economy. Practically speaking, I don't think there's any urgency.'' 
 Along with selling securities, the Fed is testing alternative means for eventually draining the reserves it created as it bought assets -- mortgage bonds, debts owed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Treasury securities -- to hold down long-term interest rates. 
 Mr. Bernanke holds the view that short-term rates are to remain low for an extended period, but dissenters have become more vocal. Thomas M. Hoenig of the Kansas City Fed was the sole no vote in the last two meetings of the committee, though he has not called for raising rates. 
 Mr. Hoenig dissented once again Wednesday, saying the language ''was no longer warranted because it could lead to a buildup of future imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability, while limiting the committee's flexibility to begin raising rates modestly.''
 Other regional Fed presidents -- James Bullard of St. Louis, Mr. Plosser of Philadelphia and Mr. Lacker of Richmond -- have said that the language should be amended at some point because it could otherwise constrain the central bank's ability to raise rates promptly if necessary. 
 ''It seems like there's an internal momentum behind the recovery,'' said Peter N. Ireland, an economist at Boston College. ''This is the dilemma the Fed has always faced after easing policy during a recession. It doesn't want to tighten policy too soon and choke off recovery, but it doesn't want to wait until it's too late and inflation is on the upswing.''

HEADLINE: Obama Vows to Push Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama conceded Wednesday that Congress may not have the appetite to deal with the hot-button immigration issue this year, but he vowed to continue to press lawmakers to at least begin work soon on a comprehensive bill to overhaul the country's immigration system. 
 In a rare interview with reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Obama said it was vital that Congress address the immigration issue, lest more state measures like the tough new law in Arizona sprout up. 
 But he acknowledged that the road to a comprehensive immigration bill was an uphill one. ''It's a matter of political will,'' he said, adding that Congress might not have the stomach for another tough battle after the bruising fight over health care and the prospect of another battle over a climate change bill.
 ''We've gone through a very tough year, and I've been driving Congress pretty hard,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 But the president said that ''we need to start a process, at least,'' adding that he wanted to come up with a proposal that could win broad public support.
 To succeed, Mr. Obama said, he will need some backing from Republicans, a tough task in an election year.
 ''I've made calls to Republicans,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I think I can get a majority of Democrats, but I need some help from Republicans.''
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat who is locked in a bruising re-election campaign in Nevada, has promised Hispanic voters in his state that he will take up immigration legislation this year, addressing both border security and citizenship. 
 But on Wednesday, he told reporters that the climate change bill would probably come before immigration because that legislation had already been drafted.
 He added, however, that Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, had an outline of an immigration bill that could soon be completed. 
 The immigration issue has become a lightning rod for both Republicans and Democrats, who are embroiled in a fight over a new Arizona law giving the police the authority to detain people they suspect are illegal immigrants. 
 Asked whether the White House, which has strongly criticized the Arizona bill as a possible infringement of civil rights, planned to challenge the measure, Mr. Obama said Wednesday, ''We're examining it now.''
 He added, ''I understand the frustrations of the border states,'' but said that is why the country needed a comprehensive immigration overhaul.
 Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton waded into the debate on Wednesday with the bravado of someone never facing election again. 
 ''I don't think there's any alternative but for us to increase immigration,'' he said, both to help the economy grow and to fix the long-term finances of Medicare and Social Security. 
 ''I just don't see a way out of this unless that's part of the strategy,'' he added in his remarks at a meeting on fiscal policy in Washington.

HEADLINE: Former Fed Chief Dampens Talk of a Tax

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who recently incited speculation that the Obama administration would propose a European-style consumption tax to reduce deficits, on Wednesday said the idea was too unpopular to be under consideration ''now or for the indefinite future.''
 But Mr. Volcker suggested that while the economy remained too fragile to raise taxes or cut spending right now to reduce projections of dangerously high national debt, ''we can deal with the Social Security problem reasonably promptly'' with changes that do not take effect for some years, such as phasing in a higher retirement age. 
 Mr. Volcker, an informal adviser to President Obama and chairman of his economic recovery advisory board, earlier this month suggested publicly that a value-added tax, or VAT, was a good option, along with an energy tax, for raising revenues.
 The White House immediately denied that it was considering that, but Republicans looking for election-year issues have continued to suggest otherwise.
 In a videotaped interview at a fiscal policy summit, Mr. Volcker stood by his own support for the idea. A VAT ''is common in every other industrialized country,'' he said, but it has ''never been popular in the United States.'' 
 He added, ''I don't think it's on the political table now or for the indefinite future, but that's the kind of thing you have to look at.'' 
 Mr. Volcker was interviewed by Peter G. Peterson, the billionaire investor and commerce secretary in the Nixon administration. Mr. Peterson's foundation hosted the fiscal summit, which also drew former President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, along with economic authorities whose views range from liberal to conservative, though most were centrists.
 Most agreed that Washington should enact a debt-reduction plan of both spending cuts and revenue increases as soon as the economy has recovered, though the timing and solutions proved divisive at times.
 The discussion groups also included Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, and former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, whose once-venerable reputations have suffered now that they have come in for some blame for the financial crisis.
 Liberal groups assailed the event ahead of time, charging that Mr. Peterson and his foundation spread undue alarm about the nation's debt to build support for cutting Social Security and Medicare. 
 Progressive activists have also complained this week of too-close ties between the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and the Obama administration, seeing as evidence the fact that Wednesday's summit followed by a day the opening meeting of Mr. Obama's bipartisan debt-reduction commission on Tuesday. 
 The commission's co-chairmen -- former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton -- attended and spoke at the Peterson event. Mr. Simpson at one point complained that critics of a value-added tax were distorting the issue to undercut the commission before it even gets down to work. 
 Conservative critics of a VAT oppose any new tax, and liberals complain that it would be regressive, hitting low- and middle-income households hardest because they spend most of their money on consumables. But proponents of a VAT, which is levied on products at each stage of production and distribution, say it would raise needed revenues, encourage saving and allow for reduced income taxes.
 Social Security was a frequent target for those proposing areas for future deficit reductions, given that the rising costs of entitlement programs as the population ages are the biggest reason for the size of deficit forecasts. Medicare is a bigger problem, but the new health insurance law envisions spending reductions, although Mr. Obama told members of his fiscal commission that the law -- like everything else in the federal budget -- was on the table for their consideration.
 Those addressing Social Security included Mr. Volcker, whose comments, as the VAT controversy showed, take on added weight given his role as an economic elder statesman and mentor to the younger president.
 He called fixing Social Security ''the most manageable'' issue, compared with Medicare and Medicaid, whose financial woes are entwined with the complexities and fast-rising costs in the health care system generally.
 ''There should be a bipartisan interest in it, of taking measures that are quite reasonable measures -- would not require any significant increase in taxes -- to stabilize the outlook for Social Security for the indefinite future,'' Mr. Volcker said.
 ''There might not be any savings at all in the short run, but I think that psychologically, the fact that it would have a real impact over time is reassuring'' to global markets and to foreign holders of American debt ''that we can step up to this problem.''
 He and other speakers expressed fear that without some action in the next year or two that reduces deficits for decades to come, interest rates could spike, the dollar could lose value or some other financial crisis would occur. 
 Mr. Rubin, a longtime investment banker, said the deficit ultimately is ''not a Wall Street problem'' but one for all Americans, since it would undercut job creation.
 ''I'm more worried about this than at any time in my lifetime,'' he said. 
 But the talk of some future crisis was vexing to one of the few liberal participants.
 ''We're in a crisis,'' said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, reflecting the frustration of many on the left that the increasing focus on deficit reduction ignores the need to keep spending to stimulate the economy.
 ''Our first thing to do is generate jobs,'' Mr. Mishel said.

HEADLINE: Now Accepting Cash, Checks Or Cellphone

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and NICK BILTON

 BODY:
You win a bet, but the loser does not have enough cash on him to settle it. If he has a credit card, and most people usually do, there is finally a solution. A number of big and small companies -- including eBay's PayPal unit, Intuit, VeriFone and Square -- are creating innovative ways for individuals to avoid cash and checks and settle all debts, public and private, using their cellphones.
 Several of the companies have developed small credit card scanners that plug into a cellphone and for a small fee enable any individual or small business to turn a phone into a credit card processing terminal. PayPal's cellphone app calls for only a simple bump of two cellphones to transfer money. Apple has submitted a patent application for a cellphone payment system. 
 Brian Kusler, 40, a software engineer, is already helping dollar bills join Susan B. Anthony coins as collector's items. After he polished off grilled lamb and zinfandel at a San Francisco restaurant recently, his dining companion paid the bill and asked him for his share. Instead of hunting down an A.T.M., the two bumped their iPhones together, and Mr. Kusler wirelessly transferred his part of the bill, about $100. 
 ''I don't carry a lot of cash; I don't think anyone does these days,'' Mr. Kusler said. ''We go out, and I oftentimes have to remember to pay my friends back when we get home, and I want to be able to just do it right there.'' 
 There is evidence that paper money is being used less often, according to the Federal Reserve. Though cash payments are difficult to track, the number of noncash transactions in the United States grew from fewer than 250 a person in 1995 to more than 300 in 2006. Data on the stock of small-denomination bills and destroyed bills indicates that the use of cash peaked in the mid-1990s and has been declining since, two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found. 
 ''When debit cards were introduced in the early '90s, that was the beginning of the slow and gradual decline of paper checks and cash,'' said Red Gillen, a senior analyst at Celent, a research and consulting firm on technology and financial services, based in Boston. 
 Still, cash has remained essential in certain instances, like paying back a colleague for lunch, buying fruit at a farmers' market or buying a beer at a cash-only bar. These new mobile payment technologies could finally change that. 
 ''The problem with cash is that it is tangible, it's inconvenient, you have to carry around a bunch of bills and you have to continually go to the A.T.M.,'' said Jack Dorsey, a Twitter co-founder who is now the co-founder and chief executive of Square, which makes a dime-size device that anyone can plug into the earplug jack of an iPhone or iPad to instantly accept credit card payments. ''If we can make cards more convenient and faster, it can replace a lot of the experiences around cash.'' 
 Light wallets are not a problem for Joe Mangrum, a sidewalk sand painter in New York, who has been using Square to take donations from passers-by and sell copies of his book. Sales have increased sharply since he started accepting credit cards on his iPhone, he said. ''I've made the sale as opposed to twiddling my thumbs because they don't have the cash.'' 
 The new services could have the biggest impact on the smallest businesses, like farm stands or house cleaners, that accept only cash and checks because they do not have stores to house credit card terminals and do not want to enter into complicated, long-term relationships with credit card companies. 
 Rachel Ancliffe, a clothing designer in Portland, Ore., sells her dresses and blouses at sample sales and from her home, and uses Intuit GoPayment to process credit card payments.
 ''You can't accept checks because then you're just kissing your product goodbye'' because of fraud and bounced checks, Ms. Ancliffe said. ''I sell 10 times more because I take credit cards.'' 
 Fraud protection offered by the credit card companies is the same as when the card is used at a cash register. Some of the new companies say security against fraud might even be improved because they provide e-mail receipts, and those from Square include photos and a map of where the transactions were made. 
 The death of cash has been predicted since the 1970s, when electronic transactions like direct deposit of checks were introduced. But most digital payment experiments, like one in 2006 by Visa, have focused on swiping cellphones, as is popular in countries like Japan, instead of credit cards. Mobile payments have not taken off in the United States because Americans are just as happy to reach into their pockets for a plastic card as for a cellphone. 
 Instead of replacing credit cards, technologies like Square and GoPayment rely on them. Credit card companies stay in the middle, extracting a fee with each swipe or bump.
 GoPayment costs $12.95 a month on top of a per-transaction fee of 30 cents plus 1.7 percent to 3.7 percent of the payment, depending on the credit card companies' rates. Square is free and users pay 15 cents plus 2.75 percent to 3.5 percent of each transaction. It will be available for iPhones and iPod Touches in May and for other phones and laptops later. 
 Exchanging money with friends using PayPal's iPhone app is free if payers use a bank or PayPal account, and costs 30 cents plus 2.9 percent of the transaction for credit cards. 
 Though people will use cash less, it is not nearly extinct, said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president for financial institutions policy at the American Bankers Association. ''Historically, we have seen more failed innovations in payments than we've seen successful ones, because you have to convince people that it's secure, more efficient and reliable,'' Mr. Abernathy said. 
 But a cashless society could become a reality as the younger generation, accustomed to buying music on iTunes and virtual gifts on Facebook, grows up. 
 ''Older people still tend to like to use cash or checks,'' Mr. Abernathy said. ''Younger people don't want to touch a piece of paper. They want to do it all electronically.''

HEADLINE: A Catalog in Full Bloom

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
RALEIGH, N.C.
I WAS staring at Whale's Tongue, the big blue agave I'd fallen for last winter in the Plant Delights Nursery catalog as two feet of snow piled up outside. Here, at the nursery, was the real thing, a good five feet wide and dusky gray-blue.
I wanted to stash it in my car. But could I grow Whale's Tongue as far north as my garden in Maryland?
''Maybe, if you keep its roots dry in winter,'' said Tony Avent, who founded Plant Delights in 1988 with his wife, Michelle. ''Last year, we had 8 degrees and this was just untouched.'' 
Agave ovatifolia, the Whale's Tongue hardy century plant, hails from the mountains of Nuevo Leon in Mexico, where winters are cold. And Mr. Avent, who loves to challenge assumptions about a plant's supposed range, has this blue beauty and many other succulents sailing through his Zone 7B winters here, where temperatures can fall to 5 degrees.
A yucca near the entrance to the nursery, about 10 feet tall and just as wide, bristled with narrow spiky leaves and sported a mass of white flowers as tightly wound as my late Aunt Ethel's pin curls.
''We sell a lot of these in a drought year,'' Mr. Avent said. As he writes in his catalog, ''If you need to stop trespassing deer, this is your plant'' -- and it's hardy to Zone 7, at least. (My garden in Maryland, as well as many gardens in and around New York City, hover between USDA Hardiness Zones 7B and 7A, where winter temperatures can fall as low as zero.)
I had come down about two weeks earlier for a preview of what visitors will see at the nursery's open house over the next two weekends. They can wander through seven greenhouses full of elephant ears and variegated agaves, rare ferns and hostas. They can also explore the Juniper Level Botanic Gardens -- six acres set aside for research and display -- where the most promising plants, including jack-in-the-pulpits, gingers and epimediums, are studied in a home-garden-like setting.
Usually these gardens are open by appointment only, and until May, the plants are for sale only online or through the catalog. But during the open house, visitors may buy as many as they can stuff into an 18-wheeler.
''I have one guy who flies in on his private plane every year,'' Mr. Avent said.
The gardens will be open again the second two weekends in July and September, when the elephant ears will be as big as their namesakes.
The trilliums were blooming in full force when I was there, in a woodland garden full of trees and shrubs that reminded me of all the things I longed for but did not have: a fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus) laden with fragrant white blossoms; a red buckeye (Aesculus pavia) loaded with buds that promised clusters of red flowers; magnolias of all kinds; and lilacs that I thought were not supposed to like the South.
''We've got 20 different lilacs here,'' said Mr. Avent, who likes to call himself the ''mythbuster of horticulture.''
''Give me a good rumor, and let me find out if it's right or wrong -- most of them are dead wrong,'' he said. ''Everybody tries the same pass-along clone of Syringa vulgaris that's no good here.''
MR. AVENT, who has a degree in horticulture from North Carolina State University, travels the world -- from the fields and forests of this country, down through Mexico and South America, as well as Europe, Africa and Asia -- searching for plants that will suit the warmer, more humid conditions of the mid-Atlantic coast and the Southeast.
There are 17,000 kinds of plants here, including many of the woody shrubs and trees that Mr. Avent grows as a habitat and striking backdrop for his perennials. He does not sell them, but will tell you where to get them.
''There's nothing worse, as a plant person, than walking through a garden and seeing a plant and not having any idea where you can get it,'' he said.
As we crouched to get a closer look at the patterned leaves of some of the 500 trilliums growing here, it occurred to me that I was the beneficiary of a childhood disappointment Mr. Avent never forgot.
As a 5-year-old, young Tony was making terrariums and selling them; by 6, he was ordering plants by mail.
''When I was 8, I told my father I wanted to go see the best garden in the world,'' Mr. Avent had told me earlier. ''I figured, from all the catalogs, that had to be Wayside Gardens.''
So one day, the family drove down to Greenwood, S.C., where Wayside is headquartered.
''We got out and there was a bed of begonias or impatiens or something, and I'm asking, 'Where are the gardens? This can't be it!' ''
While all those wonderful plants in the catalog were available, his father explained, they were either grown off-site or bought from other growers and distributed.
''I was just devastated,'' Mr. Avent said. ''And I said to myself, 'When I grow up, I'm going to have a mail-order nursery with gardens, so nobody will ever be disappointed when they visit.' ''
Plant Delights seems to be weathering the economic storm, though sales have dropped by 15 percent over the last two years. The plants Mr. Avent does put on the market are tested here for years. Of those 500 trilliums, for instance, which are mostly grown from the seeds of single plants collected across the Southeast, 14 kinds are being offered for sale this year. Since it takes five to seven years for a trillium to mature and bloom, and as long as 14 years to have enough to sell, the $22 Mr. Avent charges seems a reasonable price to me.
When he searches for trilliums he might look out over a population of 100,000 plants. ''We're looking for that one unique plant that's taller, bigger, has a darker flower or a bigger flower,'' he said, as we walked through the woodland garden.
''Here's a silver-leafed one I found in Louisiana,'' he said, bending down to get a closer look at the blotched silver and green leaves and the deep red flowers.
He showed off T. underwoodii, which has a silver streak down the middle of each brightly mottled leaf and comes from the dry forests of Alabama.
''When you find something like that, you feel like jumping up and down,'' he said.
Some of these trilliums have been crossbreeding in the garden, something that is impossible, according to the experts -- ''which is why we never let our plants read books,'' Mr. Avent said.
I could smell the fragrant flowers of the fringe tree as we stopped to look more closely at the weirdly beautiful flowers of Asarum maximum Ling Ling or Panda Face ginger. Before its patterned silvery green and gold leaves begin to cover the ground, the flowers -- little black cups with creamy throats -- open up on the forest floor.
''These patterns guide the insects down to the pollen inside,'' Mr. Avent said, prying one of the tubular flowers out of the ground and pulling it apart.
''The pollen is in here, see,'' he said, touching the tiny anthers. ''So when the insect crawls around, it puts the pollen on the stigma here.'' He touched the pistils, where the flower's ovules would be fertilized and turn into seeds.
''If you get a seed set, then you can plant the seeds,'' he said.
Thanks to the mythbuster, these arums are now thriving in hot, humid North Carolina.
European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum) ''is notorious for not taking any heat,'' Mr. Avent said. But the plant's range extends from Northern Europe into the south of France, ''where it's baking hot,'' he said. ''It's just that nothing in the trade was collected from there.''
So Mr. Avent headed south, to collect new genetic material. And, taa-daa: his arums tolerate heat.
He is always looking to fill a niche, and one was variegated agaves. In 2005, he bought a few rare variegated agaves on eBay. ''A plant the size of your thumbnail for $200 to $800 with no roots,'' he said.
When a lab in California told him it was impossible to tissue-culture variegated agaves, he contacted a lab in Minnesota that had successfully tissue-cultured some of his hostas.
''A year later, I had them back,'' he said. Now, he sells variegated agaves for about $25.
Many of his elephant ears resulted from a vacation in Hawaii, which for him means plant hunting. There, in 2003, Mr. Avent stumbled on thousands of seedlings -- ''black leaves, purple leaves, green ones,'' he said -- growing at a university experiment station, where a plant pathologist was trying to find varieties of taro that did not get leaf spot.
''He just happened to get these colored seedlings and was about to plow them under,'' Mr. Avent said. ''So I'm explaining how these have value and potential, and he's looking at me like I have snakes coming out of my head.''
But Mr. Avent persisted. He signed an intellectual property rights agreement with the University of Hawaii and has been working ever since with John Cho, the plant pathologist, to develop some hybrid elephant ears. Seven are now on the market.
Some Myths Worth Busting
HOW does Tony Avent, the horticultural mythbuster, grow so many plants successfully in his garden?
Rule No. 1: he uses the same mix of 40 percent native soil, dug on his own land, and 60 percent compost for every plant.
''The soil for every plant we have is prepared exactly the same, whether it's a pitcher plant or an agave,'' Mr. Avent said. ''Every square inch of these gardens has the same pH, between 6.2 and 6.5, which is ideal for almost every plant. The idea that this plant needs 5 and this one needs 8 is just not true.''
Succulents like agaves and cacti, however, need excellent drainage, so for these, he tills a foot of PermaTill (slate that has been heated to 2,000 degrees, so that it expands and becomes porous) into mounded beds of his regular soil and compost mix.
A full soil analysis, for nutrients as well as fungi-bacteria ratios, will tell you what elements are missing.
''Our gardens are on sand, so we add greensand,'' he said, which is mined along the East Coast and is high in potassium.
Gardeners with clay soil might have to add rock phosphate.
But never add sand to lighten heavy soil, he advises. And don't add rocks to the bottom of a pot to improve drainage: ''Water only runs through materials of similar porosity, so if you put rocks in the bottom of a pot you're actually making the drainage worse.''
Mr. Avent said he stopped using pesticides and chemical fertilizer in his outdoor gardens 20 years ago and was amazed at the improvement in his soil and plants. Conventional wisdom says that plants can't tell the difference between a chemical fertilizer and an organic one, he noted, ''but the microbes do -- the fertilizer was burning up the compost.''
After he switched to organics, he said, ''it took about a year before everything started jumping. Our insect problems disappeared. It was just amazing.''

HEADLINE: China Gains Influence in Korean Affairs as North and South Warily Seek Its Help

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- On Friday, President Lee Myung-bak will travel to China under growing pressure at home to make the case for crucial Chinese support for tough international sanctions against North Korea if, as is widely expected, the North is found responsible for the sinking of a South Korean ship. But he is unlikely to win that support, experts say, a reflection of China's growing role in the Korean Peninsula.
 Since taking office in 2008, Mr. Lee has wound down his predecessors' ''sunshine policy'' of aid and engagement with the North, heightening Chinese fears of instability and driving the North into China's economic embrace. Ultimately, that could give Beijing greater leverage in determining the fate of the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, a situation that many South Koreans would consider to be a nightmare. 
 ''China's influence has become so important that we can almost say that it can now claim the first and last piece of the apple on the Korean Peninsula,'' said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, using a Korean saying to suggest that China can have whatever it wants. 
 Even conservatives, who have usually opposed aid to the North, warn of North Korea's becoming a ''Chinese colony'' whenever reports circulate of Chinese companies taking over North Korean ports and mines at bargain prices. 
 Those fears are undoubtedly overblown, but they contain a kernel of truth, experts say.
 South Korea's concern ''about China's rising dominance over North Korea in economic terms is well founded,'' said John Delury, associate director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York. ''However, I think it's the result of Lee Myung-bak's decision to let the sunshine policy unravel, rather than a strategic plot by China to 'colonize' North Korea economically.'' 
 China, which supplies an estimated 70 percent of North Korea's trade, is the one country that can provide the necessary economic pressure to push the isolated North to the brink of collapse -- or, as Washington, Seoul and Tokyo hope, press it to agree to concessions over its nuclear weapons program. 
 But Beijing is always going to be wary of stronger sanctions. It fears an implosion in North Korea that could release a flood of refugees across its border or put it under pressure to intervene militarily should South Korea and the United States move into the North to seize its nuclear arsenal and build a Western-leaning, unified Korea on China's border. Its paramount concern regarding North Korea is to preserve stability, more than to punish it for truculent behavior or persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. 
 ''China is more interested in maintaining the status quo and avoiding instability, and believes that more trade will help to keep things from falling apart in North Korea,'' said David Straub, a North Korea specialist at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford who was formerly a senior State Department official who specialized in Northeast Asian affairs.
 China juggles its diplomacy between North Korea and its adversaries, just as North Korea plays the regional powers against one another to secure a lifeline that sustains it and allows it to avoid political changes while maintaining its nuclear programs. In the past, sanctions have brought only mixed results against the North; as often as not, they have stiffened its defiance.
 Jin Jingyi, a Chinese specialist on Korean affairs at Peking University, said that the sinking of the South Korean ship had highlighted the weakness of Mr. Lee's position. ''The fact that South Korea keeps talking about international cooperation with China and others shows that Lee Myung-bak has lost the initiative in inter-Korean relations,'' Mr. Jin said.
 ''China will be very cautious,'' he continued. ''It won't think pressuring the North will help solve the problem.'' 
 China, which seeks to enhance stability and reduce economic risk in the region, would like to see better inter-Korean relations, experts say, but just the opposite has happened under Mr. Lee. 
 ''China would probably rather share the burden of economic engagement with the South, but if necessary, it will hold its ground as North Korea's sole economic outlet,'' said Mr. Delury of the Asia Society. ''The resource-hungry, stability-centric, sanctions-averse Chinese will continue filling the void left by the dismantling of inter-Korean cooperation.'' 
 In South Korea, people remain deeply suspicious and fearful of China, which sided with the North during the Korean War. Officially, the goal of both North and South Korea is the reunification of the peninsula, but that is currently unlikely. North Korea loathes the American military presence in the South, just as South Koreans bristle at Chinese influence in the North. 
 China, for its part, knows that the Koreans historically have never been pliant neighbors and that North Korea is an unreliable place to invest, as demonstrated by the North's heavy-handed threats to confiscate South Korean investors' assets at its Diamond Mountain resort and Kaesong. China reportedly has complained to the North about its aid trains ''disappearing'' inside the North, apparently stolen and torn apart. 
 ''Despite their public rhetoric about the closeness of their ties, officials in both China and North Korea each tell even American officials how much they dislike the other,'' said Mr. Straub, the North Korea specialist at Stanford. ''North Korean officials have on numerous occasions suggested to American officials that it would be in the interests of our two countries to have a strategic relationship -- to counter China.''

HEADLINE: Welcome to Arizona, Desert Outpost Of Contradictions

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Arizona is well accustomed to the derision of its countrymen.
 The state resisted adopting Martin Luther King's birthday as a holiday years after most other states embraced it. The sheriff in its largest county forces inmates to wear pink underwear, apparently to assault their masculinity. Residents may take guns almost anywhere, but they may not cut down a cactus. The rest of the nation may scoff or grumble, but Arizona, one of the last truly independent Western outposts, carries on.
 Now, after passing the nation's toughest immigration law, one that gives the police broad power to stop people on suspicion of being here illegally, the state finds itself in perhaps the harshest spotlight in a decade.
 The law drew not only the threat of a challenge by the Justice Department and a rebuke from the president, but the snickers of late-night comedians. City councils elsewhere have called for a boycott of the resort-driven state; one trade group of immigration lawyers has canceled a conference planned for Scottsdale at a time when the state is broke and desperate for business. Meanwhile, a continuous protest is taking place at the State Capitol. 
 Bruce D. Merrill, a polling expert here, is tired of picking up his phone. ''Usually it is somebody asking me, 'What the hell is going on in Arizona?' '' Mr. Merrill said.
 But while Arizona may have become a cartoon of intolerance to much of America, the reality is much more complex, and at times contradictory. This state is a center of both law and order and of new age om. Red-meat-loving. Red-rock-climbing.
 Arizona is home to some of the toughest prison sentencing laws in the country, and one of the cleanest campaign finance laws, too. Voters overwhelmingly re-elected Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, as governor the same year they returned the conservative senator Jon Kyl to Washington. The current Republican governor signed this law, but is also pushing for a tax increase.
 Further, while Arizona may seem on the fringe with its immigration law, the measure mirrors the 1994 battle in California over a voter-approved law that Gov. Pete Wilson signed barring illegal immigrants from getting health care, public education and other services. Like California then, Arizona is taking its own tack instead of waiting on the federal government to change policies.
 ''The political and emotional landscape is almost identical,'' said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, who served as an aide to Mr. Wilson. ''History doesn't repeat itself, it just moves east.''
 The table was set for the passage of the new law by a confluence of factors, say residents, political scientists and businesspeople in Arizona. Those factors include shifting demographics, an embattled state economy and increased violence in Mexico, as well as the perception that the federal government has failed to act. Arizonans find that particularly irksome, given that Ms. Napolitano is now head of the Department of Homeland Security.
 Hispanics make up 30 percent of the population here, up from roughly 25 percent in 2000, according to census data. As the state's economy, largely dependent on construction and development, has slumped, hostility toward illegal immigrants has increased in recent years. ''More people now seem to think Hispanics are taking jobs from Anglos,'' said Mr. Merrill, the polling expert.
 Further, laws like the immigration statute and another new law requiring presidential candidates to provide documentation on their citizenship, age and residency are generally written by the hard-right lawmakers who dominate the Legislature -- with far-left-of-center minority members opposing them -- but neither side reflects the relatively centrist political views of most residents.
 More than 30 percent of registered voters here are independents, double the proportion in 2000. ''People have been leaving both political parties, which leaves the remainders in the party much more ideological,'' Mr. Merrill said.
 Residents are unnerved by the violence in Mexico and the heavy drug trade and illegal immigrant trafficking in Arizona. Most studies have shown illegal immigrants do not commit crimes in a greater proportion than their share of the population, and Arizona's violent crime rate has declined in recent years. But in this state any crime tied to illegal immigrants gets notice.
 Half of the drugs seized along the United States-Mexico border are confiscated in Arizona, and it is a major hub for human smuggling. Last month, Robert Krentz, 58, a member of a prominent ranching family, was killed on his property 20 miles from the border, and the police said the gunman was probably connected to smuggling.
 ''People outside of Arizona are not living in this state and don't understand the issue,'' said Mona Stacey, a computer technician from Mesa. ''Most of them coming across are mostly good, Catholic families getting over here. But you also have the drug lords and the smugglers. It makes the good guys look bad, and you don't know who is who.''
 Conversations here about the new law tend to begin or end with a reference to Ms. Napolitano, who personified the state's blended politics. As governor, she backed the posting of National Guard troops on the border, expanded the use of the state police in antismuggling operations, and pressed Washington for an overhaul of immigration law.
 When it came to the Maricopa County sheriff, Joe Arpaio, however -- a staunch supporter of immigration enforcement and one of the highest profile figures on the issue -- she took a largely hands-off approach.
 Now, as Homeland Security secretary, she has played up the administration's devotion of resources to the border, while resisting pressure to put National Guard troops there.
 This, too, is an echo of California circa 1994. There, Proposition 187, the measure limiting services for illegal immigrants, was struck down by the courts (a possibility here, too, say legal experts). The Clinton administration responded with Operation Gatekeeper, an effort to strengthen the border in California. It ended up pushing trafficking east, and as a result, Arizona posts the highest number of people arrested for crossing along the 2,000-mile border.
 The former director of Operation Gatekeeper has just been appointed President Obama's Customs and Border Protection commissioner.
 With more rallies opposing the law set for Thursday, Sheriff Arpaio has planned another of his controversial sweeps to net illegal immigrants.
 ''Arizona is the most unpredictable political patch of earth I've ever seen,'' said Chip Scutari, a former political reporter who now runs a Phoenix public relations firm. ''It's the land of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's tough-as-nails Tent City, and super-liberal Congressman Raul Grijalva calling for a boycott of his own state. That's Arizona.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 1, 2010 Saturday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a new immigration enforcement law in Arizona described incorrectly action by the Legislature to put in place new requirements for office seekers. The Arizona House has passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to provide documentation on their citizenship, age and residency. But the state does not have a new law requiring all political candidates to prove citizenship. (The sponsor of a Senate bill on presidential candidates said on Thursday that the measure was being shelved for now because of lack of Republican support.)

HEADLINE: Albany's Workweek

 BODY:
Gov. David Paterson of New York has finally gotten so fed up with the failure of legislators and the unions to deal with the state's budget crisis that he wants to do something revolutionary -- make them shoulder part of the burden of saving taxpayers' money. 
 Mr. Paterson wants legislators, who have failed to adopt a budget that was due a month ago, to work five days a week in Albany instead of the usual three. And he wants state employees to work four days a week, taking a weekly unpaid day off until the budget is approved.
 By Albany's standards, this is radical stuff, even with a historically huge state deficit that is $9.2 billion and growing. Legislators huffed that the governor does not have the authority -- under a technicality in the law -- to force them to put in a full week of work. 
 As for the furloughs, a state employees' union spokesman offered a one-word response: ''nuts.'' That sounded brave and defiant coming from the American general refusing a German demand for surrender in World War II. Coming from the union spokesman, it was just the same old, tedious Albany arrogance and irresponsibility.
 What the governor is trying to do is obvious and necessary. He wants to force Democrats who control the Legislature to deal with budget cuts that will be excruciatingly unpopular during an election year. And he wants about 100,000 unionized state workers to help roll back their costs like almost every other sector of the state government is doing.
 Union leaders need to sit down with the governor's office and negotiate reasonable ways to cut costs. Mr. Paterson has said he would prefer furloughs for all workers rather than firing a few and thus putting more people on the unemployment lines. Plenty of private-sector workers have done that in the last couple of years.
 Democratic legislative leaders should establish conference committees to include Republicans in the budget talks. The law requires it. And Republicans, who have been mostly smirking on the sidelines and gathering fuel for the election, need to participate in helpful ways. The Republican minority should come up with reasonable compromises -- not political illusions that would only delay budget talks or force a bad budget to get even worse.
 Unless the Legislature gets serious, the state suffers. And as Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch told one group this week, at this rate, New York might not have a budget until after the November election. For the sake of all New Yorkers, let's hope that was hyperbole.

HEADLINE: AS G.O.P. RELENTS, REGULATION BILL MOVES TO FLOOR

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and EDWARD WYATT; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington, and Helene Cooper from Quincy, Ill.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With political pressure mounting, Senate Republicans relented on Wednesday and agreed to let Democrats open debate on legislation that would impose the most far-reaching overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system since the aftermath of the Depression. 
 The decision by Republicans to allow floor deliberations came after they voted three days in a row to block the bill, and it suggested that they saw political peril in being depicted as impeding tougher rules for Wall Street. 
 But Republicans still oppose many aspects of the bill, and a rough floor fight lies ahead. 
 Senate Republicans control enough votes to filibuster the bill and prevent it from being adopted. 
 President Obama praised the shift in the Senate at a rally in Quincy, Ill., and later in a rare chat with reporters on the plane back to Washington. ''I want to work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to move this legislation,'' Mr. Obama said at the rally, adding, ''What I don't want is a deal made that is written by financial industry lobbyists.''
 Before the logjam broke, Democrats on Wednesday threatened to keep the Senate in session overnight to dramatize the Republican opposition. 
 Republicans said they decided to move forward after talks broke down between leaders of the banking committee and it was clear they would win no further changes before debate.
 At about 6:15 p.m., the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, requested the unanimous consent of the Senate to begin debate, and there was no objection from the Republican side. 
 ''Now let's get to work,'' Mr. Reid said. ''And let's do the utmost to make the American people proud of our efforts.'' He added, ''Wall Street needs reforming.'' 
 While the Republicans can still filibuster, they are at a disadvantage during floor debate given the Democrats' 59 to 41 majority. And the decision to allow floor debate appeared to be a significant retreat by the minority, reflecting a calculation that further delay was politically untenable. 
 Among the challenges for Republicans was explaining how they could participate in an oversight hearing on Tuesday criticizing Goldman Sachs executives and proclaiming the need to tighten regulation of Wall Street, but then go to the Senate chamber and vote to block debate of the financial regulatory bill.
 In an appearance on Wednesday morning on the ''Today'' show on NBC, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a centrist who is known for working across party lines, faced a series of tough questions on that issue. Later in the day, Ms. Collins was among the first Republicans to say it was time to open debate. ''Negotiations have concluded,'' she said. ''It makes sense to proceed to the floor.'' 
 The Republicans met late Wednesday afternoon to discuss the financial regulatory legislation and the steps ahead, and they defended their blocking maneuvers, saying it had helped secure assurances that changes would be made to the legislation, particularly in a chapter on liquidating failing companies. 
 Democrats, however, said that they had made no firm commitments other than to take up Republican concerns during floor debate, where amendments on any controversial issue typically require 60 votes to be approved. 
 In particular, Republicans said they had won the elimination of a proposed $50 billion fund that would be paid for by big financial companies and would be used to help pay for putting failed banks out of business. 
 The Obama administration also had opposed the fund, out of concern that it would complicate efforts to deal with more costly bank failures. And the Democrats had already indicated a willingness to remove the fund from the bill. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, said that his efforts to negotiate important changes to the bill had mostly fallen apart. And he raised particular complaints with a provision to create a new consumer protection bureau that he said would be too powerful. 
 ''I believe we owed the American people our best effort to make whatever changes we could to this incredibly complex piece of legislation, because it will have wide-ranging implications for our economy,'' Mr. Shelby said in a statement. 
 The legislation is intended as a comprehensive answer by Congress to the 2008 economic crisis, which required a $700 billion emergency government rescue and taxpayer-financed bailouts for Wall Street powerhouses.
 The House approved its version of a financial regulatory overhaul in December, and any legislation adopted by the Senate would have to be reconciled with that measure. 
 Floor debate is expected to begin in earnest on Thursday and last at least two weeks, and lawmakers in both parties are likely to bring forward a long list of amendments. Several Republicans have expressed concerns about overregulation that could stifle the economy, while some liberal Democrats contend that the bill is not tough enough on Wall Street. 
 The bill, developed in months of talks between senators in both parties, would touch virtually every aspect of the financial system. 
 It would authorize the government to shut down a financial institution deemed to pose a threat to the stability of the nation's banking system and securities markets, and it would establish a consumer protection bureau intended to end predatory lending practices by, among other things, requiring that consumers receive detailed information on mortgages and other financing. 
 It would provide new oversight of hedge funds and impose tough rules on the trading of derivatives, the complex instruments at the center of the crisis.
 Republicans, in blocking debate, said there were numerous problems in the Democrats' legislation -- including the omission of provisions dealing with the government mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and problems with specific language. 
 But the Republicans won no guarantees of concessions on any of these matters. 
 Still, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said that the delay had highlighted his party's concerns, which he said he hoped would be addressed during floor debate. And he praised the Republicans and the lone Democrat, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who had voted to block debate, saying they had provided an opportunity to improve the bill. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said he would work to make sure senators in both parties could offer amendments to the bill, of which he is the prime sponsor. ''It's time for this debate to begin,'' Mr. Dodd said in a statement. ''And it must be a serious, vigorous debate.'' 
 But Mr. Dodd, in his statement, also accused Mr. Shelby of seeking to weaken provisions in the bill to create a consumer protection bureau. 
 ''I cannot agree to his desire to weaken consumer protections given the enormous abuses we have seen,'' Mr. Dodd said. 
 Both sides said they expected an intense floor debate. ''It's a pretty big bill, and it has got a lot of complexities,'' said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who helped draft the legislation on the banking committee. ''This may be a real debate, which might shock America.''

HEADLINE: Sempra Energy to Pay $410 Million Settlement

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sempra Energy said on Tuesday that it had agreed to pay $410 million to settle claims that it gouged California on electricity contracts that were signed as the state struggled through an energy crisis a decade ago. 
 Sempra, which owns the San Diego Gas & Electric Company and the Southern California Gas Company, reached an agreement in principle with state and federal regulators for a cash settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing, a company spokesman, Doug Kline, said.
 The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement last week but it still will need the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's approval, which is expected later this year, Mr. Kline said.
 ''The settlements will put hundreds of millions of dollars back into the pockets of California energy consumers who suffered blackouts and great economic harm during the energy crisis,'' Jerry Brown, the state's attorney general, said in a written statement.
 Sempra was among several energy companies sued over events during the crisis, when wholesale energy prices soared and the state suffered rolling blackouts. The suits claimed that the companies exploited California's deregulated power system, created fake energy shortages and avoided market rules, costing utility ratepayers as much as $9 billion.
 The state has now negotiated more than $3.2 billion in settlements with energy companies to settle 39 claims of overcharging, state authorities said in a statement.
 Four years ago, Sempra agreed to pay $377 million to settle claims that it manipulated natural gas supplies during the crisis to drive up prices.
 The new settlement calls for Sempra to provide reimbursement of $270 million to California utility customers, who still are being charged 30 to 40 cents a month on their gas and electric bills to pay off debt from energy crisis deals, a Brown spokesman, Jim Finefrock, said.
 Bills for customers of the two power companies will be reduced next year by an amount to be set by the Public Utilities Commission, Mr. Finefrock said.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Promises More Aid for Greece as European Crisis Grows

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and NICHOLAS KULISH; Matthew Saltmarsh and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hoping to quell its biggest crisis since the Asian woes of 1997, the International Monetary Fund promised on Wednesday to increase the 45 billion-euro aid package for Greece to as much as 120 billion euros over three years.
 The fund is racing to conclude an agreement for more painful austerity measures from Greece by Monday, clearing the way for the government to receive funding and reassuring investors worldwide that European debt is safe. On Wednesday, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F.'s forceful managing director, made the higher aid pledge in a private meeting with German legislators. The package would be the equivalent of up to $160 billion and would come from both the I.M.F. and from other countries using the euro. 
 But as has frequently been the case during Europe's debt crisis, the promise of help was overshadowed by more disturbing news -- in this case a cut in the debt rating of Spain by a major agency just a day after downgrades for Portugal and Greece. 
 The growing fear is that the fallout from Greece and even Portugal -- which together compose just 5 percent of European economic activity -- could be a mere sideshow if Spain, with its much larger economy, has difficulty repaying its debt.
 While major stock markets stabilized after Tuesday's sell-off and the cost of insuring the debt of Portugal and Spain declined, the euro slid further on the news of Spain's downgrade by Standard & Poor's. Banking stocks in some of the smaller European economies were among the biggest losers on the day. Major stock indexes in the United States rose slightly, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending up 53 points, at 11,045.27. 
 In many ways, the current troubles in Europe go to the heart of the fund's new mission to serve as a firewall in the financial crisis -- an objective that was bolstered by $750 billion in fresh capital from Group of 20 countries last year. 
 Unlike its previous efforts in smaller, emerging economies in Asia in 1997, and more recently in Hungary, Romania, Latvia and Iceland, the fund has been hamstrung in its efforts to act quickly and decisively by political concerns within the European Union, which insists on assuming a leading role.
 ''It is a problem,'' said Alessandro Leipold, a former acting director of the I.M.F.'s European department. ''It should not be that difficult -- they did it in Hungary and Latvia. But the egos are different in industrialized countries.''
 A case can be made that if Greece had sought help from the fund late last year after the forecast for its budget deficit doubled, the amount of support needed to reassure investors would have been much less than the 120 billion euros that even now might not be enough. 
 In that vein, Mr. Leipold said Portugal and Spain should ignore any stigma associated with an I.M.F. program and make the case to the European Commission in Brussels that asking proactively now for aid would soothe skeptical markets and save Europe billions in the future.
 ''The market has seen its worst fears come true,'' he said. ''What it needs is a surprise on the upside.''
 Concerns have already surfaced in Congress that the broad demands of the sovereign debt crisis will quickly exhaust the I.M.F.'s reserves and leave the United States, the fund's largest shareholder, with the bill.
 Representative Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, said such a drain could occur if Portugal, Ireland and Spain sought I.M.F. aid at the same time. Mr. Kirk worked at the World Bank during the 1982 debt crisis in Mexico, which came close to depleting the fund's reserves. 
 ''We have seen this movie before,'' he said. ''Spain is five times as big as Greece -- that would mean a package of 500 billion.'' 
 Mr. Kirk sits on the House Appropriations Committee that oversees I.M.F. funds and said that he had already asked for hearings on the fund's ability to handle a European collapse. 
 In Athens, the Greek government had no choice but to seek an I.M.F. solution after its costs of borrowing skyrocketed, but that has not made the negotiations for aid any easier. 
 The fund has sent one its most senior staff members, Poul Thomsen, who has overseen complex fund negotiations in Iceland and Russia, to assist Bob Traa, the official responsible for Greece, to work out a solution.
 According to people who have been briefed on the talks, the aim is to secure from Greece a letter of intent for even deeper budget cuts than the tough measures imposed so far, like reductions in civil service pay, in exchange for emergency funds.
 Steps being discussed include closing down parts of the little-used Greek railway system, which employs 7,000 people and is estimated to lose a few million euros a day; limiting unions' ability to impose collective bargaining agreements, which lead to ever-higher public sector pay; cutting out the two months of pay that private-sector workers get on top of their annual pay packages; increasing the retirement age and cutting back on pensions; and opening up the country's trucking market in an effort to lower extremely high transportation rates that have hindered the country's competitiveness.
 With Greece now shut out of the debt markets, it has little leverage to resist -- especially in light of the 8 billion euros it needs to repay bondholders on May 19. Analysts expect a deal by next week at the latest.
 But whether a Greek resolution calms investor fears about the ability of Portugal and Spain to repay their own maturing debt remains unclear.
 In a recent note to investors, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, described the market concern as intensely focused on Spain.
 ''Spain's cash flows (current-account and budget deficit) are extremely bad,'' Mr. Dalio and his colleagues wrote in a February letter. ''Spain's living standards are reliant on not just the roll of old debt, but also on significant further external lending. For these reasons, we don't want to hold Spanish debt at these spreads.''

HEADLINE: Going to New Jersey to Find America

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FORGET about Billy Joel and his state of mind. Right now, the brains of New York, and Madison Avenue in particular, have come down with a case of Jersey fever.
 (No fair asking if it is anything like swamp fever.)
 The characters, culture and couture of New Jersey are being embraced by television networks, advertisers, magazine publishers and other shapers and reflectors of the popular culture. There are several series on and coming on TV with Jersey-centric settings, and they are spinning off or inspiring a spate of marketing and promotional campaigns.
 The bumper crop of Garden State shows includes ''Boardwalk Empire'' on HBO, ''Cake Boss'' on TLC, ''Jersey Couture'' on Oxygen, ''Jerseylicious'' on Style Network, ''Jersey Shore'' on MTV and ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey'' on Bravo.
 Many advertisers in major categories like automobiles, fast food, hair care, movies, packaged foods and soft drinks are eager to sponsor New Jersey-focused series, include their products inside episodes or hire cast members for personal appearances. Among them are blue-chip brands like Jimmy Dean, Dial, Eastman Kodak, Target, Verizon and Warner Brothers. 
 The Glaceau Vitamin water line of beverages sold by Coca-Cola enlisted Mike Sorrentino -- the ''Jersey Shore'' cast member who refers to his impressive abdominal muscles as ''the situation'' -- to co-star with the New York Mets third baseman David Wright in a humorous workout video that can be watched on YouTube.
 ''Who better to be David's training partner than a guy who goes by the nickname of his abs?'' asked Rohan Oza, chief marketing officer at Glaceau.
 The appeal of New Jersey situations, said Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University, is that they ''can have the excitement and voltage of New York with some of the Zeitgeist of Mayberry'' -- in other words, New Jersey is worldly ''like its much bigger neighbor, but with more regular guys, less elegance'' and therefore more appealing.
 ''Maybe the better metaphor for America at large is not Manhattan,'' he added, ''but across the bridge.''
 One episode of the new ''Jersey Shore'' season, which will begin on July 29, will be solely sponsored by a single advertiser, said Sean Moran, executive vice president for sales and integrated marketing for MTV, VH1 and Logo at the MTV Networks unit of Viacom. The advertiser is a movie studio that he said he could not identify at this time.
 Series episodes with single sponsors were commonplace in the 1950s but are rare nowadays. That makes the deal another example of the pop culture heat that New Jersey is generating.
 ''The new O.C. is, of all places, New Jersey,'' said Tim Brooks, the television historian and co-author of ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,'' referring to the Orange County, Calif., locale that previously spawned hit shows like ''Laguna Beach,'' ''The O.C.'' and ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.''
 Mr. Brooks attributed the trend to ''the recent pursuit of real, relatable people'' on television, ''as an antidote to the slick sophisticates of show biz-savvy Los Angeles, Miami and even New York.''
 ''In program testing over the years, I heard many times from viewers a desire to see 'real people like us,' '' he added. ''Unsaid was that those people still needed to be interesting, and New Jerseyites seem to fit that bill.''
 The clamor for realistic characters has been intensified by the toll taken on struggling consumers by the uncertain economy, several executives said.
 ''There's a quality to the people on these shows,'' said Jason Klarman, general manager at the Oxygen Media unit of NBC Universal, which will introduce on the Oxygen cable channel on June 1 an eight-episode series, ''Jersey Couture,'' about the Scali family and its clothing store, Diane & Company, in Freehold, N.J.
 New Jerseyans are perceived as ''unfiltered, out there, bigger-than-life personalities who are living on their own terms,'' Mr. Klarman said. ''Don't we all want to be authentic in who we are and not live by the judgments of others?''
 That belief was echoed by Suzanne Kolb, president for marketing, news and online at the E! and Style Network channels owned by Comcast.
 The reason ''a small state is controlling so many moments on television now,'' said Ms. Kolb, who is offering on Style ''Jerseylicious,'' about the Gatsby hair salon in Green Brook, N.J., is that ''the people are very honest: If there's something good in their life, or something bad in their life, they tell you about it.''
 ''They do not have a moment of hesitation,'' Ms. Kolb said. ''They are confident characters.'' And she is confident that ''Jerseylicious,'' scheduled to conclude on May 9, will be back for a second season.
 Another series, ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey,'' is to return for its second season on Monday. The first-season finale was the first of the four ''Real Housewives'' shows on Bravo to attract more than 3.5 million viewers.
 Among women ages 18 to 49, the appeal of the New Jersey ''Housewives'' is 50 to 60 percent above the average for all cable shows, said Henry Schafer, executive vice president at Marketing Evaluations, the company that compiles the ''Q scores'' for likeability of TV series and celebrities.
 ''Those Jersey women have something over there,'' he added.
 They are not, however, the first New Jersey characters to demonstrate that ineffable something on TV. That honor may go to ''The Sopranos,'' which ran on HBO from 1999 to 2007 and exposed many viewers to, or reminded them of, Jersey cultural touchstones like Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons (the subject of a Broadway musical named -- what else? -- ''Jersey Boys'').
 ''Jersey Boys'' and ''The Sopranos'' touch on, among many plot lines, the role of organized crime in the history of New Jersey, a subject that has led critics to complain about the stereotyping they perceive to be permeating the TV shows about New Jersey. Others decry stereotypes they see in the brash behavior and speech patterns, not to mention the sartorial and tonsorial styles.
 ''Not every show is for everybody,'' said Tony DiSanto, president for programming and development at MTV, whose ''Jersey Shore'' is perhaps the Jersey show most singled out for criticism. He praised the cast members for being willing to ''stand up for their friends and speaking what's on their minds.''
 ''There's a lot of heart to them,'' he added.
 Although viewer complaints led advertisers like American Family Insurance and Domino's Pizza to pull out of ''Jersey Shore,'' the withdrawals ended after the first month, Mr. Moran of MTV said, and a month after the first-season finale, some came back and agreed to advertise in the second season.
 As New Jersey enjoys its big bounce, which state may be next?
 ''I'm not ruling out Nebraska as a future 'Real Housewives' location,'' said Frances Berwick, executive vice president and general manager for the Bravo Media division of NBC Universal.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Friday with the Advertising column, about the growing popularity of New Jersey characters and culture in television shows and advertising, reversed the identifications of two stars of the Style Network show ''Jerseylicious'' and misspelled the given name of one of them in some copies. Olivia Blois Sharpe is at the right; Tracy -- not Tracey -- DiMarco is at the left. The column also misstated the number of episodes in a series, ''Jersey Couture,'' to be shown starting June 1 on the Oxygen cable channel. It is eight, not six.

HEADLINE: Seeking Reforms, Union Members Protest Bank Behavior

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As the Senate began debate on a financial overhaul bill, thousands of union members pressed for higher taxes on the nation's banks and a bigger jobs program in a rally in Lower Manhattan on Thursday. 
 The labor march near Wall Street, joined by religious and community groups as well as the president of the N.A.A.C.P, aimed to change the national discussion on banks so it focused not just on regulatory reform. Many speakers contended that the government should make financial firms pay for the damage they did to the economy.
 ''People in New York and across the country who did nothing wrong and want to work have paid for the misdeeds of the big banks with their jobs, homes and retirement savings,'' said Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O., the rally's main sponsor, is urging Congress and the president to be tougher on the banks. It called for significantly higher taxes on bankers' bonuses and private equity managers, as well as a new tax on short-term financial transactions. 
 The Senate recently began moving forward on a sweeping overhaul of the regulations of the financial industry, though many provisions are already likely to be contentious.
 At a rally alongside City Hall Park, Mr. Trumka shouted, ''Anyone out there think Wall Street ought to pay for the jobs they destroyed?'' The crowd roared yes.
 Police officials estimated the crowd at 4,000 to 7,500 people, less than the 10,000 that the rally's organizers had sought.
 Nonetheless, organizers described the rally as the biggest anti-Wall Street demonstration in decades. The marchers came from more than a dozen unions, with many holding placards saying ''No Bonuses for Big Banks'' and ''Wall Street: Never Again.''
 One of the rally's sponsors, National People's Action, a coalition of community groups, dispatched more than 300 members to take over the lobby of the JPMorgan Chase headquarters at 270 Park Avenue at lunchtime. The protesters denounced the bank for not doing more to help struggling families and those hurt by the subprime mortgage crisis.
 At the afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan, George Goehl, the executive director of National People's Action, chided Congress for not having already enacted far-reaching financial legislation.
 ''Our goal is to force a which-side-are-you-on movement for U.S. senators on the issue of Wall Street reform,'' he said. ''Are they with the American people or are they with the Wall Street banks?''
 Slogans at the rally were ''good jobs now'' and ''hold banks accountable.''
 ''We're 11 million jobs in the hole, and it's time for the financial industry to pay up to create them,'' Mr. Trumka said.

HEADLINE: Higher Oil Prices Raise Profits For Exxon and ConocoPhillips

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Higher oil prices raised quarterly profits for the Exxon Mobil Corporation and ConocoPhillips, but Exxon's earnings were hurt by weak refinery performance, higher-than-expected exploration costs and recently enacted health care legislation. 
 Exxon's earnings fell below Wall Street forecasts, in stark contrast to BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which both exceeded market expectations when they released quarterly figures this week.
 Oil prices averaged nearly $79 a barrel in the first quarter, about $3 more than the previous quarter and sharply higher than the $43 average of the first quarter of 2009.
 That strength offset weak margins from Exxon and Conoco's refinery operations, which have been hurt by slow demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel because of the soft global economy. A steady rebound in many regions, however, is expected to pull up fuel demand later this year.
 ''Our results reflect higher crude oil realizations and stronger chemical margins while the downstream industry margins remained weak,'' Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday.
 Exxon's profit in the quarter rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share. Wall Street analysts had expected Exxon to report a profit of $1.41 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Jason Gammel, oil analyst at Macquarie Research, characterized Exxon's first-quarter profit as a ''pretty big miss,'' and attributed the bulk of the shortfall to Exxon's accrual for the health care legislation.
 A charge the company took against the health care legislation cut earnings by $200 million, or about 4 cents a share.
 The company's oil equivalent production rose 4.5 percent from a year ago, helped by its liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar, it said. But Exxon's downstream arm, which includes its refining and marketing operations, posted profits of $37 million, well off the $1.1 billion it earned a year ago.
 Shares of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., fell 53 cents, to $68.66.
 Conoco's profits rose to $2.1 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $800 million, or 54 cents a share, but oil and gas output in terms of oil equivalent per day during the quarter fell to 1.83 million barrels, from 1.93 million barrels a year earlier. Revenue rose to $45.8 billion, from $31.2 billion. 
 Conoco, which is in the middle of a plan to shore up returns and reduce debt by selling $10 billion in assets, said in its conference call that it expected oil and gas output to be lower for the next several quarters.
 Shares of Conoco, which is based in Houston, rose 55 cents, to $59.10.
 Conoco's chief executive, Jim Mulva, said the company may increase its 2010 spending plan from about $11 billion to $12 billion, with investments in assets like the Eagleford and Bakken Shales that bring higher returns.

HEADLINE: Jobless Data Shows Fewer New Claims

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of workers submitting new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, implying only a gradual labor market improvement even as the economic recovery expands. 
 While the data released Thursday did not change views, analysts were disappointed with how slowly claims were declining.
 Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 448,000, the Labor Department said. That was slightly below market expectations that claims would drop to 445,000.
 ''Some companies are still struggling and believe they can meet any increase in demand with a smaller work force,'' said Paul Dales, who studies the American market for Capital Economics in Toronto. ''The recovery in the labor market is probably going to be more modest than a lot of people are expecting.''
 The Federal Reserve this week said the labor market was improving, but noted that employers remained reluctant to add to payrolls. As expected, the central bank left overnight benchmark lending rates near zero.
 Economists are concerned that claims remain above 400,000, a level they say is historically associated with steady job growth. Analysts expect data next week will show the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in April, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month.
 The four-week moving average of new claims, seen as a more-reliable barometer of labor market trends, rose by 1,500 last week to 462,500, the department said. It was the fourth weekly increase in a row.
 The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell to 4.65 million in the week ended April 17, a touch above market expectations of 4.62 million.

HEADLINE: U.S. Outlines Plan to Curb Violations Of Labor Law

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
In a move that will affect most American corporations, the Labor Department plans to require companies to prepare and adopt compliance plans aimed at ensuring they do not violate wage, job safety and equal employment laws.
 The effort, aimed in part at reducing the incidence of employers not paying overtime and improperly classifying workers as independent contractors, will require them to document many of their decisions and share that information with their workers and the government.
 In announcing the department's intentions on Thursday, Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris said his department wanted to foster a culture of compliance among employers to replace what he described as a ''catch me if you can'' system in which too many companies violated employment laws. 
 Mr. Harris said many specifics of what companies would be required to do had yet to be worked out. The department's proposed rules are still being drafted, and businesses will have a chance to respond before any final rules are issued. The process is likely to take more than a year.
 But business groups attacked the general idea, saying it would impose new burdens on employers without necessarily improving compliance with labor laws.
 Mr. Harris said that while many companies had a culture of compliance, too many others flouted wage and safety laws after weighing the costs of compliance against the benefits of breaking the law and the risks of getting caught.
 ''They are playing a dangerous game of catch me if you can, and they are putting workers' rights, even their lives, at risk,'' Mr. Harris said in an appearance at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington. 
 Department officials say they hope the plan will greatly reduce problems in industries with widespread wage violations, like restaurants and discount retailing, and those with widespread safety violations, like coal mining and construction.
 ''Employers will have to put together a plan that is designed to avoid violations of workplace laws,'' he said. ''In safety and health, they will have to prepare a plan that will avoid safety hazard in the workplace. They will have to implement the plan, and they will have to make sure the plan, as implemented, is effective in avoiding violations for risks and hazards to workers.'' 
 Mr. Harris said the limited number of Labor Department inspectors -- a few thousand -- makes it hard to protect the nation's 140 million workers at nine million workplaces. ''We cannot abide an economic calculus that exploits the fact that the Labor Department cannot and should not look over every shoulder,'' he said.
 Giving one example, Mr. Harris said companies that classify workers as independent contractors -- often to avoid paying Social Security taxes and circumvent wage laws -- would have to prepare a written explanation of why those workers should be considered contractors rather than employees. Companies would then have to give these workers the explanation. 
 Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the employer group wanted to see more details of the proposal. 
 ''But it appears to open the door to a Department of Labor compliance officer second-guessing employers on a wide range of issues and micromanaging how employers run the workplace,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''A lot of time will be wasted figuring out whether or not compliance plans will pass the Labor Department's judgment rather than actually addressing the requirements of the law.''
 Cynthia L. Estlund, an employment law professor at New York University, praised the department's plan because ''it is important to activate internal corporate efforts for compliance.''
 But Professor Estlund said violations would no doubt continue. ''There are no magic bullets,'' she said. ''It's still possible to engage in what some people call cosmetic compliance.''

HEADLINE: United-Continental Deal Is Said to Be Near

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
United Airlines and Continental Airlines are in advanced discussions on a merger after making progress on how to price the transaction, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.
 A deal could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said, though they cautioned that talks were continuing and could fall apart. The boards of the two airlines will meet separately on Friday, with Continental's directors scheduled to meet again on Sunday. 
 If a deal is worked out, a combined Continental and United would be the nation's largest airline by revenue, ahead of Delta Air Lines, which recently completed a merger with Northwest Airlines.
 Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for United, and Julie King, a spokeswoman for Continental, declined to comment. 
 Most of the details have been worked out, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are at a delicate stage. The new company would be called United and based in Chicago. 
 Continental's chairman, Jeffery A. Smisek, would be the new chief executive, while United's chairman, Glenn F. Tilton, would be the new nonexecutive chairman for two years. After that, Mr. Smisek would become executive chairman.
 The negotiations reached an impasse last weekend when the two companies disagreed over the stock prices used to determine the exchange ratio in a stock-for-stock deal. That would affect the price United would pay, these people said.
 The issue last week was that Continental wanted to use the stock prices of the two companies before news of separate merger talks between United and US Airways emerged three weeks ago. But United wanted to use more recent stock prices because its stock had risen more than Continental's. That would have allowed it to issue fewer shares to buy Continental. 
 But in the last few days, Continental's shares have moved higher, largely resolving the matter in its favor. 
 United and Continental revived merger talks a few weeks ago. In 2008, the companies were hours away from a deal, but Continental walked away because of fears about United's financial health in light of high oil prices and a weakening economy. 
 United's fortunes have since improved. On Tuesday, the company reported that its losses narrowed in the first quarter while revenue jumped 15 percent. The company also said that it had $4.5 billion in cash. 
 Last week, US Airways said it had broken off separate talks to merge with United.

HEADLINE: Financial Shares Lead the Markets Higher

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher on Thursday as investors sifted through corporate earnings that suggested the economy was recovering. 
 While Wall Street focused on financial stocks and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe faded into the background, market attention shifted to domestic issues like new first-time jobless claims and strong corporate earnings reports.
 ''Today seems to be a day where we are able to focus on what should be the main driver in buying stocks, and that is corporate America's ability to earn,'' said Art Hogan, the chief market analyst in New York at Jefferies & Company. 
 ''We certainly had a week where we remembered what volatility looked like,'' he added.
 He was referring to the impact of Standard & Poor's downgrade in ratings of Greece and Portugal on Tuesday, when Wall Street reacted with what he called a ''precipitous'' sell-off. A day later, Spain's rating was also downgraded.
 Efforts were moving ahead on the terms of a financial aid package for Greece as European leaders worked to stave off any contagion.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 11,167.32, up 122.05, or 1.10 percent; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 15.42 points, or 1.29 percent, at 1,206.78; and the Nasdaq composite index was up 40.19 points, or 1.63 percent, at 2,511.92.
 Financial shares were heavily traded.
 ''From a macro standpoint, I think that there is the belief that we will have some type of resolution over Greece,'' said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of United States large-cap equity trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. ''They are the most tied in to issues related to sovereign debt. I think that is why we saw that group lead the pack today.'' 
 ''Outside of that we still have earnings season,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick added, ''and the tone continues to be very, very strong.''
 Citigroup shares were up 2 percent at $4.56, E*Trade Financial fell 5 percent at $1.74 and Bank of America shares rose about 3 percent, to $18.30.
 The insurance services provider Assurant reported that net operating income in the first quarter rose 12 percent, to $154.3 million, or $1.32 a share, up from $1.17 a share in the first quarter of 2009. Its stock rose 8 percent, to $36.36 a share.
 Well into the corporate earnings season, the results suggested an economic recovery was in the works. And the Labor Department's report on initial jobless claims showed a decline in newly unemployed workers seeking jobless benefits, falling in the latest week to 448,000 from 459,000. 
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast 445,000 claims.
 Industrials, health care and consumer discretionary shares also accounted for high volumes. ''We are seeing a lot of indications that the consumer is back spending,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said. ''I think that trend probably will continue.'' 
 In the energy sector, FMC Technologies, which provides technology and equipment for the oil industry, was up 8.7 percent, to $73.32 a share, after reporting Wednesday that operating profit had reached $181 million in the first quarter and raising its forecast for full-year profit per share.
 Exxon Mobil said that earnings in the first quarter were $6.3 billion, up from $4.55 billion in the comparable period in 2009. But its profit of $1.33 a share was below analysts' expectations of $1.41. Its stock was down 53 cents, at $68.66 a share.
 ''On first glance it is a nice increase, but you have to look closer,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S.& P. Indices. ''Based on the estimates, it appears to have missed on both operating and sales.''
 The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibbalso reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Its stock rose $1.03, or 4.2 percent, to $25.37 a share.
 Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 99 5/32, and the yield fell to 3.73 percent from 3.76 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Europe's Debt Woes Start to Complicate China's Money Moves

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Spreading problems in Europe's sovereign debt markets pose potential challenges for China, which has been stepping up its investments in European government bonds and relies on Europe as its biggest export market.
 The turmoil that Europe's difficulty has caused in financial markets already appears to have caused tens of billions of dollars in paper losses in China's foreign exchange reserves. And the problems may complicate the timing of an expected Chinese move to break the informal peg of the Chinese renminbi to the dollar, Chinese and Western economists and bankers said on Thursday.
 Yet, officials in Beijing have almost completely avoided public comments and are showing little enthusiasm for playing a direct role in the complex diplomatic and financial negotiations as Greece, Portugal and Spain struggle to respond to downgrades in their sovereign debt ratings. China's role, if any, would probably come via its participation as a big contributor to the International Monetary Fund, economists and bankers say. 
 Jiang Yu, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, gave the first official Chinese response during a routine press briefing in Beijing on Thursday afternoon, and it implied China's preference for watching from the sidelines. 
 ''We hope the issue can be resolved satisfactorily and that the affected countries would soon emerge from their difficulties and achieve economic recovery,'' she said.
 With $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, China has considerably more cash for any financial rescue than even the I.M.F. But the central bank, the People's Bank of China, which oversees the foreign reserves, has been extremely wary of deploying that money directly as highly visible investments in troubled economies. It mainly refrained from doing so even during the depths of the global financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009.
 The Chinese government has preferred to work through the I.M.F., which China has tended to regard as a better credit risk and less politically sensitive than many individual countries.
 China's share of cash committed to I.M.F. shares, known as its quota, has nearly doubled since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, to $12.2 billion. The I.M.F. board has approved another increase soon, which would raise China's stake in the multilateral organization to 4 percent from 3.72 percent.
 China is already the fourth-largest holder of quota rights at the I.M.F., after the member countries of the European Union, with 32.4 percent; the United States, with 17.1 percent; and an Asian bloc informally led by Japan, with 11.5 percent.
 China agreed last September to buy up to $50 billion worth of bonds issued by the I.M.F. to help the multilateral agency strengthen its lending capacity, in the first such deal done by the I.M.F.
 In recognition of China's rising influence, Zhu Min, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, was named on Feb. 24 to become the special adviser to the I.M.F.'s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and will start work on May 3.
 But China has been wary of using its influence publicly, in keeping with its overriding foreign policy principle of seeking a ''peaceful rise'' in China's role in the world.
 ''China is unlikely to take a leading role in defining the terms of the I.M.F.'s assistance program to Greece,'' said Eswar Prasad, a former head of the China desk at the I.M.F. ''It is in China's interest to see the situation in Europe stabilized, as it is their most important export market. And they are likely to get behind whatever amount of assistance and types of conditions the I.M.F. thinks are most likely to achieve that objective.''
 China closely guards any details on the currency allocation of its reserves. Western bankers estimate that the Chinese reserves are about 70 percent invested in dollar-denominated assets, mainly Treasury notes and bonds, and 20 to 25 percent invested in euro-denominated assets, with the rest in British pounds, Japanese yen and other currencies.
 Chinese officials have been looking for safe ways to invest the country's vast savings overseas, and euro-denominated government bonds had appeared until very recently as an attractive alternative to Treasuries, said Yu Yongding, a former member of the monetary policy committee of the People's Bank of China.
 ''China needs deep, liquid, safe financial markets,'' said Mr. Yu, who is the director of world economics and politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an advisory body to China's cabinet.
 Premier Wen Jiabao has even voiced public concern in the last year about rising American budget deficits and the ability of the United States to protect the buying power of Chinese money invested in Treasuries. 
 The People's Bank of China has financed its country's huge foreign reserves by borrowing money domestically, mainly from the state-owned banking system; the prospect of losses on those reserves has been a sensitive subject that is frequently censored when it pops up in Chinese Internet discussion forums.
 But any losses on European investments are likely to be modest, relative to China's overall reserves, barring an actual ripple of defaults across Europe.
 The euro has lost a tenth of its value against the dollar in recent weeks. But a tenth of the 20 to 25 percent of the portfolio invested in euros still works out to a loss of only 2 to 2.5 percent on the entire portfolio. 
 Because the Chinese currency, the renminbi, is informally pegged at about 6.83 to the dollar, the euro's slump against the dollar has meant a slump against the renminbi as well. This is making Chinese goods more expensive in Europe.
 ''The slump in the euro has really affected our business, since Europe accounts for 80 percent of our business and we receive euros from our clients,'' said Wu Xiaozhan, the sales manager of Yiwu Disa Jewelry and Belt Company, a producer of beads and other costume jewelry components in Yiwu City, in east-central China. ''These are all long-standing clients, so for the time being we have not considered raising prices or switching to invoicing in another currency. We will just bear the loss for now.''
 Chinese leaders have been preparing to break the renminbi's link to the dollar, because preserving that link has limited their ability to control speculative bubbles in the Chinese economy. It has also caused them to accumulate enormous foreign exchange reserves through currency market intervention.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway's Derivatives Exposure

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Warren Buffett says he loves simple things like ice cream. But some 40,000 shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Nebraska this weekend may hear a lot about complex derivatives.
 For someone who once called these instruments ''financial weapons of mass destruction,'' the Oracle of Omaha has accumulated quite a portfolio. He has sold ''put'' options on various equity indexes and some credit default protection too, with an exposure of up to $63 billion. Realistically, the market value of Berkshire's derivatives liabilities stood at around $9 billion at the end of last year.
 But when Berkshire first issued the contracts, it banked premiums nearly as large as those liabilities in 2009. It is churning out $8 billion in annual free cash flow, according to Barclays Capital. 
 And Berkshire's equity is measured in multiples of its debt, not the other way around. As Mr. Buffett may indicate on Saturday, this makes the derivatives risk look modest, unlike the disastrously oversize exposures built up by highly leveraged financial institutions like the American International Group.
 Mr. Buffett may well also break his recent silence on Goldman Sachs. The billionaire sank $5 billion into the investment bank during the financial crisis. But now, a complex derivatives-based deal has led to fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman disputes the accusations, but its reputation is taking a battering; the drop in the company's share price has so far cost Berkshire about $1 billion.
 Shareholders this weekend may ask Mr. Buffett about his thoughts on financial regulatory reform. As far as derivatives go, there's a risk of Berkshire's being forced to post billions in collateral on existing trades -- something that they were devised to avoid and that Mr. Buffett's crew has lobbied against. New rules could also crimp Goldman's activities.
 Mr. Buffett may feel that new curbs are inevitable. In his most recent annual letter, he said those running financial institutions needed to take more responsibility.
 If Berkshire takes too much risk on derivatives or otherwise, and runs into trouble, he said, ''it will be my fault.'' Wall Street's leading lights still tend to argue they never saw the crisis coming. Mr. Buffett may well have pungent views about that, too.
 Easing of Oil Losses 
 The doubling of crude prices since last year isn't the only thing giving a healthy glow to earnings of big oil companies. The refining sector, which splattered ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips in red ink last year, is finally improving. Exploration and production profits are able to take center stage.
 At the end of 2009, refining was a nightmare. Crack spreads -- the margin refiners are paid to turn crude into usable fuel -- had slimmed to anorexic proportions. The pain was more intense for firms that had invested heavily in refiners able to transform even stubborn lower-quality crude, which can typically be snapped up at a large discount.
 As producers of heavier crude in OPEC nations and Canada scaled back production, their advantage dwindled and has all but disappeared.
 With global demand reviving, refiners worldwide are slowly being freed from this headlock. The greatest sigh of relief is coming from ConocoPhillips, the most exposed of the large American oil companies. Refining losses of $215 million slashed more than 10 percent off profit in the final quarter of 2009. Coming close to breakeven on refining in the fourth quarter seems a merciful release. With this burden removed and its $10 billion asset sale program off to a roaring start, the company looks positively hardy.
 Exxon Mobil, where refining stripped $189 million from fourth-quarter profit, actually turned a modest profit of $37 million. The company's refining business -- with its hefty exposure to the more robust Chinese market -- looks better placed still. It was to non-American cracking that Exxon owed its return to refining profitability.
 Refining won't be easy for a while. Much of the new demand from gas-guzzling Americans is likely to be met by ethanol, which will benefit from government edicts. But stabilizing the refining business will at least allow the big oil firms to capture more of the benefits from high crude prices. For those like Exxon with heavy Asian exposure, refining may even start to be a business in which investors take pride. RICHARD BEALES and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

HEADLINE: Viacom's Profit Up 37% as Ads Return

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
An increase in advertising revenue and higher fees from cable affiliates helped Viacom report a 37 percent gain in first-quarter profit on Thursday.
 The earnings report from Viacom, the owner of MTV, VH1 and other cable channels, reinforced the feeling that media conglomerates were starting to recover from a battered economy. 
 ''The economic environment is growing stronger each day, and absent any major disruption, that progress should continue at a steady pace,'' Philippe Dauman, Viacom's president and chief executive, told analysts on a conference call. This month, Mr. Dauman's contract was extended through 2016.
 Viacom, which is controlled by Sumner M. Redstone, had a 4 percent decline in revenue, to $2.79 billion, from the comparable quarter last year as a result of weakness in its film unit, Paramount Pictures. But it more than compensated through cost-cutting, and posted a profit of $243 million, up 37 percent from $177 million in the quarter last year.
 Its earnings were 40 cents a share, compared with 29 cents a year earlier. On the call with analysts, Viacom signaled that it was assessing how to return cash to shareholders.
 After a bruising season of declines, Viacom said that ad revenue in the United States rose 1 percent in the first quarter, and that worldwide ad revenue rose 3 percent. Mr. Dauman said that ''marketing budgets are beginning to loosen up'' as television channels approached the upfront ad selling season.
 But the more significant gains for the company's channels came from higher payments from cable and satellite companies, up 9 percent worldwide. David C. Joyce, an analyst for Miller Tabak & Company, said that the fee growth ''was a little better than expected.''
 Most of that growth came from fee increases, while about 25 percent came from new subscribers. The fees are normally set years in advance, and Mr. Dauman said that the company expected ''high single digits, low double-digit rate of growth'' for that revenue well into the future.
 On the film side, Viacom showed an 18 percent decrease in revenue, which it attributed in part to a decline in DVD sales. 
 Viacom's strategy at Paramount, as Mr. Dauman put it in an interview, is to ''make fewer films but focus on the franchise pictures and the branded pictures.'' In coming months it will distribute ''Iron Man 2,'' ''Shrek Forever After'' and an M. Night Shyamalan film in 3-D, ''The Last Airbender.'' Mr. Joyce said ''the next quarter should be strong for new releases.''
 Viacom's revenue comes primarily from its portfolio of narrowly focused channels like Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central. The company's most provocative program last winter, ''Jersey Shore,'' helped MTV gain audience share in the quarter.
 ''MTV had some softness in ratings until the end of 2009. There was a comprehensive rebooting of the programming lineup, and we had a number of shows that worked,'' Mr. Dauman said, citing ''Jersey Shore'' as well as the documentary series ''16 and Pregnant'' and the competition show ''America's Best Dance Crew.''

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING ASIA: Sarkozy Presses China on Iran

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- President Nicolas Sarkozy of France told President Hu Jintao of China that nations would have to impose new sanctions on Iran if it refuses to curb its nuclear program, official Chinese news organizations reported on Thursday. 
 Mr. Sarkozy's efforts increased the pressure from a vigorous push by President Obama to get China and Russia to support a new round of sanctions.
 ''China hopes to use dialogue,'' Mr. Sarkozy told Mr. Hu Wednesday during a visit to Beijing, according to China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. ''France completely understands China, and we are willing to discuss this problem together at an appropriate time.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy added, ''If dialogue does not work, then we can only use sanctions.''
 France has joined with the United States and Britain in pushing for a new package of economic sanctions from the United Nations. Those countries accuse Iran of using its nuclear program to try to develop weapons. Iran has said it is interested in pursuing nuclear power, not arms.
 Mr. Sarkozy's trip to Beijing comes at a critical juncture in the campaign Mr. Obama is leading to win support for new sanctions. Earlier this month, Mr. Hu told Mr. Obama in Washington that China would take part in negotiations over a sanctions package, but made no specific commitments to support the kind of sanctions that the United States favors. 
 China, which imports nearly 12 percent of its oil from Iran, has long said that dialogue is the proper way to deal with that country in part because it is concerned that Iran would cut off oil shipments to China if Beijing were to support sanctions.
 Iran's nuclear ambitions were a priority in the talks between Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hu, but Mr. Hu did not comment publicly on the issue, China Daily reported.
 The two leaders also spoke about global monetary reform, but Mr. Sarkozy did not press Mr. Hu to revalue the Chinese currency, the renminbi, according to the English-language edition of Global Times, another official newspaper. The Obama administration has said China is keeping the renminbi far below its actual value to give Chinese manufacturers an advantage in the global market. Chinese leaders have given no signals that they intend to revalue the currency.
 ''France's belief is that it is totally unproductive to make accusations against one another,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, according to Global Times. ''It is far more intelligent to prepare the necessary evolution of the monetary system in the 21st century.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy was making his first visit to China since relations between France and China soured in 2008 over the issue of Tibet. The Chinese government and many Chinese citizens became incensed at France when pro-Tibet protesters marred the Olympic torch relay as the torch passed through Paris. Mr. Sarkozy agreed later to meet with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader whom China labels a separatist and whom it blames for a widespread Tibetan uprising that took place in March 2008. 
 Mr. Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, stopped in the city of Xi'an on Wednesday to see the terra cotta warriors before arriving in Beijing. Mr. Sarkozy was the first head of state to arrive in China to attend the opening of the World Expo on Friday in Shanghai.

HEADLINE: Florida's Senate Spectacle

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Gov. Charlie Crist announced Thursday that he will run independently for the United States Senate, giving Florida a race that will once again make the state a gawk-worthy stage of American politics, where the country's desires, fears and conflicts play out.
 Mr. Crist told supporters in his home town of St. Petersburg that his decision to leave the Republican party is ''the right thing for America'' and ''the right thing for Florida.''
 ''My decision to run for the U.S. Senate as a candidate without party affiliation says more about our nation and our state than it says about me,'' Mr. Crist said. ''Unfortunately our political system is broken. I think we need a new tone in Washington.''
 In a six-minute speech in which he was accompanied by his family and about 250 supporters, Mr. Crist acknowledged that he was in ''unchartered territory,'' but even the most experienced strategists here are uncertain about what to expect. Perhaps never before, they say, has there been a three-way Senate race in a major swing state, with each candidate well financed, and so much at stake in terms of the balance of power in Washington. 
 The usual campaign script -- with candidates playing to their base in the primary, then moving to the middle in the general election -- aren't relevant anymore. The winner in November will might need as little as 34 percent of the vote, and with only 22 percent of the Florida electorate registered as neither Democrats nor Republicans, the most vital question of the race will be: How frustrated are voters with their own party, and how many will stay loyal?
 ''Both parties have to go out and secure their base to win,'' said Steve Schale, state director for the Obama campaign in 2008. ''That comes with perils, though -- it is exactly what Charlie Crist wants them to do.'' All three candidates portray themselves as outsiders, but each is a career politician. It is still not clear which issues will dominate the campaign (Immigration? Health care? Jobs?). President Obama's popularity is also likely to play a significant role.
 But, according to advisors to the campaigns and outside political experts, this will not be a race of just messaging. Money, campaign structure, national party input, and the wild card of unexpected mistakes all matter, even more than usual in a race of such magnitude, and each candidate has advantages and challenges to overcome. Here is how they break down at this point:
 Kendrick Meek, Democrat
 Biggest Advantage: 
 No one would seem to benefit more from a Crist run as an independent than Kendrick Meek, for one simple reason: the numbers are on his side. There are at least 650,000 more registered Democrats in Florida than Republicans, and assuming Mr. Meek wins the primary and registration continues along its expected path, that lead would amount to about two percentage points in November. If he does better with Democratic voters than either Mr. Crist or Mr. Rubio do with Republicans -- and Mr. Crist does not win nearly every independent vote -- Mr. Meek becomes Florida's next senator.
 ''If we had told anyone we are looking seriously at Florida this time last year, they would have said, 'what's wrong with you?' '' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''And look at how the dynamics of that race has changed.''
 Biggest Challenge: 
 Name recognition; Though he is a congressman, Mr. Meek remains relatively unknown outside his Miami district. ''Meek has been in the race for 17 months, collected 120,000 petitions and still has roughly the same name ID as he had when he started,'' Mr. Schale said. He has about $3.7 million in his campaign coffers and will need much more to make himself a well-known brand. ''There is a reason why very few candidates win one of the principal statewide offices on their first run,'' Mr. Schale said. ''He will need to spend a lot to introduce himself.''
 Marco Rubio, Republican
 Biggest Advantage: 
 Mr. Rubio's rise from long-shot to front-runner came quickly, and he enters the race with the energetic support of Tea Party activists and the G.O.P. establishment. Republicans in Washington and Tallahassee are gunning for Mr. Crist after years of frustration with what they see as his selfish, poll-following approach -- and Mr. Rubio's campaign advisors believe that independents will either join their cause or stay away. ''Current turn-out intensity among G.O.P. voters in Florida is far higher than either Democrat or independent voters, meaning independents could make up an even smaller percentage of the actual vote on Election Day,'' two Rubio advisors wrote in a memo on Wednesday. ''Secondly, it is a mistake to assume that independent voters are politically moderate. In fact, survey after survey this year has found that voter anger about Washington spending and the growth of government is every bit as high among independent voters as it is among Republicans.''
 Biggest Challenge: 
 The Tea Party is not enough: Mr. Rubio has said he would not change his fiery, fiscally conservative message for the general election, but the activist wing of the Republican Party is not enough to get him to victory. There are signs that he has already moderated his approach -- this week he criticized the new Arizona immigration law. If he goes too far to the middle, he angers his most ardent fans. If he does not go far enough, he may lose the swing voters in places like the Route I-4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando, where recent Florida elections have been won.
 Charlie Crist, No Party Affiliation
 Biggest Advantage: 
 Everyone knows Mr. Crist. He has served for more than a decade in public office, and his approval ratings are higher than those of some other governors in states suffering greatly from the recession. His everyman appeal (complete with flowered shirts, opposition to rate hikes from utilities and insurance companies, and ''I feel your pain'' expressions) now combines with his ability to say he is running against partisan extremism. And with his veto of a controversial education bill tying teacher pay to student performance, he now has a high-profile example that is already paying dividends.
 Several teachers joined him on stage with him for his announcement. ''We are a very loyal bunch of people,'' said Andy Ford, president of Florida's largest teachers union. ''A lot of people are thinking we owe him this because he stood up for us.''
 Biggest Challenge: 
 Money and infrastructure: When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman ran and won as an independent in Connecticut four years ago, he had a national fund-raising base among the Jewish community, and a trusted campaign staff. Mr. Crist, has about $7.6 million on hand but by bolting the Republican Party he loses growth potential. ''It takes $20 million to be competitive and he is going to have huge defections from his fundraiser base,'' said Randy Nielsen, a Republican consultant in West Palm Beach. ''The turnstiles will be busier than a New York subway at 5 o'clock.'' This could matter greatly down the stretch. Mr. Lieberman's campaign, for example, focused heavily on simple logistics -- recruiting poll workers and running utilitarian advertisements pointing out where he could be found on the ballot. Mr. Crist, in a state filled with older voters, may need precious dollars to do the same.
 Oh, and one more thing -- do not forget the wild cards
 What will happen with the investigation of Mr. Rubio's use of Republican Party credit cards for personal expenses? With the I.R.S. now examining tax returns, more scrutiny can be expected.
 The Obama factor: The president's approval rating in Florida inched up after health care legislation passed. How popular will the president be in November and how much will he help or hurt Mr. Meek's candidacy.
 The economy has been the nucleus of debate in this race, with Mr. Rubio blasting Mr. Crist for supporting the stimulus in a fight over how to get things going again. What happens if the economy improves? What happens if it declines?
 Finally, there is the nastiness factor. In a race this tight, and this important, nearly everything -- personal attacks, negative ads and rumors -- will be used to take down opponents. Which will work and which will backfire?
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Watching and Waiting, the U.S. Defers to Europe on a Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 THE United States is the largest shareholder in the International Monetary Fund and has played a forceful, interventionist role in financial crises since the early 1990s, in countries like Mexico, South Korea, Russia and Argentina.
 But as Europe gropes for a solution to a debt crisis that threatens to spread from Greece to Portugal and Spain, American officials have been resolutely reticent. 
 ''There's a sense in the Obama administration that it's Europe's responsibility to straighten out problems in the euro zone,'' said Randall W. Stone, a political scientist at the University of Rochester and an authority on the I.M.F. ''I suspect that any kind of overt interference wouldn't be appreciated very much.'' 
 American involvement has so far been behind the scenes. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner discussed the crisis last Friday with other finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations, and again on Sunday with the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, who was here for the I.M.F. spring meetings. President Obama spoke with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, by phone on Wednesday.
 But in public, American officials have said little beyond bland statements of support for the I.M.F. and the European Union. 
 ''This is clearly a European issue, and we think that it's important that the European leaders and the European structures be centrally involved in the management of the problem and the resolution of the problem,'' said an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the political delicacy of the matter. ''However, it is also clear that the I.M.F. is now a central part of the solution.''
 The official added, ''We're following these things very closely, thinking through different alternatives of what can be done and what should be done with our counterparts in Greece and the E.U.'' 
 Karin Lissakers, who represented the United States on the I.M.F. board from 1993 to 2001, said, ''It's an interesting question whether the U.S. needs to take a more active role now that there appears to be substantial contagion and spillover to other European countries, with implications for the financial markets.'' 
 Mr. Stone said the silence was not just substantive, but strategic as well. 
 Jittery bond dealers have so much leverage over the situation right now that any perception of United States pressure on the I.M.F. could throw the already complicated situation into an unpredictable tailspin, he said. 
 ''It's very much up in the air whether the current package can stem the run on the Greek bond market,'' Mr. Stone said. ''From a psychological point of view, the Europeans want to convince the market that adequate steps have been taken so that investors can come back in. The most supportive the administration can be for the I.M.F. right now is to be quiet.''
 The Americans have not been so gun-shy before, particularly with respect to financial crises in the Western Hemisphere, like those in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in the 1990s. 
 In those cases, American financial interests were more at stake than they are now. ''The cost of Greek restructuring would be much smaller for American institutions than for French and German ones,'' Mr. Stone said.
 Daniel D. Heath, who represented the United States as an alternate director on the I.M.F. board under President George W. Bush, said that European sensibilities were a factor.
 ''The I.M.F. has an effective pitch in that the rescue is being done by Europeans at the I.M.F.,'' Mr. Heath said. ''It's a family affair. They stress: 'You're not coming to Washington for a bailout. You're coming to your own people.' '' 
 Mr. Heath said of the debt crisis: ''The U.S. would like to have this contained, clearly. But it's delicate. If the U.S. is prominent, it probably worsens the resolution, doesn't it? So the best course is to keep a low profile.'' 
 Nancy P. Jacklin, who represented the United States on the I.M.F. board from 2002 to 2006, said its goals were closely aligned with Europe's. ''Their interest is very much in not seeing the European recovery tank, not having contagion, and not having a general loss of confidence that hits all of the markets,'' she said.
 That view was shared by Charles H. Dallara, the American director on the I.M.F. board from 1984 to 1989, who now manages the Institute of International Finance, a coalition of financial institutions. 
 ''I feel this is rightfully a European-led exercise in terms of its strategy,'' he said. ''But obviously as the situation has deteriorated, and as the I.M.F. has been, correctly in my view, pulled into this, the U.S. interests have gone up because what's at stake here is not just Greece, but the euro zone and more broadly the global economic recovery.''
 Even within the I.M.F., Americans have taken a back seat. The fund's forceful managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, is a French politician who was finance minister and is a rival of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. 
 As he negotiated the terms of an aid package with restive German lawmakers in Berlin this week, his top deputy, John Lipsky, an American economist, stayed in Washington. (Mr. Strauss-Kahn was accompanied in Europe by Caroline Atkinson, the fund's director of external affairs, who is an American citizen and a former Treasury official, but who grew up in Britain.)
 Mr. Stone, the political scientist, said the United States might yet use its clout to intervene, and was merely biding its time. 
 ''The U.S. is using its credibility here by being quiet,'' he said. ''We may not have gotten to the point yet where the arm-wrestling has started between the G-7 finance ministers. That's the level at which these things are decided.''

HEADLINE: Obama Says Liberal Courts May Have Overreached

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a seeming rejection of liberal orthodoxy, President Obama has spoken disparagingly about liberal victories before the Supreme Court in the 1960s and 1970s -- suggesting that justices made the ''error'' of overstepping their bounds and trampling on the role of elected officials.
 Mr. Obama made his remarks Wednesday night against a backdrop of recent Supreme Court rulings in which conservative justices have struck down laws favored by liberals, most notably a January ruling that nullified restrictions on corporate spending to influence elections. 
 ''It used to be that the notion of an activist judge was somebody who ignored the will of Congress, ignored democratic processes, and tried to impose judicial solutions on problems instead of letting the process work itself through politically,'' Mr. Obama said.
 ''And in the '60s and '70s, the feeling was -- is that liberals were guilty of that kind of approach. What you're now seeing, I think, is a conservative jurisprudence that oftentimes makes the same error.''
 He added, ''The concept of judicial restraint cuts both ways.''
 Mr. Obama's comments, which came as he prepares to make a Supreme Court nomination, amounted to the most sympathetic statement by a sitting Democratic president about the conservative view that the Warren and Burger courts -- which expanded criminal defendant rights, required busing to desegregate schools and declared a right to abortion -- were dominated by ''liberal judicial activists'' whose rulings were dubious. 
 Still, Mr. Obama, who formerly taught constitutional law, did not cite any specific decisions. He has long been a supporter of abortion rights, and repeatedly defended the court's interventionist stance during the civil rights movement because minorities were cut out of the political process, even while saying that such a role would be inappropriate today.
 Mr. Obama made his remarks in an impromptu conversation with reporters on a flight to Washington from the Midwest. They were in response to a question about whether concerns about ''conservative judicial activism'' would play a role in the court nomination.
 Mr. Obama has criticized recent conservative Supreme Court rulings before -- including the campaign-finance ruling, Citizens United, in his State of the Union address last January. But his remarks went notably further by drawing an equivalence to rulings a generation ago that have been widely celebrated by liberals as historic achievements.
 That troubled some liberals, including Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. He agreed with Mr. Obama's definition of ''judicial activism,'' but said he had ''a concern about his effort to establish a moral equivalency between the Warren court and the Roberts court.''
 And the president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, Nan Aron, argued that the Warren and Burger courts had helped make progress on economic and social fronts for people who lacked political power, while the Roberts court is ''tilted in favor of those who already have power and influence.''
 By pegging his critique to the 1960s and 1970s, Mr. Obama stayed away from the most famous liberal Supreme Court ruling, the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision striking down school segregation. Still, his statement seemed to call into question subsequent liberal legal victories.
 Such rulings gave indigent criminal suspects a right to free lawyers, required police to inform them of their rights, and expanded the kinds of evidence that prosecutors could not use. Aside from decisions on abortion and school busing, rulings required electoral districts to contain equal populations, suspended the death penalty, and banned employment practices that had a disparate impact on different racial groups.
 Several conservatives said they welcomed an acknowledgment by a Democratic president that the courts led by Chief Justices Earl Warren and Warren Burger had sometimes overstepped their role. 
 But they also suggested that his arguments might be a strategic move to de-legitimize lawsuits challenging his domestic policy agenda.
 John McGinnis, a conservative law professor at Northwestern University, said, ''His party is in control, so of course he wants deference'' to legislation enacted by Congress in the current era.
 The White House declined to identify rulings that Mr. Obama believes relied on judicial activism. It also argued that his recent remarks were consistent with his history of separating himself from liberals in the Warren court mold. In his book, ''The Audacity of Hope,'' for example, Mr. Obama suggested that ''in our reliance on the courts to vindicate not only our rights but also our values, progressives had lost too much faith in democracy.'' 
 Indeed, Walter Dellinger, a Clinton administration lawyer, said in a recent interview that Mr. Obama was likely to seek a nominee who would foster a ''culture of restraint'' on the court.
 ''He may be more concerned about avoiding a court that would strike down progressive legislation than he is with achieving a court that will enforce its constitutional views on the other branches,'' Mr. Dellinger said.
 Marge Baker, of the liberal People for the American Way, said liberals were confident they would be able to use the Citizens United ruling to turn conservatives' rhetoric against them.
 ''Republicans are going to talk about 'legislating from the bench,' and Democrats will laugh them out of the hearing room, because it doesn't mean anything after Citizens United,'' she said.
 Still, several conservatives questioned Mr. Obama's premise that ''judicial activism'' means striking down the work of elected branches and ''restraint'' means upholding it. They argued that conservatives are instead talking about judges ruling based on politics rather than law.
 David McIntosh, a co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society, said he suspected that Mr. Obama just meant he wanted the court ''to uphold the health care bill'' without revisiting any of its earlier liberal rulings.
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, was also skeptical. ''We'll see if he means it,'' he said, ''by the type of justice he appoints.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Tweak Bank Bill to Preclude Bailouts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate opened debate on Thursday on a far-reaching financial regulation bill, and Democrats moved quickly to demonstrate that the legislation would not provide any future taxpayer bailouts of failing financial companies -- answering a Republican criticism that the Democrats had dismissed as false. 
 The first amendment proposed to the bill, by Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, was intended to tighten language in the bill regarding how the government would handle any future collapses of financial companies. 
 The bill, sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking Committee, calls for the government to shut down failed banks, and it would create a $50 billion fund, paid for by major financial institutions, to help pay for unwinding failed companies. 
 Some Republicans, including the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had criticized the Democrats' legislation, saying that it would encourage, rather than prevent, taxpayer-financed bailouts of big banks. 
 The Democrats forcefully rejected that charge, saying that the bill was written specifically to prevent government bailouts and that the $50 billion fund would ensure that the financial industry, not taxpayers, would pay to liquidate failed companies. 
 In the negotiations that led Republicans to allow floor debate to get under way, Democrats indicated a willingness to remove the $50 billion fund from the legislation. The Obama administration had also opposed the fund, out of concern that it might actually hamper the government's ability to deal with costly bank failures. 
 In a floor speech, Mrs. Boxer again rejected the Republican criticism, although her amendment suggested that there might have been some reason to question the possibility of future bailouts. 
 ''When I heard my colleagues on the other side say Senator Dodd's bill would ensure taxpayer bailouts, I knew it was false,'' she said. ''It is like saying this glass of water is a cup of coffee. No, this glass of water is a glass of water. It is not coffee.'' 
 Still, Mrs. Boxer said, Why not clear things up? ''I said to Chairman Dodd, I have an idea that we should put together a very simple bill, an amendment to the bill that basically says what we know is true, that all financial companies put into receivership under this title shall be liquidated. No company is going to be kept afloat. All funds expended will be repaid to the taxpayers by the financial sector through assessments or the sale of the assets of the company.'' 
 In a provision titled, ''Liquidation required,'' Mrs. Boxer's amendment states: ''All financial companies put into receivership under this title shall be liquidated. No taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the liquidation of any financial company under this title. All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be recovered from the disposition of assets of such financial company, or shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, through assessments.'' 
 Her amendment also stresses that taxpayers will not pay for shutting down failed companies. ''Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any authority under this title,'' it states. ''All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, through assessments.'' 
 No votes were expected on amendments to the legislation until sometime next week. With the Kentucky Derby taking place in Louisville this weekend, Mr. McConnell, in particular, has reason to want to head home from Washington. 
 Debate on the legislation moved forward after Republicans said on Wednesday that they would no longer block the Democrats from bringing the bill to the floor. 
 The floor fight is expected to last at least two weeks. Republicans control enough votes to filibuster the measure and, if they remain united, could block it from being adopted. 
 As the debate began, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, said that he would work aggressively to force changes to the legislation. 
 ''My goal during consideration of this legislation here will be to reshape this bill,'' he said, ''so that it actually ends bailouts, protects consumers without jeopardizing our small community banks and brings transparency, as Senator Dodd mentioned, to the world of derivatives, without sacrificing economic growth and job creation, which we desperately need in this country.'' 
 Mr. Shelby also said he would work to prevent overregulation that could allow the government to interfere with the functioning of the economy. He said he would work ''to remove dozens of provisions that unnecessarily expand the reach of the federal government into the private affairs of Americans and potentially endanger our civil liberties.'' 
 And Mr. Shelby said he expected Democrats to agree to remove the $50 billion ''bailout fund some people call a honey pot.'' 
 Mr. Dodd, in his opening speech, said the parties would work together to adopt an important law. ''The status quo is unacceptable,'' he said. ''We cannot leave the American people vulnerable to the present construct of our financial regulatory system. The American people have paid too high a price for the failure of our system to stop Wall Street greed.''

HEADLINE: Free Money Left on Table

BYLINE: By ARMAND EMAMDJOMEH

 BODY:
What if residents of California -- a state reeling from unemployment, a sagging economy and a gaping budget hole -- had access to more than $1 billion, but did not use it? What if Alameda County residents had access to $29 million and failed to take it out of the federal treasury? 
 That is exactly what they have been doing, according to a new report, ''Left on the Table,'' by two professors at California State University, Fresno, which was published by the New America Foundation. 
An estimated 800,000 California residents will fail to claim a total of $1.2 billion in 2009 earned-income tax credit refunds, the report says.
 California has the highest rate of unclaimed earned-income tax credits nationally, with nearly a quarter of qualified residents failing to claim the credit when they file their taxes, according to studies by both the Internal Revenue Service and the Government Accountability Office. 
 Antonio Avalos and Sean Alley, the authors of the New America Foundation study, estimate that if all eligible refunds were claimed, residents of Bay Area counties should receive well over $100 million in total.
 ''We wanted to show that the program is not just important for relieving poverty, but that it's also important for local economies,'' said Maria Sotero, a research associate for the Asset Building Program of the New America Foundation.
 As it is, the report estimates that the nearly $456 million in refunds that Bay Area residents do claim and receive creates $481 million in sales for businesses and 2,500 jobs. Statewide, those claims bring in $390 million in state and local taxes. 
 ''We knew for a long time that every county was leaving a significant amount on the table,'' Mr. Avalos said, ''but we didn't know how much.'' 
 ''It's just the $1 billion that we left this year,'' he said. ''When looking at the numbers since 1997, the amount of money California residents have not been claiming is close to $10 billion.''
 The foundation study, Mr. Avalos said, would ''empower those making the effort to raise awareness'' of the tax.
 The credit, which benefits working low-income Americans, took effect in the Nixon administration. A single person must earn less than $15,000 to qualify for a maximum credit of $457; a family of three can get a credit of as much as $5,657. 
 But, Ms. Sotero said, ''even though it's a simple concept, it's a complicated process.'' 
 There are more than 20 qualifications for the credit, she said, including the requirement that a person must file an income tax return, even if he owes no tax, and must be employed. 
 ''A large portion of those that do not claim the E.I.T.C. have no filing requirement,'' said Kelly Batson, regional director of Earn It! Keep It!, an outreach program of the United Way Bay Area. 
 If a person does not file a tax return, he cannot claim the credit, Ms. Batson said. But if a taxpayer failed to claim the credit this year, it can be claimed on next year's return.
 ''If we can let those people know that they can get the E.I.T.C. and not have to pay to get their taxes done, we will have made great strides,'' Ms. Batson said. ''Unfortunately, we don't know what we don't know.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, A Delicate Decision On Rates

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Europe's collective anguish over Greece was interrupted by some good news on Thursday. German unemployment fell more than expected, while earnings surged for some of the country's biggest companies.
 No one is going to complain about signs of robust growth in Europe's largest economy, which has 10 times the economic output of Greece. But the recovery of the northern half of the euro zone as the southern periphery sinks deeper into crisis sets up a quandary for monetary policy makers that could increase the already serious tensions within Europe.
 If growth in Northern Europe continues to gain during the rest of the year, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will eventually face pressure to raise interest rates to contain inflation. 
 But a rate increase could harm Greece as well as Spain, Portugal and other countries with debt problems, raising the high cost of borrowing for governments and business.
 The central bank ''cannot risk inflation in the euro area for the sake of these three countries,'' said Zsolt Darvas, an economist at Breugel, a research organization in Brussels. ''They will have to face higher interest rates, and it will be very difficult for them to sort out their fiscal problems.''
 That view is commonly held in Germany and countries near it. Another view is that relieving the suffering of Southern Europe should trump trying to stamp out future inflation with a heavy hand.
 For the central bank, fortunately, the day of reckoning probably will not come until early next year. With no signs yet that inflation is an imminent danger, most economists do not expect an increase in the benchmark interest rate -- it is now 1 percent -- until March 2011, according to a Reuters poll.
 But Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the central bank, and other members of its governing council face plenty of other tough choices in the weeks and months ahead.
 One risk is that the loss of faith in Greek solvency will spread to Portugal and perhaps Spain, threatening another bank crisis and forcing the central bank to act. 
 The central bank has begun to gradually cut back on the nearly unlimited cash it lent to European banks after interbank lending froze in 2008. But some analysts say they believe the central bank could stop that process or even reverse it.
 The bank ''may have to go back and reopen some of its unconventional measures,'' said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 The central bank could also face pressure if the United States Federal Reserve began raising rates. Higher rates in the United States would encourage investors to move assets into dollars to earn a better return, causing the euro to fall even more.
 A weaker euro would be good for Greece and European exporters in general by making their products less expensive in foreign markets. But the downside is that a weaker euro would increase the cost of oil and other commodities, which are usually priced in dollars. Higher energy costs would feed inflation, adding pressure on the central bank to raise rates.
 For now, that risk seems to have eased after the Fed signaled Wednesday that it was in no hurry to raise rates.
 The downgrading of Greek debt to junk status by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's, and the risk of Moody's and Fitch following suit, presents a more immediate problem for the central bank. Under the central bank's rules, that would make Greek debt ineligible as collateral for central bank loans, creating serious problems for banks in Greece that use their holdings of domestic bonds to borrow cash.
 ''The E.C.B. doesn't want to be the one to push Greece over the edge,'' said Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC. ''If push comes to shove, they would bend the rules.''
 But a shift in policy could also damage the credibility of the central bank, said Mr. Darvas, the economist for Breugel. The central bank has already loosened its collateral requirements to help Greece, despite Mr. Trichet's insistence that the bank would not tailor policy to specific countries.
 The central bank also changed course on whether the International Monetary Fund should play a major role in rescuing Greece. Members of the bank's governing council first said that Europe could deal with its own problems, then pivoted as they were forced to acknowledge that the I.M.F. was indispensable.
 Such missteps notwithstanding, bickering among European Union leaders has underlined the importance of the central bank as the one institution in the euro zone able to move decisively in response to an economic crisis.
 Alessandro Leipold, former acting director of the I.M.F.'s European department, speculated that the central bank could stretch its mandate even further if Europe's politicians were too slow to agree on the terms of a rescue package for Greece.
 For example, the central bank could organize a bridge loan to allow Greece to meet its immediate financing needs and avoid a default, Mr. Leipold said. ''I don't know the technicalities but it should be possible,'' he said. Other analysts said they thought such a move was unlikely.
 Another option, according to analysts at R.B.S., entails the central bank buying government bonds, which the bank has avoided. 
 The central bank ''will defend the region using all the tools at its disposal,'' the R.B.S. analysts said in a note on Monday. As global trade recovers, German exporters like Siemens, the electronics conglomerate, and the software maker SAP have reported strong earnings, helping seasonally adjusted unemployment fall to 7.8 percent, from 8 percent.
 Economists recall that when Germany was struggling in the middle of the decade, the central bank kept interest rates low even though the policy led to overheated economies in Ireland and other countries. ''Then they were setting policy for Germany rather than smaller countries -- where conditions were far too loose,'' Ms. Henry of HSBC said.
 In the coming year, ''Germany will feature more prominently than the periphery,'' she added. ''The E.C.B. has its 2 percent inflation limit, and they will do what it takes to achieve that.''

HEADLINE: Bringing Out the Dead, Wrapped and Ready

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
To expand audiences for cultural attractions in grim economic times, why not bring out a corpse or two, preferably from ancient Egypt?
 ''People who are not necessarily interested in going to museums are all very interested in this,'' said Silvia Cubina, the executive director of the Bass Museum of Art in Miami Beach, which will unveil two mummies in a new Egyptian gallery on Friday. One, swaddled in crisscrossing fabric, had long been in the museum's storerooms, and when a local collector found out that it would go on view, he donated another with its coffin, in the shape of a longhaired youth wearing necklaces.
 Half a dozen institutions this spring are also bringing out the dead, and marketing them with catchy phrases. ''Very Postmortem'' is the title of a display of Irethorrou, a 2,500-year-old priest, at the Legion of Honor museum in San Francisco (on view through Halloween, of course).
 On Wednesday the long-term installation ''The Mummy Chamber'' opens at the Brooklyn Museum, and the Bass Museum has set up a ''mummy hotline'' (786-343-6341) for show information. 
 Curators are enlivening the galleries with scientific discoveries: computer screens display CT scans of the skeletons. Stanford University donated views of the inside of Irethorrou's body to the Legion of Honor. ''You can see that the skull has been emptied of the brain, and one nostril is enlarged, where the brain was pulled out,'' said Renee Dreyfus, the show's curator. When Irethorrou died, at around 40, his bereaved family tucked tiny amulets against his bones. An infection seems to have killed him; the body shows no signs of trauma, or even of hard labor.
 ''Our mummy didn't do a stick of work in his lifetime,'' Ms. Dreyfus said.
 The Brooklyn Museum, which sent four corpses for pro bono scanning to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., discovered that two Egyptians believed to be women were actually men. (One had a confusingly beardless coffin; a few decades ago the other had undergone X-rays that were misleading.)
 A priest named Thothirdes, one of the mistaken-identity cases, was apparently on a tight budget: he had a ''middle-of-the-road mummification,'' since his organs were stuffed back into his body rather than stored in costly stone jars, said Edward Bleiberg, the museum's curator of Egyptian, Classical and Ancient Middle Eastern art.
 Thothirdes's low-quality embalmment is consistent with the unsophisticated hieroglyphs on his coffin, which will be on view alongside his body in ''The Mummy Chamber.'' ''The handwriting is terrible,'' Mr. Bleiberg said.
 Although the shows clearly appeal to some museumgoers' ghoulish curiosity, curators usually stop short of displaying unwrapped bones. The Brooklyn Museum has not brought out its Egyptian skeletons, skulls and detached hands. (Some were gifts from Victorian tourists who picked them up as souvenirs in the Middle East.) ''This isn't the 'Bodies' exhibition,'' Mr. Bleiberg said.
 The wraps will be off, however, in July at the California Science Center in Los Angeles: ''Mummies of the World'' will show about 50 shriveled cadavers, borrowed from 15 museums. Excavated in countries including Peru, Egypt and Hungary, they date back as far as 6,500 years.
 Marcus W. Corwin, the president of American Exhibitions Inc., which is organizing the mummies' national tour, said they would be exhibited ''with great reverence, dignity and respect.'' Curators from the lending museums will travel to oversee installations. The corpses, Mr. Corwin added, ''have been cleaned, conserved, repaired and stabilized.''
 He continued, ''They've been put back to the best condition they can be in.''
 MORE SPACE, MORE STUFF
 Museums announcing growth plans need to gear up for benefactors offering large objects and sweeping collections. The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond and Oakland Museum of California, both opening on Saturday, have incorporated room-size gifts and loans into renovations that cost $58 million (Oakland) and $150 million (Virginia).
 The Oakland Museum has recreated the 1910s studio of the California cabinetmaker Frederick Meyer, with a simulated garret skylight. The California College of the Arts, which he founded, has lent a suite of Meyer's oak furniture with leafy carvings along protomodern rectilinear edges.
 The Virginia Museum has acquired a 19th-century white marble pavilion from Rajasthan, India, which weighs 27 tons, and a castoff from the Museum of the City of New York: an 1880s bedroom with gilt-encrusted ebonized furniture. (The room, salvaged from a Midtown Manhattan townhouse, has Southern roots: it originally belonged to a Richmond railroad heiress.) In September the Virginia Museum will fill two galleries with gifts of English silver from the New York collector Rita Gans, including 1810s saltcellars shaped like sea nymphs and Victorian fluted wine coolers.
 The Virginia Museum's addition of about 165,000 square feet attracted the new donations. ''Who else could just plop a period room into their building?'' said Sylvia Yount, a curator of American art at the museum.
 But the halls are already packed again. The Indian pavilion just fit into an upstairs gallery, and the Manhattan bedroom, Ms. Yount said, ''cleared the ceiling here by a few inches.''
 AMERICANA SALE
 Leigh Keno, the Americana dealer turned auctioneer, will hold his first sale this weekend. He has shipped about 740 lots from his Upper East Side office and Queens warehouse to the Stamford Marriott Hotel in Connecticut. During the last year he made a few of his classic ''Antiques Roadshow''-style discoveries, surprising consigners with attributions to famous makers and hefty suggested values.
 His top lot, a 1750s mahogany dresser with a wavy front (estimated at $200,000 to $600,000), descended in the family of James Beekman, a New York dry goods merchant. Melissa Johnson, Mr. Keno's director of consignments, found Beekman's 1750s ledger at the New-York Historical Society, recording a payment of $:16 for a dresser from Thomas Brookman, a New York cabinetmaker. Brookman is known for fashionable rococo designs; a handful survive and strongly resemble the Keno lot.
 ''Can you imagine how racy this totally London-rococo-inspired piece would have looked in New York at the time?'' Mr. Keno said at his gallery, pointing out acanthus foliage carved on the dresser feet. When he spotted the dresser in a dimly lighted corner of a suburban New York home, the consigner tentatively asked, ''Is this something?''
 Mr. Keno said his response was: ''This is your lottery ticket.''
 The weekend's sale also includes head-scratchers for an Americana specialist, like Chinese wood carvings ($300 to $500 for a set) and 1850s prints of Dutch Java ($1,000 to $2,000). The common thread is market freshness: ''I made it a point not to take shopworn goods,'' he said.

(Charles Isherwood)20100429
 'A BEHANDING IN SPOKANE' Christopher Walken's signature arsenal of stylistic oddities has seldom been put to more enthralling use than in this gruesome Martin McDonagh comedy about a scam gone wrong. But the rest of the production, directed by John Crowley, never matches its star's strange genius (1:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Terry Johnson's inspired revival of this 1983 musical, about family values as seen through the prism of a transvestite revue, delivers the unexpected lesson that in theater, shabby can be not just chic but also redemptive. Kelsey Grammer and Douglas Hodge (in a bravura Broadway debut) star winningly as the happily mismatched couple (2:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.

 'COME FLY AWAY' Twyla Tharp brings her kinetic heat to the cool of Frank Sinatra songs in this dazzling dance musical set in a fantasy nightclub redolent of the 1940s. Brilliantly performed by a cast of truly astounding dancers, the show is a tribute to the pas de deux as mating ritual (1:50). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway , at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20100429
 'ENRON' This flashy but labored economics lesson, written by Lucy Prebble and directed by Rupert Goold, works overtime to make entertaining spectacle out of a certain Texas energy company's self-destruction. But the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirrors finances isn't much more than smoke and mirrors itself (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'FELA!' This transporting musical biography of a Nigerian revolutionary of song doesn't so much tell a story as soak an audience to, and through, the skin with the style and sensibility called Afrobeat. There has never been anything on Broadway like Bill T. Jones's kinetic production, which stars the charismatic Sahr Ngaujah and Kevin Mambo (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'FENCES' Denzel Washington brings an arresting, troubled ambivalence to the starring role of this vibrantly acted revival of August Wilson's most accessible and least inventive work. Kenny Leon is the fluid director of this portrait of burned-out African-American dreams in 1950s Pittsburgh, and Viola Davis is superb as a stoic housewife (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'LEND ME A TENOR' Tony Shalhoub and Anthony LaPaglia are the frazzled impresario and the ailing tenor in this hard-working but laugh-light revival of Ken Ludwig's middling farce, directed by Stanley Tucci.

 'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC' Trevor Nunn's nudgingly acted, lugubriously slow revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's erotic waltz of a musical is most notable for the participation of the lustrous Catherine Zeta-Jones, in a lively (if miscast) Broadway debut, and of the indomitable (and invaluable) Angela Lansbury (2:50).

 'MEMPHIS' In the city of the title in the 1950s, a pioneering white radio D.J. (the endearing Chad Kimball) falls in love with R&B music and one of its comely practitioners (the lovely Montego Glover) in this slick but essentially soulless musical written by David Bryan and Joe DiPietro (''The Toxic Avenger'') and fleetly directed by Christopher Ashley. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100429
 'MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET' A small-scale jukebox musical about a big day in rock 'n' roll history, when Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley all got together for an impromptu jam in the recording studio of Sun Records. The book resembles a standard-issue rock doc, but the music-making is fiery and the songs fun. (1:30). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20100429
 'NEXT FALL' The funniest heartbreaker in town. Geoffrey Nauffts's play about that odd couple, love and religion, transfers to Broadway with its quick wit and poignantly human characters intact. Patrick Breen and Patrick Heusinger, as partners in conflict over the existence of God, lead a terrific cast, directed by Sheryl Kaller (2:20). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'NEXT TO NORMAL' No show on Broadway makes as direct a grab for the heart -- or wrings it as thoroughly -- as this brave, breathtaking musical. Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey's portrait of a manic-depressive suburban mom (the astounding Alice Ripley) and her family, directed by Michael Greif, isn't a feel-good musical. It's a feel-everything musical (2:20). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'PROMISES, PROMISES' Despite athletic choreography by Rob Ashford, this revival of a dated 1968 musical about sex in the workplace -- with a book by Neil Simon and a score by Burt Bacharach -- never manages to push the evening's temperature much above lukewarm. Katie Finneran is the energizing standout in a cast led by Kristin Chenoweth and Sean Hayes (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'RACE'David Mamet's surprisingly slack examination of a hot-button topic registers well within the average Broadway audience's comfort zone. There are glimmers of the author's scalpel-edge intelligence, and James Spader is excellent as a white lawyer representing a white man accused of raping a black woman. David Alan Grier, Richard Thomas and Kerry Washington round out the able cast (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'RED' John Logan's intense bio-drama about the painter Mark Rothko, excitingly staged by Michael Grandage, doesn't entirely avoid the cliches of the anguished-artist genre. But in a thrilling performance as Rothko, Alfred Molina makes us see through an artist's eyes, and Eddie Redmayne is excellent as his embattled assistant (1:30). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'SONDHEIM ON SONDHEIM' A genial multimedia scrapbook on the life, times and career of you-know-who. Directed by James Lapine, the show never quite finds a sustained tone, but it has charming videotaped interviews with Mr. Sondheim and a polished ensemble that includes the great Barbara Cook (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)20100429
 Off Broadway
 'ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S THE 39 STEPS' This deliciously silly deconstruction of Alfred Hitchcock's 1936 classic film has been happily re-incarnated Off Broadway (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'THE ALIENS' Annie Baker's gentle, lovely play depicts the three-way friendship that forms between a couple of sweet but troubled misfits and the youngster who works at the coffee shop where they hang out. Delicate, artful and beautifully acted, this is Off Broadway theater at its best (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Isherwood)20100429
 'AVENUE Q' Even without legs of their own, the singing hand puppets of this Tony-winning musical are still standing tall in their new Off Broadway digs. This ''Sesame Street''-style show about being young and jobless in New York remains fresh, in all senses of the word (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100429
 'EL BESO DEL ADIOS/KISS BESSEMER GOODBYE' Tencha Avila's one-act comic drama is about a young Mexican-American woman who is the first in her family to graduate from college. It's given warmth and life by a talented multinational cast. But the real themes, racism and national identity, are explored all too simplistically (2:00).

 'BLOODSONG OF LOVE: THE ROCK 'N' ROLL SPAGHETTI WESTERN' A musical spoof of spaghetti westerns that could use a little more garlic in the Bolognese. Joe Iconis's music is pleasant country rock, but his book and lyrics lack bite (2:30). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100429
 'BLOODY BLOODY ANDREW JACKSON' Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman's rowdy, dopey and devastatingly shrewd emo-rock musical about the seventh American president (played with raw charisma by Benjamin Walker) is the season's most entertaining -- and quite possibly most perceptive -- work of political theater (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20100429
 'CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND THE SPECIAL SERVICE/PANTALEON Y LAS VISITADORAS' Peruvian soldiers in the Amazon need female companionship, so Captain Pantoja enlists a whole corps of prostitutes, complete with cute, midriff-baring uniforms. This rousing, sexy and surprisingly sweet new musical could give bawdiness a good name. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation. Repertorio Espanol at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street , (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org. (Gates)20100429
 'CIRCUMCISE ME' Yisrael Campbell's highly entertaining account of his conversion to Judaism -- not once but three times -- is elevated beyond shtick by the recognition that, aside from the jokes, this is Mr. Campbell's life, and that his quest for a ''relationship with God'' continues even after the house lights rise (1:30). Bleecker Street Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)20100429
 'CREDITORS' This thrilling production of Strindberg's tragicomedy, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, puts each of its fast 90 minutes to cruel and careful use, leaving you feeling as if you'd had the breath knocked out of you. Alan Rickman directs Tom Burke, Anna Chancellor and Owen Teale as the members of a fatal sexual triangle (1:30). BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn , (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)20100429
 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Judith Ivey gives one of the best performances of the season as an achingly real, unexpectedly funny Amanda Wingfield in this terrific revival of Tennessee Williams's breakthrough play. Gordon Edelstein's production skips the usual elegiac approach for something more tough-minded but powerfully effective (2:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)20100429
 'THE IRISH CURSE' This funny but formulaic play by Martin Casella looks in on a support group for men with small penises, a condition that supposedly is especially common among Irishmen. Mr. Casella goes to extremes to make the point that being less than average in this particular area can influence a life in all sorts of ways. Not all of it is credible, but at the play's best moments the jokes land perfectly (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village , (212) 691-1555, theirishcurse.com. (Neil Genzlinger)20100429
 'LOOKING FOR BILLY HAINES' Suzanne Brockmann and Will McCabe's lightweight tale of a gay 1920s movie star and a young actor auditioning for a part in a movie about him has heavy plotting, an amiable cast and tap dancing. But it needs a lot more (2:00). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Gates)20100429
 'LOVE, LOSS, AND WHAT I WORE' Or, shoes, bags and heartaches.

 'MY TRIP DOWN THE PINK CARPET' In his disarming solo vehicle, the pint-sized ''Will & Grace'' scene-stealer Leslie Jordan revisits his upbringing in Chattanooga, Tenn., his blossoming during the disco era and the challenge of accommodating what he calls an ''overt sissy nature'' in a show-business career (1:30).

 'NEWSICAL THE MUSICAL' The four performers in this topical revue -- Christina Bianco, Rory O'Malley, Christine Pedi and Michael West -- are skilled mimics, but the format sure seems tired, especially when the show delves into politics, where jokes have a shelf life measured in hours. Even the Tiger Woods humor, relatively freshly installed, seems wearying. But some of the less time-bound material works nicely, especially Ms. Bianco's Celine Dion impression (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton , (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Genzlinger)20100429
 'THE ORPHANS' HOME CYCLE' On the basis of the three-work production that begins this New York premiere, Horton Foote's heart-piercing nine-play family album about growing up lonely in early-20th-century Texas should be the great adventure of the theater season. Directed with cinematic fluidity by Michael Wilson (2:50). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)20100429
 'THE REALLY BIG ONCE' A highly impressionistic evocation of the making of ''Camino Real,'' Tennessee Williams's highly impressionistic Broadway flop of 1953. Centered on the creative relationship between Williams and the director Elia Kazan, David Herskovits's production may bewilder the uninitiated, but it glows with an ardent empathy (1:10).

 '666' This brash show from the Spanish troupe Yllana isn't for everybody -- if ribald humor offends you, don't go -- but if you can stand the vulgarity, there are pleasures aplenty. The four cast members, portraying death-row inmates, never say a word but somehow manage to convey not only the humor in their series of scenes, but also the price of choosing the personal hell of lust and violence (1:20). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Genzlinger)20100429
 'STUFFED AND UNSTRUNG' Six puppeteers from the arm of the Jim Henson company that deals in work for grown-ups serve up a lively two hours of material, almost all of it improvised based on input from the audience. They work in full view of the crowd, playing to a video camera that projects their puppets onto two large screens, so you have the choice of either watching the skits as they would appear on TV or watching the act of creating them. It's great fun for most of the way, though all that improv eventually grows wearying and you wish for a few more set-pieces (1:30).

 'THE SUBJECT WAS ROSES' Set in the Bronx in 1946, Frank D. Gilroy's well-made 1964 play (it won the Pulitzer Prize) probes one family's tensions and shifting alliances. With a fine cast led by Dan Daily, the Pearl Theater Company's thoughtful production, like the material, seems a bit old-fashioned, in ways both good and bad (2:00).

 'THE TEMPERAMENTALS' Jon Marans's eminently likable docudrama about gay identity in the age of Eisenhower doesn't avoid the boilerplate devices of its genre, but it creates characters who surprise both us and themselves.

 'LIMONADE TOUS LES JOURS'Austin Pendleton stars in Charles L. Mee's lightweight romance about a retirement-age American in Paris and a much younger Frenchwoman named Ya-Ya (Eleanor Handley).

 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL: OVO' Cirque du Soleil imagines a colorful insect universe in this show under the big top at Randall's Island. The best acrobatic routines are dazzling, but others -- a unicyclist on a high wire, for instance -- seem familiar, and the humorous bits between the physical stunts are pretty drab.

Marielle Heller's adaptation of the compelling 2002 illustrated novel by Phoebe Gloeckner -- about a 15-year-old's upbringing in the druggy, polysexual haze of 1970s San Francisco and her toxic affair with her mother's boyfriend -- simplifies its source material (as it must) but captures its poignance and unblinking honesty (1:40). 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, south of Rector Street, Lower Manhattan , (866) 811-4111, diarytheplay.com.

HEADLINE: Fairy Godmother Needed, Even With Aid for College

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The envelope arrives with good news. The college is pleased to announce that the student has been offered acceptance and, if he or she is fortunate, some scholarship money. 
 But in this busted economy, more parents are saying they need more money and are filing appeals. Then the waiting starts again, for a phone call.
 The job of delivering that news -- after weighing hopes and dreams against limited budgets -- falls to people like Sandra J. Oliveira, the executive director of the financial aid office at Providence College.
 Ms. Oliveira is spending this week plowing through a stack of 100 appeals from high school seniors who have been accepted for the next freshman class but who say they cannot afford to attend. Each packet contains a heartfelt plea for more aid than the college offered initially, to offset the impact of recent job losses, plunges in home values or other financial setbacks. 
 ''In this economy, everyone is feeling it to some extent,'' Ms. Oliveira said recently, her wood-laminate desk cluttered with medical bills, layoff notices and tax forms sent to her as supporting evidence. ''Sometimes we can do a lot,'' she added. ''Sometimes we can't. But we spend a lot of time listening.''
 Ms. Oliveira's emotional, painstaking task is playing out on hundreds of campuses, in advance of the May 1 deadline for tuition deposits from many incoming freshmen.
 At Providence College, a Roman Catholic institution where the dogwood trees are blooming, about as many financial aid appeals have been filed by the families of prospective freshmen this spring as last; those figures, though, represent a nearly 15 percent increase over two years ago. 
 At Villanova University in Pennsylvania, which competes with Providence for students, the 350 financial aid appeals filed this spring are down from last year, but are still running 17 percent ahead of those logged in 2008, before the economy turned downward. Financial-aid appeals from prospective freshmen at Lafayette College, also in Pennsylvania, are up more than 40 percent just since last year.
 And while Harvard may be the rare university that has managed to hold the line on such appeals -- the families of 175 prospective freshmen have asked this spring for more aid than was offered, about the same as in 2008 -- it has done so only by raising its financial aid budget by $22 million, or 16 percent, over that period.
 Meanwhile, Providence, like other colleges, is under its own financial constraints, as its costs rise and its endowment ebbs. While avoiding the layoffs and furloughs that other universities, both public and private, have done, Providence is raising its full freshman-year tuition, board and other fees by 19 percent this fall, to more than $53,000.
 For families and institutions, the process that might ease those tuition expenses can be as daunting as some federal tax forms. Offices like Ms. Oliveira's collect information on a family's wages, savings, home equity and other assets, as well as on how many siblings might be attending college. Then, using a combination of federal formulas and policies unique to its own campus, Providence, like its counterparts, will arrive at an award offer.
 At Providence, one of every three dollars in the operating budget, or nearly $50 million, is spent on financial aid, and nearly three of every four students receive some scholarship help. 
 The average direct scholarship based on need last year was more than $17,000. (Students who also qualified for merit-based aid, which not all colleges offer, received substantially more.)
 But for some families, the initial offer, however generous, will not go far enough. Enter Ms. Oliveira, 46, who is equal parts banker, therapist and fairy godmother, and who has the discretion to increase an offer by several thousand dollars a year if she deems the family's circumstances dire enough.
 In arguing their case before Ms. Oliveira, families have the ear of someone who was once on their side of the desk. By the time she enrolled in 1981 at North Adams State College (now the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts) near her home in Western Massachusetts, her father had retired as a Navy chief petty officer and her mother was not working. 
 Two older siblings were in college, and two younger ones would soon be college age. She said she would have been unable to attend college without substantial scholarships. ''Financial-aid discussions were fight night at my house,'' she said. 
 After graduating with a degree in communications, Ms. Oliveira became a financial-aid officer at a community college, largely because ''my loans were due, and I had a summer of no jobs.'' She has worked in financial aid ever since, including at nearby Brown University.
 Among the appeals Ms. Oliveira was considering this week was that of a student accepted for the incoming class whose parents had each lost jobs in recent months; one had worked in construction, the other in an administrative position.
 Providence's initial offer had been about $18,000 in direct aid, Ms. Oliveira said. 
 ''With the change in circumstance, they may get another $1,000, $2,000 in grant,'' she said, using shorthand for a direct scholarship, as opposed to loans. Moreover, the precipitous drop in income will most likely qualify the family for a federal Pell grant, perhaps as much as $5,550. 
 Ms. Oliveira's eyes filled with tears as she described another parent who had just called -- someone whose daughter already attends Providence, and who was struggling to pay the final tuition bill of the year.
 ''We've given them little bits throughout the year,'' Ms. Oliveira said. ''They're borrowing from friends and relatives. The daughter is taking money she needed for a computer to make it work.''
 Here, too, Ms. Oliveira was hopeful that she could help.
 She found herself less moved by the father of an accepted applicant who had lost his job in 2009, but had since found another. The family told her the bank was refusing to allow them to borrow against their home equity.
 ''This is a bank they have worked with for a very long time, and they were almost stunned,'' Ms. Oliveira said. ''But they have other real estate worth a half million dollars that's paid off.''
 In light of more pressing appeals, she said there was probably ''not a whole lot'' she could do for that family. 
 While that phone call might not be a happy one, she said she would draw strength and satisfaction from other conversations this week that could well change the course of a young life.
 One high school senior was so excited to receive good news from Ms. Oliveira this week that she switched her cellphone to speaker mode. She then asked Ms. Oliveira to tell her again that her aid had been granted, so her whole class could hear.
 ''I could hear them cheering,'' Ms. Oliveira said.

HEADLINE: The Euro Trap

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Not that long ago, European economists used to mock their American counterparts for having questioned the wisdom of Europe's march to monetary union. ''On the whole,'' declared an article published just this past January, ''the euro has, thus far, gone much better than many U.S. economists had predicted.''
 Oops. The article summarized the euro-skeptics' views as having been: ''It can't happen, it's a bad idea, it won't last.'' Well, it did happen, but right now it does seem to have been a bad idea for exactly the reasons the skeptics cited. And as for whether it will last -- suddenly, that's looking like an open question. 
 To understand the euro-mess -- and its lessons for the rest of us -- you need to see past the headlines. Right now everyone is focused on public debt, which can make it seem as if this is a simple story of governments that couldn't control their spending. But that's only part of the story for Greece, much less for Portugal, and not at all the story for Spain.
 The fact is that three years ago none of the countries now in or near crisis seemed to be in deep fiscal trouble. Even Greece's 2007 budget deficit was no higher, as a share of G.D.P., than the deficits the United States ran in the mid-1980s (morning in America!), while Spain actually ran a surplus. And all of the countries were attracting large inflows of foreign capital, largely because markets believed that membership in the euro zone made Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds safe investments.
 Then came the global financial crisis. Those inflows of capital dried up; revenues plunged and deficits soared; and membership in the euro, which had encouraged markets to love the crisis countries not wisely but too well, turned into a trap. 
 What's the nature of the trap? During the years of easy money, wages and prices in the crisis countries rose much faster than in the rest of Europe. Now that the money is no longer rolling in, those countries need to get costs back in line. 
 But that's a much harder thing to do now than it was when each European nation had its own currency. Back then, costs could be brought in line by adjusting exchange rates -- e.g., Greece could cut its wages relative to German wages simply by reducing the value of the drachma in terms of Deutsche marks. Now that Greece and Germany share the same currency, however, the only way to reduce Greek relative costs is through some combination of German inflation and Greek deflation. And since Germany won't accept inflation, deflation it is.
 The problem is that deflation -- falling wages and prices -- is always and everywhere a deeply painful process. It invariably involves a prolonged slump with high unemployment. And it also aggravates debt problems, both public and private, because incomes fall while the debt burden doesn't.
 Hence the crisis. Greece's fiscal woes would be serious but probably manageable if the Greek economy's prospects for the next few years looked even moderately favorable. But they don't. Earlier this week, when it downgraded Greek debt, Standard & Poor's suggested that the euro value of Greek G.D.P. may not return to its 2008 level until 2017, meaning that Greece has no hope of growing out of its troubles.
 All this is exactly what the euro-skeptics feared. Giving up the ability to adjust exchange rates, they warned, would invite future crises. And it has.
 So what will happen to the euro? Until recently, most analysts, myself included, considered a euro breakup basically impossible, since any government that even hinted that it was considering leaving the euro would be inviting a catastrophic run on its banks. But if the crisis countries are forced into default, they'll probably face severe bank runs anyway, forcing them into emergency measures like temporary restrictions on bank withdrawals. This would open the door to euro exit. 
 So is the euro itself in danger? In a word, yes. If European leaders don't start acting much more forcefully, providing Greece with enough help to avoid the worst, a chain reaction that starts with a Greek default and ends up wreaking much wider havoc looks all too possible.
 Meanwhile, what are the lessons for the rest of us? 
 The deficit hawks are already trying to appropriate the European crisis, presenting it as an object lesson in the evils of government red ink. What the crisis really demonstrates, however, is the dangers of putting yourself in a policy straitjacket. When they joined the euro, the governments of Greece, Portugal and Spain denied themselves the ability to do some bad things, like printing too much money; but they also denied themselves the ability to respond flexibly to events. 
 And when crisis strikes, governments need to be able to act. That's what the architects of the euro forgot -- and the rest of us need to remember.

HEADLINE: No Bank Is an Island

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Omaya Sosa-Pascual contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The latest American banking crisis is taking shape far from Wall Street and the empty subdivisions that stretch across the Sun Belt. 
 The trouble this time is in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean commonwealth whose banks have been laid low by economic woes that make the mainland's recession seem mild.
 Now, Washington policy makers, who watch over the territory's banks as they do its defense and foreign relations, are moving to broker mergers among several major lenders there to head off what could be a series of costly failures. Deals could come as early as Friday.
 Few people probably realize that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits in the 50 states, also insures billions of deposits in Puerto Rico. So if a bank in Puerto Rico goes under, customers are protected. 
 Rising unemployment, sinking real estate values and deteriorating government finances have worsened Puerto Rico's chronically troubled economy and added new urgency to the efforts to shore up its banks. Loans are scarce, making life even harder for many local businesses. 
 Etienne Cardona, the owner of Cafe Hacienda San Pedro, a coffee shop in San Juan, has been trying for six months to get an $80,000 loan to open a second location. 
 ''They ask for so many details that require a substantial investment before the loan is even approved that we decided to put off the project,'' Mr. Cardona said. ''For now, and until things get better, we'll just stay here.''
 A lending slowdown of this kind often causes a vicious circle -- slower growth, more job losses and, in turn, an even sharper pullback in lending.
 ''This why it is so important for the banking system to get back on its feet,'' said Troy Wright, president of the Puerto Rico Bankers Association and the head of Scotiabank's operations there. 
 At least three of Puerto Rico's banks -- Eurobank, R-G Premier Bank and Westernbank -- are operating under cease-and-desist orders from regulators, restricting their ability to make new loans. They had been given until March 31 to raise new capital or combine with healthier banks. 
 Now that the deadline has come and gone, regulators have been working on a confidential plan to auction off the lenders, according to several people involved in the situation. It is known as Project Themis, after the Greek goddess of divine law and order. 
 Regulators are hoping to strengthen the territory's banking system by forcing its consolidation, while also weaning lenders from the high-cost deposits they obtain from the mainland to make loans, these people said. 
 Even as the government ends other support programs, they said, the agency is expected to make temporary financing available to the acquirers to help replace those more expensive deposits. Bids were due this week, they added. 
 In all, the efforts could cost the F.D.I.C. insurance fund as much as $5 billion, some analysts estimate.
 Puerto Rico is not exactly the Iceland of the Caribbean. But like that economically troubled nation, Puerto Rico is an island financially as well as geographically. That makes fixing its banking system a delicate task. 
 Only 11 banks operate in Puerto Rico, and the three most-troubled institutions hold more than a quarter of all deposits. By comparison, more than 200 of the United States' 8,000 or so lenders have collapsed since the credit crisis began.
 Because deposits are concentrated in so few institutions, regulators have been confronted by a number of vexing questions.
 How, for instance, does the government seize one or more of the banks without setting off a run on others? (Answer: Coordinate plans to close them.) 
 How does it avoid imperiling healthy banks, which would be required to mark down the value of their own loan portfolios if similar assets flooded the market at fire-sale prices? (Answer: Make maintaining a big capital cushion a requirement for bidding.) 
 And how exactly does the government lure investors to pour capital into an overbuilt economy with excess banking capacity amid the worst downturn in generations? (Answer: The F.D.I.C., as it has in the past, would absorb a big portion of the losses.) 
 Senior officials from the Treasury Department, which has $1.2 billion invested in two of Puerto Rico's stronger banks, have weighed in on the strategy. 
 So have other major regulators, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which supplies currency to Puerto Rico, and the commonwealth's Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. 
 The F.D.I.C. has hired Deutsche Bank to act as an adviser on merger and auction plans. 
 Some of Puerto Rico's healthier banks have been shoring up their finances in anticipation of once-in-a-lifetime deals. 
 Doral Financial, for instance, announced last week that it would raise an additional $600 million from private investors to pursue government-assisted acquisitions. 
 Banco Popular de Puerto Rico raised over $1 billion this month. Oriental Financial Group raised $100 million in March. Some overseas banks with operations on the island, like Scotiabank of Canada and Banco Santander of Spain, have also expressed interest. 
 Even in better times, Puerto Rico's banks struggled to gather enough local deposits to keep up with the demand for new loans. 
 One reason was that Puerto Rico's four million residents generally have lower income and personal savings than people on the mainland. 
 Another was the elimination of a lucrative tax break in 2006 that led big corporations to retreat from Puerto Rico, taking their money with them. 
 An enormous deposit shortfall has developed among the banks. Of the $60 billion of loans outstanding, nearly 60 percent, or $35 billion, have been financed with customer deposits, research from FBR Capital Markets said. On the mainland, by contrast, deposits typically finance about 80 percent of lending. 
 As a result, Puerto Rico's banks have had to raise money from savers on the mainland, a costlier and riskier form of financing. 
 Even before the financial crisis began, the territory was in a deep recession. 
 The economy has been shrinking for the last four years, and the island's 16.2 percent unemployment rate far exceeds that of Michigan, which has the highest jobless rate of any state. 
 The property market is also suffering from its own real estate hangover. Most banks tolerated higher debt levels on construction projects than did their mainland peers. 
 Some, like Banco Popular and First Bank of Puerto Rico, also financed projects in South Florida and other hot markets in the United States that have since faltered. 
 ''It's like a fever that extends to a patient that was already sick,'' said Heidie Calero, a local economist who advises real estate developers. 
 Now, Puerto Rico's lenders are paying the price. About 8.2 percent of loans were either past due or in default in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to Foresight Analytics. That compares with an average of 3 percent on the mainland.

HEADLINE: New Shades of the Blue and the Gray

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Of the Civil War, there is no end. So exhibitions commemorating the 150th anniversary of its beginning might seem superfluous. In recent decades hasn't the Civil War been in almost continuous commemoration? It is now considered to be as central an event in the history of the United States as the Revolutionary War. Its key documents -- all of them Lincoln's, including the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation and the Second Inaugural Address -- have become as fundamental for understanding American ideals as anything written by the founding fathers. 
 And the effects of the devastation wrought by the war, the stultifying ways in which its noblest ambitions diffused into post-Reconstruction ambivalence, and the length of the shadows it still casts over the contemporary political scene -- these are readily felt by anyone exploring the ever-growing literature. The risk now may be that we view the Civil War almost familiarly, as if its immensity were commonplace. 
 Cognizant of all this, when the National Archives planned a commemorative show -- the first part opens here on Friday, the second opens in November, extending into the 150th anniversary year -- it decided not to recapitulate the war's battles; neither did it want to survey the conflict's causes and effects, nor focus on slavery, nor even on Lincoln. 
 Instead Bruce Bustard, a senior curator at the Archives, searched through Army pension records, soldier enlistment rosters, government correspondence and the country's largest cache of official Confederate papers to escape burning to discover a series of what he called ''little-known stories, seldom-seen documents and unusual perspectives.'' This might seem to emphasize marginalia, but the exhibition's title, ''Discovering the Civil War,'' suggests that by focusing on the unfamiliar, something new will be revealed. 
 The result, while flawed, is engrossing and eminently fascinating. Few scholars of the period will be surprised, and no revelations here overturn standard interpretations, but something unusual happens nevertheless. The war starts to expand in two directions. It reaches downward, extending into once-neglected regions of social and economic life, and outward, into the world in ways we had not fully appreciated. 
 We see, for example, an undated Civil War-era photograph of a crew on a Union gunboat (probably the Mendota), and notice, loosely gathered on the far right of the deck, a handful of black sailors wearing the same berets and uniforms as their white mates. But we notice too that among all of the posed seamen, these black men seem to be the only ones holding tools or handiwork; one black sailor stands more independently near a cannon. Some fundamental differences in duties and opportunities are suggested here, but the real surprise is that there was any racial integration at all -- something that was uncommon in the Army but not, it turns out, in the shipbound realms of the Navy, where 18,000 blacks had enlisted. ''Many of the black crew members'' on this ship, we are told, ''were recently freed slaves.''
 We are also introduced to Sarah Emma Edmonds, who wanted to fight for the Union. But no female soldiers were permitted on either side. (One document here is signed by ''true & loyal citoyennes of the Confederate State,'' who unsuccessfully petitioned the Confederacy to create a ''full regiment of Ladies.'') Ultimately Edmonds, like several hundred other women, enlisted by passing as a man, Frank Thompson; she fought for two years with the Second Michigan Volunteer Infantry. A bout of malaria that would have required hospitalization (and thus, disclosure) led to her defection. One document is a testimonial by her bunkmate, who never realized she was a woman; she had to collect such accounts after the war, when she filed a claim for a wartime injury.
 And another view from the margins: About a quarter of Union soldiers were born outside the United States; men from similar communities often volunteered together. A roster of the 26th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry shows 58 of 59 men were immigrants. German must have been their common language: they hailed from regions including Bohemia, Bavaria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Prussia and Germany. 
 The war, we see again and again, had a wide reach, raising the passions of many, leaving few untouched. The South was the first to initiate a draft; the North followed. And many tried to avoid it. About 20 percent of draftees to the Union Army, we are told, never reported; about 12 percent of the Confederate Army deserted. Wealth allowed alternatives and created resentments; in the South a ''20 Negro law'' meant that planters with 20 or more slaves would be exempt from service. In the North substitute soldiers were sometimes hired for $200 to $275 to take a draftee's place.
 Pages of a roster on display list draft substitutes who signed up in Brooklyn in October 1863. An interactive touch screen allows us to discover more details. Enlisting was apparently an entree into a wider world: of 70 listed substitutes, 2 were black and 50 were immigrants. Two substitutes had even served in the Confederate Army first. (One of those, Henry Quick, had been captured by the Union, then shifted allegiance.) 
 But this exhibition is not only an account of the vagaries of soldiery. When we learn about the creation of the Confederate government, we see documents that transformed the old nation into the new, sometimes simply by crossing out the ''United'' before the words ''States of America'' on official papers and replacing it with ''Confederate,'' sometimes by making changes far more significant.
 In 1861, we see, a ''native of New York'' living in Alabama has suddenly become a postsecession foreigner. In a court document he renounces ''all allegiance and fidelity to every foreign Prince, Potentate, State or Sovereignty and particularly to the State of New York.''
 In some ways the Confederacy appears as a distorted mirror image of the North. A $50 bill in Confederate currency featured a portrait of that renowned Virginian, George Washington. (Other denominations show pastoral images of slaves happily working in the fields.) Sheet music for a Union favorite, ''The Battle Cry of Freedom,'' has reworked Confederate lyrics: ''Our Dixie forever, she's never at a loss. Down with the eagle and up with the cross.''
 In other displays too a well-known document might be used to usher in an avalanche of others, letting us grasp the scale of something we may have missed. We know about Gen. Robert E. Lee's resignation from the United States Army after Virginia rebelled, but on one wall here are reproductions of many similar resignations submitted as Southern states seceded and officers left to join their state militias.
 They are signed ''respectfully,'' ''very respectfully'' and ''most respectfully.'' They begin ''with feelings of deep regret'' or with pride: ''I have the honor to tender the resignation.'' And this is another aspect of this bloody conflict: Many of those who led the battles were friends and colleagues, trained at West Point, veterans who shared earlier battles. A touch screen display shows a Facebook-like social network of connections between the leaders of the North and the South. 
 And while the global repercussions of the conflict are usually discussed in terms of the maneuvers of Britain and France, here we have a proclamation of neutrality by King Kamehameha IV of Hawaii; still more exotically, in a bound volume we see a letter from the United States ambassador to the Chinese foreign minister, Prince Kung, translated into Chinese. Kung is asked to deny Confederate ships any entrance into Chinese waters; he agrees. Such information gives us a look at the war's world presence; our sense of it deepens with each display. 
 But there are also distractions that should have been avoided. Sometimes the show's impulse to find the little known eclipses larger themes. There are times too when the exhibition courts miscellaneous amazement over focus, and defers to impression over argument. (''Come and discover the Civil War for yourself,'' its opening panels announce.) 
 There is a related design problem. The show was created so that after its second half closes next April, the two parts will join into a single exhibition that will travel to about eight museums around the country. This means that very few (just seven) original documents are on display, and they are unimportant enough that they can be rotated out with others over time. 
 Everything else is seen in facsimile, printed on panels with photo reproductions, with passages enlarged, highlighted or annotated. But many of these copies of documents from the archives' files are more historically important than the originals on display. The problem is that they come to seem less consequential because they are less carefully presented. The layout is also more interested in being lively than helpful. You have to tilt your head to read some of the resignation letters. And sometimes you must try to discern faint handwriting, once removed from the original. 
 Sometimes too the show's attempt to entertain ends up distracting. (Try tracing the migrations of the Confederate warship the Alabama by following it on a touch screen; its journey is portrayed as if the narrative of a jumbled graphic novel.) 
 All this seems a consequence of the exhibition's populist approach: it is conceived for maximum exposure rather than maximum impact. What would have happened instead, if the show had been shaped around several dozen original documents, each given more importance than the originals shown here, each augmented with commentary and annotation? The surprises might have been more carefully prepared and the effect of individual stories more intense. 
 We value exhibitions partly because of the historical resonance of the objects on display -- for their presence, not just their content. Here, though, at first reading, many documents seem more weightless than they should, at least until we step back from their presentation, think of their implications, and realize just how far from commonplace the war's immensity really is, and how much more there is to understand.
 Part 1 of ''Discovering the Civil War'' runs through Sept. 6 at the National Archives, Constitution Avenue NW, at Ninth Street, Washington; (202) 357-5000, archives.gov/nae/support/civil-war.

HEADLINE: U.S. Intensifies Bid to Control Oil Spill in Gulf

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Robert, La.; John M. Broder and Helene Cooper contributed from Washington; and Christopher Drew and Henry Fountain from New York.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- The response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico intensified abruptly on Thursday, with the federal government intervening more aggressively as the rapidly growing slick drifted ever closer to the fragile coastline of Louisiana.
 Resources from the United States Navy were marshaled to supplement an operation that already consisted of more than 1,000 people and scores of vessels and aircraft.
 Calling it ''a spill of national significance'' which could threaten coastline in several states, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the creation of a second command post in Mobile, Ala., in addition to the one in Louisiana, to manage potential coastal impact in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ordered an immediate review of the 30 offshore drilling rigs and 47 production platforms operating in the deepwater Gulf, and is sending teams to conduct on-site inspections.
 The oil slick was only three miles offshore on Thursday afternoon and was expected to hit coastal Louisiana as early as Thursday night, prompting Gov. Bobby Jindal to declare a state of emergency and to request the participation of the National Guard in response efforts. About 40,000 feet of boom had been placed around Pass-a-Loutre, the area of the Mississippi River Delta where the oil was expected to touch first, a spokesman for Mr. Jindal said. 
 The Navy provided 50 contractors, 7 skimming systems and 66,000 feet of inflatable containment boom, a spokesman said. About 210,000 feet of boom had been laid down to protect the shoreline in several places along the Gulf Coast, though experts said that marshlands presented a far more daunting cleaning challenge than sandy beaches.
 Eight days after the first explosion on the rig, which left 11 workers missing and presumed dead, the tenor of the response team's briefings changed abruptly Wednesday night with a hastily called news conference to announce that the rate of the spill was estimated to be 5,000 barrels a day, or more than 200,000 gallons -- five times the previous estimate. By Thursday, it was apparent that the cleanup operation desperately needed help, with no indication that the well would be sealed any time soon and oil drifting closer to shore.
 The response effort has been driven by BP, the company that was leasing the rig and is responsible for the cleanup, under the oversight of the Coast Guard and in consultation with the Minerals Management Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While additional federal resources, including naval support, were available before Wednesday, officials had given little indication that such reinforcements would be deployed so quickly and at such a scale. 
 ''Some of it existed from the start,'' Rear Adm. Mary E. Landry of the Coast Guard, the federal on-scene coordinator, said of the federal resources. ''We can ramp it up as we need it.''
 Referring to what she called ''dynamic tension'' among the participants in a spill response, Admiral Landry said it was her duty to ensure that BP was trying every approach available.
 ''If BP does not request these resources, then I can and I will,'' she said. 
 Asked whether the Coast Guard had confidence in BP's efforts, Admiral Landry said, ''BP, from Day 1, has attempted to be very responsive and be a very responsible spiller.''
 BP, in turn, has pointed out on more than one occasion that Transocean owned the oil rig and the blowout preventer, a device that apparently failed to function properly and that is continuing to be the most significant obstacle to stopping the spill.
 Underscoring how acute the situation has become, BP is soliciting ideas and techniques from four other major oil companies -- Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and Anadarko. BP officials have also requested help from the Defense Department in efforts to activate the blowout preventer, a stack of hydraulically activated valves at the top of the well that is designed to seal it off in the event of a sudden pressure release.
 Doug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production for BP, said the company had asked the military for better imaging technology and more advanced remotely operated vehicles. As of now, there are six such vehicles monitoring or trying to fix the blowout preventer, which sits on the sea floor. 
 ''To be frank, the offer of help from all quarters is welcome,'' said David Nicholas, a BP spokesman.
 But Norman Polmar, an expert on military systems, said the robotic submersibles used by the oil industry were better equipped to try to stop the oil leak than any of the Navy's minisubs. The Navy's unmanned subs have cameras and can retrieve bits of hardware, he said, but are not designed to plug a hole in a pipe or do repair work.
 Other efforts to contain the spill included a tactic that Admiral Landry called ''absolutely novel'': crews awaited approval on Thursday night to begin deploying chemical dispersants underwater near the source of the leaks. Aircraft have dropped nearly 100,000 gallons of the dispersants on the water's surface to break down the oil, a more conventional strategy.
 BP is also designing and building large boxlike structures that could be lowered over the leaks in the riser, the 5,000-foot-long pipe that connected the well to the rig and has since become detached and is snaking along the sea floor. The structures would contain the leaking oil and route it to the surface to be collected. This temporary solution could take several weeks to execute. 
 Mr. Suttles said three such structures were being prepared, one of which is complete and could corral the worst of the leaks. But citing the disclosure of the new leak on Wednesday night, experts said more were certainly possible.
 ''All that movement is going to continue to stress and fatigue the pipe and create more leaks,'' said Jeffrey Short, Pacific science director for Oceana and former chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who helped clean the spill from the Exxon Valdez in 1989. 
 ''This is not on a good trajectory,'' he added.
 The next solution is drilling relief wells that would allow crews to plug the gushing cavity with mud, concrete or other heavy liquid. The drilling of one such well is expected to begin in the next 48 hours, Mr. Suttles said, but it could be three months before the leak is plugged by this method.
 The legal and political dimensions of the oil spill spread as well on Thursday, with lawyers filing suits on behalf of commercial fishermen, shrimpers and injured workers against BP; Transocean; Cameron, the company that manufactured the blowout preventer; and other companies involved in the drilling process, including Halliburton. 
 Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, has asked the heads of major oil companies, including BP, to testify at a hearing about the spill. 
 Opponents of President Obama's plan to expand offshore drilling have also called for a halt. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, called Thursday for a moratorium on all new offshore oil exploration while the cause of this rig explosion is under investigation. Mr. Nelson, a longtime opponent of oil drilling off the coasts of Florida, said in a letter to Mr. Obama that the spreading oil spill threatened environmental and economic disaster all along the Gulf Coast.
 Administration officials stressed that the president's offshore drilling plan was the beginning of a lengthy review process and did not mean that large new areas would see immediate oil and gas activity. They also said that they expected that members of Congress and the public would have new questions about the safety of offshore operations and that the administration would rethink its commitment to offshore drilling in light of the accident.
 ''That is the beginning of a process,'' said Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. ''What is occurring now will also be taken into consideration.''

HEADLINE: Need an Appointment at the D.M.V.? Do You Feel Lucky?

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
The toughest reservation to snag in San Francisco these days is not a table at the latest Michelin star restaurant, but instead a destination few would consider particularly appetizing: the Department of Motor Vehicles.
 ''There was no hope,'' said Shana Mahaffey, who needed to renew her license. ''I began in March trying to get an appointment online and by phone.''
 After three weeks, she gave up and was prepared to travel to the Oakland D.M.V. Then on a lark she tried online for San Francisco one last time and was given an unexpected opening. 
 ''It was like winning the lottery,'' Ms. Mahaffey said. 
 Last week when her time slot arrived she walked into the branch on Fell Street, and 41 minutes later she had a license. Without an appointment, a D.M.V. employee said, the wait would have been hours.
 Because of the state's budget deficit, the number of personnel hours to manage California's car culture has been reduced, while the workload has remained steady or increased. This has led to a shortage of resources at popular and convenient D.M.V. branches like San Francisco's.
 The D.M.V. processed 29.7 million licenses and identification cards statewide in 2009, up nearly 400,000 from 2008. But during the same period, to save money, the state has furloughed D.M.V. employees and closed offices the first three Fridays of each month, said George Valverde, director of the state D.M.V. ''We're losing about 15 percent of our available hours.''
 The new reality of fewer open hours and a greater workload means that some problems that were once resolved quickly can now languish. 
 Ms. Mahaffey, a local novelist whom I have known for years, was on a book tour in Washington in early March when she was stopped during check-in at Dulles International Airport and told that she could not board her return flight without valid identification. When she was leaving San Francisco, no one at the airport noticed that her driver's license had expired. 
 ''I was peeved to be stranded in Washington,'' she said.
 Garrulous by nature, Ms. Mahaffey talked her way onto the plane at Dulles, but once home, she faced another kind of transportation paralysis: she could not legally drive because her insurance coverage was void without a valid license. Ms. Mahaffey said that she had not received a license renewal notice and that as a result she must appear in person at the D.M.V. 
 By the time she resolved the matter, six weeks had passed. 
 Her struggle for an appointment is not an anomaly. Random testing of the D.M.V.'s online appointment system over two weeks showed no availability in San Francisco. Appointment schedules open 45 days in advance, for those who can wait that long, but those slots are snatched up immediately.
 An additional burden on the system is that some customers hoard appointments, claiming more than one, apparently to keep their options open. Mr. Valverde said there was a 50 percent no-show rate, a problem the agency plans to work on.
 Technology has brought some needed relief: most D.M.V. business can now be done online -- 9.4 million transactions were done online last year, a record, with a 20 percent increase in the first quarter of 2010, according to D.M.V. records.
 But Armando Botello, a D.M.V. spokesman, said there remained a ''digital divide'' affecting poorer Californians who lack Internet access. In addition, Mr. Botello said, ''a lot of people wait until the last minute'' to pay D.M.V. fees -- a situation perhaps exacerbated by the recession -- and do not leave enough time to receive a license or vehicle registration renewal by mail.
 The D.M.V. is one of the few government agencies that regularly engage all strata of the population. During a recent visit to the branch on Fell Street, there was not an empty seat in a waiting area for hundreds. A middle-aged man in a suit stood reading from a Kindle. A young woman dashed through with a live rat peeking out of her jeans pocket. An elderly matron clutched her paperwork and stared up at a screen that announced which customer was being served.
 Across the street at a DeLessio Market, Michael E. Shanahan had abandoned the crowd and waited with his paperwork, while munching a sandwich of turkey with cranberry sauce. Without an appointment, Mr. Shanahan had more than 100 others ahead of him.
 ''I'm just going to sit and enjoy my sandwich,'' he said.
 There was no impatience in his voice. In fact, what was unexpected about the bursting D.M.V. office was how remarkably pleasant everyone was. If employees were frustrated by more work at less pay, they did not show it. 
 To the contrary, ''everyone was so nice,'' Ms. Mahaffey said. ''The most traumatic part was getting the appointment.''
 A tough reservation to get, but worth the wait.
