HEADLINE: Wielding a Cost-Cutting Ax, and Often, at NASA

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In Washington, it almost seems radical -- completing government projects at their original budgeted cost.
 Yet at NASA, the new director of the space science division appears to be making headway at doing just that, creating some anguish among researchers and contractors along the way.
 In his eight months on the job, the director, S. Alan Stern, has turned back almost a half-dozen requests for more money from projects experiencing cost overruns, he said. That has forced mission leaders to trim parts of their projects, streamline procedures or find other sources of financing.
 Dr. Stern, an astrophysicist and planetary scientist, became associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in April. In an appearance before Congress the next month, he outlined a tough plan for keeping missions on budget and holding leaders responsible: better cost-estimating tools to more realistically price missions, more experience for scientists running projects, and new studies to better understand and reduce technology risks.
 NASA devotes about $5.4 billion a year to its science program, divided among specialties like astrophysics, earth science and planetary exploration. To finance President Bush's exploration initiative to return humans to the Moon, while also financing space shuttle operations and a shuttle replacement out of the agency's approximately $16 billion annual budget, science program money is being held to about a 1 percent increase per year for four years. 
 Factoring in inflation and the loss of what had been anticipated financing increases, space experts say this amounts to a loss for NASA science of about $3 billion over that period. For Dr. Stern, that means doing more with less. 
 One of the first targets in his effort to attack cost overruns was the Kepler mission, a project started in 2001 to launch a planet-hunting telescope. Because of management problems, technical issues and other difficulties, the price tag went up and the launching date slipped from the original 2006 target.
 In 2006, NASA resolved itself to a 20 percent cost overrun, which raised the price to $550 million, and accepted a 2008 launching time. Then the Kepler team came to Dr. Stern last spring with a request for an additional $42 million. 
 ''Four times they came for more money and four times we told them 'no,''' Dr. Stern said.
 After Dr. Stern's team threatened to open the project to new bids so other researchers could take it over using the equipment that had already been built, the Kepler group came up with a solution. Among other measures, the duration of the four-year mission was cut by six months and preflight testing was scaled back.
 ''When they came to believe I was serious and had my boss's backing,'' Dr. Stern said, ''they took it seriously. They quickly found a way to erase that bill.''
 Dr. Stern, 50, came to NASA from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., where he directed the Space Science and Engineering Division. His hard line on cost overruns has been one of the first signs of change noticed by researchers and many outsiders. So far, he said, his team has rolled back cost overruns in almost a half-dozen projects, sending out word that this is now standard procedure.
 ''I admire what he's doing,'' said Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, professor of space science at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Space Studies Board at the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Fisk, who headed NASA's science directorate in the 1980s, said true reform required a cultural change at the agency in how it runs programs. And a director must be consistent, he said, to convince people of the seriousness of the effort.
 ''In the beginning, he has to be hard-nosed with everybody,'' Dr. Fisk said. ''The first one he blinks on could be a problem. He has to maintain his credibility.''
 Dr. Stern said that when he took the job, he told the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, that he planned personnel and policy changes in his division to make the most of a stagnant budget while continuing to sponsor world-leading space science. He noted the appointment of Dr. John C. Mather, a Nobel laureate, to the vacant post of chief scientist in the directorate as a sign that science, not just launching spacecraft, would be the chief focus.
 ''We're just not walking around swinging the ax,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We have a very new team that, I hope, is changing the way we do business.''
 Dr. Stern said he did not blame individual managers or the NASA field centers responsible for some projects for all of the overrun problems. For years, costs have not been as tightly controlled as possible, starting with unrealistic estimates of how much it would take to complete a project, he said. 
 Over the last five years, he said, continuing projects have come back to NASA asking for $5.4 billion in new money. Although a few projects were canceled, the agency found extra money in some cases by borrowing from other programs or delaying future initiatives. 
 ''In the past, we sacrificed the future for the present,'' Dr. Stern said.
 In addition, the agency made cost control more difficult by changing mission requirements during development or modifying launching dates, Dr. Stern said. It became routine for project managers to come back to NASA headquarters for more money when there were problems, he said, and often, they got it. 
 With today's tight budgets, he said, it is unfair to expect NASA to raid other programs or stop initiating programs to pay for the excessive costs of current projects. 
 ''The mission that makes the mess is responsible for cleaning it up,'' Dr. Stern said.
 He acknowledged that NASA shared responsibility for some problems, noting that ''the blame goes all around.'' 
 The agency needs to change the way it does business, he said, in part by avoiding the tendency to micromanage projects and by doing a better job of picking more experienced people to lead programs.
 ''The person at the helm should not be a rookie,'' he said. 
 Dr. Stern's new push scored what he called one of its biggest victories when cost overruns threatened a flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory. The $1.7 billion project is to launch a nuclear-powered, wheeled robot laboratory to Mars in late 2009, a craft three times larger than the Spirit and Opportunity rovers now operating there.
 When a review last summer showed a $75 million cost overrun, Dr. Stern's office scaled back some of the laboratory's capabilities. That included eliminating a camera to take images of its descent to landing and stopping work on a laser chemistry instrument called Chem-Cam, developed by researchers in the United States and France, that would burn off surface coatings of materials to determine their composition.
 The move stirred an uproar among scientists, and the Planetary Society space advocacy group mounted a public campaign against it, calling for a Congressional review of the decision. In November, Dr. Stern announced that Chem-Cam and the descent imager were back on the laboratory manifest. The descent camera's designer and maker offered to finish the instrument at its own expense, he said, and the Chem-Cam team got more money from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a main sponsor, and its French partners.
 ''This is a win-win situation,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We got a lot of the cost reduction we wanted, and their instruments get to fly.''
 Dr. Roger C. Wiens at Los Alamos, the principal investigator on Chem-Cam, said he had delivered several spacecraft instruments for past projects, but his latest dealings with NASA headquarters were unique. 
 ''I haven't experienced this in the past,'' Dr. Wiens said. ''We were surprised to be taken off the mission and are very glad to be back on.''
 Dr. Wiens said everyone working on Chem-Cam, including the French partners, pitched in to save it, scrambling to find extra money and ways to reduce costs. Acknowledging that tough times would continue financially and that the rules had changed, Dr. Wiens said he would keep vying for space missions but would ''take another deep breath before we put in another proposal.'' 
 Dr. Louis D. Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, said he was pleased that the Mars laboratory was able to recover some of its discarded instruments. But he said similar problems would continue and probably get worse with continued budget pressure. 
 ''How long can you balance budgets at the expense of the science?'' Dr. Friedman asked. ''And is it constructive, in the long run, to tell people that if they have an overrun, even for a legitimate reason, they are in danger of cancellation?''
 Dr. Stern realizes, he said, that even with good planning and management, there will always be projects that end up costing more than anticipated. 
 ''We'll never get all the overruns out of the system,'' he said, ''but we can reduce it and make it less common, if not rare.''

HEADLINE: In 2008, a 100 Percent Chance of Alarm

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
I'd like to wish you a happy New Year, but I'm afraid I have a different sort of prediction. 
 You're in for very bad weather. In 2008, your television will bring you image after frightening image of natural havoc linked to global warming. You will be told that such bizarre weather must be a sign of dangerous climate change -- and that these images are a mere preview of what's in store unless we act quickly to cool the planet.
 Unfortunately, I can't be more specific. I don't know if disaster will come by flood or drought, hurricane or blizzard, fire or ice. Nor do I have any idea how much the planet will warm this year or what that means for your local forecast. Long-term climate models cannot explain short-term weather. 
 But there's bound to be some weird weather somewhere, and we will react like the sailors in the Book of Jonah. When a storm hit their ship, they didn't ascribe it to a seasonal weather pattern. They quickly identified the cause (Jonah's sinfulness) and agreed to an appropriate policy response (throw Jonah overboard). 
 Today's interpreters of the weather are what social scientists call availability entrepreneurs: the activists, journalists and publicity-savvy scientists who selectively monitor the globe looking for newsworthy evidence of a new form of sinfulness, burning fossil fuels. 
 A year ago, British meteorologists made headlines predicting that the buildup of greenhouse gases would help make 2007 the hottest year on record. At year's end, even though the British scientists reported the global temperature average was not a new record -- it was actually lower than any year since 2001 -- the BBC confidently proclaimed, ''2007 Data Confirms Warming Trend.''
 When the Arctic sea ice last year hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored. A large part of Antarctica has been cooling recently, but most coverage of that continent has focused on one small part that has warmed.
 When Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans in 2005, it was supposed to be a harbinger of the stormier world predicted by some climate modelers. When the next two hurricane seasons were fairly calm -- by some measures, last season in the Northern Hemisphere was the calmest in three decades -- the availability entrepreneurs changed the subject. Droughts in California and Australia became the new harbingers of climate change (never mind that a warmer planet is projected to have more, not less, precipitation over all). 
 The most charitable excuse for this bias in weather divination is that the entrepreneurs are trying to offset another bias. The planet has indeed gotten warmer, and it is projected to keep warming because of greenhouse emissions, but this process is too slow to make much impact on the public. 
 When judging risks, we often go wrong by using what's called the availability heuristic: we gauge a danger according to how many examples of it are readily available in our minds. Thus we overestimate the odds of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash because we've seen such dramatic deaths so often on television; we underestimate the risks of dying from a stroke because we don't have so many vivid images readily available.
 Slow warming doesn't make for memorable images on television or in people's minds, so activists, journalists and scientists have looked to hurricanes, wild fires and starving polar bears instead. They have used these images to start an ''availability cascade,'' a term coined by Timur Kuran, a professor of economics and law at the University of Southern California, and Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago. 
 The availability cascade is a self-perpetuating process: the more attention a danger gets, the more worried people become, leading to more news coverage and more fear. Once the images of Sept. 11 made terrorism seem a major threat, the press and the police lavished attention on potential new attacks and supposed plots. After Three Mile Island and ''The China Syndrome,'' minor malfunctions at nuclear power plants suddenly became newsworthy. 
 ''Many people concerned about climate change,'' Dr. Sunstein says, ''want to create an availability cascade by fixing an incident in people's minds. Hurricane Katrina is just an early example; there will be others. I don't doubt that climate change is real and that it presents a serious threat, but there's a danger that any 'consensus' on particular events or specific findings is, in part, a cascade.'' 
 Once a cascade is under way, it becomes tough to sort out risks because experts become reluctant to dispute the popular wisdom, and are ignored if they do. Now that the melting Arctic has become the symbol of global warming, there's not much interest in hearing other explanations of why the ice is melting -- or why the globe's other pole isn't melting, too.
 Global warming has an impact on both polar regions, but they're also strongly influenced by regional weather patterns and ocean currents. Two studies by NASA and university scientists last year concluded that much of the recent melting of Arctic sea ice was related to a cyclical change in ocean currents and winds, but those studies got relatively little attention -- and were certainly no match for the images of struggling polar bears so popular with availability entrepreneurs.
 Roger A. Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, recently noted the very different reception received last year by two conflicting papers on the link between hurricanes and global warming. He counted 79 news articles about a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, and only 3 news articles about one in a far more prestigious journal, Nature. 
 Guess which paper jibed with the theory -- and image of Katrina -- presented by Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth''?
 It was, of course, the paper in the more obscure journal, which suggested that global warming is creating more hurricanes. The paper in Nature concluded that global warming has a minimal effect on hurricanes. It was published in December -- by coincidence, the same week that Mr. Gore received his Nobel Peace Prize.
 In his acceptance speech, Mr. Gore didn't dwell on the complexities of the hurricane debate. Nor, in his roundup of the 2007 weather, did he mention how calm the hurricane season had been. Instead, he alluded somewhat mysteriously to ''stronger storms in the Atlantic and Pacific,'' and focused on other kinds of disasters, like ''massive droughts'' and ''massive flooding.'' 
 ''In the last few months,'' Mr. Gore said, ''it has been harder and harder to misinterpret the signs that our world is spinning out of kilter.'' But he was being too modest. Thanks to availability entrepreneurs like him, misinterpreting the weather is getting easier and easier.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Findings column in Science Times on Tuesday, about the way severe weather is tied to predictions of global warming, gave an outdated academic affiliation for Timur Kuran. He is a professor of economics and political science at Duke University; he is no longer a professor of economics and law at the University of Southern California.

HEADLINE: A Family That Beat Anthrax Picks Up the Pieces

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
When Ase-AmenRa Kariamu and his wife, Althea, returned to their house here after nearly four months, it neither felt nor looked like home. The odor of chlorine was so powerful that they had to wear masks. A baby portrait of their eldest daughter in an upstairs hallway was a pale bronze, as if a relic from generations past.
 Tools, supplies and art pieces from Mr. Kariamu's backyard workshop were piled in the basement. 
 ''It looks like junk right now,'' he said on Friday, picking up a half-broken shekere, a beaded gourd instrument, whose net of beads had been torn. ''Oh, man,'' he said, laughing. ''Really just unbelievable.''
 But at least he and his family were healthy and the house was free of anthrax.
 Last summer, Mr. Kariamu, 49, and his 9-year-old son, Seku-Baye, contracted cutaneous anthrax, an infection of the skin. It was an ordeal that turned the family's life -- and home -- upside down and wreaked economic havoc on the city's north end.
 Mr. Kariamu said he had been hoping to pursue his love of West African drumming and finish writing a memoir after retiring from the United Parcel Service in August. But then goatskin that he had fashioned into a drumhead turned out to be contaminated. When he and his son were found to have anthrax in early September, he was questioned by F.B.I. agents, hazardous materials teams sealed off his yard, and television news helicopters swooped overhead.
 ''You would think they had bin Laden here,'' Mr. Kariamu said. ''It was bizarre, really bizarre.''
 Now, after three and a half months of a cleanup that included treating surfaces in the rental house with chlorine bleach and pumping it full of spore-killing gas, the Connecticut Department of Public Health declared it safe for occupancy on Dec. 22. 
 The path to the back porch of the gray clapboard house at 69 Padanaram Road was littered with a pile of plastic sheeting. A heavy-duty forklift, a crane and a portable toilet, all from the cleanup effort, crowded the small backyard, and tire tracks six inches deep crisscrossed what had been a swath of grass.
 While the federal Environmental Protection Agency said it might reimburse Mr. Kariamu for damage caused by the fumigation, he said he had not been able to work with his drums and had not paid rent since September. 
 His landlord, Donald Lombardo, said he was being ''patient'' about the rent. ''Basically, I called him and told him, 'Pay me what you can. And if you can't, somehow we'll work it out in the end,''' Mr. Lombardo said.
 But not only did the City of Danbury turn down Mr. Kariamu's request for emergency financial assistance, Mayor Mark D. Boughton seemed anything but sympathetic. 
 Danbury incurred about $100,000 in overtime charges for police and fire personnel, Mr. Boughton said, adding that he was most concerned about the cost to local businesses. A stretch of Padanaram Road -- a main thoroughfare through this city -- was blocked off, sometimes for days at a time, as work at the contaminated property proceeded.
 A pizza parlor nearly went out of business because of financial losses brought on by the road closing, Mr. Boughton said, suggesting that some local establishments might sue Mr. Kariamu to recoup lost revenue.
 ''He certainly does bear responsibility,'' the mayor said.
 Mr. Kariamu, the director of a West African drumming program at the nonprofit Danbury Music Center, said he did not see it that way. He said the New York City hide dealer who had sold him the infected skin had assured him it had been legally imported. 
 He said he had assumed that if it were contaminated, it would not have been allowed in the country. 
 Mr. Kariamu -- who is of Ghanaian descent, was born in North Carolina and grew up in Connecticut -- is the second man in as many years in the greater New York region to be stricken with anthrax as a result of tainted animal skins imported from Africa. In February 2006, a Greenwich Village drum maker was infected with the more serious inhalation anthrax after handling untreated hides.
 The man, Vado Diomande, was hospitalized for a month but eventually recovered.
 Mr. Kariamu said he remembered hearing about Mr. Diomande's case when it was in the news last year. But he said that since he wore a mask when he made his drums, it never occurred to him that he would be at risk. 
 Mr. Kariamu plans to make a few changes in his drum-making routine. He said he would no longer handle untreated skins.
 He and Seku-Baye have been off antibiotics since mid-October. 
 Now, he hopes, the house can make a similar turnaround. One day, perhaps, it will feel -- and smell -- like home again.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Rise, but Prices Keep Falling

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes nudged up in November, but that was not enough to improve the broader picture of a housing market racked by record-high foreclosures and harder-to-get credit. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that sales of existing single-family homes, condominiums and town houses rose 0.4 percent in November from October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five million units. Even with the small increase, the pace of sales was still the second-lowest on record going back to 1999. The lowest pace -- 4.98 million -- was in October.
 ''There's little reason to pop open any Champagne corks,'' a real estate analyst at Weiss Research, Michael Larson, said.
 Sales are down 20 percent from November 2006, underscoring the problems plaguing the housing sector. Economists had been predicting that sales would either move up slightly or hold steady for November.
 Home prices continued to sink. The median price of a home sold in November was $210,200. That was a 3.3 percent drop from a year ago. It was the fifth-biggest annual decline on record. The median price is the point at which half sell for more and half sell for less.
 By region of the country, sales were mixed. Existing home sales jumped 10.3 percent in November from October in the West. They were flat in the Midwest. However, they fell 2 percent in the South and 3.3 percent in the Northeast.
 The inventory of unsold homes in November was 4.27 million. At the current sales pace, it would take 10.3 months to deplete that overhang.
 ''Inventory is still high and further reduction in prices may be required in some areas to induce buyers back into the market,'' the association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said.
 A dip in 30-year mortgage rates in November probably helped give nationwide existing-home sales the small lift, the association suggested. Mr. Yun thought the small increase could be taken as a sign that the market might be stabilizing. That said, previous signs of stabilization in 2007 had been dashed.
 The housing market has been suffering through a slump after five years of record-breaking activity from 2001 through 2005. Sales turned weak as did home prices.

HEADLINE: Singapore: Growth Is Slowing, but Is Still Strong

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Singapore's economy expanded 7.5 percent in 2007, at the lower end of the government's forecast range, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. Growth eased from 7.9 percent in 2006 and is expected to slow further to as little as 4.5 percent next year. Mr. Lee, left, warned that the United States economy may enter a recession next year amid financial market turmoil. ''A U.S. downturn would affect Asia too, but the impact on us would be offset somewhat by the strong momentum in the dynamic Asian economies,'' Mr. Lee said. The full-year growth figure suggests that the $132 billion Southeast Asian economy may have contracted in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip, Ending Year Of Turmoil

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Monday, ending a tumultuous year that battered financial firms but left other pockets of the market and the world with stunning gains.
 Even a report that showed sales of existing homes had been nudged up in November failed to lift the market as traders closed their books on a year marred by the running crisis in the mortgage market. A small rally in the afternoon helped cut early losses but was not enough to push the market into positive territory.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the year up 3.5 percent, slightly less than the inflation rate. For the day, the index fell 10.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,468.36 in relatively light trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed up 6.4 percent for the year, ended the day down 101.05 points, or 0.8 percent, at 13,264.82.
 ''It has been a disappointing year,'' concluded Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. ''The debt bubble burst and its ramifications were far wider than most people anticipated.'' 
 It was also a year of stark contrasts. While the broad market struggled under the weight of the credit crisis, which hurt financial firms, home builders and retailers, sectors like technology, energy and materials posted remarkable gains. The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many technology stocks, ended the year up 9.8 percent, its best showing since 2003. Foreign markets, particularly in developing countries, did even better.
 Ultra-safe Treasuries and risky emerging markets both rewarded investors. For the first time since 2002, when the last bear market ended, Treasuries outperformed the S.& P. 500 as investors sought a haven in government debt. Including dividends and interest payments, the S.& P. returned 6.2 percent while a Merrill Lynch index that tracks government-backed debt returned 8.5 percent.
 ''There was a flight to quality,'' said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, an investment firm based in New York.
 Investments that had even a slight taint of risky subprime mortgages were battered. A Merrill Lynch index that tracks floating-rate securities backed by home loans fell 10.9 percent through November, after including interest payments. MBIA, a company that guarantees those debts, fell 74.5 percent for the year.
 Financial stocks tumbled 20.8 percent for the year and shares in the consumer discretionary sector, which includes home builders and retailers, sank 14.3 percent. Other areas of the market rose, but the decline in these two big sectors hurt benchmark indexes. Together the sectors accounted for about one-third of the stock market's valuation at the start of 2007; they account for about one-fourth now.
 As investors bailed out of investments perceived as risky at home, they sought out growth elsewhere. Billions of dollars flowed from the developed world into fast-developing economies in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe. 
 Shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China, were up 179 percent; the Nifty 50 index in India was up 74 percent and the Bovespa index in Brazil was close behind at 73 percent. By contrast, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan ended the year down 5.3 percent.
 ''Typically, you would expect in a flight to safety that investors would flee emerging markets,'' Mr. Peta said. ''That they haven't shows that there is a strong desire to invest in growth.''
 The growth in developing economies also has helped propel the prices of commodities like oil (up 58 percent), wheat (68 percent) and gold (31 percent). And the United States dollar has fallen against many currencies, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.
 Many investors believe that the slower growth of the American economy will not hobble its trading partners in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Their view also reflects a belief that the dollar will continue to sink, making stocks elsewhere more attractive. From the start of 2007 through Dec. 26, investors had put $141 billion into foreign equity funds, compared with just $49 billion in domestic stock funds, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm.
 But some specialists are unsure that developing economies, many of which rely heavily on exports to developed countries, will continue to thrive. Bernard Connolly, the global strategist for Banque A.I.G. in London, said that European countries were also starting to contend with housing and credit problems.
 ''World demand, which has been extremely buoyant for a couple of years, is visibly melting away,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''Sitting here in London, it's very easy to see.''
 Mr. Levkovich of Citigroup said he was also concerned that foreign stock markets might be overvalued. But unlike Mr. Connolly he is more upbeat about the American stock market, at least through the first six months of the new year. In the second half of the year, he worries, corporate profit margins could come under pressure.
 Mr. Levkovich also asserts that most American stocks are not overvalued as they were in 2000 at the height of the tech boom. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500 index, for instance, stands at 18.6, down from 30 in early 2000 but still higher than the long-run average of about 16. The stock market, he said, has punished companies that were most closely tied to the mortgage mess but has been kind to others, a pattern he thinks will continue.
 ''If you were very credit sensitive, you got hammered, and if you were not, you did not,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''Equity markets didn't have the same kind of bubble conditions that the credit markets had.''
 Still, the stock market's fate will be closely tied to the housing and credit markets, specialists say. The economy will be most vulnerable if banks are not willing to lend to businesses and consumers with good credit histories. Without access to capital, businesses will not be able to expand or invest in new products. It would also be hard for consumers to move for new jobs and pay for education and training.
 ''The linchpin for the U.S. is how quickly do the credit markets behave normally,'' said Robert C. Doll, vice chairman at BlackRock, the asset management company.
 In an indication that at least some parts of the market are beginning to unlock, the interest rates banks charge one another to borrow have been falling since the Federal Reserve started lending to banks through a new auction system in mid-December.
 The three-month interbanking lending rate fell to 4.7 percent Monday, from 5.1 percent on Dec. 11. The difference between that rate and the cost at which the federal government borrows also fell over the same period, to 1.5 percentage points on Monday from 2.2 percentage points, though it remains very high relative to historical norms.
 ''It's going to be a challenge getting back to a normalized level,'' Mr. Peta said. But the recent drop ''does say to me that things are improving.''
 Following are the results of Monday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Fund Frozen, Florida Towns Feel the Pinch

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Kirk Semple reported from Port St. Lucie, and Mary Williams Walsh from New York.

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. 

 BODY:
On Nov. 28, Marcia L. Dedert, finance director of this rapidly growing city, called the administrators of Florida's state-run investment pool to ask whether it was still safe to park her city's money there. She was hearing talk of urgent withdrawals by others worried about the pool's investments in debt related to subprime mortgages. 
 After the pool's manager told her the money would be all right, Ms. Dedert recalled, she deposited $135 million in bond proceeds. But less than 24 hours later, the administrators froze the pool and blocked withdrawals to halt a full-blown run.
 Now the city cannot touch the money. And rest of the $371 million it has in the pool is also off-limits unless the city pays a 2 percent penalty. 
 Port St. Lucie is among hundreds of local governments in Florida that were drawn to the pool by its air of reliability and the promise of higher returns than banks offered. They now find themselves grappling with the consequences of having their money frozen. 
 Some have had to borrow money to meet day-to-day obligations. Others have had to shift money around for the time being or consider postponing long-planned projects.
 For Port St. Lucie, the timing of the freeze could not have been worse. The city is trying to recreate itself as a center of the biotech industry and had just issued $155 million worth of bonds to lay roads, water pipes and sewer lines in a planned ''jobs corridor,'' where it hopes to house the companies it is courting from out of state. 
 ''These are projects that we can't afford to stop dead in their tracks,'' Mayor Patricia P. Christensen said. 
 The pool's managers said they had been compelled to freeze the pool to save it. Until the run, it was the largest of more than 100 such pools around the country, with $32 billion in investments. Because of withdrawals, it now has about $14 billion.
 The pool has not suffered any actual losses on its investments in securities tied to subprime mortgages because it has not sold them. While it is unclear how much money, if any, the fund may lose from subprime investments, state officials say they have quarantined over $2 billion in assets from the fund because they no longer meet the pool's investment guidelines or have some other problem. 
 The state has hired an interim investment manager to restore stability to the pool, and Gov. Charlie Crist has called for a review of the pool's operations by outside lawyers.
 The problems rippling out from the investment fund are the latest in a series of economic setbacks for Florida, which is already coping with a weakening housing market and slowing population growth. 
 The economic malaise forced lawmakers in the fall to trim $1.1 billion from the state's $71 billion budget, and economists are predicting that the state might have to cut an additional $2.5 billion over the next 18 months. Given those cutbacks, local officials said they do not expect the state to bail out the investment pool, meaning they are likely to bear the losses. 
 None said they were facing imminent financial collapse. Mercifully, the freeze occurred just as end-of-the-year property tax revenues were starting to come in. But officials in many places said they were still scrambling for alternative sources of cash for the coming months -- and burning with indignation at officials in Tallahassee, the state capital.
 ''I get the impression that they don't see this as the taxpayers' money,'' Mayor Christensen said of the State Board of Administration, which operates the pool, along with Florida's $140 billion pension fund and more than two dozen other big blocks of public money. The three-member board consists of the governor, the treasurer and the attorney general. 
 The chief financial officer of the Leon County school district, Merrill Wimberley, said he was in the hospital recovering from surgery on the day of the freeze and was shocked to emerge and find the district's $46 million out of reach.
 ''I tell you, I felt like Rip Van Winkle,'' Mr. Wimberley said. The school district had to borrow $10 million the same day to pay its 4,600 teachers and other staff members, a costly stopgap.
 ''We don't relish the thought of having to pay $13,000 in interest,'' Mr. Wimberley said.
 Leslie Rocha, who oversees finances for the small town of Oakland, said that with the freeze, her town had to shift money from other sources to cover a bond payment of about $200,000 for a new school. ''It's even a bigger burden since we're so tiny,'' Ms. Rocha said. 
 Hillsborough County left $871 million in the pool, fearing it would worsen the run if it withdrew such a big amount. Its comptroller, Pat Frank, said that the county could tap reserves elsewhere for the time being, but that its budget would go out of balance because the pool had stopped paying interest on the frozen money. 
 Many officials said they believed they could get through the coming months but were bracing for crippling shortfalls should the pool remain frozen well into 2008, as they expected.
 Ms. Dedert, the Port St. Lucie finance director, said that by revising the budget and realigning sources of money and payments, the city would stay ahead of its bills for the next few months. But unless the restrictions on the money in the pool are loosened, she said, the city will run out of cash by summer.
 ''June 1 is when I start crying,'' she said. At that point, she said, the city would be forced to consider borrowing money or paying the 2 percent penalty for withdrawals.
 Many local officials expressed outrage at the penalty. They said they were duty-bound to protect their communities' principal and resented being expected to pay for what they consider inappropriate risk-taking at the state level. 
 ''I can't afford a mistake with the public's money,'' said Monti Larsen, chief operations officer for the Children's Services Council of Broward County, which has $17 million frozen in the fund. 
 This is not the first time the State Board of Administration has had to explain unusual investment losses. After the collapse of Enron in 2002, it came to light that the state pension fund had acquired big blocks of Enron stock just as other investors were dumping it. The fund lost $280 million. 
 Coleman Stipanovich, then the board's deputy executive director, blamed an outside investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management. ''We didn't understand why they were buying it,'' he told a Congressional hearing. ''Even my mother was watching on TV and knew about Enron.'' 
 Now angry depositors are asking much the same questions about Mr. Stipanovich, who was promoted to executive director in 2002 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, and who worked closely with Lehman Brothers, the firm that sold Florida more of the subprime-tainted securities than any other firm.
 Some of the purchases were in July and August, after the risks of subprime-mortgage related securities were widely known and most investors were shunning them. The timing of Florida's purchases was first reported by Bloomberg News Service.
 Mr. Stipanovich resigned on Dec. 4 and has declined to discuss his decisions. 
 Some local officials said in interviews that they were also eager to learn what role Mr. Bush might have played. A month after finishing his second term as governor last January, he formed a consulting firm, which in June was engaged by Lehman Brothers. Mr. Bush also sits on the board of Lehman Brothers's private equity unit. 
 Spokesmen for Mr. Bush and Lehman Brothers said Mr. Bush's consulting work had nothing to do with the sales of the securities to the Florida investment pool.
 The State Board of Administration has begun an investigation of the pool's internal decision-making. The inspectors general of the governor, the treasurer and the attorney general have said they intend to hire outside lawyers and auditors to conduct the investigation. 
 Government investment pools operate much like money-market mutual funds, but they are specifically exempted from the federal laws that cover mutual funds. 
 The last time such a pool made headlines was in 1994, when one in Orange County, Calif., blew up, causing the county to file for bankruptcy. The disaster set off talk of whether the pools should be subject to federal regulation. But the idea faded after state and local officials promised reforms. 
 Now local officials in Florida are again wondering whether self-regulation is adequate, and whether federal oversight might be better.
 Florida is not the only government investment pool to have acquired assets linked to subprime mortgages, but it is the only one to have suffered a run, for reasons unlikely to be clear until the investigation is completed. 
 Nor did Florida's pool officials move swiftly to stem the withdrawals. After the Orange County debacle, some governments imposed restrictions on withdrawals. Arizona, for example, requires five days' notice for withdrawals over $10 million. But Florida did not have any such restrictions. 
 Calls for accountability are particularly loud in Port St. Lucie. 
 City officials are pressing for a federal investigation into the state's handling of the fund and what they regard as deception in the advice they say Ms. Dedert received from Michael Lombardi, the pool's manager, to deposit the $135 million. ''He assured me that it was solid,'' she said.
 Roger Orr, the city attorney, said, ''It's bad faith at best and fraud at worst.'' 
 But Michael McCauley, senior corporate governance officer for the State Board of Administration, said there had been no discussion about freezing withdrawals until an emergency board meeting at midday Nov. 29.
 ''We had no idea it was going to be frozen,'' Mr. McCauley said in a telephone interview. The board members decided to act after a morning of enormous withdrawals.
 ''It was a particularly bad day,'' Mr. McCauley said.

HEADLINE: Despite One Failure, Growth Is Seen in Coachless Flights

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
Maxjet Airways, a pioneer as a discount all-business-class airline, failed Dec. 24. Is the concept that it helped invent two years ago fated to die as well?
 Judging from what the competition is planning, the answer is no. For one thing, the remaining three start-up carriers still flying discount-fare all-business-class routes across the Atlantic -- Eos Airlines, Silverjet, and l'Avion -- are all looking to expand. 
 Meanwhile, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways are planning to experiment with their own all-premium-class discount airlines on trans-Atlantic routes. 
 Much of the attention will be focused on British Airways, which is expected to introduce a ''mini-airline'' on Jan. 9. The discount start-up, developed under the code name Project Lauren, plans to begin service in May, flying a Boeing 757 configured mostly with premium-class seats between a European city (Paris and Brussels are the leading candidates) and New York (either Kennedy International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport).
 People involved with Project Lauren said the name of the new airline is likely to be Open Skies, a nod to a new agreement that takes effect in late March and greatly expands the ability of international airlines to choose new routes between Europe and the United States. 
 But plenty is still up in the air. ''The plane hasn't even been painted yet,'' said a person involved in the planning. ''Everything is still in flux.''
 However British Air's initiative evolves, and whatever the effect of an anticipated entry by Virgin Atlantic in 2008 or early 2009 in the boutique premium market, the remaining players insist they are on solid financial footing, despite surging oil prices and the prospect of an economic downturn this year.
 Part of the reason for optimism at Eos, which like Maxjet began operations in late 2005, is that its average fare -- about $4,000 round trip between New York and London when corporate and advance-purchase discounts are calculated -- generates more revenues than Maxjet did but is still considerably less expensive than its major competitors.
 Given that some corporations will never fly their most valuable business travelers in coach seats on long-haul routes, Eos stands to gain even if travel budgets shrink, said Adam J. Komack, whose title at Eos is ''chief lifestyle officer,'' and whose job it is to market the airline.
 ''We know of at least one large bank that's starting to cut down on air travel,'' he said. ''They've mandated necessary travel only. But they've also mandated that if you have to fly to London, you have to fly on Eos because our fares are better than the network carriers.''
 In contrast to Maxjet, which flew long-range 767s and expanded its trans-Atlantic nonstop routes rapidly beyond New York to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Eos has limited itself so far to flying between Kennedy and London's Stansted Airport, which is more convenient to the City, London's financial district, than Heathrow. 
 Eos also went more squarely after the corporate customer than Maxjet, which offered some of the lowest fares but whose cabins were outfitted with 102 business-class seats that only partially reclined. Eos flies smaller 757s, but they are configured with just 48 seats that fold into flat beds, which are now the business-class quality standard.
 In general, the walk-up fares for a round trip from New York to London on major airlines are $9,000 to $10,000. Some people actually pay that, but big corporations can negotiate discounts of 40 percent or even more based on the amount of business they can guarantee an airline.
 And right now, in a slow period for business travel, airlines are busily discounting. British Air, for example, is offering a business-class fare of about $2,400 between Kennedy or Newark and Heathrow, subject to a 21-day advance purchase and other restrictions. Eos has a winter fare of about $2,900 with similar restrictions.
 American Airlines, meanwhile, has a similarly restricted advance-purchase business-class fare of about $2,300 between Kennedy and Stansted -- a route it began flying in October in direct competition with Maxjet.
 Like British Air, United Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, American is a powerhouse on the popular business-travel route from Kennedy to Heathrow. American also has an industry reputation for aggressive fare pricing against emerging competitors.
 That helped bring about Maxjet's fall, said Lawrence Hunt, the chief executive of Silverjet, another discount all-business-class start-up, which began flying early last year between Newark and London Luton airport. Without a clearly superior product and without American's international networks and its popular loyalty program, Mr. Hunt said, Maxjet was simply unable to compete once American barreled into Stansted with super-low prices.
 ''They really didn't have enough of a product differentiator when American came into Stansted with $1,000 round-trip fares, compared with Maxjet's $1,200,'' Mr. Hunt said. 
 Based at London Luton airport, Silverjet has tried to avoid fallout from the Stansted fray.
 So has l'Avion, a French carrier that began flying between Newark and Paris Orly airport early in 2007. L'Avion recently added flights on that route and said it would acquire a second 757 aircraft this month.
 All of the start-up all-business-class carriers are planning expansions and adding planes. Eos, which now has 44 flights weekly between New York and Stansted, recently took delivery of its fifth and sixth 757s, with two more expected to join the fleet early this year. Eos also said it planned to start routes this year between New York and Paris and between Newark and Stansted, with a third new route planned but not yet announced. 
 British Airways is considering expanding its new discount premium-class airline once the initial route is established, and Virgin Atlantic's founder, Richard Branson, is expected to announce plans soon for that carrier's new boutique service. 
 Lured by new route opportunities between Europe and the United States that will be available under Open Skies, other established airlines are looking at routes that might support a new all-premium discount product. But all of them are moving gingerly, hoping to avoid competing against their established, highly profitable business-class cabins. That leaves an opening for the new airlines.

HEADLINE: Darker 2008 For Detroit's Automakers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The way that auto executives here have been talking, 2008 will be a bad year to sell cars and trucks in the United States. Every time one company predicts how the industry will fare, another seems to come up with an even more dismal number.
 Most forecasts now come in ranging from 15.5 to 15.9 million vehicles, an estimate that would mark the worst year for sales in the United States since at least 1998. 
 Yet several big foreign carmakers, including Toyota and Honda of Japan, are projecting that their sales in the United States will increase in the coming year in spite of the housing slump, high gas prices and lackluster consumer confidence.
 It is shaping up to be another year of declining market share for the ailing Detroit automakers and of profitable growth for their rivals. The soft market will test the Detroit companies' ability to stick with their newfound strategy of trying to make more money from fewer sales.
 The temptation to unfurl sale banners in desolate showrooms might be the greatest for General Motors, which has been in a tight race with Toyota in 2007 to retain its position as the world's largest automaker. G. M. fell behind in the first half of the year but led after nine months; final sales figures will not be known until early January.
 Whatever the result for 2007, analysts expect Toyota to pull ahead by a wide margin in 2008. Toyota said last month that it anticipates global sales will increase 5 percent, to 9.85 million vehicles. G. M. has not released its full-year production goal, but its rate of expansion worldwide has been slower and its United States sales continue to decline.
 ''G. M. has hopefully learned some lessons from the domestic market,'' said Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers. ''Market share is not the bottom line goal; profitability is.''
 Several years ago, falling sales led the Detroit companies to introduce huge ''employee pricing'' sales that quickly cleared dealer lots but significantly hurt profits and, in the longer run, discouraged new car sales because the resale values of their cars plummeted. The companies have insisted that they do not plan to revive that strategy in 2008, no matter how bad the market becomes. But some analysts are not so sure.
 ''If things aren't improving by the second quarter,'' Mr. Toprak said, ''we may see some more creative or aggressive incentive spending.''
 The gloomy outlook for Detroit's automakers has caused investors, many of whom had begun to believe that they were progressing in their turnaround efforts, to shy away from those companies recently. 
 Shares of G. M., the biggest-gaining stock in the Dow Jones industrial average in 2006, have fallen 42 percent since the high point for the year on Oct. 12, and were down 17.85 percent for 2007. Shares of the Ford Motor Company are down 30 percent since their high on July 2, and 11 percent for 2007. Chrysler is a private company. 
 New products, like G. M.'s Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac CTS sedans and the Ford Edge crossover vehicle, have sold exceptionally well, but they are not enough on their own to keep the companies from continuing to lose market share. Ford plans to introduce several important vehicles in 2008 -- a redesigned F-series pickup and the new Flex crossover -- but they will not reach dealers until late in the year.
 Honda has found another hit in the recently revamped Accord sedan, and several new vehicles have helped Toyota overcome some uncharacteristic quality stumbles in the last year.
 The president of American Honda, Tetsuo Iwamura, said during a visit to Detroit in December that he expects the company's United States sales to grow 2.5 percent in 2008. Toyota predicted that sales in the United States would increase 1 percent.
 Meanwhile, G. M., which had a five-month supply of unsold pickup trucks at the end of November, said it is cutting first-quarter production by 11 percent. Ford has announced a 7.4 percent cut in the same period.
 The combined market share of the three Detroit companies fell below 50 percent during two months of 2007, July and November, something that had never happened before. Their production cuts mean the chances of that happening in 2008 are even greater.
 ''I think we're going to have a great year,'' said Terry Baier, general manager of the Oakbrook Toyota dealership in Westmont, Ill. ''I don't think the market is going to hurt us like it's going to hurt the domestics. Right now I have a showroom full of customers, and you don't see that at a Chevy store. We're looking for a phenomenal year.''
 Dean Konner, who owns Konner Chevrolet in West Caldwell, N.J., remains optimistic for 2008 although he said 2007 was ''not good.'' He said G. M.'s new vehicles have been great but that unfortunately they came at a time when the market was weak.
 ''The outlook hopefully will be brighter than this year,'' Mr. Konner said, ''but we need the gas prices to come down.''

HEADLINE: The One Environmental Issue

 BODY:
The overriding environmental issue of these times is the warming of the planet. The Democratic hopefuls in the 2008 campaign are fully engaged, calling for large -- if still unquantified -- national sacrifices and for a transformation in the way the country produces and uses energy. The Republicans do not go much further than conceding that climate change could be a problem and, with the notable exception of John McCain, offer no comprehensive solutions. 
 In 2000, when Al Gore could have made warming a signature issue in his presidential campaign, his advisers persuaded him that it was too complicated and forbidding an issue to sell to ordinary voters. For similar reasons, John Kerry's ambitious ideas for addressing climate change and reducing the country's dependence on foreign oil never advanced much beyond his Web site. 
 Times have certainly changed. It is not yet clear to what extent Americans are willing to grapple with the implications of any serious strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: more specifically, whether they are ready to pay higher prices for energy and change their lifestyles to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels. 
 Polls suggest, however, that voters are increasingly alarmed, and for that Mr. Gore is partly responsible. His film, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' raised the issue's profile. Then came four reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Gore, predicting catastrophic changes in weather patterns, sea levels and food production unless greenhouses gases can be quickly stabilized and then reduced by as much as 80 percent by midcentury.
 There is also a growing appetite for decisive action -- everywhere, it seems, except the White House. Governors in more than two dozen states are fashioning regional agreements to lower greenhouse gases, the federal courts have ordered the executive branch to begin regulating these gases, and the Senate has begun work on a bipartisan bill that would reduce emissions by nearly 65 percent by 2050. 
 Still, the country is a long way from a comprehensive response equal to the challenge. That is what the Democratic candidates are proposing. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, former Senator John Edwards, Gov. Bill Richardson and Representative Dennis Kucinich have all offered aggressive plans that would go beyond the Senate bill and reduce emissions by 80 percent by midcentury (90 percent in Mr. Richardson's case), much as called for in the United Nations reports.
 These plans would rest primarily on a cap-and-trade scheme that imposes a gradually declining ceiling on emissions and allows power plants, refineries and other emitters to figure out the cheapest way to meet their quotas -- either by reducing emissions on their own or by purchasing credits from more efficient producers. The idea is to give companies a clear financial incentive to invest in the new technologies and efficiencies required to create a more carbon-free economy.
 None of the Democrats trust the market to do the job by itself. All would make major investments in cleaner fuels and delivery systems, including coal-fired power plants capable of capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground. Every Democrat except Mr. Kucinich says that carbon-free nuclear power has to be part of the mix, although all are careful to say that safety issues and other concerns must first be resolved. 
 Internationally, the Democrats say they would seek a new global accord on reducing emissions to replace and improve upon the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. Winning agreement among more than 180 nations will be slow-going, so several candidates, including Mrs. Clinton, have suggested jump-starting the process by bringing together the big emitters like China very early in their administrations. China and the United States together produce about 40 percent of the world's total emissions and neither has agreed to binding reductions.
 The only Republican candidate who comes close to the Democrats with a plan for addressing climate change is John McCain, one of the authentic pioneers on the issue in the Senate. In 2003, along with Joseph Lieberman, Mr. McCain introduced the first Senate bill aimed at mandatory economywide reductions in emissions of 65 percent by midcentury. He also regularly addresses the subject on the campaign trail. 
 The other leading Republican candidates -- Mitt Romney, Rudolph Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee -- talk about energy issues almost exclusively in the context of freeing America from its dependence on foreign oil. All promote nuclear power, embrace energy efficiency and promise greener technologies. Only Mr. Huckabee has dared raise the idea of government regulation, embracing, at least theoretically, the idea of a mandatory cap on emissions. The rest prefer President Bush's cost-free and demonstrably inadequate voluntary approach, which essentially asks industry to do what it can to reduce emissions. 
 So far, the Democratic candidates seem more engaged with the issue than some of their interrogators in the news media. In a recent study, the League of Conservation Voters found that as of two weeks ago, the five main political talk-show hosts had collectively asked 2,275 questions of candidates in both parties. Only 24 of the questions even touched on climate change.
 One result is that even the candidates who urge comprehensive change have not been pressed on important questions of cost: How do they intend to pay for all the new efficiencies and technologies that will be necessary? And what kind of sacrifices will they be asking of people who almost certainly will have to pay more for their electric bills and their greener cars?
 Addressing these questions will require more courage of the candidates than simply offering up broad new visions. The voters deserve an honest accounting and the candidates should be prepared to give it.

HEADLINE: In 2007, Some Giants Went Smaller

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Bigger is better, right? 
 Not so fast. Corporate America appears to have had second thoughts in 2007.
 Frank S. Blake, who replaced Robert L. Nardelli as chief executive of Home Depot, sold off the $12 billion division that Mr. Nardelli set up to serve professional builders.
 ''Bob's strategy was, 'Enhance, extend, expand,' go after adjacent markets and adjacent customers,'' Mr. Blake said. ''My vision is that all key investments, be they human resources or money or time, should be focused on the core retail business.''
 When Fred Poses became chief of American Standard Companies in 2000, he inherited a company that had steadily branched out from bath and kitchen fixtures into such disparate areas as air-conditioning and braking systems for vehicles. Last year, he sold the legacy business, spun off the Wabco braking unit, and changed the company's name to Trane, its signature air-conditioning brand. And just last month, he sold Trane to Ingersoll-Rand, which had itself pared down in recent months.
 American Standard ''had three good businesses that didn't have commonality of customers, of the way they went to market, of materials or manufacturing processes or technology,'' Mr. Poses said. ''We realized there just wasn't a lot of value in keeping them together.'' 
 Corporate executives and their Wall Street counterparts are subject to fads, and they have gone through previous periods in which first broadening and then narrowing business portfolios have taken center stage. At the moment, scaling back appears to be enjoying the upper hand.
 Edward D. Breen, who replaced L. Dennis Kozlowski as Tyco International's chief in 2002, spun off Tyco's electronics and health care businesses last year, leaving Tyco with its product roster of safety equipment, valves and controls.
 DaimlerChrysler is again Daimler and Chrysler. Many investors speculate that Time Warner may hive off parts of itself.
 Barry Diller has said that he will break up IAC/InterActiveCorp, his grab bag of Internet companies and services, into five businesses. And many Citigroup investors are clamoring for the company to undo the financial supermarket model that had guided its growth strategy for years. 
 ''There's a huge pressure on chief executives for performance these days,'' said Joseph L. Bower, who specializes in management at the Harvard Business School. ''So when the corporate office starts looking at its portfolio, it often discovers there are pieces that don't fit.''
 This is not the first time that company executives have devoted their energies to getting big, only to find that size does not necessarily equal profit. 
 Throughout the 1960s, companies like ITT and Textron bought up businesses as disparate as hotels, food and machine tools. The prevailing ideas were that a good manager can manage anything, economies of scale would always yield lower costs, and a hodgepodge of businesses was the best hedge against economic cycles. Shareholders believed all that, too, and conglomerate shares soared. 
 Then management consultants and business schools began promulgating the idea of ''core competencies'' -- the notion that companies should focus only on businesses that best fit their skills and distribution channels.
 Shareholders hopped on board and began selling conglomerate stocks, prompting many such companies (General Electric is a notable exception) to shed businesses that were not an obvious fit. 
 Over the last few years, many companies, scrambling for new ways to increase the scale of their core businesses, broadened their definition of core competency. 
 Citigroup was in the money business -- so why not sell products to consumers, businesses and investors alike? Home Depot was already selling to small contractors via its stores, so why not serve mega-builders directly? 
 Mr. Kozlowski, who had built Tyco into a ''three-legged stool'' that rested on fire detectors, medical products and electronic components, added a fourth leg, a financial company, with the idea that offering financing would help the other legs grow.
 Now shareholders have grown disaffected with many of these new conglomerates, too. They again recognize that they can diversify their own portfolios by buying shares of single-focus companies -- or, they can simply invest in mutual funds that are by definition diversified. 
 ''There is a growing sense among investors that portfolio managers do a better job than corporate managers,'' said Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a professor of business leadership at the Columbia Business School. ''So they are asking point-blank, 'Why are you keeping these businesses together?'''
 Corporate chiefs are having a harder time answering that question. Many of the perceived synergies between disparate businesses never really panned out, no matter how good they looked on paper. 
 That is the reasoning behind the growing clamor among Citigroup investors for the financial behemoth to break itself into a consumer bank, an investment bank and a brokerage firm.
 ''Banks that want to be one-stop shops for financial transactions must realize that it takes more than a pat on the back to get stockbrokers to cross-sell loans,'' said Robert H. Gertner, a professor of economics and strategy at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
 Disgruntled investors are more vehement. ''The whole idea of a financial supermarket is ridiculous,'' said William B. Smith, president of SAM Advisors, a money management firm that owns Citigroup shares. ''You can't cross-sell, because the investment bankers won't let brokers court their clients, and individuals don't want their personal bankers ramming a mutual fund down their throat.'' 
 Citigroup officials do not necessarily disagree. ''Cross-selling is always difficult,'' said Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's chief financial officer in an interview, who stressed that he does not know if Vikram S. Pandit, Citi's new chief executive, will dissect the company. 
 But Mr. Crittenden does tick off reasons he thinks the Citigroup structure works. He notes that it provides a flow of capital from mature businesses like domestic credit cards into growing businesses, like the bank Citigroup just bought in Taiwan. And he notes that diversified revenue and income streams lead to a much stronger credit rating. 
 ''There are many compelling reasons why the pieces of this company fit well,'' he said. 
 Such rationales were heard in the last wave of corporate breakups too, of course. The element that has been added this time is the rising influence of private equity firms. While many are somewhat cash-squeezed now, in recent years they have formed a steady stream of buyers for the assets the slimming down companies divest. 
 An alliance of private equity firms paid $8.5 billion for Home Depot Supply, as the company's professional unit was called. It was less than Home Depot had originally expected, but more than it probably could have gotten from a strategic buyer, considering faltering home-building markets and tight credit.
 Bain Capital Partners paid $1.76 billion for American Standard's bath and kitchen business. ''Private equity has created an exit strategy for parts of portfolios that are not attractive to strategic buyers,'' said Mr. Poses, the Trane chief. 
 Moreover, the specter of a deep-pocketed equity firm waiting to pounce can tip management into sloughing off divisions they might otherwise have held. 
 ''If the stock price is lagging, companies may decide to break themselves up before an equity firm comes and does it for them,'' said Professor Bower of Harvard. ''They'd rather the money went to their shareholders than to the partners in the buyout firm.''
 Private equity firms, of course, no longer simply buy up companies, cut costs, and flip them back to the public markets. Many private firms now buy along a theme: They snap up assets, roll them up into huge companies -- think Wilbur L. Ross and his steel, coal and textiles companies -- that they manage for years before they take them public.
 ''There's been a real migration from the old private equity firm that was managed by the numbers,'' Professor Harrigan said. ''Today's private equity companies are the new conglomerates.'' 
 If true, they may face some challenges of their own. Management experts, and a growing number of chief executives themselves, are conceding that even the smartest people become distracted if they are pulled in too many directions at once. 
 The main reason Mr. Blake decided to sell Home Depot Supply was that he wanted to tinker with product mixes, expand to new markets, and experiment with new store formats. In other words, he wanted to concentrate on the stores. 
 ''It was a question of focus,'' he said. ''Supply would have diverted too much attention and resources that had to go to retail.''

HEADLINE: Road To Nowhere

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The most impressive thing about Mitt Romney is his clarity of mind. When he set out to pursue his party's nomination, he studied the contours of the Republican coalition and molded himself to its forms.
 Earnestly and methodically, he has appealed to each of the major constituency groups. For national security conservatives, he vowed to double the size of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. For social conservatives, he embraced a culture war against the faithless. For immigration skeptics, he swung so far right he earned the endorsement of Tom Tancredo. 
 He has spent roughly $80 million, including an estimated $17 million of his own money, hiring consultants, blanketing the airwaves and building an organization that is unmatched on the Republican side. 
 And he has turned himself into the party's fusion candidate. Some of his rivals are stronger among social conservatives. Others are stronger among security conservatives, but no candidate has a foot in all camps the way Romney does. No candidate offends so few, or is the acceptable choice of so many.
 And that is why Romney is at the fulcrum of the Republican race. He's looking strong in Iowa and is the only candidate who can afford to lose an important state and still win the nomination.
 And yet as any true conservative can tell you, the sort of rational planning Mitt Romney embodies never works. The world is too complicated and human reason too limited. The PowerPoint mentality always fails to anticipate something. It always yields unintended consequences.
 And what Romney failed to anticipate is this: In turning himself into an old-fashioned, orthodox Republican, he has made himself unelectable in the fall. When you look inside his numbers, you see tremendous weaknesses.
 For example, Romney is astoundingly unpopular among young voters. Last month, the Harris Poll asked Republicans under 30 whom they supported. Romney came in fifth, behind Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, John McCain and Ron Paul. Romney had 7 percent support, a virtual tie with Tancredo. He does only a bit better among those aged 30 to 42.
 Romney is also quite unpopular among middle- and lower-middle class voters. In poll after poll, he leads among Republicans making more than $75,000 a year. He does poorly among those who make less. 
 If Romney is the general election candidate, he will face hostility from independent voters, who value authenticity. He will face hostility from Hispanic voters, who detest his new immigration positions. He will face great hostility in the media. Even conservative editorialists at places like The Union Leader in New Hampshire and The Boston Herald find his flip-flopping offensive.
 But his biggest problem is a failure of imagination. Market research is a snapshot of the past. With his data-set mentality, Romney has chosen to model himself on a version of Republicanism that is receding into memory. As Walter Mondale was the last gasp of the fading New Deal coalition, Romney has turned himself into the last gasp of the Reagan coalition. 
 That coalition had its day, but it is shrinking now. The Republican Party is more unpopular than at any point in the past 40 years. Democrats have a 50 to 36 party identification advantage, the widest in a generation. The general public prefers Democratic approaches on health care, corruption, the economy and Iraq by double-digit margins. Republicans' losses have come across the board, but the G.O.P. has been hemorrhaging support among independent voters. Surveys from the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post, Kaiser Foundation and Harvard University show that independents are moving away from the G.O.P. on social issues, globalization and the roles of religion and government.
 If any Republican candidate is going to win this year, he will have to offer a new brand of Republicanism. But Romney has tied himself to the old brand. He is unresponsive to the middle-class anxiety that Huckabee is tapping into. He has forsaken the trans-partisan candor that McCain represents. Romney, the cautious consultant, is pivoting to stress his corporate competence, and is rebranding himself as an Obama-esque change agent, but he will never make the sort of daring break that independent voters will demand if they are going to give the G.O.P. another look.
 The leaders of the Republican coalition know Romney will lose. But some would rather remain in control of a party that loses than lose control of a party that wins. Others haven't yet suffered the agony of defeat, and so are not yet emotionally ready for the trauma of transformation. Others still simply don't know which way to turn. 
 And so the burden of change will be thrust on primary voters over the next few weeks. Romney is a decent man with some good fiscal and economic policies. But in this race, he has run like a manager, not an entrepreneur. His triumph this month would mean a Democratic victory in November.

HEADLINE: Putting a Plague in Perspective

BYLINE: By DANIEL HALPERIN. 
Daniel Halperin is a senior research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 ALTHOUGH the United Nations recently lowered its global H.I.V. estimates, as many as 33 million people worldwide are still living with the AIDS virus. This pandemic requires continued attention; preventing further deaths and orphans remains imperative. But the well-meaning promises of some presidential candidates to outdo even President Bush's proposal to nearly double American foreign assistance to fight AIDS strike me, an H.I.V.-AIDS specialist for 15 years, as missing the mark.
 Some have criticized Mr. Bush for requesting ''only'' $30 billion for the next five years for AIDS and related problems, with the leading Democratic candidates having pledged to commit at least $50 billion if they are elected. Yet even the current $15 billion in spending represents an unprecedented amount of money aimed mainly at a single disease. 
 Meanwhile, many other public health needs in developing countries are being ignored. The fact is, spending $50 billion or more on foreign health assistance does make sense, but only if it is not limited to H.I.V.-AIDS programs.
 Last year, for instance, as the United States spent almost $3 billion on AIDS programs in Africa, it invested only about $30 million in traditional safe-water projects. This nearly 100-to-1 imbalance is disastrously inequitable -- especially considering that in Africa H.I.V. tends to be most prevalent in the relatively wealthiest and most developed countries. Most African nations have stable adult H.I.V. rates of 3 percent or less.
 Many millions of African children and adults die of malnutrition, pneumonia, motor vehicle accidents and other largely preventable, if not headline-grabbing, conditions. One-fifth of all global deaths from diarrhea occur in just three African countries -- Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria -- that have relatively low H.I.V. prevalence. Yet this condition, which is not particularly difficult to cure or prevent, gets scant attention from the donors that invest nearly $1 billion annually on AIDS programs in those countries. 
 I was struck by this discrepancy between Western donors' priorities and the real needs of Africans last month, during my most recent trip to Africa. In Senegal, H.I.V. rates remain under 1 percent in adults, partly due to that country's early adoption of enlightened policies toward prostitution and other risky practices, in addition to universal male circumcision, which limits the heterosexual spread of H.I.V. Rates of tuberculosis, now another favored disease of international donors, are also relatively low in Senegal, and I learned that even malaria, the donors' third major concern, is not quite as rampant as was assumed, with new testing finding that many fevers aren't actually caused by the disease.
 Meanwhile, the stench of sewage permeates the crowded outskirts of Dakar, Senegal's capital. There, as in many other parts of West Africa and the developing world, inadequate access to safe water results in devastating diarrheal diseases. Shortages of food and basic health services like vaccinations, prenatal care and family planning contribute to large family size and high child and maternal mortality. Major donors like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have not directly addressed such basic health issues. The Global Fund's director, Michel Kazatchkine, has acknowledged, ''We are not a global fund that funds local health.'' 
 Botswana, which has the world's most lucrative diamond industry and is the second-wealthiest country per capita in sub-Saharan Africa, is nowhere near as burdened as Senegal with basic public health problems. But as one of a dozen Pepfar ''focus'' countries in Africa, this year it will receive about $300 million to fight AIDS -- in addition to the hundreds of millions already granted by drug companies, private foundations and other donors. While in that sparsely populated country last month, I learned that much of its AIDS money remains unspent, as even its state-of-the-art H.I.V. clinics cannot absorb such a large influx of cash.
 As the United States Agency for International Development's H.I.V. prevention adviser in southern Africa in 2005 and 2006, I visited villages in poor countries like Lesotho, where clinics could not afford to stock basic medicines but often maintained an inventory of expensive AIDS drugs and sophisticated monitoring equipment for their H.I.V. patients. H.I.V.-infected children are offered exemplary treatment, while children suffering from much simpler-to-treat diseases are left untreated, sometimes to die. 
 In Africa, there's another crisis exacerbated by the rigid focus on AIDS: the best health practitioners have abandoned lower-paying positions in family planning, immunization and other basic health areas in order to work for donor-financed H.I.V. programs. 
 The AIDS experience has demonstrated that poor countries can make complex treatments accessible to many people. Regimens that are much simpler to administer than anti-retroviral drugs -- like antibiotics for respiratory illnesses, oral rehydration for diarrhea, immunizations and contraception -- could also be made widely available. But as there isn't a ''global fund'' for safe water, child survival and family planning, countries like Senegal -- and even poorer ones -- cannot directly tackle their real problems without pegging them to the big three diseases. 
 To their credit, some AIDS advocates are calling for a broader approach to international health programs. Among the presidential candidates, Senator Barack Obama, for example, proposes to go beyond spending for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, highlighting the need to also strengthen basic health systems. And recently, Mr. Bush's plan, along with the Global Fund, has become somewhat more flexible in supporting other health issues linked to H.I.V. -- though this will be of little use to people, especially outside the ''focus'' countries, who are dying of common illnesses like diarrhea.
 But it is also important, especially for the United States, the world's largest donor, to re-examine the epidemiological and moral foundations of its global health priorities. With 10 million children and a half million mothers in developing countries dying annually of largely preventable conditions, should we mutiply AIDS spending while giving only a pittance for initiatives like safe-water projects? 
 If one were to ask the people of virtually any African village (outside some 10 countries devastated by AIDS) what their greatest concerns are, the answer would undoubtedly be the less sensational but more ubiquitous ravages of hunger, dirty water and environmental devastation. The real-world needs of Africans struggling to survive should not continue to be subsumed by the favorite causes du jour of well-meaning yet often uninformed Western donors.

HEADLINE: When Societies Fall

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Question of Blame When Societies Fall'' (Dec. 25): The conference designed to discredit Jared Diamond highlights the worst of what goes on in contemporary academia. The organizers' failure to invite Mr. Diamond might be attributed to elementary rudeness were it not for a more damning explanation: they were afraid he would give the lie to their glib accusation that because his work is widely read, it must be oversimplified. These anthropologists' beef with Mr. Diamond clearly has less to do with the content of his thesis than with the fact that he tries to understand why things happen rather than writing a morality play conforming to their lefter-than-thou politics. 
Steven Pinker Cambridge, Mass.
 To the Editor:
 What an odd, convoluted perspective displayed by those anthropologists who attack Jared Diamond's ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' for ''excusing the excesses of the conquerors.'' The book attempts to account for why, after around 3000 B.C., western Eurasian societies became comparatively more economically, militarily and technologically advanced. It does not claim that they were also more ethically or morally advanced. Moreover, to take just one famous example, the Aztecs were engaging in ''excesses'' as conquerors before any European sails appeared on the horizon.
 Russ Weiss Princeton, N.J.
 To the Editor:
 The words of the historians Will and Ariel Durant might offer consolation to Jared Diamond and the anthropologists who disagree with his theories. In ''The Lessons of History,'' the Durants write: ''History is so indifferently rich that a case for almost any conclusion from it can be made by a selection of instances.''

HEADLINE: India's Exports Surge Before an Expected Slowdown

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
India's exports of manufactured goods, including gems and fuel products, rose in November as companies completed orders and hedged to cope with the rupee's appreciation. 
 Shipments rose 27 percent to $12.4 billion from a year earlier, slower than a 35.7 percent gain in October, the commerce ministry said. Imports increased 29.3 percent to $19.8 billion, widening the trade deficit to $7.4 billion from $5.5 billion a year earlier.
 The gain in the rupee against the United States dollar is eroding the value of exports, which make up about 15 percent of India's economy. Exports are likely to moderate this fiscal year after the rupee gained 12.3 percent in 2007.
 ''In volume terms, exports are showing growth as companies may be filling old orders,'' said N. R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the Institute of Economic Growth, a policy research group in New Delhi. ''The trend going forward is of moderation in exports for the whole year.''
 Exports grew an average 21.8 percent in the eight months through November, slower than the 23.5 percent pace in the same period a year earlier. 
 Imports rose 27 percent to $151 billion in the period, widening the trade deficit to $52.8 billion from $38.5 billion a year earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomat and Driver Are Shot Dead in Sudan

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Izzadine Abdul Rasoul Muhammad contributed reporting from Khartoum, Sudan, and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
An American diplomat in Sudan and his driver were shot to death early Tuesday as they were coming home from a New Year's Eve party in Khartoum, the capital. 
 In Washington, the Agency for International Development identified the diplomat as one of its officials, John Granville, 33, originally of Buffalo. American officials said it was ''too early to tell'' if the shooting had been random or planned, but Sudanese officials said the circumstances were suspicious, especially because gun crime is rare in Khartoum, considered one of the safest cities in Africa. 
 The United Nations had recently warned its staff in Sudan that there was credible evidence that a terrorist cell was in the country and planning to attack foreigners. 
 According to Western officials, Mr. Granville left a New Year's Eve party at the British Embassy around 2:30 a.m. and was being driven to his home in an upscale neighborhood in central Khartoum. Shortly before he arrived, a car pulled up next to him and 17 shots were fired, Sudanese officials said. 
 Mr. Granville's driver, a Sudanese employee of the American Embassy, was killed instantly, and Mr. Granville was shot in the neck and chest. He was taken to the hospital and died several hours later. 
 The Sudanese Interior Ministry identified the driver as Abdel Rahman Abbas, 40.
 A Sudanese government official said that the attack appeared well planned. The assailants' car sped in front of the diplomat's car, cutting it off. Two gunmen got out of their car, with one of them shooting Mr. Granville and the other shooting the driver, the official said.
 Walter Braunohler, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Khartoum, said he could not comment on the circumstances because the shooting was under investigation.
 A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said American and Sudanese law enforcement agents were working closely together to investigate.
 ''We do not know why this happened,'' said Ali Sadiq, the spokesman. ''All options are possible.''
 The attack came just hours after President Bush signed a bill that makes it easier for mutual funds and other investment managers to sell stakes in companies that do business in Sudan. The bill is aimed at Sudan's oil and defense industries, in particular, and is part of the broader campaign to put pressure on the Sudanese government to end the bloodshed in Darfur, a troubled region in western Sudan where more than 200,000 people have died.
 The United States has urged the Sudanese government to cooperate better with the peacekeeping mission in Darfur. On Monday, formal authority was transferred from the current African Union force to a joint United Nations-African Union mission.
 Mr. Granville had served the Agency for International Development in Sudan as well as Nairobi. A photo on the agency's Web site shows Mr. Granville standing amid a crowd of African women, each holding a radio distributed by the agency.
 Mr. Granville had been deeply involved in a project to distribute 450,000 radios equipped with generator cranks and solar panels, which work in places with no electricity.
 The goal was to prepare southern Sudan for elections in 2009 and a possible referendum in 2011 on independence, according to Shari K. Bryan, who is a senior associate and regional director for East and Southern Africa at the National Democratic Institute, a nonprofit, pro-democracy group based in Washington.
 Sean McCabe, who is married to Mr. Granville's only sibling, Katie McCabe, said Mr. Granville had been in Africa for about 10 years, since his graduation from Clark University in Worcester, Mass. The Peace Corps sent Mr. Granville to Cameroon for two years in the mid-1990s, Mr. McCabe said, and Mr. Granville also won a Fulbright scholarship for study in Africa.
 ''He'd come home and visit and spend time with his mother and his sister, and then he'd go back there and work,'' said Mr. McCabe, reached by telephone at the home of Mr. Granville's mother, Jane Granville, in the Buffalo suburb of Angola, N.Y. 
 ''That was his life,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''He loved it.'' 
 On Tuesday night, the American Embassy sent out an e-mail message to Americans in Sudan notifying them about the attack on the diplomat.
 ''Terrorist groups continue to seek opportunities to carry out attacks against U.S. interests,'' the message said, repeating earlier warnings. ''U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public places.''

HEADLINE: St. Paul Stops a Waterfront Developer From Crossing the Mississippi

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
As manufacturing declined across the country, cities from Baltimore to San Francisco have reclaimed waterfronts for recreation and development. But here along the Mississippi River, an unusual situation has emerged. 
 A well-known local developer, proposing the largest project in St. Paul's history, has been prevented by the city itself, with the support of some pro-development forces, from building an upscale mixed-use community directly across the river from the downtown. 
 Four years after Jerry Trooien, chairman of JLT Group, unveiled plans for the Bridges of St. Paul, the City Council -- with support from the St. Paul Riverfront Development Corporation, the city's planning commission and a new mayor -- voted 5 to 2 in September not to change zoning that limits height and density on the riverfront. 
 Declining to develop one of the few low-lying parcels of land along this part of the Mississippi, which otherwise has limited public access, remains a highly contested decision. And in an era when large-scale developments have emerged across the country -- along waterfronts and off -- this is a tale of what can go wrong when competing visions collide and market forces tip the balance away from development. 
 ''We started with the previous mayor, and we were in agreement on this,'' Mr. Trooien said in an interview conducted on the top floor of his office building that overlooks the proposed site, which sits between two major spans over the Mississippi on the more residential south side of the river, opposite downtown. ''We've done everything we can, but the squishy liberals think small-scale is morally superior.''
 What is to become of the $1.5 billion 33-acre mixed-use development plan remains unclear. As it was proposed, the Bridges would have created a retail destination covering 350,000 to 450,000 square feet; a Westin, the city's first new full-service hotel in decades; and more than 1,000 housing units, as well as a riverfront promenade, a marina and a public attraction called Mythica, a kind of theme park devoted to exploring the myths of cultures from around the world.
 The failure of the project was not for a lack of trying. Mr. Trooien waged a marketing campaign, including weekly full-page newspaper advertisements, lasting years and said he had spent nearly $20 million on planning and creating models of the proposed developments. ''I've spent $2 million worth on hotel drawings alone,'' Mr. Trooien said. 
 But many people here say the real problem was not Mr. Trooien's marketing of the Bridges but the plan itself. He failed to acknowledge, critics say, that community leaders long ago decided that the riverfront should not compete with downtown for large-scale development or retailing nor block views of the river. 
 Mayor Chris Coleman was the councilman representing this part of St. Paul 10 years ago when the city undertook a three-year planning process to formulate principles that would guide development. The guidelines envisioned a lower-density midrise development on the south side of the Mississippi, so the expansive views of the river and of distant residential neighborhoods would not be blocked. 
 The planning effort resulted in the formation of the St. Paul Riverfront Development Corporation, a private nonprofit agency that oversees the use of the framework. ''We created a 'development' framework, not a 'stop development' framework,'' said Patrick Seeb, executive director of the development corporation. ''But there are rules that a lot of people were involved in creating, that the community bought into, including developers who don't want to see downtown jump the river.'' 
 Jumping the river with a large-scale project was not the only point of contention. Because downtown St. Paul sits on a bluff and the development site is in a flood plain (in fact, the bridges that span the river slope downward), the Bridges proposal called for a large parking deck to raise the grade level.
 Mr. Trooien and his master planner, Roland Aberg of Hart Howerton, a San Francisco-based architecture and planning firm, envisioned raising the development 20 feet above current ground level. They argue that this did not so much block views as ''frame'' the river.
 But others saw it as compromising a distinctive aspect of St. Paul: the grassy vistas from downtown. What's more, entering the site -- which could be done only by car, as there is no mass transit -- would require ascending a steep incline. 
 ''By building a parking deck and creating this faux urbanism up in the air on the wrong side of the river from where all the infrastructure is, it made every mistake that we've come to learn over the last 30 years,'' said Thomas Fisher, dean of the College of Design at the University of Minnesota. ''It doesn't connect to existing streets or the rest of the fabric of the city.'' Objections to the project focused not only on the size, he said, but also on its placement. ''This would work fine on the other side of the river,'' he said. 
 Meanwhile, the economics of the project caused concern among City Council members. Not only was Mr. Trooien asking for substantial tax deferments, but the entire project was to be built all at the same time, raising concerns about whether a city with a population of 300,000 could absorb it at once.
 Still, Mr. Aberg and Mr. Trooien maintain that it could not easily have been phased in, and that the economics of a smaller scale project just do not work on the site. Although supported by the building trades unions and the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, the project was doomed, according to Tim Murnane, senior vice president of Opus, a national real estate development company headquartered in Minneapolis. ''Here was situation where the vision of the city and the vision that Jerry had were different, and you add in other market conditions and it was going to fail,'' Mr. Murnane said. ''The city might have done Jerry a favor.''

HEADLINE: Humans Divided as Wolves Rebound in a Changing West

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo. 

 BODY:
Sheltered for many years by federal species protection law, the gray wolves of the West are about to step out onto the high wire of life in the real world, when their status as endangered animals formally comes to an end early this year.
 The so-called delisting is scheduled to begin in late March, almost five years later than federal wildlife managers first proposed, mainly because of human tussles here in Wyoming over the politics of managing the wolves. 
 Now changes during that time are likely to make the transition even more complicated. As the federal government and the State of Wyoming sparred in court over whether Wyoming's hard-edged management plan was really a recipe for wolf eradication, as some critics said, the wolf population soared. (The reworked plan was approved by the federal government in November.) 
 During that period, many parts of the human West were changing, too. Where unsentimental rancher attitudes -- that wolves were unwelcome predators, threatening the cattle economy -- once prevailed, thousands of newcomers have moved in, buying up homesteads as rural retreats, especially near Yellowstone National Park, where the wolves began their recovery in 1995 and from which they have spread far and wide. 
 The result is that there are far more wolves to manage today than there once would have been five years ago -- which could mean, biologist say, more killing of wolves just to keep the population in check. And that blood-letting might not be quite as popular as it once was.
 ''If they'd delisted when the numbers were smaller, the states would have been seen as heroes and good managers,'' said Ed Bangs, the wolf recovery coordinator at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. ''Now people will say they're murderers.''
 Wolves are intelligent, adaptable, highly mobile in staking out new territory, and capable of rapid reproduction rates if food sources are good and humans with rifles or poison are kept in check by government gridlock -- and that is precisely what happened.
 From the 41 animals that were released inside Yellowstone from 1995 to 1997, mostly from Canada, the population grew to 650 wolves in 2002 and more than 1,500 today in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The wolves have spread across an area twice the size of New York State and are growing at a rate of about 24 percent a year, according to federal wolf-counts. 
 Human head counts have also climbed in the same turf. From 1995 to 2005, a 25-county area, in three states, that centers on Yellowstone grew by 12 percent, to about 691,000 people, according to a report earlier this year by the Center for the Rocky Mountain West at the University of Montana. That compares to a 6 percent growth rate for Wyoming as a whole in that period, 7.5 percent for all of Montana, and 19 percent for Idaho. The wolf population has grown faster in Idaho than any place else in the region, doubling to about 800 in the past four years.
 The director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Terry Cleveland, said changes in economics and attitude were creating a profound wrinkle in the outlook for human-wolf relations. Mr. Cleveland, a 39-year-veteran with the department, said that many newcomers, who are more interested in breath-taking vistas than the price of feed-grain and calves, do not see wolves the way older residents do. 
 In the public comment period for Wyoming's wolf plan, sizable majorities of residents in the counties near Yellowstone expressed opposition. Teton County, around Jackson Hole, led the way, with more than 95 percent of negative comment about the plan, according an analysis by the state. Many respondents feared that the plan would lead to more killing of wolves than necessary. 
 ''It used to be, 'Yeah, we live near wild animals,' now it's like, 'Gosh, we need to manage them, and it's the job of the state to do that,' '' said Meg Daly, a writer in Jackson, who submitted a comment opposing the wolf plan and recently spoke to a reporter by telephone. Ms. Daly said she had lived in Wyoming as a child and moved back last year.
 Many new land owners around Yellowstone have also barred the hunting of animals like elk on their property, sometimes, in a single pen stroke, closing off thousands of acres that Wyoming hunters had used for decades. Mr. Cleveland said he expected that those same ''no trespassing'' signs would be up and in force, creating de facto wolf sanctuaries, when wolf hunters or state wildlife managers started coming around this year. But the trend of land enclosure, Mr. Cleveland said, is probably not in the wolf's long-term interest.
 ''As large ranches become less economically viable, the alternative is 40-acre subdivisions,'' he said, ''and that is not compatible with any kind of wildlife.''
 Some advocates of wolf protection say that for all the talk of moderation and the nods to a changing ethos, old attitudes will take over once the gray wolf is delisted.
 ''I think it's going to be open season,'' said Suzanne Stone, a wolf specialist at Defenders of Wildlife, a national conservation group.
 Ms. Stone said she thought the changes that led to federal approval of Wyoming's wolf plan were mostly cosmetic.
 Ms. Stone and others are concerned that the plan grants Wyoming something that no other state in the Yellowstone region received: the right to kill wolves at any time by any means across most of the state.
 In the northwest corner near Yellowstone and in Idaho and Montana, wolves will be classified as trophy game animals and may be killed only in strictly controlled numbers by licensed hunters. In the 80 percent of Wyoming outside the Yellowstone area, however, wolves will be labeled predators, with no limits and no permits required to kill them. 
 The state has pledged to maintain at least 15 breeding pairs, or about 150 animals, in a five-county region around the park. The state now has about 362 wolves, according to the most recent estimates in late September.
 That formulation sounds just about right to Chip Clouse.
 ''I support no wolves on private land, and right now we have wolves running rampant,'' said Mr. Clouse, a rancher and a former outfitter in Cody, just east of Yellowstone, who has lived in Wyoming for 37 years. ''They brought the wolves in for people to see on the public lands, in the park, and what has happened is that they have grown so many packs that they're now impeding on people who are just trying to live and make a living on their own property.'' 
 Joel DiPaola, a chef at a Jackson ski resort who arrived in Wyoming from Connecticut in the early 1990s, just before the wolves, said he thought much of the huffing and puffing about the animals was emotional and would make little difference. 
 ''As the state was dragging its feet, the wolves were breeding and expanding,'' Mr. DiPaola said. ''It's now going to be almost impossible to get rid of them even if they try. Once they seem to get a foothold and have a refuge in the parks, they're here.''

HEADLINE: In Winds Of Winter, Midair Park Takes Shape

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The sleek, computer-driven architectural previews of New York's first midair park, the High Line, depict pedestrians navigating a public promenade that is on track to be celebrated next fall. Like space-age schematics, they offer a futuristic refuge: a pristine ribbon of green providing exquisite views of Manhattan. 
 But the High Line has been something quite different, a flaking, rusting industrial ruin that needed to be transformed to match the digital renderings. And someone has been doing all that work. So right now the High Line is one hairy construction site. 
 The defunct elevated railway -- which stretches from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street on the Far West Side -- is a secret world these days, barred to the meatpacking district crowds that mob the new Apple Store and swarm to a high-end shopping festival in a once-scruffy quarter that real estate advertisements now call ''the prestigious High Line District.'' 
 Fifty hard hats in safety orange -- including ironworkers, carpenters, painters and garden-variety laborers -- perform a fast-tracked logistical ballet 30 feet up on the line, as steel and concrete are delivered just in time to be grappled into place. 
 Bridges freeze before roadways, of course, and thus it is on the High Line, which shimmers with icicles at times while vibrating with hard winds from the Hudson. Safety railings sing in the gales, and it is not uncommon for snow and sleet to blow upward, swirling in updrafts shaped by the patchwork of low-rise buildings underneath. 
 Not unlike the hardy wildflowers, shrubs and even apple trees that adapted to the lost world of the track bed, workers have already embraced the onset of winter. 
 ''The cold is great -- bring it on,'' said John Forbes, 43, an ironworker. ''We really don't mind cold. It's heat that's the killer.'' He referred to the summer's labor on the unshaded railway radiating hotly from its 8-inch-thick concrete slab.
 Of course, high wind -- as on a recent afternoon punctuated with chilly gusts of 40 miles an hour -- forces managers to shut down the construction cranes. A freeze curtails the concrete pours and painting forays, while ice and snow divert topside workers to their shovels before they can scurry to tasks on the line's dry undersurface. 
 The project that has been promoted as the new Central Park for downtown is, currently, a mile-long obstacle course. The rail bed threads its way not only through High Line construction but also 10 other developments, including a new tunnel through the Standard Hotel at Washington and Little West 12th Streets. 
 ''It's very, very tight up here,'' said Mike Balbo, 27, back on the High Line. He was behind the wheel of a 9-ton payloader ferrying job debris. ''Just fitting this on the road is hard.'' 
 Bob Marriott, general superintendent for Kiska Construction Corporation, the general contractor, said, ''We've been trying to complete our repairs and our painting without massively disrupting the businesses and tenants below.'' 
 Save for a parcel near Gansevoort Street, the city owns none of the real estate underneath the High Line aside from streets and sidewalks. ''You do not want to drop things from on high,'' said Gerard Zimmermann, 40, a chief inspector for Kiska. 
 The roadbed's elevation is nothing, of course, to workers accustomed to dancing on high steel. ''For me this is pretty easy,'' said Mr. Zimmermann, who has walked atop the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges. 
 Nevertheless, the airborne landscape poses safety issues and other, more personal constraints. For example, since sanitation contractors do not deign to scale 30-foot heights, the workers must descend from the line ''because companies will only clean portable bathrooms downstairs on the street level,'' said Garrett Scalza, 30, who was supervising a group of carpenters near Gansevoort Street. 
 And since the High Line extends through residential areas, ''We can't make noise early or late, or work on the weekends,'' Mr. Zimmermann said. 
 Given their total exposure, High Line workers are especially vulnerable from on high. ''It's pretty safe up here except when there's construction above us,'' said Sathar Ansari, 32, a site safety manager. ''Other contractors, by accident, have dropped plywood and other debris, but luckily no one was hurt.'' 
 Despite extreme heat and fierce cold, so far workers have experienced only minor injuries, save for one carpenter who tripped and fell three feet and lost five days of work. 
 Near Gansevoort Street, laborers are already installing the concrete planking surface destined to be a walkway for visitors. Cast in Quebec and weighing 600 to 800 pounds, the planks -- some 7,600 of them -- are hefted by forklifts ''and then we muscle them into place with crowbars,'' said Emilio Arostegui, 40, who leads a labor crew. They are jigsaw puzzle pieces of a structural system of pedestrian promenades that extend like concrete fingers into the planting beds that will restore the park greenery using 6,300 cubic yards of soil.
 Workers up on the line are laboring to complete the first, $71 million phase of the $170 million High Line construction, a section from Gansevoort Street up to 20th Street.
 ''Next fall's opening is breathing down our neck,'' said Peter Mullan, director of planning for Friends of the High Line, a nonprofit group that helped block attempts to demolish the viaduct and helped design its renovation. 
 The structure is owned by the city south of 30th Street under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Friends of the High Line. The city's Economic Development Corporation is overseeing construction on the site along with the mayor's office and the Department of City Planning. 
 The remainder of the city-owned roadbed is scheduled to become a park by 2009. Another half-mile section rings the railyards north of 30th Street and 12th Avenue, and five bidders are competing to develop the property; only three want to preserve that part of the High Line. 
 ''There has never been another project like it, there is no model, and it involves a tangle of jurisdictions,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. He said he designated the High Line the first project in his new Office of Capital Project Development to spearhead construction ''on an extremely accelerated schedule requiring precise coordination among multiple city agencies.'' 
 He added, ''It is on budget and essentially on time.'' 
 Enemies of the High Line once claimed that the corridor, built from 1928 to 1934, was disintegrating in a rain of concrete. But despite its appearance, engineers have found it to be mostly well preserved and massively strong, ''built to support locomotives, designed for 10 times the load it will carry as a park,'' said Michael Bradley, the High Line's project planning administrator for the parks department. 
 Already, workers have ripped out the High Line's original roadbed down to the concrete slab, removing gravel, tracks, ties, soil and the urban wilderness of vegetation that had seeded itself there. This was mandatory, Mr. Mullan said, since toxic chemical contaminants had leaked from the freight trains, the last of which bowled through with a load of frozen turkeys in 1980. 
 Flaking old lead paint on the structure has been sandblasted down to the steel and is being covered with 18,000 gallons of paint. And workers are conserving the rail line's Art Decoish configurations of bolted steel plates that have been termed ''industrial folk art.'' 
 ''We are changing out steel beams, preparing the structure to carry a park instead of freight trains,'' said Tom Ryan, 41, an ironworker who leads a restoration crew. ''There are a million rivets on the High Line, and I've only replaced 10,000,'' he said, deadpan. 
 The original freight rails -- which had been temporarily relocated to the northerly reaches of the trestle -- are now being reinstalled to the south as design elements only. Workers have just put in the first rail junction, called a frog ''because that's what a frog looks like after it's been run over by a locomotive,'' Mr. Ryan said. 
 By their industrious presence, the workers have relocated the pigeons that once found their earthly paradise at the underside of the trestle, producing decades of D'oh! dry cleaning moments for unlucky pedestrians. 
 ''Pigeons know to stay away from people in hard hats,'' said Mike Forbes, 35, an on-site construction draftsman. 
 Mr. Zimmermann added, ''I think they headed to the nearest park.''
 Since acidic pigeon waste corrodes the steelwork, laborers have been installing permanent, harmless anti-pigeon shields -- angled plates welded atop girders -- as well as strategically stretched flexible steel wires to deter birds' happy landings.
 ''The thing is, the pigeons keep coming back,'' said Mr. Marriott, adding that birds have already made modifications to the High Line not envisioned by the designers, Field Operations and Diller Scofidio & Renfro of Manhattan. ''They've created new nests in the temporary pigeon netting that was installed'' as a prelude to the permanent pigeon shields, he said. 
 On the line, there is a perpetual incongruity between the grit above and the glitz below. As winds scoured the High Line tunnel through the Chelsea Market on a recent afternoon, Fernando Espino, 36, was shoveling construction debris on the concrete slab above the roof of the Morimoto restaurant, while unseen diners below tasted truffled tofu and summoned the Iron Chef's sake sommelier. 
 Workers have long been inured to the spectacle of meat hanging on hooks in the same meatpacking neighborhood where supermodels slink to fashion shoots, where Beyonce shops and Cameron Diaz heads to her scheduled hair appointment. 
 Another wave of wind roiled from the river and crashed into the High Line. ''It's not a problem for me, in 30- to 45-mile-an-hour winds,'' said John Forbes, the ironworker, who is 6-foot-5 and weighs 380 pounds. ''I'm not going to blow away. I'm an andiron.''

HEADLINE: In the Land of Many Ifs

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
For months, the American economy has been assailed by a wave of troubling news, from plunging housing prices to the soaring cost of oil, provoking gloomy talk of a possible recession. Yet so far the economy has found a way to shrug it all off and keep growing. 
 How much longer can the expansion carry on? As a new year unfolds, analysts expect a verdict soon: Either the negatives finally metastasize and drag the economy down, or a fresh source of growth emerges, helping to sustain consumer spending despite the ongoing worries about housing and tight credit. 
 ''There are even odds of a recession,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''It literally could go either way.''
 The year that just ended was not for the faint of heart. As mortgage debt became synonymous with toxic waste, banks got spooked and tightfisted. Job growth slowed. Inflation fears grew. Still, consumers kept spending, and unemployment stayed flat. American companies found enough sales abroad to compensate for weakness at home. 
 The bursting housing bubble remains a locus of concern. An era of free-flowing credit and speculation has led to a far-flung empire of vacant, unsold homes -- 2.1 million, or about 2.6 percent of the nation's housing stock, Mr. Zandi said. Even in the worst years of recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s, the share of vacant homes did not exceed 1.9 percent.
 This assemblage of unsold properties will not be whittled down to normal levels, economists suggest, until national home prices fall by at least 15 percent from their peak, reached in the summer of 2006. So far, prices have dropped a little more than 5 percent, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index. 
 The glut could be exacerbated if an already alarming wave of foreclosures continues to broaden, claiming even those with supposedly good credit. 
 Last year, the trouble in the mortgage market was largely confined to subprime loans extended to homeowners with weak credit. Nearly one-fourth of such loans were in default as of November, according to data from First American LoanPerformance and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Though default rates on loans to homeowners with relatively good credit are far lower, they are rising sharply, too. In November, 6.6 percent of so-called Alt-A home loans -- those deemed somewhat less risky than subprime -- were either delinquent by 60 days or more, in foreclosure, or had been repossessed. That was up from 4.3 percent in August. 
 This is a potentially ominous sign, because subprime and Alt-A mortgages issued in 2006 together made up about 40 percent of all mortgages. Like many of the subprime loans that have landed in trouble, Alt-A loans often begin with a low introductory interest rate that later escalates.
 The spike in foreclosures is happening even before many mortgages have reset to higher rates, suggesting that borrowers are falling behind because their homes are worth less. Many are having trouble refinancing as banks tighten lending standards. 
 All of which explains why many economists expect national housing prices to fall by 5 to 10 percent more in 2008, and perhaps into 2009 as well, before hitting bottom. 
 Such a drop could ripple out to the broader economy by depressing consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of all economic activity. 
 ''It's almost inconceivable that there won't be severe constraints on the U.S. consumer economy,'' said Bernard Connolly, chief global strategist at Banque AIG in London. 
 Through the recent era of multiplying housing prices, Americans have turned increased home values into cash via sales, refinanced mortgages and home equity loans -- more than $800 billion a year from 2004 to 2006, according to several analysts. The pace of this flow has slowed sharply in recent months. 
 Fierce debate centers on how much of that money winds up financing consumer purchases, but estimates suggest that every dollar of lost housing value is likely to constrain 5 to 10 cents of spending by consumers that otherwise would have taken place over the next year or two. That could be enough to turn an expansion into an recession. 
 Forecasting the demise of consumer spending, however, is notoriously risky. The willingness of Americans to spend, whatever the size of their debts, seems to transcend the rules of economics.
 But conditions suggesting a slowdown have been taking shape: The labor market cooled last year, creating new jobs at roughly half the rate of 2006. Wages grew slower than inflation during the last two months. Early indications suggest Americans were relatively thrifty during the holiday season. 
 ''You have to ask yourself: where does the consumer continue to get his or her spending power?'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''If consumption falters, it's good night nurse for the American economy.'' 
 This is what many economists deem the most plausible of the negative situations that could unfold in 2008: Housing prices fall, consumers tighten up, and companies eliminate jobs in response to declining business, particularly in retailing, restaurants and travel.
 Companies curtail investments, cutting jobs in real estate, construction and banking. This takes more money out of the economy, generating a downward spiral of declining activity. In a word, recession.
 Those focused on this prospect are concerned by the weakening job market and recent increases in those filing for unemployment claims. In a report last month, Ian Morris, United States economist for HSBC, predicted that unemployment would climb to 5.3 by the end of 2008, up from an average of 4.7 percent in 2007, with the economy generating only about 40,000 nonfarm jobs each month -- about one-third the pace for most of 2007.
 The prospect of such a development has spurred the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times since September, bringing its benchmark rate down to 4.25 percent from 5.25 percent. Cheaper credit generally lubricates the wheels of the economy by encouraging investment and spending. 
 The Fed has expressed reluctance to continue cutting because of concerns about inflation. But further signs of economic trouble will impel it to keep lowering borrowing costs. And if oil and other commodity prices fall enough this year to dampen fears of inflation, that would give the Fed room to cut interest rates more aggressively. 
 The economy is rife with surprises, and unexpected good news could step in to provide relief. American consumers, despite their general gloom about the economy, continue to express satisfaction with their personal finances. That could carry the day, as they tap credit cards to finance meals out and trips to the mall, even as housing wealth dries up.
 Added support for the economy is likely to come from abroad, sustaining rising exports, which have been propelled by healthy growth everywhere from China and India to Europe and the Middle East. The weak dollar helps make American products more competitive in foreign markets. 
 A combination of any of these factors might be enough to generate jobs and keep the economy going, regardless of real estate troubles.
 Moreover, some economists assert that worries about the housing market are overblown in terms of the effect on the broader economy. While bad news seems certain to continue for real estate agents, construction companies, home improvement stores and anyone else with fortunes tied to demand for garages and ceramic tiles, the economy can continue to grow even with house prices in the doldrums, they say. 
 In this view, the crucial factor is the availability of credit. The mortgage crisis has made markets skittish about the extent of losses still hiding in the weeds. Lenders have been casting a wary eye at potential borrowers, diminishing the flow of credit to support everything from car purchases to the development of office towers. 
 If the Fed's lowered interest rates do the trick, making banks feel more secure, an upward spiral could commence, as fresh lending spurs business and keeps the economy growing. But if jitters persist and banks remain tight, that could snuff out business, cut jobs and send the economy into a tailspin. 
 ''If the credit card is a little harder to come by, that means there's a little less shopping going on,'' said Neal Soss, an economist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York. ''If banks go into hibernation and there's no cash for anybody, then it's very hard to get the economy to grow with any vigor.''

HEADLINE: Hungry For a Market, But Where?

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
THE day was wet and so cold that the savoy cabbages nearly froze and the fat on Mario Batali's porchetta quickly congealed into a solid mass. But the few thousand intrepid souls who made their way to the southern tip of Manhattan on that dark Sunday afternoon in December did not seem to mind.
 Neither sleet nor lack of a handy subway stop could keep them from Finger Lakes dried beans, hot fried oysters and Nantucket scallops still in their red shells. They had heard there was a market, and they were going to get there no matter what.
 Set up just outside one of the former Fulton Fish Market buildings by a nonprofit group called New Amsterdam Public, the one-day event was meant in part to build support for a permanent indoor public market selling pristine local food. Similar events are planned for the spring and summer. 
 For shoppers, the little start-up represented hope that they might eventually have what many New York cooks dream of: a large, permanent market with local and seasonal produce, cheesemongers, butchers and a selection of staples like canned tomatoes, olive oil and granola. 
 The place, whether at the historic old fish market, the new Penn Station or somewhere else, would be warm in the winter and cool in the summer, with a stand where you could buy a good sandwich or an espresso and gossip with other people who like to talk about cooking.
 ''New York really just doesn't have that one place,'' said Micah Arbisser, who, with his wife, Lisa, had bundled up their infant and made their way from the Lower East Side to the little market.
 Like many New Yorkers who piece together a cook's pantry from Chinatown shops, farmers' markets, FreshDirect, Fairway and other stores, the Arbissers have market envy. It may be easy to boast that New York is the greatest food city in the world, but one trip through San Francisco's Ferry Building and farmers' market, London's Borough Hall or Seattle's Pike Place Market can be deflating.
 Some people who have been pondering the next generation of New York public markets think this will be a pivotal year in the slow climb toward such a space.
 For one thing, the infrastructure for getting local farm products into the city is about to change drastically. In a speech in December Gov. Eliot Spitzer told the New York Farm Bureau that ground would be broken this year on a wholesale farmers' market somewhere near the massive wholesale food complex in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.
 The governor called it the Pride of New York Wholesalers' Market, but it would also sell food grown in surrounding states, said Theodore Spitzer, president of Market Ventures, an urban planning and marketing firm that helped the state plan the market. (He is not related to the governor.)
 Although the final feasibility study will not be released for weeks, people at the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets who have reviewed it say the market, a private-public partnership, will make it possible for as many as 250 farmers to bring their products to New York City.
 A big, modern warehouse with good storage facilities and a steady stream of buyers could assure schools, hospitals and grocery stores of a reliable supply of local produce. And it could finally give local farmers a new way to bring their produce to town, particularly those with midsize farms of 50 to 200 acres. Selling wholesale could work for growers who are too small to make direct deals with big chains or not specialized enough for a stall at one of the city's 46 Greenmarkets. 
 ''Asking the farmer to continue to do what they do at the farmers' markets after they have already grown the food is like asking me to shop for the food, cook it, serve your food and clean the dishes,'' the chef Dan Barber said. ''It's just too much.''
 The Greenmarket came of age in a post-Balducci's era, educating New Yorkers about the value of local produce, artisanal cheesemaking and pasture-raised beef in a way the epicurean market boom in the 1970s and 1980s did not.
 But with no permanent buildings or storage, long waiting lists for slots at the most popular markets and sparse choice at others, the Greenmarkets have their limits. And as the instant success of the Whole Foods near the largest Greenmarket, at Union Square, showed, there is more than enough demand to go around.
 At the moment, nobody has proposed a big indoor market to rival the ones in San Francisco or even Philadelphia. The massive, high-stakes maze of New York development is one reason. In 2004 Nina Planck, a former director of the Greenmarkets and the founder of several successful farmers' markets in London, offered a detailed plan for a public market in the meatpacking district. Her proposal, sent to city planners and the Economic Development Corporation, went nowhere. 
 But the success of markets like the one at Grand Central Terminal, coupled with a growing interest in shopping for local food as a leisure activity, makes the proposition more interesting to developers.
 Theodore Spitzer, whose company has helped plan large public markets in several United States cities, is also working to redevelop the Battery Maritime Building, a Beaux-Arts gem in Lower Manhattan. The property recently underwent a $60 million renovation sponsored by the city's Economic Development Corporation, and was to include a specialty food hall dedicated to local products.
 But it will not be the great public market described in early drafts of the plans, said Karen Karp, a food and market consultant who is also working on the project. Instead, the building's prime second-floor space will primarily be used for food-related trade shows. 
 Some advocates for a New York public market would like to see it become a part of the massive remake of the James A. Farley Post Office building and Penn Station, called Moynihan Station. Plans for the project call for plenty of shops and restaurants, but economic development officials say a big public food market is not in the works.
 Instead, it seems, New York is destined to take baby steps, some of them at the tourist-rich South Street Seaport. General Growth Properties, a developer, holds the lease on most of the properties in the area, including the landmark tin building at the former Fulton Fish Market, one of the spaces that the New Amsterdam team wants to move into.
 The developer does want some kind of food market. To help figure out what kind, it hired Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant who splits his time between New York and Northern California.
 He proposes turning 16 permanent stalls on South Street into incubators for chefs who want to try out new concepts. He has talked to Scott Peacock, a chef in Atlanta, about a biscuit shop; to Mr. Barber about a creamery; and to Mr. Batali about a tripe truck. Culinary schools could feature promising new chefs in the space. A seasonal farmers' market could spill into the street.
 It may not be the grand market some envision, but it could add to the momentum for one, or for several.
 ''A market in New York has to reflect political and cultural will, and we are arching toward it,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''But New York can't have one market. It has to have 30.''
 In a twist, he thinks the ideal New York market, wherever it ends up, should be global and deeply local at the same time.
 ''New York should be uniquely ambitious about a public market,'' he said. ''In the way the Ferry Building reflects Northern California, a New York market should reflect New York. And New York is a global crossroads.''
 That philosophy is at odds with what the people behind the New Amsterdam Public, Robert LaValva and Jill Slater, have in mind. Their goal is to make Lower Manhattan the beacon of New York's sustainable food movement by establishing a popular market filled with well-chosen local products in a historic public building.
 ''There is nothing easier to sell, other than maybe a newborn puppy,'' Ms. Slater said. 
 Mr. Wolf and people from General Growth Properties find the idea interesting, but the company has remained neutral about how it might fit into its final plans.
 The New Amsterdam market, which backers plan to present to the city this year, has the support of culinary figures like Mr. Barber, Alice Waters and Odessa Piper. Michael Hurwitz, the director of the Greenmarkets, does not see it as competition. There are more farmers eager to sell their food and customers for them than there are outlets, he said. 
 And, he pointed out, ''I don't think anything replaces direct sales from farmer to customer.''
 Whatever kind of market emerges, it cannot come fast enough for many of the farmers, because, for now, selling to New Yorkers is logistically grueling. 
 ''You have to combine a restaurant delivery with the Greenmarkets and mail order to move enough product,'' said Michael Yezzi of Flying Pigs Farm in Shushan, N.Y. 
 Mr. Yezzi and his wife, Jennifer Small, who sell meat from about 475 rare-breed pigs a year, spend two days a week working at the Greenmarkets. 
 If they start at 2:30 a.m., the drive to the city takes about three and half hours. In the late afternoon the drive home can take five. With fuel, market fees, hired help and baby sitters for their two children, he figures that two days of selling costs him more than $1,300. 
 A grand market with easy access for devoted customers and an on-site butcher to care properly for his expensive pork would solve the biggest problem he has selling in New York City.
 ''I spend too much time away from the kids and away from the animals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Film Year Full of Escapism, Flat in Attendance

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Despite a modest increase in 2007 box office receipts, moviedom is trudging into January with a droop in its shoulders.
 Ticket sales at North American movie theaters totaled $9.7 billion, a 4 percent increase over the previous year, according to Media by Numbers, a box office tracking company. But attendance was flat, after a narrow increase in 2006 and three previous years of sharp declines. Movie fans bought about 1.42 billion tickets last year, according to Media by Numbers. The high watermark of the last 10 years came in 2002, when moviegoers bought about 1.61 billion tickets.
 The results last year were largely driven by expensive sequels like ''Spider-Man 3'' (the top-grossing film) and ''Shrek the Third'' (the runner-up), although a handful of expert marketing campaigns turned some oddball entries like ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' into bona fide hits. One surefire franchise was born to Paramount and DreamWorks in ''Transformers'' (which placed third).
 Nine of the Top 10 grossing films were science fiction, fantasy or animation. The sole exception (unless you count the mock-historical ''300'') was Universal's action thriller ''The Bourne Ultimatum,'' which placed sixth with $227 million in domestic ticket sales. 
 As the movie industry turns its attention to 2008, the dark ''No Country for Old Men'' is showing box office legs, and one film in particular is already shaping up as a home run. Early results for ''Juno,'' about a quirky teenager who becomes pregnant, have outpaced those for the indie hits ''Little Miss Sunshine'' and ''Brokeback Mountain.''
 ''The critical acclaim and award recognition have magnified the movie,'' said Peter Rice, the president of Fox Searchlight, which is distributing ''Juno.''
 But box office results are always a game of glass half-full and glass half-empty, and the half-empties this time seem more prominent. 
 DVD sales continue to slump both domestically and abroad. The private money that has washed over Hollywood in recent years is starting to slow, investment bankers say, as more hedge funds go home with little to show. And movie executives are worried about the impending collision between striking screenwriters and the important awards shows.
 The strike, now in its ninth week with no new talks scheduled, is starting to weigh more heavily on the movie business over all. Until now, the damage has been mostly confined to television, which operates with a shorter production pipeline. But as the strike drags on, movie executives -- and their corporate bosses -- are starting to worry about having enough time to put together their mega-movie slates for summer 2009.
 At the box office the happy surprises of 2007 were almost all confined to escapist offerings like ''The Game Plan,'' a Walt Disney release about an N.F.L. quarterback and his young daughter, or sophomoric comedies like ''Superbad,'' a Sony release from the producer Judd Apatow.
 But studios have instead churned out gloomy message movies, and more are on the way, noted Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Media by Numbers. 
 ''There were some great films, but the appetite wasn't there,'' he said. Movies rooted in the Iraq war or terrorism -- ''In the Valley of Elah,''''Rendition,''''Redacted'' -- particularly struggled. A glut of serious-minded awards hopefuls canceled one another out. Signs of trouble lurked even during the blockbuster-packed summer, in which ticket sales surpassed the $4 billion mark for the first time. Sequels, with the notable exception of ''Bourne,'' the third in a series, were generally not well reviewed and sold fewer tickets than their second or first installments.
 ''Shrek the Third,'' ''Spider-Man 3'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' all marked low points for these franchises at the domestic box office when ticket sales are adjusted for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo, another tracking service.
 (The studios note that more than half of the ticket sales for each of those titles came from overseas. While there are no reliable independent data for overseas ticket sales, entertainment trade publications estimate that foreign receipts for the six biggest studios increased 9 percent in 2007 over a year earlier, to $9.4 billion.)
 Stars did not seem to interest moviegoers, with marquee names playing to empty seats. Angelina Jolie flopped with ''A Mighty Heart,'' about the murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and Nicole Kidman's career grew chillier with the North American collapse of ''The Golden Compass.'' Among the men, Tom Cruise struggled to avoid blame for a dead-on-arrival ''Lions for Lambs,'' and Brad Pitt drew shrugs for ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.''
 One big exception: Will Smith cemented his status as a top box office draw -- and perhaps the biggest star in the business today -- with robust results for ''I am Legend,'' a Warner Brothers release about a man wandering a post-apocalyptic Manhattan. The picture has sold $195 million in tickets since its Dec. 14 opening, with another $61.3 million coming from overseas, according to Box Office Mojo.
 (Denzel Washington also gets credit for helping to turn Universal's ''American Gangster'' into a $184 million hit, although he appears to be having a harder time with the just-opened ''Great Debaters.'')
 Of course results vary by studio, and some are entering 2008 on a high note. Walt Disney, for instance, has played the game better than most.
 ''Ratatouille'' overcame early skepticism about its rat-in-the-kitchen subject to become both a global blockbuster and a critical darling. ''Enchanted,'' about an animated princess who comes to life, continues to chug away in theaters, and ''National Treasure: Book of Secrets'' is a slam dunk. That action film, starring Nicolas Cage, sold $124 million in tickets domestically in its first 10 days of release, according to Box Office Mojo.
 Mark Zoradi, president of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, cited a recent decision to focus more intently on the company's brand as a catalyst for its performance. ''The Disney name continues to be enormously successful with audiences,'' he said.
 Twentieth Century Fox appears to be able to sell just about anything. That studio has set the standard for effective Internet marketing by coming up with ways for fans to personalize messages. ''The Simpsons Movie,'' with its $526 million in total ticket sales around the world, benefited from Simpsonize Me, a Web promotion (simpsonizeme.com) that allowed visitors to animate pictures of themselves. Fox used a similar promotion to fuel ''Alvin and the Chipmunks.''

HEADLINE: What's Your Consumption Factor?

BYLINE: By JARED DIAMOND. 
Jared Diamond, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, is the author of ''Collapse'' and ''Guns, Germs and Steel.''

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 TO mathematicians, 32 is an interesting number: it's 2 raised to the fifth power, 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. To economists, 32 is even more special, because it measures the difference in lifestyles between the first world and the developing world. The average rates at which people consume resources like oil and metals, and produce wastes like plastics and greenhouse gases, are about 32 times higher in North America, Western Europe, Japan and Australia than they are in the developing world. That factor of 32 has big consequences.
 To understand them, consider our concern with world population. Today, there are more than 6.5 billion people, and that number may grow to around 9 billion within this half-century. Several decades ago, many people considered rising population to be the main challenge facing humanity. Now we realize that it matters only insofar as people consume and produce. 
 If most of the world's 6.5 billion people were in cold storage and not metabolizing or consuming, they would create no resource problem. What really matters is total world consumption, the sum of all local consumptions, which is the product of local population times the local per capita consumption rate. 
 The estimated one billion people who live in developed countries have a relative per capita consumption rate of 32. Most of the world's other 5.5 billion people constitute the developing world, with relative per capita consumption rates below 32, mostly down toward 1. 
 The population especially of the developing world is growing, and some people remain fixated on this. They note that populations of countries like Kenya are growing rapidly, and they say that's a big problem. Yes, it is a problem for Kenya's more than 30 million people, but it's not a burden on the whole world, because Kenyans consume so little. (Their relative per capita rate is 1.) A real problem for the world is that each of us 300 million Americans consumes as much as 32 Kenyans. With 10 times the population, the United States consumes 320 times more resources than Kenya does.
 People in the third world are aware of this difference in per capita consumption, although most of them couldn't specify that it's by a factor of 32. When they believe their chances of catching up to be hopeless, they sometimes get frustrated and angry, and some become terrorists, or tolerate or support terrorists. Since Sept. 11, 2001, it has become clear that the oceans that once protected the United States no longer do so. There will be more terrorist attacks against us and Europe, and perhaps against Japan and Australia, as long as that factorial difference of 32 in consumption rates persists.
 People who consume little want to enjoy the high-consumption lifestyle. Governments of developing countries make an increase in living standards a primary goal of national policy. And tens of millions of people in the developing world seek the first-world lifestyle on their own, by emigrating, especially to the United States and Western Europe, Japan and Australia. Each such transfer of a person to a high-consumption country raises world consumption rates, even though most immigrants don't succeed immediately in multiplying their consumption by 32.
 Among the developing countries that are seeking to increase per capita consumption rates at home, China stands out. It has the world's fastest growing economy, and there are 1.3 billion Chinese, four times the United States population. The world is already running out of resources, and it will do so even sooner if China achieves American-level consumption rates. Already, China is competing with us for oil and metals on world markets. 
 Per capita consumption rates in China are still about 11 times below ours, but let's suppose they rise to our level. Let's also make things easy by imagining that nothing else happens to increase world consumption -- that is, no other country increases its consumption, all national populations (including China's) remain unchanged and immigration ceases. China's catching up alone would roughly double world consumption rates. Oil consumption would increase by 106 percent, for instance, and world metal consumption by 94 percent. 
 If India as well as China were to catch up, world consumption rates would triple. If the whole developing world were suddenly to catch up, world rates would increase elevenfold. It would be as if the world population ballooned to 72 billion people (retaining present consumption rates). 
 Some optimists claim that we could support a world with nine billion people. But I haven't met anyone crazy enough to claim that we could support 72 billion. Yet we often promise developing countries that if they will only adopt good policies -- for example, institute honest government and a free-market economy -- they, too, will be able to enjoy a first-world lifestyle. This promise is impossible, a cruel hoax: we are having difficulty supporting a first-world lifestyle even now for only one billion people.
 We Americans may think of China's growing consumption as a problem. But the Chinese are only reaching for the consumption rate we already have. To tell them not to try would be futile.
 The only approach that China and other developing countries will accept is to aim to make consumption rates and living standards more equal around the world. But the world doesn't have enough resources to allow for raising China's consumption rates, let alone those of the rest of the world, to our levels. Does this mean we're headed for disaster?
 No, we could have a stable outcome in which all countries converge on consumption rates considerably below the current highest levels. Americans might object: there is no way we would sacrifice our living standards for the benefit of people in the rest of the world. Nevertheless, whether we get there willingly or not, we shall soon have lower consumption rates, because our present rates are unsustainable. 
 Real sacrifice wouldn't be required, however, because living standards are not tightly coupled to consumption rates. Much American consumption is wasteful and contributes little or nothing to quality of life. For example, per capita oil consumption in Western Europe is about half of ours, yet Western Europe's standard of living is higher by any reasonable criterion, including life expectancy, health, infant mortality, access to medical care, financial security after retirement, vacation time, quality of public schools and support for the arts. Ask yourself whether Americans' wasteful use of gasoline contributes positively to any of those measures. 
 Other aspects of our consumption are wasteful, too. Most of the world's fisheries are still operated non-sustainably, and many have already collapsed or fallen to low yields -- even though we know how to manage them in such a way as to preserve the environment and the fish supply. If we were to operate all fisheries sustainably, we could extract fish from the oceans at maximum historical rates and carry on indefinitely. 
 The same is true of forests: we already know how to log them sustainably, and if we did so worldwide, we could extract enough timber to meet the world's wood and paper needs. Yet most forests are managed non-sustainably, with decreasing yields. 
 Just as it is certain that within most of our lifetimes we'll be consuming less than we do now, it is also certain that per capita consumption rates in many developing countries will one day be more nearly equal to ours. These are desirable trends, not horrible prospects. In fact, we already know how to encourage the trends; the main thing lacking has been political will. 
 Fortunately, in the last year there have been encouraging signs. Australia held a recent election in which a large majority of voters reversed the head-in-the-sand political course their government had followed for a decade; the new government immediately supported the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Also in the last year, concern about climate change has increased greatly in the United States. Even in China, vigorous arguments about environmental policy are taking place, and public protests recently halted construction of a huge chemical plant near the center of Xiamen. Hence I am cautiously optimistic. The world has serious consumption problems, but we can solve them if we choose to do so.

HEADLINE: An Intellectual Insider, Forever on the Outside

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
''I like this guy because he is excited,'' Jack Kerouac wrote in his diary after an encounter with Alfred Kazin on the streets of New York in the late 1940s. ''He stumbles about, chatting away, almost getting run over by trucks, eager, stuttering, proud, a little piqued at this world, which makes him cast furtive looks out of the corner of his eye.''
 Kazin at the time was still in his 20s but already a rising literary star with the publication of ''On Native Grounds,'' his pioneering study of the American realist novel. Hungry, ambitious and eager for fame (the political philosopher Sidney Hook would later recall him as ''a starry-eyed opportunist''), he was more than a little piqued at the world. He would lose the stutter but continue to cast the furtive looks of an outsider for the rest of his life, as Richard M. Cook amply documents in ''Alfred Kazin,'' his even-tempered, judicious biography of this notoriously prickly critic. 
 Introverted and combative, Kazin, who died in 1998 at 83, presents a wealth of contradictions for Mr. Cook to put his arms around. He was a gregarious loner, attracted to the upper reaches of Manhattan's literary society and, as an upstart from Brownsville, a poor Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, contemptuous of it as well.
 ''There is a gift there, a long-bred talent for sociability, that I certainly lack,'' he wrote in his journals after watching William Styron's wife greet guests at a party in 1986. ''And it makes me bitter, bitter.''
 A proud Jew, and a champion of writers like Bernard Malamud, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth, he opposed the Zionist program in the 1940s and could speak with offhand contempt of Judaism, whose sole contribution to human thought, he wrote toward the end of his life, is ''a summons to prayer, ritual and obedience.'' 
 Although a committed socialist, he refused the cultural role of ''an armed intellectual,'' as he put it, and shrank from most of the ideological battles that consumed his contemporaries at City College and in the pages of magazines like The Partisan Review.
 Mr. Cook, who teaches American literature at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, examines these and other paradoxes with a discerning eye. He is conscientious and thoroughgoing. But as a biographer, he faces some daunting obstacles, not all of them surmountable.
 In the first place, Kazin skimmed the cream. His autobiographical trilogy, ''A Walker in the City,'' ''Starting Out in the '30s'' and ''New York Jew,'' constitutes a memorable, impassioned chronicle of his own life and times. Mr. Cook relies heavily on these works, but he also introduces, with a deft hand, hundreds of illuminating passages from Kazin's unpublished journals to round out the picture, identify pseudonymous figures and correct the record, which Kazin, by his own admission, shaped for artistic purposes.
 Mr. Cook can do little about the life itself, however. Once Kazin scored a triumph with ''On Native Grounds,'' he embarked on a decades-long odyssey of book reviews, grants, temporary teaching appointments, lectures, academic conferences and, in later years, accolades. Mr. Cook scrupulously records it all, leaving the reader to contend with many sentences of this sort: ''In the fall, he arranged with Houghton Mifflin to write an introduction to the Riverside edition of 'Moby-Dick.'''
 In Mr. Cook's hands Kazin emerges as an arresting hybrid, a somewhat old-fashioned man of letters, whose critical models were Van Wyck Brooks and Edmund Wilson, with the fervent heart of a first-generation proletarian Jew enraptured and infuriated by America. 
 The 1930s, a decade of radical politics and economic misery, made him and held him to the last. By temperament and social circumstances, Kazin gravitated to the great realists who set out to take the measure of industrial America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, writers like Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris. To a great extent, Mr. Cook argues, literary time, for Kazin, stopped with the rise of fascism, the collapse of the socialist dream and the onset of World War II. 
 Throughout the 1950s Kazin felt himself adrift, a self-described Emersonian, aflame with ''humanistic moral passion,'' confronting the inward-looking, alienated fiction of the cold war and the Beat Generation. He disliked experimental writing. He hated the New Criticism and the theory-driven bent of literary studies in the academy. His best writing would be inspired by his own life, and by the classic American writers who had captured his imagination in his youth. 
 Mr. Cook suffers from excessive politeness. He bends over so far to be fair that you can almost feel the sinews straining. Kazin was not, by most accounts, a pleasant person. He could be self-absorbed, rude, condescending and humorless. 
 ''I do take myself seriously as a writer and do feel important to myself and other people,'' he once said in an interview. Emotionally demanding, a serial philanderer, he made life more than difficult for his first three wives. On this score Mr. Cook really does take his subject to task. Bravo.
 Kazin shrank from political battle. Mr. Cook, you feel, disapproves. He becomes enthusiastic when Kazin, uncharacteristically, enters the lists against the neoconservatives associated with Commentary and The New Criterion during the Reagan years and shows himself a fighting liberal. More than 20 years on, however, these face-offs seem less like the Lincoln-Douglas debates than like the petty squabbling of a small population of New York intellectuals. 
 As a literary critic, Kazin remained true to himself and his moment. This was his strength and his weakness. Everything, for him, was personal. A critic who could lash out at bedroom wallpaper for being sickening ''with its irrelevance,'' he engaged writers with an almost audacious presumption, feeling the contours of their psyches and clutching them in an intimate, passionate embrace. 
 The guy was excited.

HEADLINE: New Losers On Wall St.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The brokers' customers did reasonably well. The brokers did not.
 That is not the usual way of Wall Street. Two-thirds of a century ago, a best seller asked, ''Where are the customers' yachts?'' It noted that somehow the brokers always made money, even when their customers suffered. And so it has been for most of the years since then.
 But not in 2007.
 How could that happen? In recent years, Wall Street came up with what amounted to parallel markets. Ordinary investors could buy and sell stocks and bonds, but the favored insiders could partake of a host of investments not available to the rest of us. There were specialized securities and complex derivatives, and instruments known by their initials: C.D.O.'s, M.B.S.'s and SIVs. 
 In 2007, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose a respectable 3.5 percent, and high-quality bonds performed well as long-term interest rates fell -- at least for those with good credit. Commodity prices continued to boom, and many foreign stock markets also did very well, particularly when viewed from America, land of the declining dollar. By and large, the customers of the big financial firms had reason to be pleased.
 But not the bosses. The chief executives of Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were forced out, while Morgan Stanley's chief will go without a bonus for the first time anyone can remember. 
 Those three companies, and some of their competitors, had to go looking for capital infusions to make up for losses in those exotic markets that the public had been kept away from.
 Most ordinary investors found out what a C.D.O. was only when they read about the losses C.D.O.'s were bringing to the unfortunate owners.
 Some of the biggest profits earlier in this decade went to those who invested in private equity firms, which could take companies private and then get their money back almost immediately, often by having the companies borrow it. 
 But in 2007, the credit markets seized up, and suddenly it was not as much fun to be in the private equity business. The ones who enjoyed it the least were those newly admitted to the club. The Blackstone Group went public in June, just weeks before the credit markets began to turn hostile. Among the unhappy customers last year were the ones who got in on that deal. The shares, sold to the public at $31, ended the year at $22.13. 
 Perhaps that shows us this was the Groucho Marx market: a private club that decides to let in anyone may know something the rest of us don't.
 Over all, financial stocks did the worst of all in 2007. Of the 10 economic sectors that make up the Standard & Poor's 500, eight showed gains, with the best performances turned in by energy and materials stocks -- sectors that were helped by surging growth in developing economies. Among the historic names that rose more than 20 percent were Exxon Mobil, United States Steel and Alcoa.
 But the financial shares in the S.& P. 500 fell 21 percent as a group. Among the big names that lost at least a third of their value in 2007 were Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, Moody's and Citigroup. MBIA, a company that specializes in guaranteeing the financial health of others, lost nearly three-quarters of its value.
 Financial scares tend to arrive every decade or so, and the American economy and financial system have always bounced back, confounding the skeptics -- although in some of those crises there were more than a few financial fatalities. Many of the biggest banks of the 1970's are no longer around. They vanished into mergers with what had been smaller rivals that did not make the mistakes of earlier eras -- notably lending to Latin American countries and overinvesting in commercial real estate.
 The survivors of that wave of mergers, by and large, were regional banks. Two of the country's largest banks, Bank of America and Wachovia, have their headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. (Whether it is a coincidence or not, Charlotte is now the strongest major housing market in the country, according to one index.)
 On a relative basis, 2007 was the worst year for financial stocks since at least 1970 -- the earliest year for which Standard & Poor's could provide comparable records. (The financials suffered larger falls in 1974 and 1990, both years of crises on Wall Street, but those were years when most stocks fell. By contrast, 2007 was a year when most nonfinancial stocks rose.)
 The most recent period of severe underperformance of financial stocks was in some ways the opposite of this one. In 1997 and 1998, financial markets were shaken first by the collapse of some Asian currencies, then by Russia's default on its debt. A weak world economy sent commodity markets plunging, with oil falling almost to $10 a barrel.
 Now, commodities are strong, with gold topping $800 an ounce for the first time since 1980 and oil almost reaching $100 a barrel. Russia is riding high, and the government of Singapore, which suffered along with its neighbors a decade ago, bailed out Merrill Lynch.
 The crisis of the late 1990s caused consternation in financial circles, and led to the rescue of a big hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. But it had little effect on America's economy, particularly on consumers. House prices, to cite one example, rose steadily during the period.
 In this cycle, a decline in home prices helped to reveal financial excesses in the subprime mortgage market, where lending standards seemed to have all but evaporated in 2006 and the first half of 2007. 
 The results of that did spread, but not yet to the entire economy. The other economic sector where stocks fell in 2007 was consumer discretionary companies, a group that includes retailers and home builders. An index of department store stocks fell 35 percent, as forecasts of poor holiday sales came true.
 But those stocks did better than those of home builders, which were down 42 percent. And the entire economy kept growing, in part because of rising world demand.
 Many of the subprime mortgages had been financed through the securitization market, where a wondrous financial alchemy enabled risky investments to be transformed into supposedly safe investments rated AAA by the bond rating agencies, whose calculations of maximum possible losses turned out to have been woefully low. 
 In 2008, the biggest issue for Wall Street and the banks will be assessing the damage. Can the securitization market recover, and continue to provide financing for everything from credit cards to corporate loans? Or will its failure in the area of subprime loans spread, leaving it discredited and other parts of the economy desperate for cash?
 On the answer to that question may hinge the answer to whether the latest financial crisis will pass with little impact on the real economy, or whether it will pull down all the parts of the economy that enabled most investors to have a good year while their brokers were suffering. 
 If the former, the banks and brokers will recover, and the bailouts from China, Singapore and Abu Dhabi will appear brilliant, proving that governments can identify bargain investments.
 But picking bottoms is not easy, as Bank of America found. Its $2 billion rescue of Countrywide Financial in August was hailed as a bold move at the time, but the price it paid looks very high now. 
 There was, it turned out, a lot more bad news about Countrywide that was yet to emerge when Bank of America acted. If that is true for the banks and brokerage firms that received bailouts in late 2007, neither the rescuers nor the customers of those financial firms are likely to find much to enjoy in 2008.

HEADLINE: Candidates Play to Audiences on the Road in Iowa

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
As Mitt Romney, Fred D. Thompson and Mike Huckabee hit points all over Iowa in a closing flurry before Thursday's caucuses, it can seem as if they are campaigning in three entirely different worlds. 
 Mr. Romney, the white-collar Republican in a Ward Cleaver sweater, is promoted as a corporate master, ''to business as Elvis was to music,'' said Bob Beauprez, a former member of Congress from Colorado, who introduced Mr. Romney at an event on Monday. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, rattled off his platform with PowerPoint crispness, a man in a hurry. 
 Not so Mr. Thompson, who cuts the more classic ideal of small town, Middle America Republicanism, strolling through tiny Allison, Iowa. ''I always love to meet a man representing law and order,'' Mr. Thompson said in greeting Jason Johnson, who was wearing a Butler County Sheriff's Department uniform. 
 Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher and governor of Arkansas, speaks with the sure cadences of a man trained on pulpits. He employs a flow and rhyme reminiscent of the Rev. Jesse Jackson (''We have excess regulation, excess litigation''), boasts of his hardscrabble upbringing (''one generation removed from dirt floors and outdoor toilets'') and tells jokes like a certifiable Christian comedian. His economic populism has more in common with John Edwards, a Democrat, than with Mr. Romney and Mr. Thompson, a former senator from Tennessee. He draws ''amens'' from his audiences, who praise him in biblical terms. 
 ''If the earth cried out for Abel when Cain killed him, I wonder what kind of earplugs he would need today with all these abortions,'' said Darcy Seely of Anamosa, Iowa. ''That's why I'm for Huckabee. He's for life.''
 While the other major Republican candidates, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, have spent little time in Iowa in recent weeks, Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Romney and Mr. Thompson have been anchored here. They are united in reverence for President Ronald Reagan, distaste for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and devotion to small-government Republicanism. 
 Their appearances also represent dueling slices of anthropology within an evolving party. In a sense, Iowa is serving as a laboratory of competing Republican identities for the post-Bush years. 
 Mr. Thompson presents himself as every bit the ''law and order'' Republican. People he meets constantly mention his role as a prosecutor on the television series of that name, and Mr. Thompson himself mentions the show in his speeches, urging people to ''watch the reruns'' because then he gets a bit more in ''that little check I get.'' 
 He mutters, bounces up and down on his toes, making himself even taller than 6 feet 5 inches. His invocations of Reagan reflect a kind of audition for the Hollywood role of avuncular, common-sense Republican embodied by Reagan in the 1980s. Like Reagan, Mr. Thompson carries himself with a practiced sheepishness, a man who wants the role but does not need it.
 ''You're taller than you seem on TV,'' Ellie Senne of Allison told him on his visit to the Main Street Cafe.
 ''I was even taller before all those politicians beat me down,'' Mr. Thompson assured her.
 Mr. Romney is less likely to stroll casually at all. He works according to a plan.
 ''Gosh, it's nice to be here today,'' Mr. Romney said Monday night in Waterloo, but not a moment later than what the schedule dictated. He did three minutes on the story about how he met his ''sweetie,'' Ann, at a party in high school, three more minutes on how his son bought a Winnebago on eBay to drive across Iowa. He expounded on his business background, warned of ''global jihad,'' criticized bilingual educational and reminded everyone that ''marriage is between a man and a woman.''
 In turn, Mr. Romney's supporters often seem equipped and willing to recite his resume with database efficiency. ''I like his experience as a governor, turning around the Olympics and at Bain Capital,'' said Beverly Parizek, who sells insurance in Cedar Falls. ''Everything he touches seems to turn to success.'' 
 Mr. Romney's venue Monday night was Galleria de Paco, an upscale restaurant in Waterloo packed with an elegantly dressed crowd, many headed out to celebrate New Year's Eve after hearing Mr. Romney.
 At an Elks Lodge in Cedar Rapids on Tuesday, Mr. Huckabee described his campaign as ''farmers with muskets against the redcoats with bayonets.'' His concern extends beyond corporate board rooms, ''down to the factory floor, to the people who carry their lunch to work in sacks.'' He has been outspent ''20 to 1,'' he often said, in apparent reference to Mr. Romney. ''Just like some of you understand that your whole life you feel like you have been outspent 20 to 1 in about everything you have ever tried to do.'' 
 But everyone is equal under God and democracy, Mr. Huckabee added. ''You can't pay extra to vote more than once.'' 
 Mr. Thompson met few people on his quickie tour of downtown Allison, but made up for it by saying a lot of things twice. ''Fond memories, fond memories,'' he said of his time in the Senate. ''Bless you, bless you,'' he tells a man in a feed store who declares himself a ''Law and Order'' fan. ''Good to see you, good to see you,'' Mr. Thompson said to someone familiar upon stepping of his blue-and-mustard-colored bus. 
 He drew a nice crowd at his next stop, in Tama, another cafe, this one packed at lunchtime on New Year's Eve. It is cold out, ''so cold that back in Washington the politicians have their hands in their own pockets,'' Mr. Thompson said. This is the kind of gentle crack that Reagan used to relish, as does Mr. Thompson. He kept pounding his left fist into his meaty right palm, making a steady ''thlopp.''
 Mr. Thompson once filled in for the radio host Paul Harvey, he said, ''which was like pinch-hitting for Babe Ruth.'' He preaches pleasantness and common sense and a brand of Republicanism that he says has been lost. 
 ''My folks came off the farm with an eighth-grade education and started their family and taught me how to be a nice person,'' Mr. Thompson said.
 ''I like his demeanor,'' said Jody Maxted of Marshalltown, who like many Thompson supporters compared him to ''the kinds of Republicans you don't see as much anymore.'' 
 Mr. Romney urged everyone to ''vote a few times'' on Thursday, drawing polite laughter, and adding a ''just kidding'' in case anyone thought he wasn't. This is as close as Mr. Romney comes to a wisecrack, especially compared with Mr. Huckabee, who jokes (seemingly) at great length about stopping supporters of other candidates from caucusing. He suggests shoveling snow into their driveways.
 In these final days, Mr. Huckabee has had little one-on-one contact with voters, despite his campaign's populist demeanor, embarking on something of a media campaign instead. He held almost no public events Sunday and most of Monday, and will spend much of Wednesday -- the day before the caucuses -- traveling to Los Angeles to appear on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' On Tuesday he took no questions from his audience of 500, but held a news conference with the roughly 30 reporters in the middle of the hall.
 If Mr. Thompson is the candidate of furrowed brow, and Mr. Romney the big smile, Mr. Huckabee is a man of fast eyes and quick lines. Asked why he was going on with Mr. Leno, he said it was a contingency, ''in case all else fails, maybe he needs a sidekick.'' 
 He could have Hollywood to fall back on -- the Fred Thompson plan, in other words.

HEADLINE: If Elected: The Candidates on Foreign Policy

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton foresees a ''remaining military as well as political mission'' in Iraq, and says that if elected president, she would keep a reduced military force there to fight Al Qaeda, deter Iranian aggression, protect the Kurds and possibly support the Iraqi military. 
 Mrs. Clinton said the scaled-down American military force that she would maintain would stay off the streets in Baghdad and would no longer try to protect Iraqis from sectarian violence. But, she said, there were ''remaining vital national security interests in Iraq'' that would require a continuing deployment of American troops. 
 With many Democratic primary voters favoring a total withdrawal, Senator Clinton appears to be trying to balance her political interests with the need to retain some flexibility. Like other Democratic candidates, she has called for engaging Iran and Syria in talks and called on President Bush to reverse his troop buildup. 
 But while Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Bush's troop reinforcements as an escalation of war, she said in the interview, ''We're doing it, and it's unlikely we can stop it.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton made it clear that she believed the next president is likely to face an Iraq that is still plagued by sectarian fighting and occupied by a sizable number of American troops.
 In broad terms, Mrs. Clinton's strategy is to abandon the American effort to stop the sectarian violence and to focus instead on trying to prevent the strife from spreading throughout the region by shrinking and rearranging American troop deployments within Iraq.
 Some counterinsurgency experts say the plan is unrealistic because Iraqis are unlikely to provide useful tips about Al Qaeda if American troops end their efforts to protect Iraqi neighborhoods. 
 But a former Pentagon official argued that such an approach would minimize American casualties and thus make it easier politically to sustain a long-term military presence that might prevent the fighting from spreading throughout the region.
 Senator John McCain said that the buildup of American forces in Iraq represented the only viable option to avoid failure in Iraq and that he had yet to identify an effective fallback if the current strategy failed. 
 ''I have no Plan B,'' Mr. McCain said. ''If I saw that doomsday scenario evolving, then I would try to come up with one. But I cannot give you a good alternative because if I had a good alternative, maybe we could consider it now.''
 Mr. McCain said that the success of the Bush administration's strategy was essentially a precondition for a more limited American role that could follow. 
 ''I am not guaranteeing that this succeeds,'' said Mr. McCain, who has long argued that additional troops are needed. ''I am just saying that I think it can. I believe it has a good shot.''
 Mr. McCain said that the most optimistic course of events he envisioned for the remainder of the Bush administration involved a steady reduction in violence and a gradual turnover of security responsibilities to the Iraqis. Under those circumstances, Mr. McCain said, the United States military would gradually withdraw to its bases in Iraq, though he did not provide a timetable for how long that might take. American air and ground forces could continue to operate from those bases when needed but then eventually leave, he said.
 One plan proposed by some Democratic lawmakers is to withdraw American troops to Kuwait, from where they might carry out strikes against terrorists in Iraq. Mr. McCain said that this approach reflected a naive understanding of the difficulties in obtaining intelligence and conducting operations in Iraq. ''The fact of modern warfare is that you can't parachute into places,'' he said.
 Another plan, advocated by Mrs. Clinton, would maintain a reduced force at bases in Iraq to stabilize Kurdistan, deter neighboring nations from intervening and to fight terrorist groups there. ''That assumes somehow that the place has not descended into chaos,'' Mr. McCain said.
 Mr. McCain acknowledged that his message -- that a long, hard and uncertain road still lies ahead in Iraq -- was not a popular one, and could mark the end of his political ambitions. However, it could be as politically treacherous for Mr. McCain to back away from his support of the war as it is for him to stay with it.
 Senator Barack Obama says he would ''engage in aggressive personal diplomacy'' with Iran if elected president and would offer economic inducements and a possible promise not to seek ''regime change'' if Iran stopped meddling in Iraq and cooperated on terrorism and nuclear issues. 
 Mr. Obama said that Iran had been ''acting irresponsibly'' by supporting Shiite militant groups in Iraq. He also emphasized that Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program and its support for ''terrorist activities'' were serious concerns. But he asserted that Iran's support for militant groups in Iraq reflected its anxiety over the Bush administration's policies in the region. 
 He emphasized further that ''changes in behavior'' by Iran could possibly be rewarded with membership in the World Trade Organization, other economic benefits and security guarantees. 
 Mr. Obama has also talked about keeping a limited force in Iraq after withdrawing American combat units at the rate of one or two per month. But he insisted that the mission of his residual force would be more limited than that posited by Mrs. Clinton, saying, for example, that the part of the force assigned to counterterrorism might be based outside Iraq.

HEADLINE: Huckabee and Consultant Form an Uneasy Alliance

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
About three weeks ago, Mike Huckabee received an unexpected e-mail message from the veteran political consultant and television commentator Ed Rollins offering help with his unexpectedly surging dark-horse Republican primary campaign. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Huckabee had signed him up, Mr. Rollins recently recalled.
 They were an unlikely match from the start: Mr. Huckabee was a Southern Baptist pastor before he became governor of Arkansas, Mr. Rollins is a cheerfully profane operative who once said he had bribed African-American ministers to surpress black voting. (He later said he misspoke.) 
 Now, just days before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Huckabee's reliance on -- and then rejection of -- Mr. Rollins's advice to go after his opponent has threatened to throw his campaign into a tailspin, potentially jeopardizing the image of unvarnished ''authenticity'' that Mr. Huckabee is now making the centerpiece of his closing appeal to Iowa voters.
 Mr. Huckabee had pledged for months not to stoop to negative politics or attack advertisements. He drew an obvious contrast with his better-financed rival Mitt Romney, who battered Mr. Huckabee with critical commercials and mail. 
 Mr. Rollins, however, was impatient with Mr. Huckabee's nice-guy approach, telling a reporter just the day after Christmas that if Mr. Romney's attacks continued the Huckabee campaign would soon throw some punches of its own. ''I'm an old boxer,'' he said. 
 Finally, over the weekend, Mr. Huckabee acceded to his new adviser's counsel, using a stump speech to begin an escalating series of attacks on Mr. Romney's credibility and calling his tactics ''dishonest.'' On Sunday, Mr. Huckabee flew to Little Rock and spent some of his scarce campaign dollars filming a new commercial driving home his attacks on Mr. Romney.
 The next day, Mr. Huckabee overruled Mr. Rollins by renouncing his four-day-old attack strategy. He pledged at a news conference that he would stop going after Mr. Romney, but -- to the incredulous guffaws of a roomful of reporters, convinced Mr. Huckabee wanted it both ways -- he nonetheless screened the attack commercial before live television cameras to prove that it existed. ''If you gain the whole world but lose your own soul, what does it profit you?'' he said, quoting the Bible to explain his last-minute decision to reverse himself again.
 He took full responsibility for the commercial and its cancellation. But he also tossed a gentle jab at Mr. Rollins. Asked if he had fired anyone for advocating the attacks, Mr. Huckabee said no. ''Ed is awfully happy about that,'' he added, glancing toward his new adviser in the corner of the room.
 Mr. Huckabee's strategic switchback underscores the extraordinary seat-of-the-pants nature of his campaign, visibly still struggling to adjust to its sudden jump in the last month from dark horse to front-runner status. 
 While Mr. Romney, a millionaire fund manager, raised nearly $45 million and lent himself an additional $17 million over the first three quarters, Mr. Huckabee brought in just $2.3 million over the same period, ending the caucuses with about $2 million in cash. Unlike Mr. Romney, Mr. Huckabee has not been able to afford many commercials, mailings, polling, focus groups, extensive expert-policy briefings or, until Mr. Rollins, big-name campaign consultants.
 Instead Mr. Huckabee's campaign -- really, little more than the candidate, a campaign manager and a press secretary -- has relied mainly on his instincts, his wit and the news media.
 At a New Year's Eve reception for Huckabee volunteers, even some of his supporters expressed concern about the sudden reversal in strategy, worried the change of heart might make it harder to win over undecided conservative Christian voters whose turnout is essential to Mr. Huckabee's success at the caucus Thursday night.
 ''It is perplexing,'' said Tom Fleming, of Norwalk, Iowa. ''Very poorly timed. You don't change direction three days before the caucus.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Huckabee raced to get back on his footing, spreading the word about an influential Des Moines Register poll that placed him the front-runner among likely Republican caucusgoers. And he tried to fold his decision not to run the commercial into the populist appeals to economically anxious voters that have distinguished his campaign from his Republican rivals. 
 ''The pundits think I am crazy, and they may be right,'' he told an enthusiastic crowd of about 200 in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, urging them ''to prove the pundits wrong'' and send a message about ''the influence of money and the spirit and the tone of presidential politics.''
 Later, in Cedar Rapids, he decried the ''Wall Street to Washington axis of power'' and likened his shoestring campaign to hard-pressed working Iowans. ''Well, I know I have been outspent in this state 20 to 1,'' he said, adding, ''Just like some of you understand that your whole life you feel like you have been outspent 20 to 1 in about everything you have ever tried to do.'' 
 While Mr. Romney has a small army of operatives to help turn his supporters out to caucus, Mr. Huckabee has just about 20 paid staff in Iowa, with organized phone banks of about 75 volunteers in Des Moines and about 75 more around the state making calls on his behalf. He is counting on the pre-existing networks of home-schooling parents, gun club members, and conservative Christian churchgoers to help turn out his vote. 
 In closing, he urged voters to pick a candidate with ''authenticity,'' whose values and honesty they could trust in office. He appeared to be alluding to Mr. Romney, who has changed his position on abortion rights and his tone on other social issues over the years. But Mr. Huckabee asked a rhetorical question that may have been at odds with his recent changes in strategy as well. ''If I am saying and doing something today different than I was doing or saying before, how do you have any confidence about what I will do in the future?''
 Still, when reporters pressed him about the attack commercial he screened while renouncing it, Mr. Huckabee said Iowa voters applauded his decision to pull back from such attacks.
 Mr. Rollins, for his part, shrugged. ''Sometimes the candidate makes the decision,'' he added. ''And that is a good thing.''

HEADLINE: The Economy and the New Year

 BODY:
As 2008 begins, house prices are still skidding, bank losses are still mounting, oil is again flirting with $100 a barrel and consumers are buying less as prices rise. To many, the wheels appear to be coming off the economy. To others, including President Bush and his aides, the economy is fundamentally sound and resilient. 
 Obviously, both camps cannot be right. Unfortunately, the preponderance of evidence is grim. 
 When Mr. Bush says the economy is strong, he is generally referring to rising wages, low unemployment and what he calls healthy economic growth. But wages have either fallen or failed to outpace inflation during most of his tenure. Job creation is now slowing from a pace that has long been subpar. Economic growth is also braking, if not contracting. In any event, growth during the Bush years has not been healthy; rather, it has been abnormally lopsided. Corporate profits have soared (until recently) and the rich have become richer, while most Americans have treaded water or lost ground, their troubling circumstances masked by an unprecedented borrowing binge, now exacting its toll. 
 The other presumed economic bright spots -- business investment and exports -- are less bright upon closer inspection. According to a new government report, orders for big-ticket commercial goods rose a spare 0.1 percent in November. 
 As for exports, they have surged lately, but the growth has not yet led to more manufacturing jobs or inflation-beating pay raises for existing factory workers. The relative health of exporters is also obscuring the fact that to be more competitive in the long term, corporate America needs health care reform and tax reform, two fronts on which the Bush administration has made no progress. Instead, much if not most of recent export growth is due to the weakening dollar, which makes American products more affordable elsewhere. 
 While the boost is welcome, relying solely on a weaker currency to correct America's trade imbalance has downsides. For one, a falling dollar interacts with global money flows in a way that complicates the job of the Federal Reserve to steer the economy. That was made clear again last week, when a top Chinese bank official warned of a destabilizing sell-off in dollar-based assets if the Fed continued to cut rates. 
 Hoping for the best is facile if not paired with preparation for the worst. Perhaps more than anything, a lack of preparation makes it hard to believe Mr. Bush's assurances that all will be well. The administration has operated in a state of economic denial for years: conducting wars while cutting taxes, piling up debt, neglecting to regulate the financial sector even as it went on a lending binge, and ignoring the pain that was sure to come when consumers, bankers and investors sobered up. 
 Given that record, it is no surprise that Mr. Bush is now refusing to acknowledge the seriousness of the problems he has helped create. Americans don't need more denial. They need an unvarnished appraisal of the nation's economy -- including the politics and ideology that has driven it to this point. That is the only real hope for starting to turn things around.

HEADLINE: Democrats: More Than Health Care

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Perhaps you have heard that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have come up with different health care plans. Hers would require every American to own health insurance. His would not.
 That difference is the only one between the two candidates on any domestic policy that has received much attention. (Think about it: can you name another?) Outside of health care, the campaigns -- and we in the media -- have focused on more exalted concepts, like experience, change and judgment.
 But there really are some other important differences between the candidates. When you look at their policies as a whole, you see that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have actually laid out two competing economic philosophies. The fight over health insurance is just one part of their disagreement.
 Compared with all the other candidates -- Democrat and Republican -- Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama occupy roughly the same place on the ideological spectrum. They're both somewhat to the right of John Edwards, who favors a more muscular brand of government intervention to help the middle class. And they are well to the left of every Republican. 
 But the differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama can't be neatly captured with the standard language of right and left. 
 The easiest way to describe Senator Clinton's philosophy is to say that she believes in the promise of narrowly tailored government policies, like focused tax cuts. She has more faith that government can do what it sets out to do, which is a traditionally liberal view. Yet she also subscribes to the conservative idea that people respond rationally to financial incentives. 
 Senator Obama's ideas, on the other hand, draw heavily on behavioral economics, a left-leaning academic movement that has challenged traditional neoclassical economics over the last few decades. Behavioral economists consider an abiding faith in rationality to be wishful thinking. To Mr. Obama, a simpler program -- one less likely to confuse people -- is often a smarter program.
 Given the odds that the next five weeks will turn one of the two candidates into a presumptive presidential nominee, it's worth thinking about these ideas while there is still a campaign going on. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama both may be middle-of-the-road Democrats, but they do have different visions of how government should work. 
 If you can remember Bill Clinton's State of the Union addresses, you'll get a pretty good idea of where Hillary Clinton is coming from. Those speeches were filled with programs to encourage specific kinds of behavior, like tax breaks for college tuition, health care and retirement savings. 
 So has Mrs. Clinton's campaign. She has proposed new tax credits for savings, tuition, health care, elder care and renewable energy use. Her retirement tax credit, for example, would match the first $1,000 saved by couples making less than $60,000. For those making from $60,000 to $100,000, the match would be 50 cents on the dollar. To Mrs. Clinton, these policies are more efficient than old-style bureaucracy and less expensive than across-the-board tax cuts. 
 ''Her view is that it makes more sense to have government focus on specific needs and concerns,'' Neera Tanden, the campaign's policy director, says. ''And her experience in the government informs that view.'' 
 Mr. Obama -- the onetime community organizer -- tends to look at economic policy more like a foreign-policy realist looks at the world. He will sometimes remind aides that policies that look good on paper don't necessarily work in the real world. ''That's his thing,'' says Austan Goolsbee, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser. 
 The problem with Mrs. Clinton savings plan, according to the Obama view, is that many people won't save even when they are offered subsidies to do so. After all, many workers who are eligible for 401(k) matching funds don't take advantage of them now. 
 So Mr. Obama would instead require companies to deduct money automatically from their employees' paychecks and place it in a savings account the employee owned. Employees could opt out of the program. But if they did nothing, they would end up saving money. It's an idea that comes directly from academic research showing that savings rates have jumped when individual companies have adopted such plans.
 Mr. Obama isn't opposed to narrow tax credits, but his agenda isn't organized around them. Instead, he has proposed an across-the-board $1,000 tax cut for every family in the bottom 90 percent or so of the income distribution. As he notes, the middle-class squeeze is caused by slow-growing wages and the rising cost of energy, education and health care, he says. It's not a narrow problem.
 His skepticism about government tinkering also helps explains his stance on a health care mandate. (Except for the mandate, the Democratic health plans are essentially the same.) Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards favor a mandate, because -- as they point out -- there will never be universal health care without one.
 Mr. Obama counters that Mrs. Clinton's mandate won't do the trick, either. She has not proposed especially tough penalties for people who ignore it. 
 ''I don't think that the problem with the American people is that they are not being forced to get health care,'' Mr. Obama has said. ''The problem is they can't afford it.''
 So which of the approaches has a better chance of success?
 There's no question that tailored policies can work. They often did during the Clinton administration. President Clinton's expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides a cash rebate to working families with low incomes, has been arguably the most effective antipoverty policy of the last 30 years. 
 Even when such policies aren't perfect, they can make a difference. Mr. Obama is right that some people would ignore a health care mandate. But some wouldn't. As any good behavioral economist knows, there really are people who can afford health insurance and who would like to have it -- but who haven't gotten around to getting it. A mandate would nudge some of them to do so, and the whole health care system would be better off as a result.
 Yet for all of the good ideas Mrs. Clinton has proposed, there still seems to be something missing from her agenda. It feels like less than the sum of its parts. It lacks some of the elegance of the Obama approach. 
 Most people have only limited time and ability to sort through the details of government programs and then sign up for each one that might help them. And today's middle-class anxiety stems from some tremendously broad issues, like globalization and technological change. No matter how well it's designed, a package of tax credits doesn't seem quite up to the task of making the economy work for the middle class. 
 In a coming column, I'll look at the economic philosophies of the Republican candidates.

HEADLINE: Iowa Then...

BYLINE: By MILDRED ARMSTRONG KALISH. 
Mildred Armstrong Kalish is the author of ''Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression.''

DATELINE: Cupertino, Calif. 

 BODY:
 LIKE many Americans, I've been tuned into the nonstop coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Unlike many Americans, I'm an actual Iowan, having grown up there in the 1930s. As I watch and listen from the promised land of California, where I moved long ago, I can't help but keep returning to a twin observation: Yes, this is really different from the Iowa of my childhood -- but it's also kind of the same.
 The difference is obvious and inescapable. The hypersaturated media and political attention we take for granted today depends on a system of communication that is fast, reliable and far-reaching. In my time such a system did not exist. 
 In the small town of Garrison, where I grew up, most houses had just a telephone, a big wooden boxy affair that was attached to the wall in the kitchen. A telephone switchboard installed in the front of one of the two gasoline filling stations on Main Street, which was all of four blocks long, was efficiently operated by Gesena Gross, an old maid. (That's what we callously called unmarried females in those days.) She was known as ''Central.'' Her official hours were from about 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. She also had a switchboard in her home where one could call after hours in an emergency.
 The farms had to share telephone lines; each family was assigned different rings so you could know whom the call was for. For instance, the Irwins would have one long ring and two short ones; the Burkeys would be assigned three short rings; the Boldts would have one long, one short, one long and one short and so on. 
 The problem arose when people on the same line would listen in on someone else's call and thus drain the power. The exasperated original callers could barely hear each other and there would ensue a request to the unwelcome eavesdroppers, incremental in intensity. ''Will one or two of you please hang up your receivers?'' and ending with ''Get off the damn line!''
 As for other forms of communication, Garrison had no newspaper and no mail delivery. Residents daily walked to a post office on the town square. I do recall that there was mail delivery to the surrounding farm houses; the job was not highly paid but it was coveted because it came, on retirement, with a federal pension.
 And radios? Most people owned simple devices that were powered by a battery or a small wind generator on the roof. Electrification came with the New Deal a few years later.
 So where are the similarities?
 Though Iowa has been holding caucuses since the mid-1800s, the rest of the country didn't pay attention to them until recently, and I don't even remember them from my childhood. What I do remember, though, are the passionate political gatherings that regularly took place on my grandfather's front porch. It occurs to me that these were not so different in spirit from the caucuses we are enduring now.
 I recall the scenes from early in the '30s. In early evening, after supper, about a half a dozen of the older men from the area would gather to chew the fat. After discussing local matters, the talk quite often turned to the who, why and how of political preferences.
 Grandpa was a slight man, constructed mostly of bone, muscle and gristle. He liked to sit or stand quietly with his hands loosely clasped inside and just above the top of the bib of his denim overalls. He seldom raised his voice and he spoke softly and thoughtfully. He sounded authoritative. 
 Some of the men I remember: Ed Meece and Cap Gross were assertive Republicans; they were Herbert Hoover supporters. So was A. J. Donald, our neighbor and a banker. These gentlemen didn't think government should intervene in public affairs to fix the economy. They were certain that Franklin Roosevelt would ruin America.
 Alex Irwin, Clarence Barkdoll and Ed Baldwin (our only druggist) -- and Grandpa were dedicated Democrats who derisively pointed out ''Hoover villages'' made of cardboard and flimsy lumber. (They called newspapers ''Hoover blankets.'') 
 Grandpa was the only one of the group who was a farmer. And he understood that Roosevelt's programs would help the rural areas. In particular, I remember him talking about Roosevelt's promise to create ''Farm to Market'' roads that would put crushed rock mined from local limestone quarries on top of the dirt roads that storms turned into impassable mud paths, a monumental plague of the farm communities.
 My grandfather's mini-caucuses and passions weren't just reserved for adults, though. Most mornings, before we trotted off to school, he would assemble my three other siblings and me. Generally, he'd read us a few cogent Bible verses while we stood there, all gussied up in our clean school clothes, dinner pails in hand, champing to be off to see our classmates.
 One morning, just as the Roosevelt-Hoover race was heating up, Grandpa glanced up during his reading and noticed a large pin on my older brother Jack's shoulder. (Jack was probably 12 at the time.) The button, with bold black letters on a white background, read ''Hoover.''
 Grandpa froze; his face took on a grim, stony look; he gritted his teeth. Without seeming to look at the Bible, he finished his reading abruptly. Staring directly at Jack, he tapped his own shoulder and then pointed to the basket of corn cobs that fed the kitchen stove. In a split second, Jack plucked the offending emblem from his shoulder and flung it into the corn cobs. We went merrily off to school. Roosevelt won that election.

HEADLINE: Anger and Blame After Deadly Flood in Northwest

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: CURTIS, Wash. 

 BODY:
The big rain fell with fatal efficiency those first few days of December. It washed mud from mountainsides and lifted logs into the Chehalis River, which rose to a historic high as it roared downhill. Bridges broke. Cows drowned. Helicopters plucked people from rooftops. 
 The flood was devastating, and revealing, churning up once again the question that confounds the Pacific Northwest: How to balance people, water, fish, forests and farms? A month later, anger and blame accompany the giant dehumidifiers still being used to dry out houses. 
 ''We've got to have a big public debate, and it's got to result in action, not inaction,'' said W. Jay Gordon, an organic dairy farmer who is executive director of the Washington State Dairy Federation. ''Maybe this will finally provoke that public discussion. It's not just logging. It's not just farming. It's not just development, and it's not just environmentalists.''
 The storm that caused the flooding has been linked to at least six deaths in the Northwest and the loss of hundreds of farm animals. It instantly updated local building codes that require new development to be above the flood line. It has also prompted competing accusations that logging contributed to the damage and that efforts to protect salmon habitat left the river full of destructive debris.
 ''That's part of it,'' Pete Dykstra, a 64-year-old dairy farmer here whose 100 Holstein cattle drowned, said of the logging. ''But part of it's Mother Nature, too, and part of it's the environmentalists.''
 Mr. Dykstra and many other local residents attribute some of the damage to laws intended to protect salmon. ''We can't dredge it,'' he said of the river. ''And if a tree falls over, we can't clear it out because that's habitat.''
 Tension has increased as more people move to this part of Washington, about 100 miles southwest of Seattle, bringing new development pressure and new ideas about how to use the land. Lewis County, which suffered much of the worst damage from the storm, had 59,000 people in 1990, according to the Census Bureau. Last year it had nearly 74,000.
 While people still talk about the big flood of 1996, which inundated the region and closed Interstate 5, new retail development has been built in the flood plain since then, and some of the houses that flooded in December were under construction.
 Like many other places in the Northwest outside big cities, Lewis County is trying to make its way from a declining economy based on logging and mining to one that meets new needs. 
 What had been the largest employer, a coal mine operated by TransAlta, closed late in 2006, taking 600 jobs. But the timber industry, in steady decline in many other places in the Northwest, has actually grown here in recent years, and the county has also lured warehouses for big companies like Fred Meyer, a department store, and Michaels, the chain of craft stores. They like the access to Interstate 5, which goes right through Lewis County and connects to ports in Seattle and Portland while it runs the length of the West Coast. 
 But just like in 1996, the Interstate flooded in the storm of Dec. 2 and 3. It was closed for four days. New flood-control measures were supposed to be a priority after the 1996 flood, but the projects have yet to be built. Now that Lewis County is more involved in the region's global economic goals, local officials say flood control is even more critical.
 ''This is not just about Lewis County,'' said Bill Lotto, head of the county's Economic Development Council. ''It becomes a much broader thing when you can't get goods from Mexico to Canada.''
 Farther from the highway, however, many longtime residents are less concerned about connecting to the outside.
 Many people who do not farm have jobs in logging. They emphasize their self-reliance, noting how people banded together to buy dehumidifiers rather than wait for government help. The Baw Faw Grange, a farmer's group here in Curtis, has been feeding people in the area since the first days after the storm. The Curtis post office, which had been tucked into a corner of the Curtis Store until the store was inundated with eight feet of mud and water, is now run from a truck in the Grange's parking lot. 
 ''We've got people in Seattle telling us how to live our lives, and half of them have never picked up a pitchfork,'' said Barbara Soto, 41, stopping by the post office on New Year's Eve.
 Ms. Soto is among those who blame efforts to protect salmon for a buildup of debris that slammed down the flooded river.
 Others blame logging directly, and some cite a photograph published in The Seattle Times after the flood that showed big mudslides on a recently cut steep slope that drains into a tributary of the Chehalis. Studies have shown that clear-cutting increases erosion and mudslides. And not every advocate for limiting logging is a big-city environmentalist.
 ''If there had been more forest cover, the water wouldn't have run off as quickly and been as destructive,'' said Margaret Rader, a board member of the Chehalis River Council, a local volunteer group. ''There's no way that it couldn't have had an impact.''
 All sides agree that the rain itself was stunning, with 15 inches falling on parts of the Chehalis River basin.
 ''Who do you blame for that?'' said Bobbi Fenn, 54, who said she had lived in the area near Curtis for half a century and never before seen such flooding. ''Sometimes things just happen. I've been thinking someone should write a book about it, but I wouldn't want to read it.''

HEADLINE: California Sues E.P.A. Over Denial Of Waiver

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
California sued the federal Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, challenging its recent decision to block California rules curbing greenhouse-gas emissions from new cars and trucks.
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, California has the right to set its own standards on air pollutants, but must receive a waiver from the E.P.A. to do so. The environmental agency broke with decades of precedent last month and denied California a waiver to move forward with its proposed limits on vehicular emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.
 In a statement announcing the lawsuit, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said, ''It is unconscionable that the federal government is keeping California'' from adopting new standards. 
 California officials argue that the agency had no legal or technical justification for blocking the new standards. The E.P.A. administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, said when announcing the decision that a new federal fuel-economy mandate would be more efficient in curbing pollution than the state standards. 
 The lawsuit also challenges the agency's contention that California is not uniquely affected by global warming and so lacks the ''compelling and extraordinary'' conditions that would allow it to regulate greenhouse-gas pollutants.
 Mary D. Nichols, thechairwoman of the Air Resources Board, the state agency charged with putting California's 2002 law on vehicular emissions into practice, said the suit was filed quickly because ''the states didn't want to sleep on their rights.''
 California regulators, Ms. Nichols added, have just calculated that in 2016, the state's standard would reduce carbon dioxide output by 17.2 million metric tons, more than double the 7.7 million metric tons that would be eliminated under the new federal fuel-economy standard. 
 California's cumulative reductions from 2009 through 2016 would be 58 million tons, she said -- triple the reductions the federal standards would provide. 
 The environmental agency had no immediate reaction to the new calculations, but it did put out a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying in part, ''As the administrator indicated'' in the Dec. 19 decision, ''we now have a more beneficial national approach to a national problem which establishes an aggressive standard for all 50 states, as opposed to a lower standard in California and a patchwork of other states.''
 Ms. Nichols pointed out, in a telephone news conference, that the Clean Air Act did not permit a patchwork of individual state regulations; it permits California to have independent rules on air pollutants, and permits other states to choose between the federal standards or more stringent standards set by California.
 California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, added that the word ''patchwork'' was ''completely untrue.'' 
 ''California's got the only'' greenhouse-gas emission standard ''in the country,'' Mr. Brown said.
 The lawsuit was joined by New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and 11 other states as well as five environmental organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 ''We think because it was a California rule, the precedents indicate the Ninth Circuit is the appropriate jurisdiction,'' Mr. Brown said, referring to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 Gloria Bergquist, vice president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in Washington, disputed Mr. Brown's assertion that there was no other nationwide standard set to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. 
 ''Congress approved an energy bill that will result in 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide over the next 12 years, so there is a national program now,'' Ms. Bergquist said. ''So it isn't a question of California not having a reduction.''

HEADLINE: Discussion of a Fed Cut Only Stirs Up Concerns About a Weak Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Wall Street stumbled out of the blocks for the new year after oil prices surged briefly to $100 a barrel and a report pointing to a fall in manufacturing activity in December revived fears that the economy would falter in 2008.
 Stock markets responded with a sharp slide. The Dow Jones industrials shed 220.86 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 13,043.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.20 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,447.16, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 42.65 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,609.63. 
 The sell-off paused only for a bit, after minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 11 suggested that central bankers were inclined to cut interest rates again this month if the economy and credit conditions continued to look weak.
 But while investors usually cheer an impending rate cut, the minutes only fueled anxiety that the economy would fall into a recession in the coming months. Fed officials said they expected growth to be ''more sluggish than they had originally anticipated'' and predicted weak consumer spending and ''heightened uncertainty'' in financial markets. 
 Policy makers said they expected the risk of inflation to subside in 2008. But their meeting occurred before data showed an uptick in prices, and some analysts said the bank's outlook might have since changed.
 Underscoring those concerns, oil prices leapt Wednesday by more than $3, to $99.62 a barrel, and one $100 trade was made on the New York Mercantile Exchange. High oil prices will very likely nudge up consumer prices in 2008, analysts said, adding to the challenges facing the Fed. Oil is now close to its inflation-adjusted record of $102.81 a barrel, set in April 1980.
 Oil's rise further rattled investors already grappling with a batch of poor economic data. The day began with a report that the manufacturing sector might have contracted in December for the first time in 10 months. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, based on a survey of companies, dropped to 47.7 from 50.8 in the previous month, on a scale on which anything above 50 signals growth. The sector's actual performance, though, will not be known until the Federal Reserve reports on industrial production for the month.
 New manufacturing orders fell to the lowest level since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. New orders tend to drop sharply during a recession or in the months leading up to one. 
 Analysts also fretted about an unexpected fall in a measure of export orders. Foreign sales have bolstered American growth in recent months as domestic demand flagged. A drop-off could precipitate a more significant slowdown than economists expect.
 Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, said the manufacturing data was consistent with sluggish growth.
 ''The manufacturing sector is probably shrinking at a modest pace right now,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean the overall economy is going into a recession.''
 Mr. Harris also played down concerns over rising prices. ''We're not going to be talking about upside risks to inflation six months from now,'' he said. ''We're going to be talking about a very weak economy.'' 
 The supply management report overshadowed a more favorable reading on construction spending, which edged up slightly in November, according to the Commerce Department. The continuing housing slump sent residential projects down again, but nonresidential construction edged up 2.1 percent after a 1.1 percent rise in October. 
 Keeping pace with the last few months, public construction projects grew again in November, while private residential construction fell. 
 Spooked investors went for safe corners of the market Wednesday, sending gold to a record high and pushing down yields on Treasury bonds. 
 At least one perennial bull sounded a bit gloomy Wednesday, but he managed to eke out at least one hopeful note. ''This is just one day,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''There are a lot more days to come this month.''
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Apartment Prices in Manhattan Defy National Real Estate Slide

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
As the housing market across the country continued to stagnate in the fourth quarter of last year, the market in Manhattan set a record, according to reports to be released on Thursday by four of the city's major real estate brokerage firms. 
 The average price for an apartment reached $1.4 million in the last quarter of 2007, up 17.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006, according to data tracked by the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 The reports noted, however, that average prices were being pushed to record levels because of the increasing number of apartments selling at the top end of the market, above $10 million.
 Many other indicators also showed that the Manhattan sales market remained strong: the number of apartment sales jumped by 3.2 percent, compared with the same time period the year before; apartments sold an average of 18 days faster than they did a year ago; and the inventory of apartments for sale shrunk by 13.5 percent. 
 ''Every single indicator that we tracked showed a gain,'' said Jonathan Miller, the executive vice president and director of research of Radar Logic, who prepared the data for Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 The record prices can be credited largely to Manhattan's wealthiest buyers. The number of apartments that sold for more than $10 million tripled in the past year, according to data tracked by two other brokerages, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. Many of these deals were at 15 Central Park West and at the Plaza, two buildings in which 94 of the 1,342 condos sold in Manhattan in the fourth quarter are located. 
 Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that sales at those two buildings helped drive up average condo prices by $500,000.
 Mr. Miller said that he had not seen the luxury market drive Manhattan real estate prices so profoundly since 2000, when buyers poured wealth from the dot-com boom into high-end apartments. 
 That is not to say that these high-end transactions will shield Manhattan real estate from a slowdown in 2008.
 Real estate brokers predict that sales prices may not keep up this pace through 2008 because more buyers could have trouble taking out large mortgages and some Wall Street bankers may receive smaller cash bonuses.
 ''I'm not forecasting high appreciation,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''I'm forecasting that the market will be flat'' in 2008.
 Co-ops, which typically cost less than condominiums, are clearly lagging behind condos in terms of financial performance. According to the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, the average condo price jumped by 17.8 percent in the last quarter of 2007 over the same period a year earlier, the average co-op price rose by 9.1 percent. Mr. Miller said that the inventory of co-ops for sale dropped by 26.2 percent, at least in part because some sellers took their co-ops off the market, hoping to try again in the spring.
 Still, real estate brokers and economists point out that the overall market has performed just as well as the luxury market. In fact, half of the sales in Manhattan involved apartments that sold for less than $828,0000, according to data tracked by Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.
 ''The marketplace is not being held afloat by just the high end,'' said Diane Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''We have great demand across the board.''
 Buyers paid high prices for apartments in Harlem, where condos drove up average prices by 93 percent, to $895,000, , largely because of new construction. Apartments at the new condominium building at 111 Central Park North, which accounted for 21 of the 108 sales in Harlem, sold for an average of $2.2 million.
 Some outlying neighborhoods in Manhattan, however, are already experiencing a minor slowdown. The median sales price for apartments in Inwood dropped by 4 percent, to $299,000, in the past year and by 5 percent, to $412,500, in Hudson Heights, according to Halstead Properties.
 Barak Dunayer, president of Barak Realty, said that prices were definitely flat in those neighborhoods and that fewer owners there were putting their apartments up for sale.
 While Brooklyn co-ops and condos sold for an average of $661,000, compared with $613,000 at the same time the year before, some segments of the market experienced a slowdown, according to data tracked by the Corcoran Group. Median prices on two-bedroom Park Slope apartments dropped by 4 percent, to $637,000. Median prices for two-bedroom apartments in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill dropped by as much as 14 percent, to $462,000.
 Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, which also studied Manhattan figures, attributed the price drops to fewer closings for apartments in high-priced new buildings. She said that Brooklyn over all has settled into a stable rhythm because it was not experiencing the drastic price jumps of recent years.
 ''Brooklyn showed its maturity this year because the appreciation was much more steady,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 2007 May Be Gone, but the Volatility of the Markets Carries On

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Oil prices began the year with a volatile surge on Wednesday, briefly reaching $100 a barrel, a long-awaited milestone in an era of rapidly escalating energy demand and tightening supplies.
 Crude oil futures for February delivery hit $100 on the New York Mercantile Exchange shortly after noon when a single trader bid up the price by buying a modest lot and then selling it immediately at a small loss. Prices eased somewhat in later trading, settling at $99.62. 
 While the lone trader was apparently looking for vanity bragging rights, the spike in crude prices of $3.64 for the day reflected deeper worldwide trends, including the surge in demand from China, India and the oil-producing countries themselves. 
 ''We're starting the year with a bang,'' said Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. ''It's the same usual suspects: the bad, bad world out there, a cold winter and declining oil inventories.''
 The volatility suggested that traders will see more of the escalation in energy markets that marked the final months of 2007, when crude oil shot past $80 and then $90 in a matter of weeks before fears of a recession in the United States halted what appeared to be an inevitable march to $100 in early December. But the December retreat was brief, and now some energy specialists are talking about not only $100 oil, but $120 oil in the coming year. Others are predicting that an economic slowdown will ease demand pressures.
 ''We're going to see sharply higher gasoline prices this spring; we're going to see sharply higher heating oil and diesel prices immediately,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. But, he added, ''if I had to bet what we would see first, $115 oil or $85 oil, I'd bet $85.''
 Gasoline prices have so far lagged behind the rise in the price of oil, currently at a nationwide average of $3.05 a gallon for regular grade, according to AAA, the automobile club. That is below the peak in May of $3.23 a gallon, but 73 cents higher than at this time a year ago.
 The immediate impetus for Wednesday's rise in oil prices appeared to arise from an attack by rebels in the Nigerian oil center of Port Harcourt and rough weather in the Gulf of Mexico that had slowed Mexican oil exports. 
 The price of oil has been flirting with $100 for months, and there has been added price pressure in recent weeks because of turbulence in Pakistan after the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
 There is no shortage of explanations for the escalation of oil prices by about 60 percent over the last year. The price of a barrel was below $25 as recently as 2003 and, almost unimaginably, below $11 in 1998, a time when there was a glut in the world markets.
 Booming economies in recent years have led to more consumption of oil-derived products like gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. Political tensions in countries like Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran have threatened world supplies, while important fields in Mexico, the United States and other countries are aging and producing less.
 Big oil companies, though flush with cash from record profits, are having trouble finding promising new fields to bolster supplies. Newly found fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Brazil will take years to develop.
 The Bush administration has further tightened supplies by announcing that it would add to the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the coming weeks, a move that some leading Democrats have urged President Bush to suspend in order to ease the tight oil market.
 Investors and hedge funds have contributed to the run-up. Oil, like other commodities, has become a perceived safe haven for traders who are skittish about the weakening dollar and fallout from the tight credit market in the United States.
 ''There is a momentum for higher prices because of the lack of cushions and because surprises are everyday events,'' said a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, Larry Goldstein. ''When anything goes wrong now, it gets immediately priced in not by pennies, nickels or dimes but by dollars.'' 
 Oil is now within reach of its inflation-adjusted high, reached in April 1980 in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution when oil prices jumped to the equivalent of $102.81 in today's dollar. The brief stab at $100 on Wednesday broke the previous intraday trading record of $99.29, reached on Nov. 21. The price at the end of the day, $99.62, surpassed the record close of $98.18, set on Nov. 23.
 Other commodities also rose, spurring more speculation that inflation could be a problem this year. Spot gold climbed over $860 an ounce, and soybeans, wheat, platinum, heating oil and natural gas soared.
 Unlike the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s, the current spike in oil prices has not caused a recession or blunted consumer spending in a major way so far. But it has widened the trade deficit and raised concerns about inflation at a time when a growing number of economists fear a recession may be coming.
 Mr. Gheit of Oppenheimer said that if there was a recession ''oil prices will definitely go down because demand will go down, and the speculators will take a dip as a leading indicator and they will jump first, and that will cause a meltdown.''
 Of the trader who sent oil to $100 in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Gheit added, ''He's probably going to frame the ticket and sell it on eBay for $100,000.''

HEADLINE: Sudanese Police Talk to Witnesses in Death of U.S. Diplomat

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan 

 BODY:
The Sudanese authorities on Wednesday questioned witnesses in the killing of an American diplomat and his driver who were shot by gunmen in a drive-by attack here in the capital. 
 Sudanese officials insisted that the shooting was not a terrorist attack, but the United States Embassy said it was too soon to determine the motive.
 John Granville, 33, an official for the Agency for International Development, was being driven home about 4 a.m. Tuesday when another vehicle cut off his car and opened fire before speeding off, the Sudanese Interior Ministry said.
 The diplomat's driver, Abdel-Rahman Abbas, 40, died at the scene. Mr. Granville initially survived the attack with five gunshot wounds but died after surgery, said Walter Braunohler, the public affairs officer at the American Embassy in Khartoum.
 The Sudanese police said they had questioned a number of witnesses from the scene of the attack ''and investigations are continuing,'' the state news agency SUNA reported Wednesday.
 The driver's family said the two victims had been heading home from a New Year's party at the home of a British diplomat. One woman who lives near the site of the attack, Nimat Malik, told a Sudanese newspaper that she rushed to help the American.
 She said Mr. Granville told her, ''I am dying, I need help.'' She told the paper that she had some medical training and wanted to try to stop his bleeding using her robes, but that other bystanders warned that she could face trouble for tampering with evidence.
 ''But I saw the need to help him, so I got the police car to take him to hospital to receive medical assistance,'' she told the paper.
 There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, and American and Sudanese officials investigating the shooting have not specified any suspects.
 Attacks on foreigners are rare in Khartoum, where the last American diplomats were killed in 1973.
 Mr. Granville was working to put in place a 2005 peace accord between Sudan's north and south that ended more than two decades of civil war, the Agency for International Development said.
 Mr. Granville's family in Buffalo said he was committed to his work in Africa.
 ''John's life was a celebration of love, hope and peace,'' a family statement said. ''He will be missed by many people throughout the world whose lives were touched and made better because of his care.''
 Sudan's Foreign Ministry said the attack was ''isolated and has no political or ideological connotations'' and pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice.
 But Mr. Braunohler, the embassy spokesman, said it was ''too early to tell'' whether the attack was related to terrorism.
 The shooting took place a day after a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force took over control in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, where more than 200,000 have died in a conflict that began in 2003. 
 Aid workers have come under increasing attack in Darfur by the region's armed groups, but such attacks have not been known to take place in Khartoum. Mr. Granville's work appeared to be focused on providing aid for Sudan's south, well away from Darfur.

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler paid a $30 million fine in 2007, the most ever by an automaker, for failing to meet federal fuel-efficiency standards, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
 The penalty was assessed for DaimlerChrysler's imported fleet of cars from the 2006 model year, which failed to meet the corporate average fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles per gallon, an agency spokesman, Eric Bolton, said Wednesday.
 DaimlerChrysler, now known as Daimler, topped the record of $28 million set by BMW in 2002. The United States has collected $735 million in fines since 1985 from automakers whose fleets failed to meet car and light-truck mileage standards, now at 27.5 m.p.g. and 22.2 m.p.g..
 Other automakers paying fines last year were BMW, $5.1 million for its imported fleet of passenger cars; Porsche, $4.6 million for its cars and sport-utility vehicles; and Volkswagen, $1 million for its sport utility vehicles. For each 0.1 mile below the standard, automakers pay $5.50 multiplied by the number of vehicles in the fleet.
 Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, sold an 80.1 percent stake in its Chrysler unit last year to Cerberus Capital Management and has paid $281.8 million in fines to date, the most in the industry. BMW is second, at $245 million, followed by Porsche's $57 million, based on agency data. 
 American automakers -- General Motors and Ford Motor -- and the Japanese makers Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor typically avoid penalties by using past or future year mileage credits to offset noncompliance. Some automakers also qualify for a 1.2 m.p.g. credit for making vehicles able to run on E85, a blend mixing gasoline with 85 percent ethanol.

HEADLINE: Urban Success Story, With Hint of Unease For Poorer Residents

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 The heart of the downtown here spreads out like an oddly shaped T -- from west to east for a half-mile along Main Street, and from north to south down a shorter stretch on Mamaroneck Avenue, where new restaurants, pharmacies and wine stores seem to sprout by the day. 
 The steady drone of cars, once an aberration of sorts within the city's nucleus, is now intrinsic to its fabric. And pedestrians, a rarity after dark just a few years back, stroll around at all times, amid the concrete-and-glass towers that rise like shiny exclamation points into an otherwise barren skyline.
 ''I like to say that I live in a small city with a big-city vibe,'' said Jordan Bachelder, 29, a financial adviser who traded a rental studio apartment in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan for a one-bedroom condo here in 2004. 
 ''I guess you can call it the suburbs,'' he added. ''But with all that's around, it doesn't feel like the suburbs to me.''
 Nine years ago, when Mayor Joseph M. Delfino was first elected, downtown White Plains felt somewhat abandoned, its commercial arteries pockmarked by shuttered shopfronts, dollar stores and crumbling facades -- echoes of the recession that had upended the local economy in the early 1990s. At the time, the area's most memorable landmark was the vacant site of a former Macy's department store, a cavernous hole at the corner of Main and Mamaroneck. 
 Today, downtown is a study in contradictions, a place where brands as popular as Wal-Mart and Target and as exclusive as Trump and Ritz-Carlton occupy prominent spots in a newly developed strip spanning four city blocks. It is a place where luxurious condominiums stand near public housing projects that are home to many of the city's working poor; and where mothers chat in Spanish at a Dunkin' Donuts, while young professionals tap on laptops in a Starbucks on the opposite side of the street.
 ''Our dream was to design a city that if you lived here, worked here or visited here, you didn't have to go anywhere else,'' said Mr. Delfino, a Republican who is now in his third term as mayor. ''I think we've met that objective.''
 But the pace and depth of the transformation, arguably the most remarkable traits of the downtown renaissance, have also been a source of concern to some low-income residents, who fear that they may be pushed out as the area gentrifies.
 ''I love the way downtown looks, but is there a place for working people like me in the new downtown? I don't know,'' said Darryl Jenkins, 53, who has lived at the Winbrook Houses, a downtown public housing development, for more than 30 years. ''It seems that all the homes that have been built so far are for rich people.''
 White Plains sits about 30 miles north of Times Square and 30 to 50 minutes by train from Grand Central Terminal. It has about 60,000 residents, but the population quadruples during the day, as thousands of people come to work and shop in the city. The office vacancy rate now hovers below 7 percent, he added, down from a high of 34 percent in the last decade. 
 The plan for the new downtown, which Mayor Delfino began working on almost as soon as he took office, borrowed from some of the same elements that cities including Boston, Chicago and Madison, Wis., had used to awaken their dormant cores: a mixture of retail, residential and entertainment projects that turned the area from a passage to a destination.
 The city took the first steps, in ways big and small: It installed new lamp posts, planted flowerbeds and trees, gave out grants to help landlords spruce up their properties and bought a machine to loosen up old chewing gum stuck to benches and sidewalks. 
 What is perhaps most unusual about the plan, though, is how fast it has unfolded, given that few developers seemed inclined at first to invest in a downtown that had yet to turn a corner. 
 In 2003, downtown White Plains saw the conclusion of its first significant development, a $325 million project called City Center, which replaced the abandoned Macy's store. The complex includes a Trump Tower, where some condos have sold for more than $1 million; luxury rental units in a doorman high-rise; several chain stores and restaurants and a multiscreen movie theater, the city's first since the early 1990s.
 Last month, the latest addition opened its doors: a Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where a 2,140-square-foot presidential suite can be booked for $5,000 a night. (The cheapest rooms -- which, like all the others, feature his and her sinks, separate bathtubs and showers, flat-screen televisions and iPod docking stations -- cost $369.) 
 The hotel occupies the lower floors of a 44-story tower that provides a clear view of the Manhattan skyline. Some 185 condos rise above it, priced from $750,000 to $8 million; all but six of the units have been sold, according to Matthew Vesely, the property's director of sales and marketing. A second residential tower is set to open next summer. Another luxury condominium complex is set to break ground on Main Street, near North Broadway, sometime next year, with units priced from $500,000 to $2.9 million.
 ''White Plains is a whole different city,'' said Louis R. Cappelli, who developed the Ritz-Carlton and City Center projects. ''It's a balanced city.''
 In all, White Plains officials have approved the construction of 4,400 units of housing downtown, and more than half of them have been built -- the first residential projects developed in the area since 1989, Mayor Delfino said. Most of the new construction is geared toward upper-class dwellers, a move the mayor said was necessary to balance the disparity in income among downtown residents. Ten years ago, he explained, 8 out of every 10 families that lived downtown fell in the low- or middle-income category; today, about half of the downtown families make more than $100,000 a year. 
 John McIlwain, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington, said that a resurgent downtown needed wealthier residents to support its retail base, but that the challenge was to retain an eclectic mix of backgrounds, which is vital to its city character.
 ''You don't want to prevent gentrification, but you want to find ways that the people who already live there can stay,'' Mr. McIlwain said. One strategy, he added, is to compel developers to provide a certain amount of affordable housing with each upscale project they build.
 In White Plains, the requirement is 6 percent of the overall number of upscale units constructed; in most cases, the income threshold for most affordable units stands at 80 percent of the city's median family income, $71,891, said the deputy mayor, Paul Wood.
 Rita Z. Malmud, president of the White Plains Common Council, said that the goal of the development was ''not to turn downtown into a playground for the rich,'' but that the area needed to achieve ''the right mix.''
 She added, ''What we have to make sure is that downtown remains a welcoming place to people of all races, all income levels and all stripes as we move forward.''

HEADLINE: Iraq War Taking Back Seat to Domestic Issues as Pressing Campaign Topic

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Marc Santora contributed reporting from Londonderry, N.H.

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
The Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are navigating a far different set of issues as they approach the Iowa caucuses on Thursday than when they first started campaigning here a year ago, and that is likely to change even more as the campaigns move to New Hampshire and across the country.
 Even though polls show that Iowa Democrats still consider the war in Iraq the top issue facing the country, the war is becoming a less defining issue among Democrats nationally, and it has moved to the back of the stage in the rush of campaign rallies, town hall meetings and speeches that are bringing the caucus competition to an end. Instead, candidates are being asked about, and are increasingly talking about, the mortgage crisis, rising gas costs, health care, immigration, the environment and taxes. 
 The shift suggests that economic anxiety may be at least matching national security as a factor driving the 2008 presidential contest as the voting begins.
 The campaigns are moving to recalibrate what they are saying amid signs of this changing backdrop; gone are the days when debates and television advertisements were filled with references to Iraq.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York recently produced a television advertisement that attacked the Bush administration for failing to deal with ''America's housing crisis.'' Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Republican, has begun talking about expanding health care coverage, an issue of particular concern in New Hampshire. 
 ''People say that health care is a Democratic issue,'' he said. ''Baloney.''
 John Edwards of North Carolina has a ready answer when asked about immigration at rallies here -- a subject that rarely if ever came up at Democratic gatherings a year ago. He drew cheers at a New Year's Day rally in Ames when he said that while he would support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, he would insist that none could become naturalized ''until they learned to speak English.''
 Part of the shift appears to stem from the reduction in violence in Iraq after President Bush's decision to send more troops there last year. Mrs. Clinton, who once faced intense opposition from her party's left over her vote to authorize the war, now is rarely pressed on it, though Democrats say it continues be a drag on her in this state. Senator John McCain, a strong proponent of increased troop levels, is off of the defensive and now positions himself as having been prescient about what would work to quell the violence. 
 ''You see much more concern about the economy,'' said Mark Penn, Mrs. Clinton's chief strategist. ''You see much more concern about health care. When we started it was principally concern about the war, and now it's a mix of war, the economy and health care.''
 Alex Castellanos, a senior strategist for Mr. Romney, said much the same thing was happening on the Republican side and suggested that it may have contributed to the success of Mike Huckabee, the Republican former governor of Arkansas.
 ''As concern in the economy grows, you've seen in both parties this populist strain of appealing to voters,'' Mr. Castellanos said.
 The shift in emphasis is also a reflection of the fact that New Hampshire is, politically, a very different place from Iowa, especially for Republicans. A central part of the Republican appeal here has been to social conservatives on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage; they have far less sway in New Hampshire.
 In that state, where the primary is held Jan. 8, Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney and Mrs. Clinton have begun broadcasting advertisements that talk about cutting taxes and reducing government spending. Both those issues have historically proved to have great resonance with New Hampshire voters, and particularly with independents who are allowed to vote in either primary.
 This is not to suggest that Iraq is no longer a pressing issue for many voters. Senator Barack Obama points to his unwavering opposition to the war in a television advertisement being broadcast in the final hours here, and Mr. McCain is pointing to his early advocacy of increasing troop levels in Iraq as evidence that he had more national security credentials than Mr. Romney.
 What has changed, though, is that the war in Iraq is far from the only issue driving this election, the result of the decline in carnage there and daily reports that the nation's economy might be in trouble. 
 ''I still think the war is a real important issue,'' said David Axelrod, a senior strategist for Mr. Obama. ''But the sense of economic insecurity has grown and pushed those other issues up on the list of concerns.''
 That has become increasingly evident in what the candidates are hearing from voters. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were pressed on Social Security, gaps in Medicare coverage, the economic threat to middle class from the alternative minimum tax and rising energy costs. All the candidates are hearing, at virtually every stop, questions about immigration and trade deals.
 And it was increasingly evident in what the candidates were choosing to say at a time when they were enjoying as big as a stage as they will during this caucus season. In his speeches, Mr. Obama is spending less time speaking about the war than he once did, instead talking about a ''retirement system that is in tatters,'' and the loss of jobs to Mexico. Mr. McCain talked about Iraq and Pakistan, but moved to on to talk about education, health care and global warming.
 ''There are a number of challenges facing us domestically,'' Mr. McCain said Wednesday in Londonderry, N.H.
 Mrs. Clinton is devoting a long portion of her closing speech to health care. Mr. Huckabee's closing stump speech is devoted to economic anxiety, as he criticizes Wall Street and hedge funds managers and says that the wealthy cannot understand the concerns of everyday people. 
 And Mr. Edwards on Wednesday seized on the news that oil prices had reached $100 a barrel to reprise the populist message that long ago eclipsed the war as the central thrust of the campaign. ''Today's report that the price of oil has reached $100 a barrel is just another example of how corporate greed is squeezing the middle class,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Laugh About the Lord

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: SERGEANT BLUFF, Iowa 

 BODY:
 ''People ask me, 'Do you believe in resurrection?''' Mike Huckabee told a few hundred people in Sergeant Bluff, outside Sioux City, on his final campaign swing through Iowa. ''Of course I do. Dead people vote in every election we have in Arkansas. Resurrection is real to us!'' 
 It was the signature rhetorical device of his Republican presidential campaign, a distinctive genre of humor that might be called the Jesus joke. It could border on blasphemous from the mouth of another orator, but for Mr. Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister before he became governor of Arkansas, a few laughs about the Lord can help fend off tough debate questions, warm up a crowd and remind fellow evangelicals of his Christian credentials without unnerving secular-minded voters. 
 Mr. Huckabee never brings up the Mormon faith of his rival Mitt Romney, but he does not have to. In a state where conservative Christians usually make up more than a quarter of Republican caucusgoers, suspicions about Mormonism have undeniably helped propel him from dark horse to front-runner.
 As the Iowa campaign nears an end, Mr. Huckabee's closing argument centers on the question of consistency about issues like abortion. But what most distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field has been his increasingly heated populist appeals to voters' economic anxieties. He squares off against ''Wall Street,'' ''hedge fund managers'' and ''East Coast establishment Republicans,'' and emphasizes his own humble roots as ''the son of a firefighter who worked a second job.'' 
 ''People knew my father from the shipyard, not Harvard,'' he said Wednesday in Mason City. 
 That sets up a stark contrast with Mr. Romney, whose own millions are financing a vast voter turnout effort. ''How many people in America,'' Mr. Huckabee said, ''could relate to a person who could write checks for tens of millions of dollars and not miss it at all in their lifestyle?'' 
 ''No matter how many television ads, and no matter how many radio ads, and no matter how many telephone calls that come right during your dinner hour, and no matter how many pieces of mail stuffed in your mailbox, what it still comes down to is you want someone who is authentic, you want someone who is consistent, and you want someone who can lead and who has the experience and who has been re-elected by voters with the affirmation that somehow he has done something right.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey School Plan Hinges on Odd Alliances

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Ever since Gov. Jon S. Corzine unveiled his plan three weeks ago to overhaul the way New Jersey finances its schools, he has witnessed the formation of unexpected alliances that either favor the new way he wants the state to dispense billions of dollars or strenuously oppose it.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Corzine met with officials from Hudson County who have been among his staunchest political supporters, including Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy of Jersey City, who vehemently opposes the governor's plan on the grounds that it shortchanges poor and urban districts, and may result in sizable local tax increases. 
 At first, Mr. Corzine's plan also upset another longtime ally, the New Jersey Education Association, which represents teachers and is considered the most powerful labor group in the state. But last week the group changed its mind after lobbying successfully for changes, and it is now aligned with a group that supports providing parents with vouchers to send their children to the public schools of their choice.
 Under the governor's original proposal, the state would funnel more money to children who live outside the poorer districts, which now receive more than half of all state aid, and apportion funds to schools based on demographics like family income, language ability and special academic needs. Overall spending would increase by $532.8 million the first year.
 To win over the teachers' union, the Corzine administration agreed to loosen a provision requiring about 120 school districts that are already spending more than what the state deemed to be adequate to return any excess money to local taxpayers. Instead, the districts would be allowed to keep more of that money to help deal with inflation.
 Neither Democrats nor Republicans are lining up in a predictably partisan fashion. Democrats like State Senator Sandra Bolden Cunningham, who represents Jersey City, and Newark's mayor, Cory A. Booker, have expressed the strongest reservations to the plan put forward by Mr. Corzine, a Democrat. Yet some Republicans, including Assemblyman Bill Baroni of Mercer County, have been among the most supportive.
 The scramble is a reminder of how the politics of education in a state with more than 600 school districts is often unpredictable, and colored by such factors as geography and race. 
 For now, it is uncertain whether the bill will survive intact when it is taken up by the Assembly and Senate budget committees on Thursday, or approved by the end of the legislative year on Tuesday.
 ''It's a cliche, but politics makes strange bedfellows, and when you talk about this kind of financing, it really is a political issue,'' said Joseph R. Marbach, a political scientist at Seton Hall University. ''Before, it was often a traditional split, urban versus suburban, but this formula really cuts across the lines in so many ways.''
 For more than two decades, the task of financing public schools in New Jersey has been guided by a State Supreme Court case, Abbott v. Burke, which found that students in poor and urban districts were not receiving the same education as their counterparts in wealthier suburbs.
 Some districts, called Abbott districts, have made great strides in narrowing the achievement gap between rich and poor students, whites and minorities. But some have not. And the term ''Abbott'' has become such a polarizing code word that Mr. Corzine said last month at a news conference announcing his formula, ''I would hope that over a period of time we will earn our way out of that.''
 In a sign of just how determined Mr. Corzine is to get the formula signed into law soon, the Assembly Budget and Education Committees convened a rare joint hearing during Christmas week to question Mr. Corzine's education commissioner, Lucille E. Davy. 
 It was there, in an 11-hour hearing, that the president of the New Jersey Education Association, Joyce Powell, came out in favor of the plan.
 And while some Republicans, whose support Mr. Corzine was said to be working hard to gain, have been receptive, others are demanding more changes. 
 On Wednesday, the departing Senate minority leader, Leonard Lance, and his successor, Thomas H. Kean Jr., proposed that any new formula should link additional school financing to spending cuts in the budget.
 Getting enough Democrats on board could prove to be just as hard for Mr. Corzine. With Jersey City scheduled to receive the minimum increase in funds, 2 percent a year, Mr. Healy told the governor that basic cost-of-living increases would force his city -- which has raised taxes by 20 percent in the last three years -- to raise taxes by up to $1,000 a household each year.
 As a result, he warned that the city would work with the Education Law Center, a nonprofit group that represents the Abbott plaintiffs, to sue the state if necessary.
 ''If this stays the way it is, and it passes in lame duck,'' Mr. Healy said, ''I don't know what other recourse we have.''

PERSON: Michael Goldberg 

HEADLINE: Michael Goldberg, 83, Abstract Expressionist

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Michael Goldberg, an abstract painter of the New York School whose vibrant works are in major museums and private collections, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 83.
 The apparent cause was a heart attack he suffered while working in his studio on the Bowery, said his wife, the artist Lynn Umlauf. It was the same studio he took over from Mark Rothko in the 1950s. 
 Mr. Goldberg was a painter of strong convictions who in his youth was influenced by the gestural Abstract Expressionist mode of older painters like Kline, Still and de Kooning, and never abandoned it. The improvisational nature of jazz, which he admired, was also important to his work. 
 Stuck like some of his peers with the label ''second-generation Abstract Expressionist,'' Mr. Goldberg shrugged it off. ''Labels come and go,'' he told Saul Ostrow, the conceptual artist who was a close friend, in a 2001 interview for the magazine Bomb. ''It makes no difference to what you're trying to do.''
 He saw abstract painting, he told Mr. Ostrow, as ''still the primary visual challenge of our time. It might get harder and harder to make an abstract image that's believable, but I think that just makes the challenge greater.''
 Mr. Goldberg and his wife both taught at the School of Visual Arts. Since 1980 he had spent five months of each year in Tuscany, Italy, on an estate outside Siena. Most of the works produced there last summer appeared in his show at Knoedler & Company in September. Done with oil sticks pressed directly against the canvas, a method Mr. Goldberg chose some years ago over brushing with paint, they are energetic productions based on what he called a ''quasi grid,'' with patchy squares of color intersected at random by strong diagonals.
 Born in the Bronx on Dec. 24, 1924, Michael Goldberg began classes at the Art Students League at 14. From 1940 to 1942 he attended the school run by the Abstract Expressionist painter and teacher Hans Hofmann. His studies were interrupted at 18 when he volunteered for Army service in World War II. He became a master sergeant in North Africa and Burma with the commando unit known as Merrill's Marauders. Mr. Goldberg received a Purple Heart and the Bronze Star that was awarded to every member of the unit.
 After further study at the League and the Hofmann school, he set up shop as a painter, eventually occupying Rothko's Bowery loft. Hanging out at the Cedar Street Tavern and with the Eighth Street Club, a discussion group founded by downtown artists in 1949, he came under the influence of Abstract Expressionism.
 In 1951 his work made its first public appearance in the Ninth Street Show, a groundbreaking exhibition of the new New York avant-garde organized by the club and the dealer Leo Castelli. In 1953 the Tibor de Nagy Gallery gave him his first solo show.
 Besides Ms. Umlauf, whom he met in 1969 and married 10 years later, Mr. Goldberg is survived by a younger brother, Gerald Jay Goldberg, of Manhattan, and two stepchildren from an earlier marriage to the writer Patsy Southgate: Luke Matthiessen of Brooklyn and Sara Carey Matthiessen of Northport, L.I. 
 In his youth, he reminisced, he and his colleagues never expected to make money at painting and created art just for themselves. When buyers began to appear in the mid 1950s, he recalled, the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. came to his studio one day and bought $10,000 worth of his work, to be paid in $2,500 installments. Unemployed at the time, with no bank account, Mr. Goldberg received the first payment on a freezing midwinter day. His first act was to buy an electric blanket. He spent the weekend in bed under the blanket, the money tucked beneath his arm.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Jan. 4 about the Abstract painter Michael Goldberg referred incorrectly to his Army service in World War II. Under his original name, which was Sylvan Goldberg, he served in the China-Burma-India Theater, where many of the soldiers styled themselves as Merrill's Marauders, after the commando unit headed by Brig. Gen. Frank D. Merrill. But there is no indication that he served in the unit itself, according to the records of Robert Passanisi, a historian and archivist of the Marauders who served with them. Mr. Passanisi pointed out the error last week, and this correction was further delayed for research.

HEADLINE: Economy and Geopolitics Decide Where Oil Goes Next

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
NOW that the price of crude oil has crossed the $100-a-barrel threshold, and then retreated slightly, what direction will it take now?
 Many experts say it will go up, then down, and then maybe up again. That, anyway, has been the pattern of the last several years of volatile prices.
 The arguments for even higher oil prices are well known. The economies of China and India are booming and hungry for energy. Oil fields in Mexico, the United States and several other oil producers are drying up, tightening world supplies. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is using oil as a political weapon. Rebels in Nigeria are creating havoc in some of Africa's most productive oil fields. 
 The war in Iraq rages on. The dollar is weakening, causing hedge funds and traders to flee to oil and other commodities as a safe haven. 
 But all those factors were in play last summer when the price fell to about $60 a barrel, before it rallied at the end of the year. The price touched $100 on Wednesday and surpassed that briefly on Thursday before retreating after the government reported higher-than-expected heating oil and gasoline supplies. The price settled at $99.18 a barrel, down 44 cents.
 ''Predicting oil prices continually demonstrates the perils of prophecy, because oil prices are the derivative of what happens in the global economy and global geopolitics,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Mr. Yergin said he could foresee oil prices surging as high as $150 in the next few years or falling as low as $40. 
 John Richels, president of the Devon Energy Corporation, an international oil and gas company based in Oklahoma City, said $150 a barrel was possible, but so was $55. ''We have to make investments based on our outlook over a long period of time,'' he said. ''It is tough.''
 Central to the question of where oil prices will go is the effect of high prices on the consumption and development of alternative fuels. 
 Large amounts of public and private investment are going into solar, wind and biofuel development, but so far they are making only a slight contribution to energy supplies. Scientific and engineering leaps, like developing the atomic bomb or sending a man to the moon, can be made relatively quickly, but they are still measured in years.
 Until now, most economists have been surprised that the rise in oil prices -- from as low as $11 less than a decade ago -- has not had a greater effect on American consumers. But with oil prices rising at an increasingly rapid rate over the last few months in conjunction with the housing market slump and credit squeeze, many economists now wonder whether oil prices could tip the economy into a recession.
 A recession, of course, would curb oil demand. That would push oil prices right back down again, or so the theory goes, as fewer consumers drive to the mall, companies produce and ship less and world trade slows.
 ''If we are slowing down, we will not be buying as much goods from China and services from India,'' said Addison Armstrong, director for market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker that deals with banks and hedge funds. ''My forecast for 2008 is that crude prices will average $75 a barrel, and that is based on a scenario of a slowing economy in the United States.''
 But Mr. Armstrong and other experts cautioned that a protracted insurgency in Nigeria, a punishing hurricane season or other unpredictable events could take oil prices up even more. 
 So why are oil prices going up now? The military situation in Iraq is arguably improving, and Iraqi oil exports are beginning to flow again. Tensions with Iran have eased a bit. There are forecasts for a mild late winter in the United States, which should help bolster oil and gasoline inventories going into the spring and summer driving season. 
 Many experts say the answer lies in the investment decisions of traders and hedge funds. With the markets in equities, housing, credit and currency shaky in the United States, traders are betting on oil and other commodities as a perceived safe haven. 
 Phil Flynn, a vice president and market analyst with the Alaron Trading Corporation in Chicago, said the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve had underscored for traders the depths of the country's economic risks and led them to buy oil futures.
 Mr. Flynn said he thought that oil prices were more likely to fall than rise, ''because I think the factors that drove us to today are unlikely to repeat in 2008.'' He added that he thinks the dollar will find a bottom in 2008 and that the problems in housing are already priced into the markets. 
 But most experts say that if oil prices do go down, they will probably not go down very far or for very long.
 Mr. Richels of Devon Energy said that consumers in Europe and Japan were not feeling the same pressure as Americans because their currencies have been strengthening and not weakening.
 ''There is still a lot of demand that is outside of the United States,'' Mr. Richels said. ''There is increasing oil consumption, particularly in the developing nations, and oil is getting more difficult to find.''

HEADLINE: Securities, In a Swoon, Come Home

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his new blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
What better time of year is there than New Year's Eve to release some bad news? 
 On the other hand, what better time of year is there for a money manager to engage in a little window dressing to make a portfolio look better?
 Either way, one end-of-year incident in 2007 illustrates two absurdities: the techniques that banks use to make themselves appear healthier than they really are, and the determination of some portfolio managers to get dubious-looking securities out of their portfolios by the end of the year. 
 Perhaps, just perhaps, it also shows that some investors have overreacted to the credit squeeze of 2007, and that there really are buying opportunities around.
 The bank in question is Zions Bancorporation, which operates in 10 Western states from a base in Utah. On the afternoon of Dec. 31, it notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had been forced to bail out an off-balance-sheet affiliate by purchasing $840 million of securities from it. That move produced an immediate loss of $33 million, since Zions paid more than the securities were worth.
 Zions added that the affiliate, called Lockhart Funding, still owns $2.1 billion of securities, which it estimates are worth $22 million less than book value. Under the current accounting rules, it doesn't have to take that loss. At least not yet.
 Let's first look at Lockhart and why it exists. In a world with sensible bank regulations, and accounting that reflected economic reality, it would never have been created.
 Lockhart, which was set up by Zions in 2000, provides the cash for Zions to make small business loans. Zions turns those loans into securities and sells the securities to Lockhart, which then borrows money in the commercial paper market. Lockhart also buys securities not put together by Zions.
 Why bother? First, the loans disappear from Zions' books. Second, the bank regulators accept that fiction when they calculate how much capital Zions needs to have. As Clark B. Hinckley, a Zions senior vice president, told me, ''It enabled us to essentially originate these loans and not have to keep tangible capital behind them.''
 The reason this is all fictional is that Zions has a ''liquidity agreement'' with Lockhart. If any of the securities go bad, Zions will buy them at book value. If Lockhart cannot raise money by selling commercial paper to investors, Zions will buy the paper or buy some of Lockhart's assets. For all practical purposes, Lockhart is part of Zions.
 Zions has disclosed this arrangement over the years, so investors presumably understood it. But the arrangement made Zions appear to be better capitalized than it really was. The same is true of dozens of other banks.
 The reason for the last-minute disclosure of the purchase of assets is that as 2007 ended Lockhart found it impossible to sell enough asset-backed commercial paper, even though Zions itself has purchased $710 million of Lockhart paper. Since Lockhart could not sell the paper, Zions had to buy the assets.
 And that brings us to the evidence of investor absurdity. An investor buying Lockhart's asset-backed commercial paper knew that Lockhart's assets backed the commercial paper. If that was not enough, the liquidity agreement means Zions effectively stands behind the paper.
 Mr. Hinckley reports that these days Zions can, and does, borrow in the unsecured commercial paper market, and at lower rates than Lockhart was offering to pay. That seems odd. Why would anyone prefer lower-yielding paper with less security? If I'm willing to lend you money without collateral, why would I refuse to lend if the loan was backed by both collateral and your promise to repay, and had a higher interest rate?
 The answer is that asset-backed commercial paper has gotten a bad name, as unwary investors learned that the assets in question sometimes were funny securities backed by subprime mortgages. So money managers, whose year-end portfolios will be subject to scrutiny by customers, fled from such paper. The amount of outstanding asset-backed commercial paper declined rapidly as the end of the year approached, although it edged up this week, after the year-end numbers were recorded.
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the bank regulators know all about this, and they have been talking about making changes for years. But it is complicated, and nothing seems to happen.
 We probably will get action if and when there is a good scandal. Perhaps some bank will fail even though it seemed to have plenty of capital. Then there will be expressions of shock, and calls for changing the rules to reflect economic reality. In the meantime, banks will be able to keep assets off their books -- until they have to report the losses when the assets go bad.

HEADLINE: United Arab Emirates: Link To U.S. Dollar Kept

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The United Arab Emirates will keep a 30-year link between its currency, the dirham, and the United States dollar, after completing a review of its currency regime, said the central bank governor, Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi, left. ''In 12 months I can say to you that the U.A.E. will maintain the peg,'' Mr. Suwaidi said. ''We have come to the conclusion that the inflation problem does not lie with the peg against the U.S. dollar.'' The dirham is fixed to the dollar at 3.6725. ''We were studying the causes of inflation, and we came to the conclusion that the causes are not in the dirham/U.S. dollar peg, therefore we need not do anything on that front,'' Mr. Suwaidi said.

HEADLINE: Dealing With the Dragon

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On both Wednesday and Thursday, the price of oil briefly hit $100 a barrel. The new record made headlines, as well it should have. But what does it mean, aside from the obvious point that the economy is under extra pressure?
 Well, one thing it means is that we're having the wrong discussion about foreign policy. 
 Almost all the foreign policy talk in this presidential campaign has been motivated, one way or another, by 9/11 and the war in Iraq. Yet it's a very good bet that the biggest foreign policy issues for the next president will involve the Far East rather than the Middle East. In particular, the crucial questions are likely to involve the consequences of China's economic growth.
 Turn to any of several major concerns now facing America, and in each case it's startling how large a role China plays.
 Start with the soaring price of oil. Unlike the oil crises that followed the Yom Kippur War and the overthrow of the shah of Iran, this crisis wasn't caused by events in the Middle East that disrupted world oil supply. Instead, it had its roots in Asia.
 It's true that the global supply of oil has been growing sluggishly, mainly because the world is, bit by bit, running out of the stuff: big oil discoveries have become rare, and when oil is found, it's harder to get at. But the reason oil supply hasn't been able to keep up with demand is surging oil consumption in newly industrializing economies -- above all, in China.
 Even now, China accounts for about only 9 percent of the world's demand for oil. But because China's oil demand has been rising along with its economy, in recent years China has been responsible for about a third of the growth in world oil consumption. 
 As a result, oil at $100 a barrel is, in large part, a made-in-China phenomenon.
 Speaking of made in China, that brings us to a second issue. There's growing concern in this country about the effects of globalization on wages, largely because imports of manufactured goods from low-wage countries have surged, doubling as a share of G.D.P. since 1993. And more than half of that rise reflects the explosive growth of U.S. industrial imports from China, which went from less than 0.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1993 to more than 2 percent in 2006.
 Last, but most important, is the issue of climate change, which will eventually be recognized as the most crucial problem facing America and the world -- maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of our lives.
 Why is climate change a China issue? Well, China is already, by some estimates, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And as with oil demand, China plays a disproportionate role in emissions growth. In fact, between 2000 and 2005 China accounted for more than half the increase in the world's emissions of carbon dioxide.
 What this means is that any attempt to mitigate global warming will be woefully inadequate unless it includes China.
 Indeed, back in 2001, when he reneged on his campaign promise to limit greenhouse gas emissions, President Bush cited the fact that the Kyoto treaty didn't include China and India as an excuse for doing nothing. But the real problem is how to make China part of the solution.
 So what does all this tell us about the presidential race?
 On the Republican side, foreign policy talk is all bluster and braggadocio. To listen to the G.O.P. candidates, you'd think it was still February 2003, when the national discourse was dominated by people who thought that American military might was sufficient to shock and awe the rest of the world into doing our bidding. 
 Memo: China has 50 times the population of Iraq.
 The Democrats in general make far more sense. But among at least some of Barack Obama's supporters there seems to be a belief that if their candidate is elected, the world's problems will melt away in the face of his multicultural charisma. 
 Memo: It won't work on the Chinese.
 The truth is that China is too big to be bullied, and the Chinese are too cynical to be charmed. But while they are our competitors in important respects, they're not our enemies, and they can be dealt with. 
 A lot of Americans, when they think about the next president's foreign-policy qualifications, seem to be looking for a hero -- someone who will stand tall against terrorists, or transform the world with his optimism. 
 But what they should be looking for is something more prosaic -- a good negotiator, someone who can bargain effectively with some very tough customers and get the deals we need on energy, currency policy and carbon credits.

HEADLINE: The Power of Immigration to Divide

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Immigration and the Candidates'' (editorial, Dec. 30):
 You imply that liberal Democrats are in agreement that the 12 million immigrants in the United States illegally should be welcomed into legal status because they are here and it is unrealistic to do otherwise. 
 This is one liberal who believes that amnesty (or whatever euphemism you prefer), in addition to fostering a diminution of respect for the law, will serve as a signal to millions of others that if they can get here, they are home free. 
 Even the most generous of societies has to recognize the limits of its resources. With the world's population rising fast, we cannot address the unchecked growth of underdeveloped areas by admitting everybody to this country. 
 Any policy that signals a pseudo-open border will intensify the many resource problems we are already bumping up against. The Census Bureau predicts that if our immigration policy is not changed, our population will exceed 400 million by 2050.
 The answer is not a fence across the South; as you say, 40 percent of illegal immigrants enter legally and overstay their visas. But amnesty is not the answer either. Carl Mezoff
 Stamford, Conn., Dec. 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 None of our presidential candidates or Congressional politicians seem to be aware of the law of averages. If we had a secure border, combined with a temporary moratorium on legal immigration, we could bring our average total immigration levels back to historical norms.
 A moratorium for 10 years, or perhaps 15, would cancel out the illegal immigration of recent years. This would also allow us to concentrate on a humane policy of assimilation for the millions of illegal immigrants who are here as a result of our government's failure to keep them out. 
 The moratorium approach is simple. Perhaps our politicians should just do something simple for a change.
 Ron Sheppe
 Rochester, N.H., Dec. 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial calls Senator John McCain the ''single voice of reason in the Republican camp'' on immigration. Yet he was an original sponsor of the immigration bill requiring that immigrants ''earn'' citizenship. 
 I bristle at the thought. Most of the presumably illegal immigrants I have observed in Texas have already earned their right to be American citizens. 
 Many have taken jobs that can only be classified as heavy and dangerous labor -- stone work, ditch digging and other backbreaking work. Some have taken jobs that no one else wanted, like cleaning toilets or restaurant kitchens. Others have stepped in to help Americans clean their homes and raise their children.
 All this has been accomplished at substandard wages, too often not remotely enough to live on. By being willing to work hard for very little money, haven't our illegal immigrants already ''earned'' their citizenship?
 Claude M. Gruener
 Austin, Tex., Dec. 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial supports ''assimilation'' of illegal immigrants, rather than ''expulsion.'' If only the rest of us could ignore the law and receive your backing. 
 As with the free trade issue, do you suggest we just ignore the immigration problem and forge ahead on faith alone? This has been symptomatic of our country for decades: influential and powerful business leaders and political leaders ignore the effects of their policies on the middle class. 
 It is not right for an immigrant to break the law to gain advantage over those who apply legally or for an employer to do so in pursuit of a business advantage. If chief executives went to jail, think how fast the immigration crisis would end. Harold Tuchel 
 Waterloo, Iowa, Dec. 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The focus on economics and jobs to the exclusion of all else in the current debate about immigration is most unfortunate. 
 It is demeaning to all of us. The contributions of our immigrant ancestors (or selves) and their descendants are not solely or even primarily economic. Music, science, art, law, religion, writing, education, medicine, aviation, the exploration of space, communications, and so many other fields of learning and achievement -- do these count for nothing? 
 Remember, almost all of us are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. What gives us the right to seal our borders and turn away the poor and the oppressed? What right do we have to remain on this land and cover it with our shopping malls and housing developments?
 The only hope of redemption we have is to admit that our own ancestors acted out of desperation, just as today's immigrants do, and to welcome those who come seeking a better life.

 To the Editor:
 In the third paragraph of your editorial, you pose the question ''What should be the role of immigrant labor in our economy?'' Near the end you say, ''The issue has left the country divided, fretful and ambivalent, and voters are yearning for honesty and thoughtfulness.'' Well said.
 What we sorely need is a dialogue on the law -- a discussion The New York Times should spearhead. But this is the topic you skirt. What is the law? To whom does it apply? When should it be enforced and for whom? If enough people break a law, is it no longer enforceable? What is the value of law? 
 These are questions law-abiding taxpayers ask themselves. At the risk of oversimplifying, what laws can I break, and will you write an opinion piece defending my right to do so? The vacuum will be filled when these questions are answered. Ann Marie Ottaviano

HEADLINE: Open for Tours in North Korea, Strictly Guided

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: KAESONG, North Korea 

 BODY:
Under the gaze of a bronze statue of Kim Il-sung standing atop a hill, a convoy of 11 buses packed with South Koreans wound its way through this quiet city center in North Korea, which was opened up to daily tours early in December and is now suddenly host to hundreds of mostly South Korean tourists seven days a week.
 Bus No. 1 came to a halt at a street corner, temporarily blocking two middle-aged North Korean women from crossing the street and producing a telling moment in the short history of tourism in the North. Finding themselves only feet away from North Koreans -- real, live North Koreans who were neither guides nor minders -- the South Korean tourists stared at the two women outside, some even pressing their noses against the bus windows.
 The two women, wearing gray overcoats and the kind of high-heeled boots that seemed to be in fashion here, smiled in embarrassment. Then they waved at the South Korean tourists, who waved back just as the bus started moving. 
 And so went a recent visit to Kaesong, the product of a rare period of relative openness in the North, which strictly controls even the glimpses it provides of itself to the outside. Waved to, most women waved back. Men nodded. Schoolchildren, who could be seen going about unaccompanied by adults, did not fail to return a wave.
 Although the North missed its year-end deadline to declare all of its nuclear activities and disable its main nuclear site, it seems to be on track to do so eventually. Its improving relations with the United States were punctuated recently by the announcement that the New York Philharmonic would play in Pyongyang, the capital, in February, at North Korea's invitation.
 Entry by foreigners to Pyongyang tends to be strictly controlled. But the tours to Kaesong, like those to the Mount Kumgang area in North Korea's southeastern section, are open to all foreigners, including journalists, as long as they pay the fee of about $180 for a one-day trip.
 The Mount Kumgang area has received outsiders for almost a decade now, but it remains a Potemkin-like resort fenced off from surrounding villages. By contrast, Kaesong is a real city, one that, judging from the hand-painted wooden traffic signs and total absence of cars on its often unpaved streets, the authorities have not tried to transform into a Pyongyang-like showcase.
 An ancient capital that eventually fell to the North during the Korean War, Kaesong lies just north of the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean Peninsula and is a two-hour drive from Seoul. It is considered richer than other parts of the North because thousands of its residents work in a South Korean-run special industrial zone just outside the city.
 The tours here start in Seoul around 6 a.m. and are run by Hyundai Asan, the South Korean company that developed the industrial zone and is planning to start regular tours to Mount Paektu, along the North's border with China, and possibly to Pyongyang next spring. 
 One morning last week, most of the tourists were elderly South Koreans, though they included the young as well as non-Koreans.
 Once inside North Korea, South Korean guides reminded the tourists that taking photographs from inside the bus, or of anything but approved tourist spots, was forbidden. The convoy went up the highway alongside the expanding special industrial zone and past hills denuded of trees.
 ''Let's get rid of U.S. imperialism!'' read a red-and-white banner on the side of a building next to the highway.
 The first stop was Pakyon Falls. South Korean tourists posed for photos in front of the 121-foot waterfall, many of them trying to get the falls as well as a North Korean guide holding a big white bullhorn in the same picture. ''Take a picture with the waterfall,'' the guide told one man who had mustered up the courage to ask her directly to pose for him.
 At a stall selling drinks, though, a saleswoman dressed in a Christmassy pink fur-collared costume welcomed photographs and said flirtatiously that she should be paid a modeling fee.
 ''Ginseng tea? Coffee?'' she offered.
 One of the many North Korean guides traveling inside the buses came over. Smiling broadly, the guide, who was in his 40s, said he had been dispatched from Pyongyang to help out with Kaesong's opening. 
 ''It would be good to normalize relations with the United States,'' he said, expressing an opinion repeated by two other guides. ''We could focus our resources on developing our economy. From the U.S. perspective, it would no longer be threatened by our nuclear arms.''
 ''Our relations began improving after our nuclear tests last year,'' he added, dragging on a cigarette. ''The U.S. is basically afraid of nuclear proliferation, and we showed them who we are.''
 Another guide, in his 30s, said normalization would allow North Korea to shift its resources from defense so that it could become an ''economic power.''
 Compared with guides at Mount Kumgang or the Kaesong industrial complex a couple of years ago, some of the guides here, who wore elegant long overcoats and scarves, were indistinguishable from their South Korean counterparts. 
 ''I also sell fresh mountain water,'' the woman at the stall said in a sing-song voice. ''I even sell hangover pills.''
 One bus was filled with South Koreans who had grown up in Kaesong and were returning for the first time in six decades. Everything had changed, they said, except the very same tourist spots they were visiting.
 On the steps leading to Sungyang, a Confucian lecture hall, another North Korean guide with a white bullhorn was dramatically interrupted by an old man who jabbed a large finger in the air and yelled out: ''Why isn't there a nameplate on the entrance? Every Korean house should have a nameplate.''
 Flustered, the guide remained speechless as the South Koreans streamed past her into the hall. Inside, though, she said, ''The Japanese imperialists took the nameplate and burned it during the occupation.''
 Later, the man with the large finger, Lee Hee-tae, 80, who had lived here until the Korean War, said he was dissatisfied with the answer. ''I don't think the Japanese took it,'' he said, ''because I saw it after the end of the Japanese occupation.''
 Overhearing his comments, a young North Korean guide asked, ''Is there anything wrong?''
 After listening to Mr. Lee's explanation, the guide said simply, ''I can't believe you remember what happened 60 years ago.''

HEADLINE: As Expected, Ford Falls From 2nd Place in U.S. Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Ford Motor had been in second place in the American car market since the Great Depression. But it lost its grip last year. 
 Toyota beat Ford in 2007 in United States auto sales, putting it behind General Motors, industry statistics showed Thursday. Ford had held the No. 2 spot since 1931, according to the company's historian.
 Ford sales fell 12 percent last year, compared with 2006, while Toyota's sales rose 2.7 percent. Its three brands -- Toyota, Lexus and Scion -- beat Ford's three American brands by nearly 234,000 vehicles, according to figures from Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. 
 To be sure, Toyota's victory was not a surprise, since Ford's own projections at the start of the year conceded that Toyota would probably pass it. But Ford's displacement was another psychological blow to the 104-year-old car company. It is struggling to keep its North American turnaround on track amid a housing slump, high gas prices and weak consumer confidence. 
 Moreover, the move is another milestone for Toyota, which surged past Chrysler into third place in 2006 and has reported record sales for 12 consecutive years.
 G.M., whose sales fell 6 percent in 2007, remained ahead of Toyota by more than 1.1 million vehicles in the United States, but the two companies were locked in a close battle for No. 1 worldwide. Toyota briefly led G.M. in global sales last year, but G.M. regained the lead last summer.
 Chrysler reported a 3 percent decline for the full year, ending up in fourth place.
 But these days, executives in Detroit insist that they are no longer caught up in sales races, mostly because their companies' future depends on bringing back profits.
 ''The most important thing that we're driving to is to return our business to profitability in 2009,'' said George Pipas, chief sales analyst at Ford.
 First, though, the carmakers must get through 2008, which by most forecasts will be the industry's worst year since at least 1998. Over all, light-vehicle sales are expected to fall well below 16 million.
 In 2007, sales declined 2.5 percent, to 16.15 million from 16.56 million. Detroit's automakers accounted for just 51.1 percent of the total, the lowest share ever, according to Autodata.
 Ford had the greatest decline. Its market share fell to 14.8 percent in 2007 from 16.4 a year earlier. Despite its recent push to sell more cars, they accounted for most of Ford's decline. Some of that was intentional, as the company discontinued the old Taurus sedan and sold 142,000 fewer vehicles to rental-car companies in an effort to raise profit margins. It has since revived the Taurus name.
 ''While the decline is relatively large, much of it was anticipated at the beginning of the year,'' Mr. Pipas said.
 Still, Mr. Pipas acknowledged that Ford's sales in December came in short of internal projections for the second straight month.
 G.M.'s share of the United States market fell to 23.5 percent, from 24.3 percent in 2006. G.M. also cut sales to rental companies to the lowest level in nine years, the company said. Chrysler, whose share was flat at 12.9 percent, said it plans to make a big reduction in fleet sales this year, though it was not more specific.
 All three Detroit companies managed to pare down their inventory of unsold vehicles significantly in 2007, by cutting production of slow-selling models and offering year-end deals. G.M. and Chrysler both said their year-end inventory was the lowest since 1994.
 G.M. and Ford have announced sizable cuts in their first-quarter production. Chrysler also is reducing production, and eliminating 10,000 jobs, in addition to cuts made last year. 
 As part of that plan, about 5,000 positions at five plants, including a Jeep factory in Detroit, a sedan factory in Sterling Heights, Mich., and a small-car factory in Belvidere, Ill., will be eliminated in February and March, Chrysler said Thursday. 
 Chrysler announced the cuts last fall, only days after it reached a new agreement with the United Automobile Workers union.
 Chrysler Promotion
 Chrysler appointed its purchasing chief, Simon Boag, to head its manufacturing partnerships with overseas automakers.
 Succeeding Mr. Boag, 42, will be John P. Campi, a former procurement executive at Home Depot, where the current chief executive of Chrysler, Robert L. Nardelli, was previously chief executive.
 Chrysler is looking to form partnerships with companies like Chery Automobile of China to expand product lineups and keep assembly plants running with minimal investment. Chrysler is also talking to Nissan about a manufacturing partnership, according to the chief executive of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn.

HEADLINE: Even Trucks Hit the Wall In an Erratic 2007

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
They may be built like a rock, be able to haul boulders and hail from deep in the heart of Texas. But pickup tricks cannot stand up to tough economic times.
 Final sales tallies announced Thursday showed that 2007 was the year the pickup hit the wall.
 That's bad news for auto companies, which have long relied on pickups as a steady supplier of hefty profits as they responded to consumers' shifting tastes for other vehicles. 
 Even when sport utility vehicles lost their allure earlier this decade, pickups hung on, fueled by the need among builders and business owners to replace their workhorses, and by the need of some drivers to own the biggest wheels on the block.
 But analysts say that high gasoline prices, the housing slump and the uncertain economy are causing pickup drivers to hold off trekking to the dealer.
 ''Pickup truck sales are victims of the economic conditions we're now in,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
 At Ford Motor, sales of the F-series pickup fell 13.2 percent in 2007, even though the F-series was the best-selling vehicle in the country for the 31st straight year.
 General Motors, whose new Chevrolet Silverado got off to a strong start when it was introduced last winter, watched inventories pile up on showroom lots in the fall. Sales of Silverados, which now carry rebates of up to $2,000, fell 2.8 percent in 2007. 
 G.M. is cutting truck production this winter and will eliminate several thousand union jobs.
 Meanwhile, Toyota missed its sales target of 200,000 new Tundra pickups in 2007, winding up about 4,000 short. It was a rare disappointment for the Japanese automaker, which deliberately sets conservative sales goals and generally exceeds them.
 Collapsing pickup sales were a primary reason that Detroit plummeted to its lowest market share ever last year, taking just 51 percent of American sales, versus 49 percent for its foreign rivals, according to an Autodata estimate. 
 Over all, industry sales were the lowest since 1998, at 16.1 million vehicles, down 2.5 percent from 2006. Indeed, the slide of Ford's F-series helped Toyota pass the company to take second place in the American market for the first time, behind G.M. 
 The drop in the pickup truck market follows a slump in sales of S.U.V.'s, whose sales are down one-third from their peak in 2002. 
 But there are reasons Detroit worries more about lost pickup sales than S.U.V.'s. After all, S.U.V. drivers often simply shifted to other models. Many switched to crossover vehicles, which are S.U.V.'s built on car underpinnings, making them easier to handle and more fuel-efficient.
 But pickup truck owners, known for their intense brand loyalty, rarely buy another type of vehicle, especially if they use their trucks for business.
 Toyota thought it could hit its sales goal for the Tundra by courting commercial customers, such as ranchers, construction workers and landscaping crews. Executives were heartened by warm reviews for the truck, which Automobile Magazine called ''a big truck with the mindset of a faithful servant.''
 Instead, the market softened just as the latest Tundra landed in showrooms, causing its sales to fall short. 
 Even so, Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis at the Power Information Network, a division of the research firm J. D. Power and Associates, said Toyota's shortfall was not significant. 
 ''They did basically what they said they were going to do, in a segment where the other manufacturers would do almost anything to protect themselves,'' he said.
 Given the positive reviews for the Tundra, Mr. Pinelli of Autodata said it was clear the problem was not the Tundra itself, but the selling environment. Long-term, he said, the Tundra would most likely attract more buyers once the overall market rebounds.
 In the short-term, however, auto companies and industry analysts are predicting some of the weakest sales in more than a decade -- just in time for another wave of newly designed pickups arriving this year. 
 Ford, for example, will show the latest incarnation of the F-series in 10 days, during preview days at the Detroit auto show. 
 Meanwhile, Chrysler has a new version of the Dodge Ram that it plans to unveil at the Chicago auto show in February. Ram sales fell 2 percent in 2007, and Chrysler introduced a new incentive program Thursday, offering interest-free loans or $2,500 rebates on many of its vehicles. The deals run through Feb. 28.
 Toyota will show a concept pickup at the Detroit show called the A-BAT, for ''advanced breakthrough aero truck.'' 
 Jalopnik.com, a Web site for automobile enthusiasts, likened its futuristic looks to those of the Honda Ridgeline, another victim of the pickup truck woes of 2007.
 Sales of the Ridgeline, which is based on the Honda Pilot S.U.V., fell 15 percent in 2007, even though Honda posted its 11th straight year of higher sales in the United States. Nissan's Titan fell 9.2 percent from 2006.
 Mr. Libby said auto companies, who have never hesitated to offer big rebates on their big trucks, would fight hard to attract customers. ''I don't see any lessening of the competition going forward,'' he said. ''If anything it's just going to get worse.''

HEADLINE: Reports Show Signs of Continued Weakness in the Economy

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Reports on factory orders and the labor market released Thursday portrayed an economy that is skirting recession as attention shifts to government figures on employment to be released Friday.
 Demand for manufactured goods rose 1.5 percent in November, more than forecast and propelled by a surge at petroleum refiners, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Companies added 40,000 jobs in December, down from the previous month's 173,000 increase, a private employment service, ADP Employer Services, reported.
 The figures eased concern among some investors that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth is cooling as weaker job creation hurts spending by consumers already burdened by soaring energy costs and retreating home prices, economists said.
 Thursday's reports ''are worrisome without being catastrophic,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America. ''We are seeing continuing labor market weakness, but it still doesn't appear to be completely rolling over.''
 A Labor Department report on Thursday showed initial jobless claims decreased to 336,000 last week, from a two-year high of 357,000 the previous week. The total number of people collecting unemployment insurance rose for a fourth week, to the highest since October 2005.
 ''This is one piece of evidence that suggests maybe we can muddle through this period without going into recession,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight. Claims ''would have to go up to about 375,000-400,000 before the economy would be in real trouble.''
 The ADP figures, based on payroll data, come before Friday's report from the Labor Department, which is expected to show that the economy created 70,000 jobs last month, less than in November, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
 ''The slowdown in hiring is intensifying,'' said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort. ''Growth has slowed, and it makes the economy more vulnerable to a potential recession.''
 ADP considers only private employment and does not take into account hiring by government agencies. Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis produces the report with ADP.
 The 1.5 percent increase in factory orders was the biggest in four months and followed a revised 0.7 percent increase in October that was more than previously reported, the Commerce Department said. Excluding transportation, bookings rose 1.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Global-Minded Tata Chief Set to Get 2 Ford Luxury Lines

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
When Ratan Tata visited the home of the designer Ralph Lauren last autumn, the two auto enthusiasts spent much of the time in the garage, admiring Mr. Lauren's car collection, including the Batmobile-esque 1955 Jaguar XKD. 
 Now Mr. Tata is poised to take over Jaguar. 
 Tata Motors said Thursday that it was beginning detailed talks with the Ford Motor Company about buying the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, confirming what investors and analysts in India, Detroit and Britain have anticipated for months. Tata said it intended to reach an agreement over the next few weeks. 
 For Mr. Tata, who is 70, the takeover will cap 16 years of transforming one of the world's most diverse and unusual conglomerates, the Tata Group. Through 98 companies, Tata creates and sells products ranging from steel to tea to watches, making the company's name ubiquitous in India. Under Mr. Tata, the name has started to reverberate around the globe as well. 
 A string of international deals has diversified Tata to the point where more than half its revenue this year will come from outside India. Tata's increasingly global outlook is also bolstering the overseas ambitions of other Indian companies. 
 Going overseas was necessary, Mr. Tata said. In the late 1990s, the group's truck unit recorded a loss that was the ''biggest in Indian history,'' he said in a recent interview in Tata's headquarters in the leafy, historical Colaba district of Mumbai. ''We were so dependent on one economy,'' he said. ''I decided we needed a broader view.'' 
 Since then, Tata has done dozens of deals, buying businesses as diverse as the Tyco Global Network; Daewoo Commercial Vehicles; the Moroccan chemical company Imacid; Tetley Teas; and, most audaciously, the $11.3 billion takeover of the British steel maker Corus last year, a company several times the size of Tata Steel. The group's 27 listed companies have a market cap of over $70 billion, and the group reported after-tax profit of $2.8 billion in the last fiscal year -- a 33 percent increase from the year before, in part because of the Corus acquisition. 
 The latter deal garnered Mr. Tata some rare criticism, with analysts wondering if he had taken on too much. Corus ''came to us, we didn't seek them out,'' Mr. Tata said, and it was a deal he could not pass up. In ''one swoop we were in Europe, where we weren't before,'' he said. ''That opportunity was going to happen once, and it was not going to happen again.'' 
 The Tata Group is an unusual corporate enterprise. Started in 1868 by Jamsetji Tata, one of India's dwindling group of Parsis, the group has often seemed to value employees as much as profits (paying laid-off Tata Steel employees for the rest of their lives when the company made cuts, for example), and has prided itself on fair practices, rather than cut-throat maneuvering or paying bribes, a practice still prevalent in some of corporate India.
 Indeed, Mr. Tata seems the most unlikely of corporate titans -- almost preternaturally humble, unabashedly open about the company's mistakes and about the fact that he never really wanted to be an industrialist. He studied architecture at Cornell University. After decades of working for the family business, he says he is considering opening a small architecture firm when he retires. 
 He is a distant relative of the founder -- his father was adopted by the wife of one of Jamsetji's sons. Never married, he lavishes attention on his dogs, writes thank-you notes to employees who do him favors, and is often spied on Sundays driving alone on Marine Drive in Mumbai in one of the several cars he owns. 
 ''None of us observers of the Tatas could have predicted that he would grow and blossom the way he has and be in total charge of the company the way he has,'' said R. M. Lala, the author of several books about the family and companies, and a onetime director of the Tata Trust, a charity that finances health care and education projects in India. Other executives and companies may have made more money in India, Mr. Lala said, ''but Tata is still the most respected name in Indian industry.''
 As company chairman, Mr. Tata has been instrumental in carrying on the family legacy, and turning what was a loosely aligned group of companies that shared one name into a group with seven business lines and centralized management. 
 It is a business plan Mr. Tata developed in the most unlikely of settings -- he spent three months at his mother's bedside at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan in 1981. At the time he was chairman of Tata Industries, then a small part of the group responsible for new ventures. When he was named chairman in 1991, he started reining in some of the company's independently minded managers and giving the parent company sizable equity stakes in its offspring.
 The process was not easy, Mr. Tata wrote with typical candor in a 2003 epilogue to ''The Creation of Wealth,'' a book about the Tatas. 
 ''If I reflect on what these 10 years have been for me personally, they have been a mixed bag,'' he wrote. ''There is some satisfaction that I've seen the group come together in many ways,'' he wrote, but ''at the same time there is a sense of frustration at the resistance to change from many of my colleagues that I have seen through this period of time.'' All in all, he wrote, ''it has been a hard and sometimes unrewarding experience.''
 Outsiders do not see it that way, though. The Tata family has been ''all about building businesses and being far-sighted about it,'' said Tarun Jotwani, the chief executive of Lehman Brothers in India. What Mr. Tata has done very well is be the strategic and ethical head, while providing a ''culture of integrity,'' Mr. Jotwani said.
 Mr. Tata's reign may come to an end soon -- he says he is considering retiring after one of his pet projects, the $2,500 People's Car, hits showrooms this year. Mr. Tata has no heirs, and there is no likely family member to take over his role, meaning the man who brought the Tata Group to the rest of the world may be the last Tata to run the company.

HEADLINE: Bad Night for Status Quo On Right and Left, Victories by Outsiders Leave No Clear Path to Party Nominations

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
The Democratic and Republican establishments and their presidential candidates, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Gov. Mitt Romney, were brought low in Iowa on Thursday night, shaken seriously by two national newcomers who won decisively on messages of insurgency and change.
 The victors in Iowa, Senator Barack Obama for the Democrats and former Gov. Mike Huckabee for the Republicans, are as far from the status quo as possible. One is the son of a Kenyan father and a white Kansan mother who entered the United States Senate just three years ago. The other is a former Baptist minister who was best known until recently for losing over 100 pounds and taking on the issue of childhood obesity.
 The two winners burst the aura of strength and confidence that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Romney had tried to cultivate for months, and left both parties suddenly without a clear path to their nominating conventions, let alone November. 
 Mrs. Clinton's loss was especially glaring. Her central strategy for much of 2007 was to appear as the inevitable nominee, but Iowans shredded that notion. She tried in recent weeks to convince voters that another Clinton administration could be an agent of change, but Iowans clearly did not buy it. 
 Without question, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Romney have the money, the campaign apparatus and the legions of supporters to stay in the hunt for the nomination and to right their campaigns. But Mrs. Clinton's lackluster finish raises anew questions about her electability, and whether independent voters -- twice as many of whom backed Mr. Obama over her -- will ever come around to Mrs. Clinton.
 And Mr. Romney, who outspent Mr. Huckabee 6 to 1 in television advertising in Iowa, now faces a far more crowded field of rivals in the New Hampshire primary who are eager to tear into his wounded candidacy
 All the candidates now move to that primary on Tuesday, which Mrs. Clinton had tried to make a fire wall for her campaign, as it was for her husband's presidential candidacy in 1992, when he finished strongly in second place.
 ''If Hillary doesn't stop Obama in New Hampshire, Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee,'' said Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant who was John Kerry's senior strategist in 2004.
 Clinton advisers declined to say Thursday night if she would now pursue a different strategy against Mr. Obama. But a shift seems likely now that Mrs. Clinton's multilayered, sometimes contradictory message -- offering an experienced hand, for example, but also running as a candidate who could bring change -- fell flat in this first contest.
 ''We built a campaign for the long haul -- we feel very good about our operation in New Hampshire, and polling has us up,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton spokesman. The danger for Mrs. Clinton, of course, is that those polls may not hold after the outcome in Iowa.
 Further undercutting Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama peeled away broad swaths of women from her base of support, and the political potency of baby boomers fell apart in Iowa. Half of the Democrats under 45 said their first choice was Mr. Obama, according to a poll by Edison/Mitofsky of voters entering caucus sites.
 At the same time, it was also historic that so many Iowa Democrats voted for an African-American man and a woman. For Mr. Obama, especially, the ratification of his candidacy by Democrats and independents in a predominantly white and rural state suggests that he may be able to build a broad and multiracial coalition in his bid for the White House.
 The nomination fights will only intensify from now, though the steel that Mr. Huckabee will deploy in the battle is unclear. He seemed to come out of nowhere -- a former governor who was so little known among Republicans that many of them could not even name the state he once led (Arkansas) -- and turned from asterisk-status to giant-slayer in spite of a paltry political organization, slim dollars and a final week marked by gaffes.
 As when Pat Robertson made a surprise second-place showing in the Iowa caucuses in 1988, Mr. Huckabee enjoyed substantial political support from evangelical Christians and took advantage of a muddled Republican presidential field to gain his 11th-hour victory.
 For Mr. Romney, of Massachusetts, his loss will register as a deep blow to his candidacy -- a failure bound to worry establishment Republicans and wealthy donors who have viewed him as their man. It will also energize and inspire Republicans who are backing Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary.
 Mr. Romney's drive to the Republican nomination was supposed to begin with him looking formidable and confident coming out of Iowa. Mr. Romney, his wife and his sons planted themselves here for months and poured in money, including millions of his own; he now heads to New Hampshire clearly wounded and a target for even more rivals, like Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Senator Fred Thompson, and Mr. McCain, of Arizona.
 Mr. Huckabee, a folksy and fairly plain-speaking politician with a sense of humor that many Iowans enjoyed, appealed to Republican caucusgoers who put a premium on a candidate's Christian faith-- and who were deeply wary about seeing a Mormon, Mr. Romney, become president.
 But Mr. Huckabee also struck many populist themes that have deep appeal to middle-class Iowans and farmers, promising to tailor his economic priorities to their needs and taking tough stands on a key issue here, immigration.
 But Iowa voters are not New Hampshire voters, as Mr. Huckabee and his advisers are well aware. Devoutly religious voters do not exist in nearly the same numbers in the Granite State. And the fervent anti-tax sentiment among Republicans there is likely to clash with Mr. Huckabee's record of raising taxes in Arkansas.
 ''If Huckabee scares the Republican establishment and makes the party fear losing, you could see a rapid rallying around a second candidate,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant not working for any candidate. Still, he said, ''Nothing makes a man look like a leader more than a winner.''
 Mr. Robertson's Iowa victory in 1988 -- when he came in second to Bob Dole and edged out the ultimate nominee, George H. W. Bush -- gave him little bounce in New Hampshire, given the lack of a fervent evangelical base. ''I'm going to be the nominee,'' Mr. Robertson said right after his victory, crediting God in particular with his success. But his fortunes faded after a drubbing soon after in New Hampshire.
 Mr. Huckabee talked about God on the Iowa campaign trail, as well, but on Thursday night there was one other word that he -- as well as Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney, Mrs. Clinton, former Senator John Edwards -- discussed especially and emphatically: ''change.''
 As Mr. Edwards put it, ''the status quo lost and change won'' in the caucuses. Mr. Obama and Mr. Huckabee repeated the words incessantly in their victory speeches, brandishing the word as a talisman that overcame Mrs. Clinton's decades of experience and Mr. Romney's leadership bona fides. Yet change was not only the political message; change was the two men themselves.

HEADLINE: Germany Posts Month 21 Of Declining Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Of all the measures of Germany's economic revival over the last two years, none may be more telling than this: there are 711,000 fewer people out of work in this country than in 2006, and 1.5 million fewer than in 2005, when unemployment reached a peak of more than 5 million. 
 The German government released employment data for December on Thursday, surprising experts again with a larger-than-expected decrease in the number of unemployed -- 78,000, adjusting for seasonal variations. Economists had expected the number of people out of work to fall by 30,000. 
 It was the 21st consecutive month of falling numbers, and brought the jobless rate for December down to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent the month before, the lowest level since March 1993.
 ''This is the fastest decline in the history of the Federal Republic,'' Frank-Jurgen Weise, the chief of the Federal Labor Agency, said in Nuremberg, where the agency is based.
 Germany's labor market has benefited from a number of trends occurring around the same time, some more healthy than others. A buoyant global economy has created a ready market for exports. Demographics also play a role. Economists noted that with a low birth rate and an aging population, Germany has fewer working-age people to fill the jobs its reinvigorated economy is generating.
 Mr. Weise said he expected unemployment to fall further this year as more jobs are created. Other economists were more cautious, saying that the nation would face pressures including high oil prices, a rising currency and a weaker American economy.
 Germany's banishment of double-digit unemployment has been a political coup for Chancellor Angela Merkel. But some analysts worry that all the positive economic news is starting to influence political debate in a way that could undo the hard-won gains in the job market.
 The Social Democratic Party, which governs Germany in coalition with Mrs. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, is calling for the adoption of a national minimum wage. The country is one of just a few in Europe that do not have a national minimum.
 The Social Democrats have made the issue the centerpiece of their campaign in a state election this month in Hesse. Mrs. Merkel opposes a minimum wage on the ground that it could hurt job growth, but a majority of Germans support it, according to polls.
 Mrs. Merkel's vice chancellor, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a leading Social Democrat, said Germany should consider a minimum wage in the range of 7.20 euros ($10.62) to 7.50 euros ($11.06) an hour. By comparison, the minimum wage in France has been set at 8.27 euros ($12.19) since mid-2006; in Britain, it is $:5.52 ($10.89) an hour for workers 22 and older.
 Employer groups in Germany uniformly oppose a set minimum, and some economists agree that it could discourage hiring. Germany, they say, has recaptured its competitiveness, in part by resisting pressure for big pay increases.
 ''The German labor market is working better because the unions have lost power,'' said Holger Schmieding, head of European economics at Bank of America in London. ''This is an attempt to correct that by having the government set wages in sectors where the unions are not strong enough to do it.''
 Other economists said it was not a minimum wage itself, but the level at which it was set, that mattered.
 Bert Rurup, the chairman of a group of five economists known as the ''council of wise men'' who advise the government, said a minimum wage, at a moderate level, would not hamper employment.
 He pointed to a 2006 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which found that a wage of 4.50 euros an hour (now $6.63) would affect only 1 percent of full-time employees, and potentially even fewer if trainees were excluded.
 Some economists said it was inevitable that Germany would adopt a minimum wage, given that nearly three quarters of European Union members have one, as does the United States. 
 ''The big question,'' said Martin W. Hufner, an independent economist, ''is will the unions be able to push it up to 7.50 euros, which would destroy jobs? Or will it end up at 6 or 6.50, which would be tolerable?'' 
 Another big question is whether Germany will be able to sustain its employment momentum. In recent weeks, investment banks and academic institutions have trimmed their forecasts for German growth this year, with most now predicting less than 2 percent.
 ''Germany is in excellent shape domestically,'' Mr. Schmieding said. ''The bad news is that it is being hit by an awful series of shocks. It would be a success if we got half the employment gains we got in 2007.''
 While Germany now exports much of its goods to fast-growing markets in Asia, Russia and the Middle East, economists say it will not be able to shrug off a faltering American economy. Nor will it escape the effects of the euro, which rose to a rate of $1.4744 to the dollar in New York late Thursday.
 ''Germany surprised most of the experts in 2007,'' Mr. Rurup said. ''But it did so largely on the strength of the external economy. We will see a weakening of that trend in 2008.''

HEADLINE: Bush Ponders Move to Bolster Economy

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush said Thursday that he was considering whether to propose a stimulus package to shore up the economy, the clearest indication yet of a growing concern inside the White House over rising oil prices, the subprime mortgage crisis and the possibility of recession.
 ''I'm concerned about people losing their homes and paying a lot for gasoline,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview with Reuters. 
 Asked if he intended to do anything more to help people stay in their homes, the president volunteered the idea of an economic stimulus package, although he said he had not made up his mind and would probably not do so until sometime around his State of the Union address, which he delivers on Jan. 28. 
 ''In terms of any stimulus package, we're considering all options,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 He and his aides ''are listening to a lot of good ideas from different people,'' he said, adding that ''we've got our people out there carefully not only monitoring the situation, but listening to ways -- possible remedies.''
 White House officials would not discuss the options under consideration and said the president was unlikely to make any decision about whether to offer a package, much less what it might entail, until after he returns from a weeklong trip to the Middle East that begins next Tuesday.
 But it is a safe bet that tax cuts, long a centerpiece of the Bush domestic agenda, would be a feature of any administration initiative. And it is an equally safe bet that Democrats, who are contemplating their own economic stimulus package, would object, saying further tax cuts are unaffordable.
 Mr. Bush plans to meet Friday with his working group on financial markets, a panel that includes Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Fed cut interest rates three times last year, and minutes of its most recent meeting show that some of its members believe rates may have to be cut again to curb the uncertainty in the credit and housing markets, disquiet that in turn could depress consumer spending.
 Mr. Bush has repeatedly said economic fundamentals are strong, a theme he is likely to echo Monday in Chicago when he delivers a speech on the economy. But with polls showing that the economy has eclipsed Iraq as the leading concern among voters, and with Democrats warning of a ''Bush recession,'' it has become increasingly apparent that inside the White House, there is a growing feeling that he cannot leave the economy to its own devices in his final year as president.
 Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way back from Crawford, Tex., on Tuesday, Mr. Bush's counselor, Ed Gillespie, said one of the president's top priorities this year would be making his tax cuts permanent. But Mr. Gillespie also went on to hint that the administration might do even more.
 ''We shouldn't have the economy and consumers and investors wonder whether or not those tax cuts will expire; that's not healthy at a time when we cannot take economic growth for granted,'' Mr. Gillespie said, before adding, ''We'll do what we think is appropriate to continue to foster economic growth.''
 Though Mr. Gillespie said he was not prepared to ''unveil any policy,'' Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the second-ranking House Republican, told reporters last month that a stimulus package seemed likely. 
 ''You have President Clinton's secretary of the Treasury and President Bush both talking about an economic stimulus package,'' Mr. Blunt said, referring to Lawrence H. Summers, who has advocated tax cuts to bolster the economy. ''There's more likely to develop some kind of consensus around that, and my belief is the president intends to head in that direction as well.''

HEADLINE: The Two Earthquakes

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

DATELINE: Ottumwa, Iowa 

 BODY:
 I've been through election nights that brought a political earthquake to the country. I've never been through an election night that brought two.
 Barack Obama has won the Iowa caucuses. You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel moved by this. An African-American man wins a closely fought campaign in a pivotal state. He beats two strong opponents, including the mighty Clinton machine. He does it in a system that favors rural voters. He does it by getting young voters to come out to the caucuses. 
 This is a huge moment. It's one of those times when a movement that seemed ethereal and idealistic became a reality and took on political substance. 
 Iowa won't settle the race, but the rest of the primary season is going to be colored by the glow of this result. Whatever their political affiliations, Americans are going to feel good about the Obama victory, which is a story of youth, possibility and unity through diversity -- the primordial themes of the American experience. 
 And Americans are not going to want to see this stopped. When an African-American man is leading a juggernaut to the White House, do you want to be the one to stand up and say No? 
 Obama has achieved something remarkable. At first blush, his speeches are abstract, secular sermons of personal uplift -- filled with disquisitions on the nature of hope and the contours of change.
 He talks about erasing old categories like red and blue (and implicitly, black and white) and replacing them with new categories, of which the most important are new and old. He seems at first more preoccupied with changing thinking than changing legislation. 
 Yet over the course of his speeches and over the course of this campaign, he has persuaded many Iowans that there is substance here as well. He built a great organization and produced a tangible victory. 
 He's made Hillary Clinton, with her wonkish, pragmatic approach to politics, seem uninspired. He's made John Edwards, with his angry cries that ''corporate greed is killing your children's future,'' seem old-fashioned. Edwards's political career is probably over. 
 Obama is changing the tone of American liberalism, and maybe American politics, too. 
 On the Republican side, my message is: Be not afraid. Some people are going to tell you that Mike Huckabee's victory last night in Iowa represents a triumph for the creationist crusaders. Wrong. 
 Huckabee won because he tapped into realities that other Republicans have been slow to recognize. First, evangelicals have changed. Huckabee is the first ironic evangelical on the national stage. He's funny, campy (see his Chuck Norris fixation) and he's not at war with modern culture. 
 Second, Huckabee understands much better than Mitt Romney that we have a crisis of authority in this country. People have lost faith in their leaders' ability to respond to problems. While Romney embodies the leadership class, Huckabee went after it. He criticized Wall Street and K Street. Most importantly, he sensed that conservatives do not believe their own movement is well led. He took on Rush Limbaugh, the Club for Growth and even President Bush. The old guard threw everything they had at him, and their diminished power is now exposed. 
 Third, Huckabee understands how middle-class anxiety is really lived. Democrats talk about wages. But real middle-class families have more to fear economically from divorce than from a free trade pact. A person's lifetime prospects will be threatened more by single parenting than by outsourcing. Huckabee understands that economic well-being is fused with social and moral well-being, and he talks about the inter-relationship in a way no other candidate has. 
 In that sense, Huckabee's victory is not a step into the past. It opens up the way for a new coalition.
 A conservatism that recognizes stable families as the foundation of economic growth is not hard to imagine. A conservatism that loves capitalism but distrusts capitalists is not hard to imagine either. Adam Smith felt this way. A conservatism that pays attention to people making less than $50,000 a year is the only conservatism worth defending.
 Will Huckabee move on and lead this new conservatism? Highly doubtful. The past few weeks have exposed his serious flaws as a presidential candidate. His foreign policy knowledge is minimal. His lapses into amateurishness simply won't fly in a national campaign.
 So the race will move on to New Hampshire. Mitt Romney is now grievously wounded. Romney represents what's left of Republicanism 1.0. Huckabee and McCain represent half-formed iterations of Republicanism 2.0. My guess is Republicans will now swing behind McCain in order to stop Mike. 
 Huckabee probably won't be the nominee, but starting last night in Iowa, an evangelical began the Republican Reformation.

HEADLINE: Let It Start Now

 BODY:
The candidates have spent a year and tens of millions of dollars in Iowa, and Thursday night the first actual voters offered their first assessments. Some candidates and their strategists were hoping the caucuses and the New Hampshire primary next week would settle the race, weeding out the contenders for the two major parties' presidential nominations. Watching the campaign in cold, snowy and mostly empty Iowa, we were hoping for something else -- that this year's Iowa-New Hampshire rush to judgment will be the last. 
 For all of Thursday night's drama, the results in Iowa did not preclude a race going into New Hampshire, and, we hope, beyond -- to South Carolina, Florida and the cluster of primaries on Feb. 5. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton, but she's got plenty of money left, and John Edwards got a boost. Mike Huckabee's win was unlikely to deter Mitt Romney or the Republicans who did not contest Iowa: John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani. 
 Keeping this race alive so significant numbers of Americans in more populated states can participate would begin to make up for the ludicrous spectacle of the past year, which enriched the television networks and the political consultants (some $300 million already spent) far more than it enriched the political dialogue. We hope both parties will wake up and end the undemocratic system in which the choice of a new president rests far too heavily on nonbinding votes in January by voters that don't necessarily represent the rest of the country.
 We don't question the enthusiasm or the commitment of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire. But Iowa, where a huge turnout amounts to less than 10 percent of the population, is about 92 percent white, more rural and older than the rest of the nation. New Hampshire has a non-Hispanic white population of about 95 percent. Iowa's Democrats are more liberal and more protectionist than the nation's Democrats. Its Republicans are more conservative, and religiously driven, than the nation's Republicans. And yet, The Boston Globe reported that Mr. Romney spent $7 million on ads in Iowa. That's nearly $4 per registered voter.
 We believe the time has long passed for both parties to not only break the Iowa-New Hampshire habit but also end the damaging race to be third, with states pushing their primaries closer and closer to New Year's Day. 
 Instead, the country should adopt a more sensible and more representative system of regional primaries, in which states are divided into regional groups that vote on a designated day. The honor of going first would rotate year to year among the regions. That would give a far broader range of American voters a say in this vitally important choice.
 Make no mistake, there are choices to be made in this first election in many, many years in which both parties' nominations are being contested. Most of the Republican contenders (with the exception, most of the time, of Senator John McCain) offer the same kind of politics of division that has so polarized this nation over the last seven years. It is a politics that thrives on religious and social intolerance and fear.
 Mr. Huckabee, the Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor, cloaks himself in affability and Christianity. But he bullied Mr. Romney into pleading with religious conservatives to accept his Mormon faith as Christian enough for a Republican nominee and, after professing charity, has recently become a scourge of undocumented immigrants. 
 Fear often appears to be the only plank on which Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, is standing, when you can tell where he is standing at all. Mr. Giuliani, who parlayed the 9/11 tragedy into a lucrative business and now speaks, bizarrely, of the ''9/11 generation,'' has switched his views a dizzying number of times -- on immigration, on abortion, on New York. 
 Almost as dizzying, in fact, as the pirouettes executed by Mr. Romney, who wants American voters to forget his record as governor of Massachusetts -- where he endorsed gay marriage and reproductive choice -- and believe what he says now that he wants to be president. Among Mr. Romney's tailored-for-the-campaign proposals is to double the size of the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which even President Bush knows must be closed.
 All of the Republicans want to continue President Bush's disaster of a war in Iraq, including Mr. McCain. He, however, has taken a courageous stand for immigration reform, which seemed to doom his candidacy last year, and is a strong advocate of the need to confront global warming and to stop the abuse of prisoners in Mr. Bush's system of secret prisons.
 The Democrats are united in their opposition to the war, but none have spelled out a persuasive plan for getting American troops home without setting off a wider conflagration.
 Senator Obama generates enormous excitement with his youth, and his promises of change -- even if it's not entirely clear what he intends to change or how. Senator Clinton, meanwhile, wavers between wanting to be seen as ready to serve as president because of her eight years in the White House with her husband -- and trying to satisfy voters' yearnings for new ideas and new ways. 
 Mr. Edwards has a strong populist message, but it sounds a bit odd coming from a former tort lawyer and hedge fund executive who ran as a completely different person in 2004. One of his ads features an out-of-work Maytag employee who said Mr. Edwards promised his 7-year-old son: ''I'm going to keep fighting for your daddy's job.'' We're still waiting for Mr. Edwards to explain how he, or any politician, can turn back the tide of economics and globalization. We'd prefer if he explained how to make it work for all Americans.
 None of this has led us to a choice in the nominating contests, never mind for the presidency. The majority of Americans are in the same position. That's why they should be allowed to see and hear more of these candidates, and not have to settle for the judgments of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: At Huckabee Central, Prayer Ushers Candidate to the Top

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
Just as the Republican caucuses began on Thursday at 6:30 p.m., a small group of women and children joined hands in the middle of the ballroom at Mike Huckabee's headquarters here and began to pray for his election.
 Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, rode a crest of evangelical Christian support to victory on Thursday over his rival Mitt Romney, capping a remarkable ascent over the last two months from near the bottom of the Republican field. A poll of people entering the Republican caucuses on Thursday showed more than 8 in 10 of his supporters identified themselves as evangelicals. 
 The same surveys showed extraordinary turnout among evangelicals, who represented some 60 percent of Republican caucusgoers. In years past, Republican Party leaders in Iowa put evangelical turnout at about 40 percent.
 Mr. Romney's advisers had been saying that if evangelical turnout rose to more than 50 percent, victory would be impossible for Mr. Romney, whose Mormon faith is regarded as heretical by many evangelicals. Mr. Romney's past support for abortion rights also troubled many Christian conservatives.
 Despite some major stumbles in the final stretch of his Iowa campaign as he endured a ferocious assault on his record from Mr. Romney, Mr. Huckabee struck a chord among Iowa Republicans with a distinctive mixture of humor, Christian conservatism and economic populism. 
 His stump speeches evoked comparisons to the prairie populism of William Jennings Bryan. And he charmed audiences with a witty and extemporaneous speaking style honed over 10 years in the pulpit as a preacher and local televangelist before he entered politics; he is a former governor of Arkansas. He told voters to pick a candidate who was ''consistent'' and ''authentic,'' an unstated contrast to Mr. Romney's recent conversion to opposing abortion rights.
 What most distinguished Mr. Huckabee from the rest of the Republican field, though, were his escalating appeals to the economic anxieties of lower-income voters. He emphasized his own roots as ''the son of a fireman who worked a second job,'' denounced stagnant wages and rising inequality, and portrayed his underfinanced fight with Mr. Romney as ''the people'' against ''the Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power''
 ''People would rather elect a president who reminds them of the guy they work with, not that guy who laid them off,'' Mr. Huckabee said at a campaign stop Thursday morning, invoking an implicit contrast with Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts.
 The centerpiece of his economic policies is the Fair Tax, a proposal to replace all payroll and income taxes with the combination of a national sales tax and cash rebates for the poor. Enthusiasts like Mr. Huckabee describe it as a way to jump-start the nation's economy and diminish inequality. Critics call it regressive and unworkable, and it has never gone far in Washington. 
 Mr. Huckabee's success has startled and unnerved many in his own party. His campaign has met derision and doubt from all three factions of the coalition that has made up the Republican Party since the election of President Ronald Reagan: antitax, foreign policy and social conservatives. 
 Antitax activists fault his record of spending on transportation, education and health care as governor of Arkansas. Hawks complain that his comments about courting the good will of other nations put him to the left of some Democrats on matters of foreign affairs, and they express anger at his criticism of President Bush's ''arrogant, bunker mentality'' foreign policy. 
 Even his natural allies among Christian conservative leaders have been slow to embrace Mr. Huckabee, in part because he sometimes appears to distance himself from their movement. He often faults fellow Christian conservatives, for example, for focusing too much on ''the gestation period'' in their respect for human life.
 In the final days of the race, Mr. Huckabee deviated further from what has been Republican orthodoxy. He stopped merely trumpeting the taxes that he cut in Arkansas and started defending the taxes he raised to pay for better roads, schools, health care, or parks that he said benefited working people.
 Just days before the caucuses, he twice reversed himself on the question of whether he would respond to Mr. Romney's criticisms with equally pointed attacks of his own, then drew loud guffaws from a roomful of reporters for appearing to want it both ways by screening for them an attack advertisement that he said he had decided not to run.
 For most of the race, Mr. Huckabee's shoestring campaign consisted of little more than a campaign manager, a press secretary and his daughter. He could not afford polls, focus groups or expert briefings, guiding his campaign largely by instinct. 
 His sudden surge in the polls at times left him appearing unprepared for the questions he faced, stumbling over details like the geography of Pakistan or suggesting erroneously that more illegal immigrants came from Pakistan than any other non-Latin-American country.
 Despite his ascent in Iowa, he faces daunting obstacles as he moves on to New Hampshire, where Christian conservatives are much less influential. Mr. Huckabee still badly trails the field in fund-raising. He raised less than $2.5 million in the first three quarters of 2007 and said he ended the Iowa caucus with about $2 million in the bank. By comparison, Mr. Romney raised nearly $70 million, including more than $17 million in personal loans he made to his campaign. 
 ''God help you and thank you for all you have done,'' Mr. Huckabee told his supporters on Thursday night. ''And now we have a long journey ahead of us.
 Mr. Huckabee has been traveling Iowa with his three dogs on his bus, and in the latest sign of the seat-of-the-pants nature of his campaign his aides were still struggling last night to find a way to transport the dogs to New Hampshire for the next leg of the race.

HEADLINE: OBAMA TAKES IOWA IN A BIG TURNOUT; HUCKABEE VICTOR

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, a first-term Democratic senator trying to become the nation's first African-American president, rolled to victory in the Iowa caucuses on Thursday night, lifted by a record turnout of voters who embraced his promise of change.
 The victory by Mr. Obama, 46, amounted to a startling setback for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, 60, of New York, who just months ago presented herself as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. The result left uncertain the prospects for John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, who had staked his second bid for the White House on winning Iowa. 
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards, who edged her out for second place by less than a percentage point, both vowed to stay in the race.
 ''They said this day would never come,'' Mr. Obama said as he claimed his victory at a packed rally in downtown Des Moines. 
 On the Republican side, Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who was barely a blip on the national scene just two months ago, defeated Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, delivering a serious setback to Mr. Romney's high-spending campaign and putting pressure on Mr. Romney to win in New Hampshire next Tuesday.
 Mr. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, was carried in large part by evangelical voters, who helped him withstand extensive spending by Mr. Romney on television advertising and a get-out-the-vote effort.
 ''Tonight we proved that American politics is still in the hands of ordinary folks like you,'' said Mr. Huckabee, who ran on a platform that combined economic populism with an appeal to social conservatives.
 Mr. Huckabee won with 34.4 percent of the delegate support, after 86 percent of precincts had reported. Mr. Romney had 25.4 percent, former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee had 13.4 percent and Senator John McCain of Arizona had 13.2 percent.
 On the Democratic side, with 100 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Obama had 37.6 percent of the delegate support, Mr. Edwards 29.8 percent and Mrs. Clinton had 29.5 percent. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico was fourth, at 2.11 percent.
 Two Democrats, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, dropped out of the race after winning only tiny percentages of the vote.
 A record number of Democrats turned out to caucus -- more than 239,000, compared with fewer than 125,0000 in 2004 -- producing scenes of overcrowded firehouses and schools and long lines of people waiting to register their preferences.
 The images stood as evidence of the success of Mr. Obama's effort to reach out to thousands of first-time caucusgoers, including many independent voters and younger voters. The huge turn-out -- by contrast, 108,000 Republicans caucused on Thursday -- demonstrated the extent to which opposition to President Bush has energized Democrats, and served as another warning to Republicans about the problems they face this November in swing states like this.
 Mr. Obama's victory in this overwhelmingly white state was a powerful answer to the question of whether America was prepared to vote for a black person for president. What was remarkable was the extent to which race was not a factor in this contest. Surveys of voters entering the caucuses also indicated that he had won the support of many independents, a development that his aides used to rebut suggestions from rivals that he could not win a general election. In addition, voters clearly rejected the argument that Mr. Obama does not have sufficient experience to take over the White House, a central point pressed by Mrs. Clinton.
 Mr. Obama took the stage, smiling broadly and clapping his hands in response to the roar of cheers that greeted him.
 ''They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.''
 The result sent tremors of apprehension through Mrs. Clinton's camp, and she promptly turned her attention to New Hampshire, flying there on a plane that left at midnight. Aides said that former President Bill Clinton would go there immediately and spend the next five days campaigning in a state where he has always been strong Mrs. Clinton, in her concession speech, sought again to embrace the mantle of change that has served Mr. Obama so well, even as she was flanked on the stage by a Mr. Clinton, his face frozen in a smile, and Madeleine K. Albright, who was Mr. Clinton's secretary of state.
 ''What is most important now is that, as we go on with this contest, that we keep focused on the two big issues, that we answer correctly the questions that each of us has posed,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''How will we win in November 2008 by nominating a candidate who will be able to go the distance and who will be the best president on Day One.''
 Mr. Edwards in his speech suggested that he had benefited from the same electoral forces that lifted Mr. Obama to victory. ''Continue on,'' Mr. Edwards shouted at supporters from the stage, his voice sounding hoarse. ''Thank you for second place.''
 In fact, he drew 29.8 percent of the delegates awarded, to Mrs. Clinton's 29.4 percent.
 Mr. Huckabee declared victory at a boisterous rally in which he rejoiced in his ability to overcome his better-financed opponent, who had spent much of the past year building up for a victory and had hammered Mr. Huckabee with negative advertisements over the past month here.
 ''We've learned that people really are more important then the purse,'' he said. 
 Mr. Romney will now make a stand in New Hampshire, where he has also invested heavily.
 ''Congratulations on the first round to Mike,'' Mr. Romney said on Fox News.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, had campaigned intermittently here over the past month, at one point hoping to take advantage of the unsettled field here to come in third. Instead, he came in sixth place, garnering just 3 percent.
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Huckabee face very different circumstances heading into New Hampshire and the states beyond. Polling suggested that a once overwhelming lead enjoyed by Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire was vanishing even before the results of Thursday's vote. Mrs. Clinton's advisers have long worried that a loss here would weaken her even more going into New Hampshire, stripping her both of claims to inevitability and to electability.
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama -- as well as Mr. Edwards -- face a rigorous and expensive run of nearly 25 contests between now and Feb. 5. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton appear far better-positioned, in terms of organization and money, to compete through that period, than Mr. Edwards. Though Mr. Edwards presented second place as a victory, he fell far short of winning -- as he had once sought to do -- and might find it difficult now to raise more money or find new supporters.
 Compared to Mr. Obama Mr. Huckabee's situation is much more tenuous, and his victory on Thursday did little to clarify the state of the Republican field. In New Hampshire, polls have shown Mr. McCain on the rise and little support for Mr. Huckabee. Mr. Giuliani has invested much of his time and money in Florida. And, as Mr. Romney's advisers noted tonight, he has more a foundation of money and support in many of the coming states.
 Iowa seemed particularly fertile ground for Mr. Huckabee. Polls of Republicans entering the caucus sites found that 60 percent described themselves as evangelical, and by overwhelming numbers they said they intended to vote for Mr. Huckabee.
 The polls, conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press, also left little doubt about the reasons for Mr. Obama's convincing victory here. He did much better among young voters.
 Voters here were far more interested in a candidate promising change -- as Mr. Obama was -- than one citing experience, the heart of Mrs. Clinton's appeal. Half of Democrats said their top factor in choosing a candidate was someone who could bring about change. Just 20 percent said the right experience, Mrs. Clinton's key argument, was the main factor.
 For all the talk about electability, barely one in 10 respondents said it was the main factor in their decision. 
 There was a sharp generational break in support of the two candidates. Mr. Obama was backed by 60 percent of voters under 25 while Mrs. Clinton was supported by about 45 percent of voters over 65.
 The survey of Democrats entering the caucus sites found that more than half said they were attending their first caucus -- and they divided with about 40 percent for Mr. Obama and about 30 percent for Mrs. Clinton.

HEADLINE: Stocks & Bonds: Wall Street Hesitant Before Jobs Report

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed narrowly mixed Thursday as investors traded cautiously ahead of a report on December employment that will be released Friday. Inflation jitters remained high as oil prices set another trading record above $100.
 Investors who sent shares skidding on Wednesday amid economic concerns and rising oil prices initially took some solace in a report released Thursday by the payroll company Automatic Data Processing. The report said the economy added 40,000 private-sector jobs in December, above the 30,000-job increase forecast by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
Also Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of newly laid off workers seeking unemployment benefits fell last week. But investors were mindful that these weekly readings can be volatile, and the latest reflected unusual factors related to the Christmas holiday. 
 Wall Street has for weeks been holding out for the December jobs snapshot to be issued Friday. The report, from the Labor Department, should indicate whether the solid job market that existed last year can continue into 2008 and help sustain consumer spending.
 In Japan on Friday, share prices plunged to their lowest finish since July 2006, losing ground after jittery trading on Wall Street amid concerns about the economy and rising oil prices.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index lost 616.37 points, or 4.03 percent, to finish Friday's half-day session at 14,691.41 points. The close was the index's lowest since it posted 14,500.26 points on July 19, 2006.
 Oil set a fresh trading record of $100.09 a barrel in New York trading after government figures showed a larger-than-expected decline in crude oil inventories. Analysts said more expensive oil was stirring some concerns about rising prices in general and whether the Federal Reserve would still have room to lower interest rates.
 ''We are worried about inflation,'' Nicholas Raich, director of equity research at the National City Private Client Group, said. ''That's probably the biggest risk in 2008.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,056.72, after moving higher and lower over the course of the session.
 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was unchanged at 1,447.16, and the Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.95 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,602.68.
 Linda A. Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, said on Thursday: ''There was nothing that was really that helpful in the economic reports today. The jobless claims were a little bit better, but they're still in a sideways pattern and the four-week average keeps moving up.'' 
 Bond prices rose as stocks retreated, increasing 3/32, to 102 29/32. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which trades opposite its price, dipped to 3.89 percent from 3.90 percent Wednesday. 
 The continuing rise in commodities prices, including a likely uptick in gasoline prices, makes some investors nervous about the pace of consumer spending.
 In corporate news on Thursday, shares of the State Street Corporation rose $6.49, or 8.2 percent, to $85.37 after the company said William W. Hunt had resigned as president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. State Street, a provider of mutual fund and pension-processing services, is preparing to book a $279 million fourth-quarter charge related to expected lawsuits over the weak performance of certain fixed-income strategies managed by the investment division.
 Shares of Monsanto rose $9.45, or 8.5 percent, to $120.92 after the company said its first-quarter profit nearly tripled.

 BODY:
Overview | In this lesson, students consider how they want to be perceived by others and create social networking profiles that could conceivably be posted online by literary characters or historical figures.
Author(s) | Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network
Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance | 1 hour
Objectives | Students will:

        
Analyze the personas they show to various people in their lives.
        
Learn about considerations made when creating an online profile for a social networking site by reading and discussing the article "Putting Your Best Cyberface Forward."
        
 Develop notes for online profiles of literary characters or historical figures based on the various personas they use.
        
Complete thoughtful profiles for their respective literary characters or historical figures.
Materials

        
pens/pencils
        
blank paper
        
classroom board
        
copies of the article "Putting Your Best Cyberface Forward" (one per student)
        
resources about online networking sites, especially user profiles (computers with Internet access, etc.) 
Activities / Procedures

        
Warm-Up/Do-Now: Before class, place a blank sheet of paper on each desk. Students respond to the following prompt (written on the board or copied into a handout before class for easier student access):
 "Divide the paper on your desk into four equal parts. Label each of the four sections with one of the following headings: 'Parents,' 'Friends,' 'Teachers' and 'Strangers.' It is normal for us to shape behaviors and appearances to try and control how we are perceived by others. Under each heading, write or draw the aspects of your personality that you show this audience on a regular basis. What character traits, habits, interests, sayings, activities, likes, dislikes, dreams, goals, etc. do you show each group of people?"
 After a few minutes, allow volunteers time to share their answers. Discuss why people have different "faces" for different people and why it may not be appropriate or necessary for everyone to be privy to all aspects of an individual. 
        
As a class, read and discuss the article, ("Putting Your Best Cyberface Forward"), focusing on the following questions:
What is "impression management"?What dilemma do people face when creating profiles for social networking Web sites?How seriously did you consider the questions addressed in the article when developing your profiles? If you do not have any profiles, how might you respond to these types of questions?What correlation has Joseph B. Walther made between the attractiveness of a person's friends on Facebook and how that person is perceived?What do you think about Mr. Walther's findings? Explain your answer.What considerations do online daters make to ensure that they appear "desirable" to others?According to the article, why do the existing sites inadvertently promote misrepresentation?What improvement does Keith N. Hampton recommend for making impression management online more honest and useful?How accurate is your profile?Explain to students that they will each be developing online profiles for a literary character or historical figure. This activity will provide an opportunity for students to examine these personalities more deeply. They will have to determine which aspects of persona to highlight when composing their online profiles. Briefly discuss with students (and list on the board) features they have on their own social networking profiles.Assign or have each student choose a character or historical figure. Subjects may be assigned using a novel, short story, play, event, country or era that is part of the current curriculum. Teachers may want to include characters from movies, if that is relevant to the curriculum. To study their characters or historical figures in depth, students should research and brainstorm answers to as many of the following questions and tasks that apply. Encourage students to expand or alter questions and tasks as they see fit. Remind students that online profiles are only as creative and thoughtful as the author's ideas and expertise allow. For each item offered, students will want to consider if their character or historical figure would tell the truth or make something up for the profile. Students should have rational support for each choice they make. (The following should be written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):
General Information 

        
Who is your character?
        
What is your character's screen name?
        
Would this character list his or her birth date or age range? If so, what would he or she state?
        
What type of picture would this character or personality post as a main image? Would it be a recent photo, an old photo, an icon, etc.?
        
What political or religious views might be conveyed in the profile?
        
Is this character or person married, single or divorced? Would he or she tell the truth or lie about his or her status?
        
What privacy settings would this character or person use to control this profile? Would he or she allow open access or require selective availability? (IMPORTANT: The answer to this question will shape the development of the profile.)
Details

        
What adjectives would you use to describe this person's behavior? How might this subject's personality affect the information found in this profile?
        
What are this person's strengths and weaknesses? How might these weaknesses be recast as strengths for an online networking profile?
        
What education, if any, would this character or person list?
        
How might this character or person describe his or her work, if applicable?
        
What might be listed under the "What are you doing right now?" prompt?
Networks and Groups

        
What characters or people would be part of this subject's networks or groups?
        
To what networks or groups might this character or personality belong?
        
What would other characters write on the "wall" or in the inbox of this figure? (For example, what would an antagonist write on a protagonist's "wall"?)
Just for Fun

        
What personal information would be listed? Include activities, interests, favorite music, television shows, movies and books, favorite quotations, etc.
        
What photographs or videos that would be posted to the profile? (Explanations can be written, or, if time allows, they can be drawn or printed or storyboarded.)
        
What applications would this character or person use to create his or her profile? For each application, consider what would be posted. Possible applications include events calendars, classified listings, notes, blog postings, virtual gifts, etc.
Once the notes have been completed, students will share their ideas with a partner and get feedback. Have the students take turns explaining their subject's profile and talking about who is meant to see that profile based on online privacy settings. Listening partners should consider how each item in the profile adds depth and meaning to the character or historical figure. To guide their comments and feedback, students should use sentence starters like:

        
"What this character shows this group is..."
        
"What I don't understand about this character is"
        
"What I would like to know more about is..."
After getting feedback, students should begin working on their online networking profiles.
In the last five minutes of class, students should discuss how this activity has helped them better understand a character or historical person, as well as this subject's contextual existence. 
Wrap-Up/Homework: Students will complete online social networking profiles for their characters using the notes and feedback generated during class. In a future class, students can share their work and create electronic profiles to be posted on the school's official Web site.
Further Questions for Discussion 

        
Do you think most people your age are self-conscious? Do you feel this will change with maturity? Why or why not and how?
        
What quality do you admire and would like to develop? Why?
        
How does an online networking site allow you to develop relationships you would not normally have?
        
How important is social networking to your current social life? Why or why not?
        
What are the benefits and drawbacks of social networking?
Evaluation / Assessment | Students will be evaluated based on completion of charts, participation in class and peer editing discussions, detailed and plausible notes, and thoughtfully composed online profiles.
Vocabulary | Emblazoned, tweak, demographic, pretentious, nefarious, culpable, imperviousness.

HEADLINE: In Hispanic Ritual, a Place for Faith and Celebration

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
On the day she was to become a woman, Monica Reyes sat in the front of the church for Mass. Her white dress -- sewn in her mother's hometown in Mexico -- spilled over her chair like an oversize lampshade.
 Then she stepped through the worn, wooden doors of St. Joseph's Church, in a Roman Catholic parish for generations of poor, Hispanic immigrants, and into a 20-seat white Hummer limousine that rented for $150 an hour. Before long, a stretch Lincoln Town Car arrived for the next Quinceanera Mass. 
 An elaborate coming-of-age ritual for Hispanic girls on their 15th birthdays, the Quinceanera has long been divisive in the American Catholic Church, where it is viewed as either an exercise in excess or an opportunity to send a message about faith and sexual responsibility.
 But the Mass won an important endorsement last summer, when the Vatican approved a new set of prayers for American dioceses called Order for the Blessing on the 15th Birthday. It was an acknowledgment of the changing face of American Catholicism. Hispanics account for nearly 40 percent of the nation's 65 million Catholics and 71 percent of new American Catholics since 1960.
 Here in the Archdiocese of Denver, Hispanic ministry leaders view the Quinceanera not only as a chance to strengthen faith and family, but also as a weapon against teenage pregnancy.
 Before Monica could have a Quinceanera Mass, she and her parents had to enroll in a four-week Catholicism curriculum with a strong pro-chastity message that was introduced last year at Hispanic-dominated parishes. Lessons included tips for safe dating, like avoiding dating Web sites in favor of group outings in public places like the mall or family barbecues.
 In Mexico and other Latin American countries, the Quinceanera once signaled that a girl was officially on the marriage market. As a result, some have viewed the Quinceanera as a sexual coming-of-age moment for girls.
 Although teenage pregnancy rates have generally been in decline over the last 15 years, 51 percent of Hispanic teenagers become pregnant before age 20, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.
 ''Even now, immigrant parents don't talk to their young daughters about sex,'' said Timothy Matovina, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. ''There is not an open conversation going on about the value of waiting till marriage or the economic pitfalls of becoming a single mother.''
 A blend of European court traditions and ceremonies from Latin American countries, the Quinceanera sometimes has the feel of an out-of-control prom in the United States. A $400 million-a-year industry has sprouted up offering Quinceanera planners, cruises and professional ballroom dancers to teach the ceremonial waltz.
 The Reyes family estimates it spent $20,000 on Monica's Quinceanera, relying on savings, family and friends to pay for two limos, rental of a banquet hall, a buffet of Mexican and American comfort food, dresses and a disc jockey.
 Monica's 14-year-old sister, Marisol, shared the church altar and dance floor with her older sister. The family could not fathom finding the money for another Quinceanera so soon.
 Mr. Lara, of the Denver Archdiocese, said one goal of the classes was to send the message that it was all right to arrive at church in a minivan instead of a Hummer.
 The Reyes family said the expense was worth it, even if they will only now begin saving for college.
 ''It's a prize for them being good,'' said the girls' mother, Luz Reyes.
 Ms. Reyes said she was giving her daughters something she never got growing up in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where her Quinceanera dress was a tattered gown and dessert was a simple layer cake.
 At her party, Monica wiped away tears as she danced with her grandfather.
 On the dance floor, she changed from flat shoes to heels, signaling her departure from childhood. Her first meal as a woman was a bowl of beans washed down with strawberry soda.
 ''The big thing isn't to have a party,'' Monica said. ''It's that you're going from a little girl to a woman. You're thanking God you have been in this world for 15 years.''

HEADLINE: After Crackdown, Election Today Tests Georgian Leader

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia 

 BODY:
The pro-Western president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, was leading in the polls ahead of an election on Saturday that he hoped would restore his mandate to govern after he ordered a police crackdown on protesters and declared a state of emergency here in November. 
 The dispersal of demonstrators on Nov. 7, in which more than 500 people were injured, though none fatally, was hardly unusual in post-Soviet politics. But it disillusioned at least some supporters of Mr. Saakashvili, whom the Bush administration has championed as a model of democratic leadership in the region. 
 Mr. Saakashvili, 40, a graduate of Columbia University Law School in New York and a staunch ally of the United States in the Caucasus region, was unapologetic about the police crackdown in an interview at his residence on Friday. 
 He said his decision to call Saturday's snap elections set his government apart from others in the region, and had already deflated criticism of his government after the events of November. 
 ''All these claims that Georgia went authoritarian collapsed after the so-called authoritarian leader called for elections,'' Mr. Saakashvili said. 
 ''People usually do crackdowns to keep power. I gave up power immediately after the crackdown to make sure there is a democratic process that resolves the crisis.'' 
 Police used tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and clubs to clear the streets of the capital in a daylong melee on Nov. 7. He declared a state of emergency that day, but lifted it nine days later. 
 Mr. Saakashvili said the police crackdown on protesters was justified because a supporter of the protesters was plotting a coup. 
 He said he called new elections not in response to the police actions but to what he said was underlying discontent with economic reforms expressed by the protesters. 
 ''Over all, I don't regret any of it,'' he said. ''I believe we were right.'' 
 Indeed, in the two months since the election was called, the vote has evolved as much into a referendum on Mr. Saakashvili's economic reforms as his democratic credentials, Georgia's tense relations with Russia or its policy of closely supporting the United States, according to aides and some opposition politicians. 
 The reforms have brought foreign investment and growth to one of this region's poorest countries, but have left large pockets of poverty and runaway unemployment. Roughly a quarter of the population lives in poverty. 
 ''There was a segment of society that felt like we didn't care,'' Giga Bokeria, a member of Georgia's Parliament and an ally of the president, conceded in an interview here on Friday. 
 Georgia's economy grew 10 percent in 2007. Yet below the surface, as in other former Communist countries, poverty and unemployment are corroding support, Mr. Saakashvili said. He said protesters included former traffic policemen he had fired to curtail corruption. 
 The country is important to the United States, in part because of a key oil pipeline that crosses its territory. 
 Mr. Saakashvili's government has also supported the United States by deploying troops in Iraq and is the third largest contributor of troops, after America and Britain. The deployment, however, was not an issue in the election, as it has been in other countries that allied with the United States in the war. 
 Seven candidates are on the ballot on Saturday. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held in two weeks. 
 A poll of 1,200 adults by the Washington firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, sponsored by Mr. Saakashvili's campaign and released Thursday, showed Mr. Saakashvili with support from 52 percent of probable voters. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.
 His leading opponent in the election, Levan Gachechiladze, who represents a coalition of nine opposition parties, received 16 percent among probable voters, according to the poll. 
 In the Nov. 7 crackdown, government troops entered and closed down an independent television station, Imedi, which is partly managed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, causing what company officials estimated was $3 million to $4 million worth of damage. 
 Imedi is owned by Badri Patarkatsishvili, a billionaire wanted in Russia on corruption and other charges and now living in London for fear of arrest if he returns to Georgia. He remains a candidate on the ballot on Saturday. 
 In December, the Georgian government released clandestine recordings of Mr. Patarkatsishvili offering a Georgian Interior Ministry official a $100 million bribe, apparently to help stage a coup. 
 The election on Saturday is also a plebiscite on Georgia's hoped-for integration into NATO. Membership in the alliance is widely supported here. Six of the seven candidates and a majority of Georgians support NATO membership. 
 Also on Saturday, voters will decide whether to a hold parliamentary elections this spring or next fall.

HEADLINE: Firehouse Dispute Raises Racial Tension in St. Louis

BYLINE: By MALCOLM GAY

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
An African-American firefighter's complaint that he found a stuffed monkey hanging by its neck in his firehouse last month has become a stark reminder of this city's troubled racial legacy. 
 Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation recently ruled out a hate crime in its inquiry into the complaint, the incident has pitted many of the city's black firefighters, who say the toy was meant to evoke a lynching, against their white colleagues, who say the monkey was simply hung up to dry after being found at a fire scene. 
 That explanation has not satisfied Capt. Addington Stewart, chairman of the Firefighter's Institute for Racial Equality, a fraternal organization that represents all but a few of the department's more than 300 black employees. ''What I know is what I saw,'' Captain Stewart said, describing a strap wrapped around the neck of a stuffed monkey dangling from a coat hanger. ''I take that to be unconscionable.'' 
 The episode might have remained an internal squabble were it not for the recent demotion of the city's first African-American fire chief, Sherman George, which came after Mr. George publicly refused demands by Mayor Francis G. Slay to promote a group of mainly white firefighters. Many of the city's black leaders have lined up behind the former chief, who resigned soon after being demoted.
 In demoting Mr. George, some of those leaders said, Mr. Slay brought St. Louis race relations to a new low. Some started a petition drive in support of a mayoral recall. 
 ''Sherman George was an African-American in one of the highest positions in the mayor's administration -- he was an icon,'' said Alderman Terry Kennedy, chairman of the Aldermanic Black Caucus. ''To push him out like that? You're not doing anything but causing trouble.'' 
 The current controversy has its roots in a lawsuit filed in 2004 by a group of black firefighters who raised accusations of racial bias in the promotion examinations for firefighters. 
 Mr. George, 63, was not a party to the lawsuit. But after a federal judge ruled last spring that the exams were valid, Mr. George declined to promote 28 firefighters -- 4 of whom were black -- to the rank of captain, and five captains, two of whom were black, to the rank of battalion chief.
 ''I never said anything about black and white,'' said Mr. George, who had advocated for an alternate testing system. ''I don't believe that the tests gave the applicants an opportunity to demonstrate the skills and abilities necessary to be an officer in the St. Louis Fire Department.''
 In what became a months-long public showdown, Mr. George declined repeated calls from Mayor Slay to promote the firefighters. The chief cited a 2005 ruling by the state appellate court giving him sole discretion over promotions in the department.
 But when Mr. George missed the mayor's Sept. 14 deadline to make the promotions, City Hall demoted him to deputy chief.
 He retired from the department on Oct. 12, and has filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
 ''They placed me in an untenable situation,'' said Mr. George, who says his demotion came with a $20,000 pay cut that reduced his pension. ''They knew I wouldn't work under those conditions -- I couldn't work under those conditions.''
 Mr. Slay said he was sensitive to the racial politics of demoting Mr. George, who as a child picked cotton and rose to become a popular symbol of African-American success in a city where many black residents, who make up more than 50 percent of the population, are mired in poverty and crime.
 ''The bottom line is that he failed to comply with a direct order,'' said Mr. Slay, a Democrat. ''We tried to be very respectful of the situation, but when it came down to it, we had a court decision, and we had people on these lists, real people with families that were forgoing a lot of money. It created a tremendous morale problem.''
 Many black firefighters criticized Mr. George's removal, but members of Local 73 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which represents nearly all of the department's roughly 400 white members, applauded the move.
 ''The department was not at all harmonious under Sherman George,'' said the president of the local, Chris Molitor. ''A test was given. We wanted promotions to be made.'' 
 The political crisis deepened in November, when the mayor's office named a white battalion chief as Mr. George's successor instead of a higher-ranking African-American candidate. 
 ''The mayor has stabbed the black community in the heart,'' said the Rev. Douglas Parham, president of the Clergy Coalition of Metropolitan St. Louis, a group of more than 60 African-American ministers, and the leader of an effort to recall the mayor. ''This tells me that the mayor of St. Louis sees the chief of the fire department as a white man's job.''
 In an editorial last month in The St. Louis American, the city's largest black newspaper, James H. Buford, president of the Urban League of St. Louis, wrote, ''Racially, the St. Louis community has been mortally wounded by the turn of events.''
 The renewed strain on race relations comes as the city, after years of stagnation, is making economic strides. The downtown area has received roughly $4.5 billion in public and private investment since 1999, Mr. Slay said, and is home to many newly renovated lofts and more than 80 new restaurants and retail shops. 
 ''Downtown is going great,'' Mr. Slay said. ''We've got more invested in neighborhoods all over the city, including predominantly African-American neighborhoods. I'm also talking with a lot of leaders in the black community about what we need to do to bring this city together.''
 But Mr. George's demotion, coupled with downtown's revival and a public school system that recently lost its accreditation when it was taken over by the state, has some politicians from the city's poorer North Side voicing fresh accusations of mayoral neglect. 
 ''There's no development in North St. Louis,'' said State Representative Jamilah Nasheed, a Democrat who represents the city's predominantly black 60th District and has called for Mr. Slay's removal. ''You cannot develop downtown St. Louis and leave North St. Louis looking like a shack.''
 Not all black leaders view Mr. George's ouster exclusively through the lens of race, and some say he presented the mayor with a serious insubordination problem. But those who support Mr. Slay note that given the city's troubled racial past, the mayor handled an impossible situation poorly. 
 ''People have the notion that St. Louis is in the Midwest, but it's one of the few Midwestern cities that had slavery,'' said Alderman Kennedy, whose black caucus has not taken a position on the recall effort. ''Many of us have raised the issue of the racial divide, but I don't think it's been heard. So when it comes to important issues that may be complicated, it tends to fall on racial lines.
 ''So, is this a racial issue? Yes it is. Why is it a racial issue? Based upon the history of the city of St. Louis.''

HEADLINE: Glenn W. Ferguson, 78, Ex-Ambassador to Kenya

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Glenn W. Ferguson, a former ambassador to Kenya, the president or chancellor of three universities and, for a brief time in the 1980s, the president of Lincoln Center, died at his home in Santa Fe, N.M., on Dec. 20. Mr. Ferguson, who held other influential positions during his career, including head of Radio Free Europe, was 78. 
 The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Patricia.
 In May 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mr. Ferguson ambassador to Kenya, a post he held for three years. 
 Mr. Ferguson returned to the United States in 1969 and, for a year, was the chancellor of Long Island University. From 1970 to 1973, he was president of Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and from 1973 to 1978 he was president of the University of Connecticut.
 He then began a five-year term as chief executive of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the government-financed network created during the cold war that broadcast news in 21 languages to an estimated 18 million listeners a day.
 In 1983, Mr. Ferguson, who had not applied for the job, was named president of Lincoln Center. He had been recommended by several members of the board. But the primarily administrative nature of the job did not suit him, and nine months later he announced his resignation.
 Glenn Walker Ferguson was born in Syracuse on Jan. 28, 1929, the only child of Forrest and Mabel Walker Ferguson. 
 Mr. Ferguson graduated from Cornell with a degree in economics in 1950. A year later, he earned a master's degree in business administration, also from Cornell. He was a lieutenant in the Air Force during the Korean War, assigned to a psychological warfare unit. In 1957, he received a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh, but never practiced law.
 After several years as a management consultant and then as an assistant professor of international affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Ferguson was named director of the Peace Corps in Thailand. From 1964 to 1966, he was the first director of Vista, the domestic version of the Peace Corps. 
 Besides his wife of 57 years, the former Patricia Head, Mr. Ferguson is survived by two sons, Bruce, of Great Falls, Va., and Scott, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Sherry Ferguson Zoellick, of McLean, Va.; and four grandchildren.

CUTS IN STUDENT LOANSSallie Mae said Friday that it planned to cut back on its core business of making student loans, setting off a 13 percent decline in its share price. Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, has suffered in recent months from higher borrowing costs and the collapse of a $25 billion buyout. It has sharply cut its earnings forecast for the year and held a special sale of stock to raise $2.9 billion in cash. Sallie Mae, formally known as the SLM Corporation, said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it planned to ''be more selective'' in making student loans, both those backed by the federal government and the higher-rate private loans 
 The company said in its filing that it was retrenching in the business because of market conditions and the landmark student-loan law that took effect in October, cutting billions of dollars in federal subsidies for student lenders. Stock in Sallie Mae fell $2.47, or 13 percent, to $16.69 a share. (AP) 
 EXPANDING INTO WIND ENERGY Scottish and Southern Energy, a British utility, agreed to buy the Irish wind farm operator Airtricity for 1.83 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in cash to add to its production of renewable energy. In the deal, Scottish and Southern said it would also take over 375 million euros of debt. The European Union has called for 20 percent of all energy, including transport fuels and heating, to come from renewable sources by 2020. Airtricity, Ireland's largest wind farm operator, has been expanding operations in Britain and last year won approval to install turbines off the coast of England. Scottish and Southern, based in Perth, Scotland, said the deal would probably be completed in the first quarter. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) IMS HEALTH TO CUT 10% OF JOBS IMS Health, which provides market research to the pharmaceutical and health care industries, said Friday that it would cut its work force by about 10 percent -- or about 760 jobs -- by the end of the year. The company, based in Norwalk, Conn., expects to save $55 million to $60 million a year starting in 2009 from eliminating jobs and other cost-cutting measures. ''We are positioning ourselves to reflect market realities and are adjusting our cost structure -- aiming for greater simplicity, fewer management layers, faster decision making and a sharper focus on addressing clients' new priorities,'' the chief executive, David Carlucci, said in a statement. (AP) WENDY'S REPORTS WEAK SALES Wendy's International, the fast-food chain that is considering a possible sale of itself, reported weak fourth-quarter sales on Friday, and its stock sank to a new 52-week low. Wendy's said quarterly sales at stores opened at least a year fell 0.8 percent at company-owned restaurants in the United States compared with a 3.1 percent increase in the prior year. At franchise restaurants, same-store sales were up 0.2 percent, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, same-store sales rose 0.9 percent for company stores and 1.4 percent for franchise stores. ''Although we made progress during the fourth quarter, I am not satisfied by our same-store sales results,'' Kerrii Anderson, above, Wendy's chief executive, said in a statement. (AP)
 ALABAMA BANK'S LOAN LOSSESRegions Financial, Alabama's biggest bank, will quadruple its reserve for loan losses, to $360 million, for the fourth quarter because of slowing real estate markets in Florida and Georgia. Regions moved $900 million of its $7.5 billion in loans to residential builders into a special asset pool because of slumping demand for housing, particularly in Miami and Atlanta. The Birmingham, Ala., bank raised its provision for loan losses from $90 million as of Sept. 30, to $360 million, and said it expected losses to increase throughout 2008. 
 (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 JOB CUTS AT SUN-TIMES The Chicago Sun-Times, the flagship newspaper of the Sun-Times Media Group, has proposed cutting 35 union newsroom positions, or about 19 percent of the paper's nonmanagement news jobs. The union has two weeks to make a counterproposal and plans to ask Sun-Times management to offer a buyout package, said Misha Davenport, a features writer and co-chairwoman of the Chicago Newspaper Guild. Sun-Times Media, formerly Hollinger International, is under pressure from shareholders to sell the company after revenue fell 10 percent to $279 million last year through Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Hedging Their Way to Billions

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
REMEMBER the colossal salaries of hedge fund managers -- when they needed to earn at least $240 million just to be included among the 25 wealthiest in 2006? Well, those numbers may now look puny, especially at the top of the range.
 Through the first nine months of 2007, three hedge fund managers had made more than $1 billion, with John Paulson and Paolo Pellegrini of Paulson & Company earning a combined $2.7 billion, Bloomberg Markets reports. That is $1 billion more than the 2006 leader, James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, made in all of that year. 
 Mr. Paulson, who manages more than $7 billion, ''started warning his investors back in the middle of 2006 that the frenzy to build and sell housing was a bubble about to pop,'' Anthony Effinger writes. ''His New York-based firm, Paulson & Company, made big bets predicting the edifice would soon come crashing down. The wager paid off in the first nine months of 2007, when Paulson's Credit Opportunities funds rose an average of 340 percent.''
 Next on the list is Philip Falcone, whose Harbinger Capital Partners also bet against the housing market and earned $1.3 billion through Sept. 28.
 Don't worry about Mr. Simons, though. His earnings were estimated at just over $1 billion for the first nine months of last year.
 BONUS 2008 To get the biggest bonus possible this year, be prepared to make your case forcefully, says Deepak Malhotra, author of the book ''Negotiation Genius.'' In an interview with Best Life, he outlines three steps to try to get what you think you deserve:
 Speak up. ''People too often accept whatever is offered to them. Do the math prior to your meeting and then explain the figure that you think is fair and appropriate.''
 Have backup. Be prepared to document all your accomplishments. Do not expect your boss to remember.
 If the boss says he cannot give more money, ask for other rewards, like additional vacation days. 
 GOING THE WRONG WAY ''Blacks are moving backwards, not forward when it comes to achieving financial freedom,'' Mellody Hobson writes in Black Enterprise.
 Ms. Hobson is president of Ariel Capital Management, which conducts an annual survey of black investors in conjunction with the Charles Schwab brokerage firm. She says the latest findings are depressing.
 ''When the Black Investor Survey began in 1998, 57 percent of blacks invested in the stock market,'' she writes. ''Participation climbed as high as 74 percent in 2002, but after the dot-com bubble burst, many got scared and pulled out of the stock market. Today, we are back where we started with only 57 percent of our community being stock and mutual fund investors compared to 76 percent of whites.''
 The other survey findings for 2007 are equally disheartening, she adds.
 ''African-Americans have less than half of what their white counterparts have saved -- about $48,000 compared to $100,000,'' she writes. And ''it turns out black retirement accounts are worth about $73,000 compared to $210,000 for whites.''
 The gap probably will not close anytime soon, given how much people put away each month. Ms. Hobson writes that the monthly savings for blacks ($180) is only about 70 percent of what it is for whites ($260).
 FINAL TAKE Company loyalty is all well and good, but it seems a substantial number of employees are taking it too far.
 While the accepted advice is never to have more than 5 percent of assets in any one particular stock, ''of those who choose company stock for their 401(k), the average is 30 percent of assets,'' Money reports, citing research from Fidelity Investments.
 If there is trouble, those people may lose not only their job, but also a large chunk of retirement savings. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: This Round, Accusations Of Spying And Thievery

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Yuan Cao spent a weekend in late September 2006 in front of a computer at Institutional Credit Partners, a private investment bank where he had worked for five weeks. That Sunday, he moved computer files onto two flash drives -- standard backups, he would later maintain -- signed off, and left the office. Two days later, he quit by e-mail message.
 His bosses said he had to come back for an exit interview, so Mr. Cao returned on Oct. 2. He had worked on complex financial instruments known as credit derivatives. At the end of his meeting, two police officers appeared in the conference room and arrested him on charges of stealing information worth millions of dollars. He was handcuffed and taken to the Midtown North station house. 
 Later that day, a detective questioned Mr. Cao, and they went to his new job to retrieve the flash drives, which were in a backpack on his desk. He was indicted on felony charges that carry prison sentences up to 25 years.
 Now, Mr. Cao, 25, and his lawyer say that he is not a thief who stole valuable information, but rather a hapless computer geek who was mistaken for a corporate spy in hand-to-hand legal combat between Mr. Cao's former employer, Institutional Credit, and a Canadian insurance company, Fairfax Financial Holdings. The innocent act of backing up data, they say, took on a sinister cast because of brutal civil litigation that Mr. Cao has nothing to do with.
 That civil fight involves claims that dirty tricks were used to drive down Fairfax's stock price -- and a countercharge by Institutional Credit that covert operatives sent by Fairfax have been following its executives to their homes, stealing garbage and surveilling family members.
 And even though Mr. Cao is not involved with that dispute, one detail emerged from it recently that startled senior officials in the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mr. Cao. 
 A few weeks after his arrest, the president of Institutional Credit, Thomas J. Priore, made a $5,000 contribution to a boxing charity on Long Island. Mr. Priore said he learned about the group and its need for support from Bernard Hardy, the New York City police detective who investigated Institutional Credit's complaint against Mr. Cao. The detective's son boxed with the group. Mr. Priore said it was unfair to suggest there was a connection between the arrest of Mr. Cao and the money it gave to the boxing club weeks later. 
 ''Are we appreciative of Detective Hardy's work?'' Mr. Priore said. ''Yeah. The guy did a great job of catching a criminal. We're appreciative of people who make the financial and business world a place where we can operate without thieves.''
 The company asked the detective how to contribute to the boxing charity, according to Carlos Mendez, an executive with Institutional Credit. Later that fall, a company check for $5,000 was brought to an exhibition boxing match in Long Island, a fund-raiser sponsored by the Westbury Boxing Club. Most of the donations ranged from $50 to $200, according to Michael DerGarabedian, a lawyer who administered the funds but was not involved in collecting them. ''With that $5,000, we had maybe $8,000 in the account,'' Mr. DerGarabedian said.
 Mr. Cao's lawyer, Michael Bachner, told a judge in Manhattan that he learned about the check from lawyers with the firm of Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, which represents the Canadian insurer in its lawsuit against Institutional Credit.
 ''We're concerned that payment may have had an impact on the way Mr. Cao was treated,'' Mr. Bachner said Friday. The most serious charges have been dismissed, but Mr. Cao is still accused of unlawfully copying computer information worth more than $2,500. A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office would not comment on the check yesterday, citing a continuing investigation. Mr. Priore said that his company had been the victim of a crime, and that it made the donation to support a worthy program. Detective Hardy, who could not be reached by phone for comment, was asked by Mr. Bachner about the check during a pretrial hearing last month, and said there was no connection between it and the arrest. 
 Mr. Cao, who came from China to attend M.I.T. for graduate school, is now unemployed, his lawyer said.
 As for the Westbury Boxing Club, it certainly needed the money, said Pete Brodsky, who founded the club in 1979. ''The club was going under,'' he said. ''We have kids who are from indigent families -- they can't afford gloves, wraps for the hands. We give them a place to go.''
 He was not running the group at the time of the 2006 fund-raiser, he said, but has taken the reins again. The program survived, but faces new financial troubles, he said. Would he consider going back to the group's biggest donor? ''I think I'll try some other people,'' Mr. Brodsky said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The About New York column in some editions on Jan. 5, about a legal and public relations fight over allegations of short-selling between Institutional Credit Partners, a private investment bank with offices in Manhattan, and Fairfax Financial Holdings, a Canadian insurance company, referred imprecisely to the bank's charges against Fairfax. It claims that Fairfax operatives have a history of stealing garbage -- which prompted bank executives to take ''emergency measures'' for protection -- but it does not accuse Fairfax operatives of stealing garbage in this particular dispute.

HEADLINE: Huckabee Moves to New Hampshire, With Tweaks to His Message

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: HENNIKER, N.H. 

 BODY:
Fresh from his victory in the Iowa caucuses, Mike Huckabee has to be considered a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination. But that has not sobered up his distinctive Bible Belt-meets-Borscht Belt act on the stump.
 After arriving in New Hampshire by chartered jets late Thursday night, most of the presidential contenders rose early to hit the trail. Not Mr. Huckabee. He gave morning interviews to no fewer than seven television networks, continuing his strategy of capitalizing on his folksy charm and self-deprecating wit to compensate for the fact that his shoestring campaign cannot afford much advertising. 
 And at his first face-to-face event with voters, at 4 p.m., he warmed up the crowd by playing bass guitar with a local rock band (''In the Midnight Hour,'' ''Mustang Sally'') and introduced his campaign sidekick, the actor Chuck Norris. 
 ''If you elect me, what about Chuck Norris for secretary of defense?'' Mr. Huckabee said, pledging to build up a military so formidable it would be ''Chuck Norris approved.''
 With almost no field organization and only about $2 million in the bank as of last week, the Huckabee campaign has relied on such sideshows as an inexpensive way to drum up the kind of crowds that other campaigns rely on their staff to turn out. (Mr. Huckabee's rally was interrupted periodically by shouts of ''Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!'' from a group of teenage fans in the crowd.)
 But as the ''Huck and Chuck Show'' comes here, it is also a reminder of the challenges Mr. Huckabee faces in taking his folksy Christian populism on the road for a crucial primary, including the need to appear as presidential as rivals like Mitt Romney or Senator John McCain. 
 Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and Southern Baptist pastor, is already retooling his message. In Iowa, he emphasized his Christian conservative convictions on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, though without ever using the words ''abortion,'' ''same-sex'' or ''gay.'' To court the state's many evangelicals, he ran television commercials flashing the words ''Christian leader.'' 
 He has dropped that description from the commercials he has begun running in New Hampshire, using only the labels ''authentic conservative'' and ''proven leader.'' In his first stump speech here, speaking after Mr. Norris to an enthusiastic crowd of about 500, he omitted any mention of abortion or same-sex marriage. 
 Instead, departing from his usual remarks, he heaped praise on the 10th Amendment to the Constitution as a monument to federalism and states' rights. And he added some new details to his usual pledge to improve education, talking about the importance of paying teachers more in exchange for improved performance.
 Mr. Huckabee's advisers say he will be happy with third place in New Hampshire, where Mr. Romney, a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, and Mr. McCain, who won the primary here eight years ago, are neck and neck in the polls. In an interview, Ed Rollins, Mr. Huckabee's national campaign chairman, said Mr. Huckabee hoped for a strong-enough showing to demonstrate some momentum before moving on to the more socially conservative states of Florida and South Carolina.
 In the meantime, though, Mr. Rollins made clear that the campaign's main target was Mr. Romney, who has tried hard to appeal to the social conservatives who make up Mr. Huckabee's base of support. ''We are going to see if we can't take Romney out,'' Mr. Rollins said. 
 He suggested that Mr. Huckabee would present a comparison of two governors -- one who improved services and infrastructure over 10 years in Arkansas, the other who spent the last year of his one term in Massachusetts traveling to lay the groundwork for a presidential run. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Huckabee is trying to turn his Iowa victory into much-needed cash, possibly slipping out of New Hampshire before its primary to try to raise money for races in Southern states just ahead. Mr. Rollins said that roughly $2 million had come in the last few days and that the campaign could now afford to do its own polling.
 Mr. Huckabee is also sharpening the populist economics that, while light on policy details, set him apart from the Republican field.
 ''People in my own party talk about how this economy is terrific, and for some folks it is,'' Mr. Huckabee said Friday in Henniker, saying his own humble roots gave him an understanding of the plight of those struggling with the high costs of health care and gasoline. ''I probably come from the same kind of place you do. I understand struggle.''
 Speaking to reporters on the flight from Iowa, he mused about strategies that might help him translate his Christian conservative appeal to secular New Hampshire.
 ''A big tent revival out on the grounds of the Concord State Capitol?'' he said, in his deadpan style. ''We'll get them all converted to the evangelical faith, and then we'll win. How's that? That would work.''

HEADLINE: Opposition Seeks New Vote As Violence Ebbs in Kenya

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
If the price of cabbage is any indicator, things here in Kenya's capital may be edging back to normal.
 Before last week's election, a head of cabbage in Mathare, an enormous slum, cost 15 shillings, or about 20 cents. After the much-debated results were announced on Sunday and the country exploded into chaos, cabbage prices doubled. By Thursday, as the police tear-gassed protesters in the streets and gangs from opposing tribes hacked one another to death -- some of it right here in the sour-smelling, garbage-strewn footpaths of Mathare -- cabbage prices shot up to 100 shillings. 
 But on Friday, many shops opened up for the first time since election day and the price of cabbage dropped to 50 shillings. Not normal, for sure, but better than it was, which seems to be the story in many parts of the country. 
 ''A few days ago things were very, very bad,'' said Dominick Mutuku, who runs a small restaurant in Mathare and was hit in the head with a rock over the weekend. ''But now it's over.''
 Kenya's crisis is probably not over, though many Kenyans clearly wish it was, but for the first time in a week tensions have cooled somewhat. The overnight death toll on Friday, according to local news reports, was fewer than 10, compared with the more than 300 people killed in a few shocking days of violence earlier this week. 
 Politically, some space seems to be opening up as well. Mwai Kibaki, the president who narrowly won re-election, and Raila Odinga, the opposition leader who contends that the government rigged the results, have yet to meet or even agree on how to do so. They are still negotiating about negotiating. 
 But the government on Friday said that it would hold a new election -- as opposition leaders are demanding -- if a court so ordered. And Mr. Odinga has dropped his insistence that before any talks take place, the government admit to rigging. Just a few days ago, Mr. Odinga accused the president of pulling off a ''civilian coup.'' Now Mr. Odinga says he will consider some type of power-sharing arrangement with Mr. Kibaki.
 ''We want a revote, but we are not being so rigid as saying that is the only option,'' said Salim Lone, a spokesman for Mr. Odinga.
 Alfred Mutua, the government's top spokesman, said Friday, ''We are willing to talk with anybody.''
 But Mr. Mutua reiterated the government's stance against having those talks mediated by outsiders. Opposition leaders are confident that foreign mediators will side with them. Already, the European Union, the United States, Japan and just about every major donor to Kenya have said that the presidential election results were deeply flawed. That may be why the Kenyan government has refused to sit down with a foreign mediator and why Kenyan officials put the brakes on a visit from the president of Ghana, who was planning to fly in earlier this week.
 ''This is a Kenya problem, and we can solve it ourselves,'' Mr. Mutua said.
 That said, the government has been willing to entertain some high-profile foreign visitors eager to get Kenya back to its old self as one of Africa's most stable countries and a regional economic powerhouse. Mr. Kibaki met with the retired South African archbishop Desmond Tutu on Friday to discuss options for reconciliation. And Jendayi Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for African affairs and the highest ranking Western official to come to Kenya since the unrest began, was scheduled to land in Nairobi on Friday night and meet with Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki over the weekend.
 Obviously, there are still political differences. Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki both insist that they won the election. The opposition controls the most seats in Parliament, and more than half of Mr. Kibaki's cabinet was voted out of office. Accommodation will have to be made if the government is going to accomplish anything in the next five years, the length of the presidential term.
 Of more concern, though, are the tribal issues. This election stirred up strong undercurrents of ethnic-based hatred that will not recede any time soon. Mr. Kibaki is a Kikuyu, known as Kenya's privileged tribe, and Mr. Odinga is a Luo, a tribe that has long felt marginalized. The voting followed mostly tribal lines. After Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner, despite disputed vote tabulations that gave the president a razor-thin margin of victory at the 11th hour of the counting process, Luos and members of other tribes lashed out at Kikuyus. Mobs swept through towns across the country, looting Kikuyu stores, attacking Kikuyus and in one case burning to death up to 50 Kikuyu women and children who were taking refuge in a church.
 Thousands of Kikuyus have evacuated ethnically mixed areas and are streaming back to central Kenya, their homeland and a Kibaki stronghold. Aid officials said more than 100,000 people had been displaced. Many are still scared.
 ''Kenya has changed,'' said Francis Mwaniki, a Kikuyu who said gangs destroyed his home. He has no plans to go back.
 But in Kisii, a town in western Kenya that had been the scene of brutal clashes among tribes, people returned to work. For the first time in a week, farmers were loading bananas and lettuce into trucks bound for Nairobi. In Mombasa, Kenya's biggest port, several hundred people demonstrated outside a mosque and the police fired tear gas at them. But fuel and freight were beginning to flow again, which is crucial for the rest of East Africa.
 In the Eldoret area, where the church was burned, the town was still tense, residents said, but no episodes of violence were reported. 
 Mathare, the giant slum, seemed to represent the national mood. Things were hardly cheery here. Two bodies were found by the river on Friday morning, and dozens of families were still camped out by an air force base seeking protection.
 But the stores were open and the streets full, and Chuck Norris movies were playing again on Biashara Street.
 ''We want to go back to normal,'' said Anthony Irungu, a shopkeeper, as he put a fresh coat of green paint on his stall. ''We are trying.''

HEADLINE: Romney Embraces Theme Used to Beat Him

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Michael Falcone contributed reporting from Portsmouth, N.H.

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
Having barely slept after landing at 3 a.m. on Friday, weary advisers for Mitt Romney gathered a few hours later in a conference room in the Courtyard Marriott in Portsmouth to regroup after the resounding defeat Mike Huckabee handed them in Iowa.
 Dominating the conversation was the idea that the central lesson from Iowa in both parties was that voters wanted change in Washington and a focus on how Mr. Romney might harness that sentiment to defeat his main rival in New Hampshire, Senator John McCain. 
 So far Mr. Romney has tried with varying degrees of fervor to portray himself as a change agent for Washington, often playing up his private-sector background and arguing that he has not been in politics long enough to be ''infected.'' In September, he even rolled out the slogan ''change begins with us.'' 
 Often, however, the point has gotten lost in Mr. Romney's speeches as he has tried to hit a jumble of other notes establishing his conservative credentials. It is also a balancing act for any Republican presidential candidate to try to carry off, given how popular President Bush remains with the Republican base.
 Mr. Romney has taken great pains to come to the defense of the Bush administration in the face of recent criticism of its foreign policy from Mr. Huckabee, invariably drawing applause from Republican audiences. 
 Mr. Romney has also jabbed at Mr. Bush at times, saying, for example, that he believed the post-invasion phase of the war in Iraq was mismanaged and using as a frequent punch line the statement that people ''don't want the people who ran the Katrina cleanup'' to take over health care. But his critiques have generally been muted and cautious.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Romney's advisers made clear Friday that ''change'' will be their dominant theme before the primary here on Tuesday, believing it is a message that gives them a chance to draw a clear contrast with Mr. McCain. 
 ''In many ways, it's easier for us to post up against McCain than it is against Huckabee,'' said Ronald C. Kaufman, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney. ''He's also an outside guy. McCain, on the other hand, is Washington.''
 Stuart Stevens, a media consultant for Mr. Romney who used to work for Mr. McCain, said the message played to the strengths in Mr. Romney's resume. 
 ''It is right in the wheelhouse of where Mitt Romney wants to be,'' he said.
 Mr. Romney faces a critical test in New Hampshire. Just as his longtime lead in Iowa was erased by a surging Huckabee campaign, Mr. Romney's lead in surveys in New Hampshire has evaporated in the face of a resurgent McCain campaign.
 A loss in New Hampshire would be devastating for the Romney campaign, his aides privately conceded, given their stated strategy of winning ''early and often.'' They argue that they will be able to fight on, with Michigan's primary on Jan. 15 acting as a fire wall. The campaign has recently stepped up efforts in Michigan, where Mr. Romney has deep roots, releasing an advertisement focused on the economy and starting a direct-mail campaign on economic issues. 
 In New Hampshire, Mr. Romney unveiled an advertisement on Thursday featuring residents of the state criticizing Mr. McCain on taxes and immigration. 
 ''He's had his chance in Washington to make things better,'' a woman says at the conclusion of the advertisement.
 Over the last week in Iowa, Mr. Romney tried to work the theme of change, although it was often overshadowed by other messages, like his focus on his own family values in response to Mr. Huckabee's strength among social conservatives. 
 On Friday evening at a town-hall-style forum here, Mr. Romney unveiled a stump speech that has been revamped from the one he used in Iowa, building his remarks entirely around the ''change'' theme.
 ''Washington is simply broken,'' he said, taking a veiled swipe at Mr. McCain. ''Sending the same people back to Washington and just having them fill different chairs is not going to change Washington. If you want to change Washington, it'll take somebody going there who knows how to change things.''
 In response to Mr. Romney's new theme, the McCain campaign circulated an e-mail message to reporters, highlighting a statement from Mr. Romney in 2002, when Mr. McCain campaigned for him. At the time, Mr. Romney said that Mr. McCain ''has always stood for reform and change.''
 Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain, said: ''It is laughable that Mitt Romney would think anyone buys his latest act as an agent of change, when the only thing he's ever changed are his positions on every issue of importance in this election.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Sounds Warning About Economy

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The unemployment rate surged to 5 percent in December as the economy added a meager 18,000 jobs, the smallest monthly increase in four years, the Labor Department reported on Friday. 
 Economists viewed the report as the most powerful indication to date that the United States could well be falling into a recessionary downturn. Evidence of widening unemployment heightened anticipation that the Federal Reserve would further cut interest rates this month, perhaps by an unusually large half a percentage point, in a bid to prevent the economy from sliding into the muck. 
 ''This is unambiguously negative,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''The economy is on the edge of recession, if we're not already engulfed in one.''
 A recession is typically defined as an extended period of at least several months during which economic activity shrinks and unemployment rises. 
 The swift deterioration in the job market resonated as a warning sign that troubles once confined to real estate and construction are spilling into the broader economy, threatening the ability of American consumers to keep spending with customary abandon. 
 On Wall Street, the report led to a big sell-off that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plunging nearly 2 percent. 
 As the presidential race heated up, Democrats seized upon the bleak job numbers to indict Republican-led economic policies. ''This morning's jobs report confirms what most Americans already knew,'' Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said in a statement. ''President Bush's economic policies have failed our country's middle class.''
 President Bush cautioned that ''we can't take economic growth for granted'' and said he would work with Congress to be ''more diligent'' on protecting the economy. Speaking to reporters at the White House after a meeting with his economic advisers, Mr. Bush warned that ''the worst thing the Congress could do is raise taxes on the American people.''
 The lone consolation for investors, workers and the public at large was that the bad news seemed severe enough to prod the Fed to push its benchmark rate below its current 4.25 percent when policy makers meet at the end of the month. Lower interest rates decrease borrowing costs and encourage banks to lend more freely, spurring spending, hiring and investment.
 The Fed has already eased rates three times since September in a bid to inject confidence into jittery markets. But analysts cautioned that central bankers may now feel constrained against further easing: inflation is growing, particularly as oil hovers near $100 a barrel. Lower interest rates, over time, can generate the seeds of inflation, and could make an already weak dollar worth less against foreign currencies.
 ''The Fed is trying to juggle a two-sided sword,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. ''They're trying to fight inflation moving higher and they're trying to fight a slowdown in growth.''
 In an effort to encourage lending, the Fed has been pumping cash through the banking system by auctioning off loans at discounted rates. On Friday, it said it would expand a pair of auctions scheduled for this month, offering $30 billion.
 Some economists said the markets and other analysts were making too much of a lone jobs report that could yet be revised.
 ''The stock and bond markets are going into panic mode,'' said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''We're going to have a slowdown, but I don't think we're going to have a recession.''
 While filings for jobless benefits have been rising in recent weeks, the pace has not been swift enough to justify such a sharp jump in the unemployment rate, Mr. Darda added.
 For months, the economy had managed to grow vigorously despite worrying developments, from the unraveling of the housing industry to turmoil in the credit markets. Through it all, economists marveled at the resilience of the labor market, suggesting that as long as the economy kept creating jobs by the tens of thousands each month, Americans would keep spending and growth would carry on. 
 But the jobs report for December suggested that the negatives dogging the economy finally appear to be dragging it down.
 ''There's no mystery as to why the unemployment rate went up,'' said Robert A. Barbera, chief economist at the research firm ITG. ''The mystery is why it took so long.''
 December's addition of 18,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls was an abrupt drop from the 115,000 created in November -- a figure revised on Friday from an initial estimate of 94,000. It put the annual rate of job growth at its lowest since 2004. 
 Some areas of the economy continued to expand, according to the report. Government jobs grew, and health care added 28,000 jobs. Food services added 27,000.
 But that growth was largely reversed by pain elsewhere. Retailing lost 24,000 jobs in December. Financial services lost 7,000. Construction shed another 49,000 jobs. Even commercial construction, which some have suggested could compensate for woes among home builders, lost 17,000 jobs. Over all, private sector jobs slid by 13,000.
 Despite a weak dollar, which has helped compensate for disappointment at home by lifting American sales abroad, the nation shed 31,000 manufacturing jobs in December.
 For the third consecutive month, wages grew slower than the pace of inflation, cutting into the real income of many workers. Among rank-and-file workers, who make up more than four-fifths of the labor force, average hourly earnings rose 3.7 percent last year, below the 4.3 percent rise in 2006.
 Job growth has been slowing steadily for two years. In 2005, the economy generated 212,000 new jobs a month, according to the Labor Department. Last year, the pace dropped to 122,000.
 The spike in the unemployment rate, which was 4.7 percent in November, suggested that the deterioration of the job market is now accelerating. 
 Last year, companies fretted about business prospects amid falling housing prices and tightening credit. Many stopped hiring, but large-scale layoffs were rare. But now, some appear to have concluded that they can no longer tough it out. 
 ''December's bleak jobs report represents the siren call that this business cycle is just about over,'' declared Bernard Baumohl, managing director at the Economic Outlook Group, in a note to clients. ''We're about to tilt over to the other side of the economic curve and begin the downsizing.''
 In Penacook, N.H., the tilt came during the Christmas season: Riverside Millwork, a supplier of windows, doors and stair parts, laid off 43 people. That added to a wave of layoffs that has winnowed the staff from 225 to 40 since October 2005, when home building began its decline.
 ''We've cut just about everything that we can possibly cut,'' said Larry Byer, the company's human resource manager. ''When you don't have assets to sell or to keep you going, the bodies have to go.''
 In calculating the rate of job growth, the Labor Department relies upon a sampling of payroll data and an extrapolation of how many jobs have been created and destroyed. An accompanying survey of households, used to calculate the unemployment rate, presented an even bleaker picture, showing that the number of Americans saying they were working plunged by 436,000 in December -- the worst number in five years.
 The trend was pronounced for teenagers, blacks and Hispanics, with unemployment among those groups jumping 0.6 percentage point, triple the increase for whites.
 The household survey is notoriously volatile and treated with skepticism. But unlike the payroll data, it is not subject to revision, other than for seasonal factors, making it a better indicator when the economy is on the cusp of change, Mr. Barbera said.
 Between December 2005 and December 2006, the household survey showed jobs increasing by 2.2 percent. Over the last year, jobs grew less than 0.2 percent.
 ''Every time we've gotten down to this level since 1956, there's been a recession,'' Mr. Barbera said. 
 The risk is that the weakening job market will swell from a symptom of malaise to a cause. As fewer jobs are created, spending power could dry up. Faced with declining business, employers could further trim payrolls. As unemployment grows, more homeowners could fall behind on mortgages, leading to more losses at banks, and more layoffs.
 ''The risk of a vicious cycle setting in now is very high,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''The job market's operating at stall speed. Either it picks up soon or it quickly unravels.''

HEADLINE: Could It Be The Year of The Rising Dollar?

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
THE dollar's sharp drop over the last two years has been a huge boon for Americans who bought foreign stocks.
 But now many market strategists are cautioning investors that the principle would hold true in reverse if the dollar switched course for an extended stretch: a sharp rise in the dollar would cut into foreign stock returns. While these strategists are not saying the dollar will erase all its losses anytime soon, they say it has probably hit bottom and may even be on the rebound.
 ''Those people who are waiting for the dollar to crash should wake up and smell the coffee, because it has already happened,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research in Great Neck, N.Y. 
 He predicted that the dollar would strengthen in 2008 -- especially when compared with currencies against which it has lost the most ground. Those include the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.
 ''Those three currencies have been painfully strong in recent months, to the point where central bankers are either thinking about or starting to lower interest rates,'' Mr. Yardeni said.
 Certainly, most strategists are not suggesting that Americans bail out of foreign investments. They say that it is a good idea to be globally diversified, even if a rise in the dollar trims future foreign returns. ''I don't think the currency is going to hurt you that much over the next couple of years; it's just not going to help you,'' Mr. Yardeni said. 
 But he said those who owned foreign stocks in the last two years -- when the dollar's decline supercharged returns -- might need to rebalance portfolios. 
 Mr. Yardeni recommends that American investors put 25 to 35 percent of their stock portfolios into foreign shares. Some strategists recommend a smaller allocation, perhaps 10 to 15 percent. After pouring money into mutual funds that own foreign stocks, Americans started making net withdrawals from these funds in mid-November, according to AMG Data Services.
 Still, European stock funds have been popular with Americans in recent years, and for good reason. The European stock fund category has had average annual returns of more than 25 percent over the last five years, according to Morningstar. But currency values caused a large part of that performance.
 Stuart A. Schweitzer, the global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, has been particularly bullish on European stocks for years, but lately that enthusiasm has begun to cool. ''I think European growth is likely to slow, weighed down by the strong euro, high oil prices and slower U.S. growth,'' he said. ''I think it is time for investors to consider taking profits on some of their European equities.''
 Michael Joynson, a director for global equities at Citi Global Wealth Management, a Citigroup unit, said he did not expect the dollar to strengthen nearly as much as some strategists have forecast. Citigroup economists predict that the dollar will fall a bit more against the euro early this year but will end 2008 at around $1.47, near its current level.
 In that case, Mr. Joynson said, exchange rates may squeeze European carmakers and pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of their sales in the United States. But he said European companies in industries having most of their sales in Europe (like utilities, telecommunications and retailing) should be relatively unhurt by the lofty euro.
 Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, a fund management company based in Los Angeles, is among strategists who predict that the dollar will rise sharply this year.
 ''I think the big story of 2008 will be the strengthening of the dollar,'' Mr. Sri-Kumar said. He recommends underweighting stocks in the euro zone and in Britain, while overweighting emerging markets whose currencies have not risen sharply. He also predicted that emerging-market economies would continue to grow despite a slowdown in the United States and Europe.
 OTHER strategists are less confident about the prospects for developing countries. ''They've got a lot of internal investment demand, but they still sell 48 percent of their exports to the United States and Europe,'' said David Darst, the chief investment strategist in Morgan Stanley's global wealth management group. 
 Mr. Darst was particularly cautious about Chinese and Indian stocks, which have already risen sharply. But he was less worried about emerging markets with oil-based economies. Among big foreign stocks, he favors Petrobras, the Brazilian oil giant; it recently made a huge oil discovery off of Brazil's coast.
 Mr. Darst also recommends investing in large-capitalization American stocks, particularly companies that make consumer products with global brands. ''We are telling people to focus on consumer staples -- the Colgates of the world, the Coca-Colas of the world,'' he said, adding PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson to the list. He said such global giants should flourish, even with a relatively weak dollar and a global economic slowdown.

 BODY:
FINAL EXAM: A Surgeon's Reflections on Mortality, by Pauline W. Chen. (Vintage, $13.95.) To doctors, who are in the business of saving lives, death represents failure. ''I learned from many of my teachers and colleagues to suspend or suppress any shared human feelings for my dying patients,'' Chen, a liver surgeon, writes. ''These lessons in denial and depersonalization began as early as my first encounter with death in the gross anatomy dissection lab.'' In these thoughtful, moving essays on the relationship between medical practice and the emotional events surrounding death, Chen draws on her 15 years of clinical experience to inform a discussion of the failings of medical education (and possible remedies) and to share stories about dying patients and their families. 
 GAME OF KINGS: A Year Among the Geeks, Oddballs, and Geniuses Who Make Up America's Top High School Chess Team, by Michael Weinreb. (Gotham, $15.) Weinreb spent a year (2004-5) following the eight boys on the varsity chess team of Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn as they competed for a national championship. He describes the ferocious nerd-macho chess culture of his Eastern European/Hispanic/African-American subjects in what our reviewer, James Kaplan, called a ''thrilling, vigorously reported, deeply empathic book'' that ''vibrates with the energy of the outer boroughs.'' 
 THE COLLABORATOR OF BETHLEHEM, by Matt Beynon Rees. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.95.) The former Jerusalem bureau chief for Time magazine, Rees has set a mystery in the middle of a war zone. When a colleague is unjustly accused of collaborating in an Israeli assassination of a Palestinian leader, a history teacher at a United Nations school on the West Bank conducts his own search for the killer. ''An astonishing first novel,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in the Book Review. 
 THE SHAKESPEARE WARS: Clashing Scholars, Public Fiascoes, Palace Coups, by Ron Rosenbaum. (Random House, $18.) This ''besotted, passionate new book,'' as our reviewer, Walter Kirn, put it, probes the relationship between the early editions of Shakespeare's plays and the later ones. Line by line, sometimes word by word, Rosenbaum, with the aid of a roster of scholars and directors, weighs the question of whether Shakespeare got it right the first time, and whether later cuts, additions and changes represent typesetters' errors and actors' flawed memories, or Shakespeare's second thoughts. Colin McGinn, a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of Miami, admits in the preface to SHAKESPEARE'S PHILOSOPHY: Discovering the Meaning Behind the Plays (Harper Perennial, $13.95) that he is no literary scholar. But his straightforward examination of ''the philosophical ideas embedded'' in six of the major plays -- among them the possibility of knowledge, the nature of the self and the nature of evil -- is provocative. McGinn makes a case for the influence of Montaigne, a skeptic whose work was being translated into English at the time the plays were written.
 CHINA SHAKES THE WORLD: A Titan's Rise and Troubled Future -- and the Challenge for America, by James Kynge. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) Kynge, the former China bureau chief of The Financial Times, offers a nuanced, well-reported description of China's rapid economic rise. He also points to China's vulnerabilities, like pollution and corruption. Reed Hundt, a business consultant, sees China as ''fertile ground for entrepreneurship'' and its global success as rooted in ''vigorous domestic competition.'' Protectionism is not the answer to Chinese economic power, Hundt argues in IN CHINA'S SHADOW: The Crisis of American Entrepreneurship (Yale University, $15). Rather, he believes that Congress should make legal changes -- including providing low-cost, high-quality education -- to encourage Americans to innovate.
 I KILLED: True Stories of the Road From America's Top Comics, compiled by Ritch Shydner and Mark Schiff. (Three Rivers, $13.95.) For stand-up comedians, getting big laughs is known as killing; dying is getting none. These reminiscences evoke both experiences. While there are famous bylines here, the focus is on comics you haven't heard of. John Leguizamo is not one of its contributors, but an account of his career can be found in PIMPS, HOS, PLAYA HATAS, AND ALL THE REST OF MY HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS: My Life (Ecco/Harper, $13.95). Fans of his one-man shows will recognize many of Leguizamo's stories about a mischievous Latino kid growing up in Queens who ''had other things on my mind. ... Like girls. And dodging my old man's fists.''
 PATHFINDERS: A Global History of Exploration, by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto. (Norton, $17.95.) This sweeping history of exploration, by a professor at Tufts, begins with the peopling of the world through migration and discovery and ends in the present, examining the way cultures have diverged and converged. Writing in the Book Review, Candice Millard praised ''Pathfinders'' as ''a rich study of humankind's restless spirit'' and found it ''brilliant and readable.''

HEADLINE: No Happy Ending In Dickensian Baltimore

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
ANOTHER swath of society -- this time the fourth estate -- has fallen into the ecosystem of ''The Wire,'' bringing with it another set of not-so-great expectations.
 The new executive editor of the ailing Baltimore Sun says he wants a prizewinning series about the ''Dickensian'' lives of children let down by the city school system, but without a lot of complexity or boring context. 
 ''We need to limit the scope,'' the editor, James C. Whiting III (Sam Freed), instructs his skeptical, dispirited editors, ''not get bogged down in details.'' 
 Whiting, a frontman for a Tribune-like media company, devalues the word Dickensian, stripping it down to a synonym for abject poverty, instead of a world of stark contrasts with unlimited scope and a rich, teeming bog of detail. If anything, he and his henchmen are the Dickensian characters in the room -- Gradgrinds in suspenders and J. Press shirts demanding that reporters do ''more with less.'' 
 The word is also a nudge at fans who liken ''The Wire,'' David Simon's layered, intricate HBO series about Baltimore cops and drug dealers to a sprawling 19th-century novel, as lurid and engrossing as ''Bleak House'' or ''Little Dorrit.'' 
 They won't be disappointed. The fifth and final season of ''The Wire,'' which begins Sunday night, sinks deep into the Simonian bog, adding a new strand of narrative -- the city room of a failing newspaper -- to the dealers, cops, addicts, teachers and city officials who collide, and sometimes collude, but mostly bump up helplessly against immutable barriers of corruption, inertia and economic decline. 
 This season, like all the others, ''The Wire'' taps into a cold, cold place with many losses and few gains, a sub-zero-sum game. 
 The show's gloomy fatalism is echoed in the real-life fate of a series that this week picks up where it left off: The drug trade changes hands, but never stops, and ''The Wire,'' which is unquestionably one of the best and most original series on television in decades, has never received an Emmy Award in a universe where ''Boston Legal'' has five and ''Desperate Housewives'' has six.
 This series's greatest distinction is perhaps the very thing that chases away broad popularity and peer recognition: ''The Wire'' traces the interlaced lives of drug dealers and police officers, and both sides of the street receive equal time and consideration. No other series has as many African-American characters, and some of most richly conceived ones fall into categories -- drug dealers, convicts and addicts -- that violate television's taboo against racial profiling. By defying the very stereotypes it perpetuates, the show confounds easy viewing.
 And in the inverted logic of ''The Wire,'' failure is its own success, a badge of honor in a decaying and dishonorable world. The series's creators never received the acclaim their work deserves, and there are no lasting victories on ''The Wire,'' just glimmers of success that tease out hope only to be quickly and brutally squelched. 
 It's a difficult show to follow, and not only because much of the dialogue is unvarnished street slang or because there is no thumping musical score to signal imminent menace or a character's inner thoughts. (The only pop tunes are from a jukebox in a bar or the car radios of assassins staking out their victims.) 
 The series doesn't revolve around one charismatic protagonist the way ''The Sopranos'' did. It doesn't harbor a central mystery like the one in ''Lost,'' one that binds together a huge cast of characters. ''The Wire'' takes its title from the police wiretap surveillance that keeps detectives just within reach of a major bust; the series eavesdrops on a complicated, harsh and unexamined sector of American life, without subtitles or footnotes. 
 It's also a hoot.
 Like other transporting works of fiction, ''The Wire'' offers an insular, absorbing universe with its own language, rules of behavior and castes, not casts, of characters. It is one of the most intimate and alarming depictions of urban America on television, and yet it's an invigorating and even exhilarating experience, each season a new Harry Potter book for adults. Instead of magic ''The Wire'' traffics in realism and the romance of failure.
 Or, as Prez, a cop turned teacher said last season while describing a football game: ''No one wins. One side just loses more slowly.''
 Characters come and go from season to season, but institutions never change.
 Police detectives, teachers or journalists who try to innovate are quickly slapped down by their employers' entrenched, ill-fitting definitions of success. And all institutions are alike: Schools need higher test scores for financing; corner dealers need to up their numbers; police pump up minor arrests to meet their quotas; and newspapers lay off seasoned, responsible reporters to cut costs and shape articles to the expectations of the Pulitzer Prize committee.
 Jim Whiting thinks the paper could win a prize with a searing expose on the failure of the Baltimore school system. He dismisses his editors' warnings that the problems of the city's underprivileged children are more deep rooted than burned-out teachers and outdated textbooks. 
 Viewers know better. The fourth season zeroed in on the lives of four street kids, and, among other things, vividly illustrated how economic conditions, broken families and social dissolution scar children long before they take their first standardized test. Mr. Simon, who was a Baltimore Sun crime reporter when the newspaper was still prestigious, is using his last season to settle new scores, excoriating the newspaper owners who allow their journalism standards to decline along with their revenues. 
 Each season takes on a different theme, but all of them are linked and laid out like a rhyming scheme. Parallelism has always been a hallmark of ''The Wire.'' The street dealers have the same kinds of constraints and personality clashes as the police officers who chase them, and even the mayor has to wend his way around the machinations of a Republican governor in Annapolis. 
 This time it's the journalists of The Baltimore Sun, whose straits reflect those of the Baltimore police. Police officers of every rank are owed weeks of overtime pay, and budget cuts have taken their toll on even the most important cases, including the ''wire.'' Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), who is back on detective duty, off the wagon and as frustrated as ever by the system, mutters, ''I wonder what it feels like to work in a real police department.''
 The first glimpse of the newspaper is an empty loading dock where old-timers gather to smoke and gossip about expected buyouts and layoffs. ''Some day,'' one of them says, tossing away his cigarette butt, ''I want to find out what it feels like to work on a real newspaper.'' 
 Inside every flawed and failing institution, there are a few who do the best they can. Clark Johnson, who played a Baltimore detective on ''Homicide,'' an NBC drama that was based on Mr. Simon's nonfiction book by the same name, plays Gus, the Sun's cynical but dedicated city editor. Despite closed foreign bureaus, staff cuts and highhanded interference by new bosses who value ''readability'' over truth, Gus struggles to meet deadlines, source article properly and prevent the misuse of a gerund. 
 The staff is worried and disgruntled, but one reporter is eager to meet management's expectations. Scott (Tom McCarthy) is a recent hire from The Kansas City Star, and chafing under Gus's by-the-book guidance he strains the truth for splashy stories that could catapult him to The Washington Post or The New York Times. 
 This season weaves the symbiotic relationship between the news media and the police into a larger tapestry of daily life on the streets, where old rivalries and unforgiven slights hobble even the most ruthless and ambitious leaders, and small acts of kindness stand out like shooting stars, all the more impressive for being rare. 
 ''If you leave everything in,'' Whiting pompously tells his editors, ''soon you have nothing.'' The final season of ''The Wire'' is committed to proving him wrong; by leaving nothing out it offers viewers as close a chance as anyone can get to everything.

HEADLINE: As Public Works Languish, Private Cash Sets the Agenda

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Conceived as a freeway, the Route 34 Connector still promises to whisk motorists across New Haven as they exit Interstate 95. But in less than a mile, the three broad lanes abruptly end, forcing traffic onto side roads that skirt the unbuilt right-of-way -- a wasteland of elongated asphalt parking lots and scrub grass.
 Mayor John DeStefano Jr. calls the aborted project a tragic example of public infrastructure gone awry. He has drawn up detailed plans to rip up the highway and parking lots and restore the neighborhood of homes and stores that once existed. But lacking money, the mayor's project only inches forward.
 A few streets away, there is no such obstacle. On either side of New Haven's highway to nowhere, city streets throb with construction activity. A different kind of infrastructure spending -- unrelated to roads or rapid transit, airports or levees -- is under way. 
 Yale University is rebuilding itself -- drawing on its huge, rapidly growing endowment and on multimillion-dollar gifts, mainly from alumni -- to renovate 54 buildings and construct 16 new ones. Not since the 1930s has Yale undertaken so ambitious an expansion. 
 The message in this outburst of activity, here and in other places across the country, is that private spending, supported handsomely by a growing number of very wealthy families, is gaining ground on traditional public investment. In the case of New Haven, once the recipient of more federal dollars per person for urban renewal than any other city, private investment now far surpasses public outlays. 
 ''For us,'' the mayor said, ''infrastructure spending has come to mean growing the university. Yale has the money, and what they get from us is the approval to grow.''
 But for all the wealth going into private philanthropy, its reach is limited. Richard C. Levin, Yale's president, is not committing money to the mayor's reconstruction plan or to other items on Mr. DeStefano's wish list, like high-speed rail service to Manhattan or lengthening the runway at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport so more airlines will fly here.
 Philanthropic spending adds mainly to the nation's stock of hospitals, libraries, museums, parks, university buildings, theaters and concert halls. Public infrastructure -- highways, bridges, rail systems, water works, public schools, port facilities, sewers, airports, energy grids, tunnels, dams and levees -- depends mostly on tax dollars. It is hugely expensive and the money available, while still substantial, has shrunk as a share of the national economy.
 The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that government should be spending $320 billion a year over the next five years -- double the current outlay -- just to bring up to par what already exists.
 A few decades ago, after the Depression and World War II, the nation rapidly added infrastructure and ''maintenance was a less pressing issue,'' Casey Dinges, a society spokesman, said. The entire interstate highway system, for example, was built in just 35 years.
 But now 14 years are likely to pass before a widening of just one bridge in that system, spanning the Quinnipiac River here on I-95, is completed. The traffic-congested bridge is to become six lanes in each direction, from the present three. 
 Nearly six years into the expansion, the approaches are gradually being widened, but the bridge itself is untouched. The first pilings have yet to be sunk to support the additional lanes. The state transportation department, which is handling the $2 billion project, blames the slow flow of money, mainly from the federal government. That flow has averaged less than $45 million a year, according to Albert A. Martin, the department's deputy commissioner. 
 ''If we had had the $2 billion in hand right from the start, that would have reduced the construction time by half, to seven years,'' Mr. Martin said. ''The problem is, we don't have the dollars readily available. That is one of the big differences between us and Yale.''
 Yale's Expansive Makeover
 Yale's reconstruction proceeds at warp speed. Scaffolding and gauzelike scrim, to protect pedestrians from falling debris, cover buildings on nearly every block of the urban campus. The emphasis is on those devoted to science and medicine, to enhance Yale's stature in these fields. But every other department is a beneficiary, too, and all of the 12 residential colleges are being renovated. To keep this work going year-round, Yale built a four-story brick dorm, almost large enough to fill a city block, as temporary student housing.
 The 90-year-old football stadium, the Yale Bowl, got a share of the largesse. A mansionlike field house is soon to be built alongside it, which, among other things, will allow the opposing teams to spend halftime in greater comfort. For years they have rested in roped-off exit tunnels beneath the stands; the locker rooms are too far away.
 ''The field house is a luxury item in a way,'' Laura A. Cruickshank, an architect employed by Yale as university planner, acknowledged. ''But when you have a stadium that is so old and iconic, you have to do things differently. And how much of a luxury is it when you have players who play the way they do and you have to tape them up at halftime in the tunnels?''
 Propelled by the construction on campus, Yale has become a big owner of commercial real estate in the surrounding downtown, engaging in a form of urban renewal not unlike what Mayor DeStefano wants for Route 34. But while the mayor has to extract state and federal subsidies, Yale goes forward with its own money.
 Biotech start-ups, restaurants and stores now occupy Yale-owned buildings. Wanting its new campus in upscale surroundings, the university even employs two people full time to recruit boutique retailers in New York and Boston as tenants on spruced-up streets.
 ''The mayor was far-sighted enough,'' said Mr. Levin, who has been Yale's president since 1993, the same year that Mr. DeStefano first won his office, ''to recognize that working with us, with our capital, we could actually revive the downtown, which we're doing.''
 The person in charge of improving the neighborhood around Yale is Bruce Alexander, 64, a former real estate entrepreneur who helped develop the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. Mr. Levin recruited him in 1998 and, during a recent tour of the city, Mr. Alexander pointed out one of his favorite achievements -- the purchase of a group of contiguous buildings occupying a square block in the heart of the city.
 The owner had gone bankrupt, and to avoid having the buildings auctioned piecemeal, Yale bought them all, at the mayor's request, and filled them with stores and restaurants at street level, and apartments and offices on the upper floors.
 ''When you own a block of property,'' Mr. Alexander said, ''you can create an identity.''
 Infrastructure Spending Lags
 The shift from public money to private wealth in shaping the nation's cities is evident in national data. Government outlays on physical infrastructure have declined to 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product, from 3.6 percent in the 1960s. Philanthropic giving, in contrast, has jumped to nearly 2.5 percent of G.D.P., from 1.5 percent in 1995 and 2 percent in the '60s. 
 Most of this money goes into endowments and foundations, or comes in the form of individual gifts, and then is increased through leverage. Of the $3 billion that Yale has spent so far on its vast building program, for example, slightly less than two-thirds came from gifts and from the endowment, which now totals $22.5 billion. The rest was borrowed, Mr. Levin said.
 Yale now spends more than $400 million annually on its renaissance, nearly six times its outlays for construction and renovation in the mid-1990s. New Haven, by contrast, budgeted $137 million in the current fiscal year for all its capital projects, including those subsidized by state and federal governments. That is less than twice the amount budgeted in the mid-'90s.
 Government investment nationwide has lagged for several reasons, say business leaders, academics and public officials. Tax cuts have helped to hold down overall government spending. So has the view, widespread in recent decades, that public investment is often inept and wasteful. And politics intrudes, with the widely criticized earmark process in Congress cited lately as a prime example of misdirected spending. 
 ''Governments are accountable to the democratic process, which has many, many virtues; I would not trade it for anything else,'' Mr. Levin said. ''But it is not particularly good at focusing resources and driving things efficiently.'' 
 Perhaps most important, big businesses no longer put as much clout and attention behind public infrastructure investments. In an earlier era, corporations, many with deep roots in local communities, lobbied government for the railroads, highways and many other facilities they needed to operate successfully. And they served as a crucial fountain of local tax revenue.
 But companies are more mobile today. And many of the urban manufacturers most dependent on public infrastructure have moved or gone out of business. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company, once New Haven's largest employer, is among the departed. Yale, which pays some taxes and escapes others that most corporations pay -- particularly property taxes -- is now the city's biggest employer.
 Anthony P. Rescigno, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, is struggling to revive the commitment of his members. He is trying to drum up stronger support among local businesses to lengthen the airport runway to 5,000 feet from the present 4,000 so that commercial airlines will bring in more flights. His members favor the longer runway, but not passionately. 
 ''We had an example of a biotech company in New Haven bringing people here all the time,'' Mr. Rescigno said. ''Because he couldn't bring them here easily by air, he would bring them to New York. The meetings and conferences took place there, not here. He had an option.''
 Some government-business alliances still carry weight. In the Seattle area, for example, Microsoft has pushed its headquarters city, Redmond, to spend millions to upgrade roads for its expanding campus, along with the millions that the software giant has spent.
 Now Microsoft wants the state to replace a 40-year-old, two-lane bridge on a highway that connects Seattle and Redmond. ''We joined the city in arguing for the new bridge,'' said Lou Gellos, a Microsoft spokesman, ''and that was instrumental in bringing the issue to the forefront.''
 But such examples are increasingly rare these days. 
 ''If you had 30 C.E.O.'s saying, 'Damn it, we need new bridges or faster trains,' then that would happen,'' said Peter R. Orszag, director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''The fact of the matter is that public infrastructure spending does not have much momentum behind it at all.''
 Money Tight, Progress Slow
 Mayor DeStefano, 52, an intense man who grew up here, has chosen to spend most of his limited capital budget to renovate New Haven's public school buildings and add three high schools. 
 His goal, he says, is to raise the quality of the education so that families will choose to use the public schools, even moving back from the suburbs. His argument is not unlike Mr. Levin's: Newer buildings, better equipped, make for a better education. 
 ''The high school dropout rate has been cut in half,'' the mayor said, arguing that the multiyear reconstruction project is showing results. ''Eighty-two percent of the kids go on to two- and four-year colleges. That is higher than the state average.''
 Mayor DeStefano's efforts to rebuild New Haven as a city of middle- and working-class neighborhoods represent a reversal of the large urban renewal projects that once dominated public infrastructure spending. New Haven was at the forefront of that movement. Under an earlier mayor, Richard C. Lee, federal tax dollars poured in for slum clearance, highway construction, big public housing projects, a coliseum and a huge downtown shopping mall. 
 Most of this is gone now. A community college rises where two department stores stood, and the mall is closed. The 10,000-seat coliseum, a Mecca for wrestling matches and minor-league hockey, was torn down last January.
 The Route 34 Connector would have linked I-95, south of the city, to the existing Route 34 in the north. Environmentalists helped to halt the project, objecting in particular to a section of the freeway that would have crossed wetlands. More recently, low-income families living near the right-of-way petitioned the mayor to return the land to streets, stores and homes.
 ''They want to recreate the neighborhood in which they grew up, or where their parents and grandparents grew up,'' said Karyn M. Gilvarg, executive director of the New Haven City Plan Department. She estimates the cost of doing so at $150 million, a relatively small sum for Yale, but too expensive for the mayor to proceed quickly. 
 There are other delays. The mayor would like Metro-North Railroad's New Haven line to offer a high-speed service to Manhattan, cutting the 80-mile run to an hour, from an hour and 40 minutes.
 ''The largest cluster of hedge fund managers after New York and London is in Fairfield County,'' the mayor said, arguing that New Haven would get some of that business ''if it were a half-hour or an hour closer'' by train to Midtown Manhattan.
 The state government, which owns the New Haven line, is indeed gradually building up an infrastructure to make faster train service possible. Three hundred new rail cars, built to run at high speeds, will start arriving in 2010.
 ''We are in the process of repairing bridges and upgrading power lines,'' Mr. Martin, the transportation official, said. ''And we are looking at installing concrete ties as replacements for the wooden ones.''
 Given the limited pool of federal and state money, however, the project moves at a snail's pace. Under the best-case schedule, high-speed service will not arrive in New Haven for a decade.
 ''We don't have the big companies pushing the government to get the work done, because they don't need it,'' Ms. Gilvarg said. ''They are all going to China or wherever, and the business sector is smaller in New Haven than it was.''
 Blurred Lines in New Haven
 For New Haven, that leaves Yale.
 ''There are no corporate citizens left in New Haven except Yale,'' Mr. Levin, the university president, said. He, too, would like to see the airport runway lengthened and high-speed rail service to New York. But they are not central to what he considers his mission, which is to make Yale pre-eminent among universities, not just in science and the arts, but in the students' daily lives.
 Eight of the 12 residential colleges have already been rebuilt, at a cost of at least $40 million each. In appearance, the colleges are the same elegant gray sandstone Gothic structures dating from the early 20th century. The new comforts and efficiencies, though, are evident on closer inspection.
 Visiting Trumbull College, next to Sterling Library, Ms. Cruickshank, the university planner, points to the leaded glass windows, which are double paned now, eliminating the unsightly plexiglass that had been screwed to the windows to keep down heating bills.
 The bedrooms are still small, but they are organized for the first time in clusters of four or five around a common room, creating a much more social environment. ''You cannot walk from one place to another without passing students,'' said Janet B. Henrich, the master at Trumbull. 
 Reconfiguring rooms and passageways is costly without being as noticeably expensive as the changes in the basement, which long housed a small theater for student productions, a gallery for their art, a music practice room and a snack bar. But exposed pipes ran along the ceiling, limiting the space. 
 That was solved by enlarging the basement and encasing the intrusive mechanicals, so that the basement no longer seems like one. The theater in particular benefited. It has 60 cushioned seats, banked steeply over the stage, and equipped with the latest lighting and sound devices.
 ''I am not sure it makes for better performances,'' Ms. Henrich said, ''but it is probably safer and easier to learn the basics.'' 
 As Yale invests, pursuing its goals, Mayor DeStefano falls increasingly into step, blurring the line between public and philanthropic infrastructure spending. Yale has acquired land to build two more residential colleges, and the mayor contributed by closing off and giving portions of two streets to the university.
 In return, Yale has agreed to spend $10 million to repair bridges, streets, lights and sidewalks in the neighborhood -- in effect, picking up a bill that would strain the city's budget.
 ''The streets of their campus are the streets of the city,'' Ms. Gilvarg, the city planner, said. ''They are part of the public infrastructure, not private roads.''

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
WHEN Mary Hardy of Larchmont, N.Y., began visiting prospective colleges last year with her son, she had no idea how many campuses they would cover or how much it would cost. It wasn't until their fourth campus, and a stay at an expensive Boston hotel, that she realized, ''Wow, this is really going to add up.'' 
 She says she became ''more mindful'' of her spending. Even so, after 13 campuses in six trips, she estimates that some $6,000 went for hotels, rental cars, trains, cabs, meals and gas. It would have been closer to $10,000 had she not used frequent flier miles. 
 When it comes to spending for college, be it for private tutors, SAT prep classes or tuition, families know pretty much what they can expect to pay. But who budgets for the college tour? 
 Students apply to so many colleges these days that some visit a dozen or more campuses, many of them far afield geographically (read: airfare). Popular destinations for my Westchester County neighbors: Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Montreal, Michigan and Oregon. Bundling visits into family mini-vacations adds even more expense.
 Tom Carroll, a father of three, is a veteran of the college tour circuit. From his home base in southeastern New Hampshire, he and his family have visited close to 24 campuses, venturing as far south as North Carolina. 
 He schedules information sessions in the morning and early afternoon. ''Most schools will give at least one and sometimes more lunch passes to the dining hall,'' he says. ''This is a good way to see what the food choices are as well as get a free lunch.'' He also travels with a cooler of sandwiches, snacks and drinks and stays in discount hotel chains with microwaves in the room. Frozen meals, he notes, can be had for $4 to $7. Mr. Carroll's belt-tightening skills were honed when his eldest child traveled with a field hockey team during high school.
 The best way to save money might seem obvious but eludes many: limit visits to serious choices. ''Parents spend a ton of money, and the kid hates it within the first 30 seconds,'' says Scott White, director of guidance at Montclair High School in New Jersey. ''I've never seen a kid who has changed his mind after the first impression.'' Advance research can help winnow the list. So does waiting until the end of junior year, when you know which college is appropriate, suggests Ms. Hardy, the Larchmont mother. Advanced Placement classes can lower a grade point average, or SAT scores may be substantially higher than expected.
 For middle- and low-income families, the expense of a campus visit may be yet another burden, but for others it seems a small investment in an education that can cost $200,000 at a private college. For one, the visit is widely viewed as beneficial, an opportunity to stop by the financial aid office to meet staff members and learn about institution-specific policies that can help families make wiser choices about where to apply.
 A visit both informs about what a given institution is really like and demonstrates a student's interest in attending -- important to colleges leery about accepting students who might go elsewhere and lower their ''yield.'' 
 Still, admissions officers try to be sensitive to students' economic circumstances, and applicants can signal their interest in other ways, communicating by e-mail or telephone and meeting with admissions staff who visit high schools.
 Then there's this reality check: According to the latest survey of freshmen by the Higher Education Research Institute, more than 50 percent are attending college within 100 miles of home, more than 85 percent within 500 miles. 
 It's easy to visit a range of colleges in your own backyard. ''It's a tank of gas,'' says David Hawkins, director of public policy and research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling. ''You don't even have to stay overnight.''

HEADLINE: Job Requirement

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
Joseph P. Fried writes the Home Front column for the Sunday Business section of The Times.

 BODY:
SCHOOL-supported stints in the workplace have become as familiar a part of the undergraduate world as bleary-eyed cramming for finals. While on most campuses such spells are optional, more than 125 institutions require a dip into the workforce for certain majors, and at least a dozen mandate it for every full-time undergraduate. 
 The experience can be had through an internship (typically part-time, frequently unpaid) or a cooperative program (full-time study alternating with full-time -- and paid -- work). 
 A period of work tied to academics, these colleges say, is too important to be elective. ''It's integral that students take what they learned in classes and be able to apply it in the real world,'' says Susan Leister, director of the internship program at Alverno College, a women's college in Milwaukee where undergraduates -- some 2,000 -- must intern before graduation. 
 While there's no one model, many programs weave in pre-job classes that discuss career skills (self-presentation, networking, organizational analysis) and post-job seminars that sort out how it went. Some students do journals, papers or portfolios while on the job. Colleges frequently work with students to find companies with appropriate positions, but preferred placements are not a given. Hopefuls sometimes have to compete not only with applicants from their own colleges but with others from around the country.
 At Northeastern University in Boston, about 90 percent of undergraduates participate at least once in its widely known co-op program; that comes to 6,000 placements in any given year. ''We spend a lot of time channeling students to the placement they're most interested in,'' says Jack Greene, dean of the college of criminal justice and special assistant to the provost for experiential learning. ''We spend a lot of time vetting the placements, and all are reviewed by cooperative and academic faculty for their complexity and challenge.'' 
 While co-op programs can theoretically steer students to any corner of the earth, part-time internships are limited by geography (read: fewer opportunities at a college in a cornfield) and are more vulnerable to downturns in the economy. That's one reason Michael True, chairman of the Internship/Co-op Special Interest Group of the National Society for Experiential Education, prefers they be an option in most majors, not a requirement.
 At Messiah College, a liberal arts college in Grantham, Pa., where Mr. True directs the internship center, stints are voluntary except in nursing, teaching and a few other fields that require on-the-job training. ''I like to see a student choose to do an internship, to say, 'I want to take responsibility for my career choice and for getting experience off campus.' '' Much to the dismay of liberal-arts advocates who think work can and should wait, surveys increasingly show that college is viewed as career preparation. So the concept of integrated work is a selling point at these institutions:
 Alverno College (Milwaukee)
 REQUIRED One or two internships, depending on major, each totaling 120 hours, usually 8 to 10 hours a week.
 Illustrating how internships relate to academic interests, Ms. Leister cites two recent examples: a management major assisted an operations analyst at Harley-Davidson, scrutinizing productivity reports and seeking avenues for improvement. Pay: $12 an hour. In a non-paid internship, a sociology major interviewed new clients at a public defender's office. Internships are paired with classroom seminars in which students reflect on their experiences. 
 Bennington College (Vermont)
 REQUIRED 210 hours of interning, in each of three years.
 Bennington sets aside the months of January and February (sans tuition) as Field Work Term, which dates back to the college's founding, in 1932. Most students leave campus for the duration -- some even go abroad -- to work at places like television networks, publishing houses, museums and nonprofit groups. The grade is based in part on the student's interpretive essay and on the employer's comments. It is possible to fail. While internships are often related to a student's academic work, this is not a requirement, because the college sees the experience as ''not just doing a specific job'' but as a way of ''studying what it is to work,'' says a Bennington spokesman, David Rees. 
 Kettering University (Flint, Mich.)
 REQUIRED 11 weeks of classes alternating with 12 weeks of work year-round for four and a half years.
 ''Students mature more rapidly in a professional work setting,'' says Stan Liberty, the president of Kettering, which focuses on science and technology. ''They seem to have more self-confidence than students in strictly academic settings.'' All 2,300 undergraduates follow the work schedule, no exemptions, until graduation. ''We have employment fairs, and the companies come in and recruit students as they would regular employees,'' Mr. Liberty says. Students are expected to stay with one employer, because switching to a new one often means another round of entry-level tasks instead of more responsibility -- and more money (starting pay is usually $12 an hour). More than 600 companies, in fields like pharmaceuticals, medical technology and automotive and aerospace industries, hire Kettering students under the program. 
 Keuka College (upstate New York)
 REQUIRED 140 hours in each of four years.
 Most students at this Finger Lakes institution fulfill the requirement by working full time in January, when no classes are scheduled (the college calls it Field Period). ''What's important is the connection between experience and theory,'' says Anne Marie Guthrie, dean of the Center for Experiential Learning. Interns have set up Web sites for nonprofit groups, connecting lessons in video art with the digital nuts and bolts of the workplace; accounting majors have helped with bookkeeping at private companies.
 Northeastern University (Boston)
 REQUIRED One experiential component, which may be co-op participation, internship, study abroad, community service or research.
 Northeastern's experiential requirement, part of a new core curriculum, went into effect this fall for entering freshmen. Most students in the co-op program spend two or three six-month periods in the field (tuition-free) alternating with six months of academics on campus. Usually, Dr. Greene says, ''We send them out with questions from coursework they have to address.''
 He continues: ''When they come back it's grist for discussion in a reflection seminar. It's complementary learning, being tested in a real world setting. A capstone course at the end of senior year ties up the threads of what the student has learned.'' Students receive grades for the seminar as well as the capstone course. 
 Dr. Greene says that in some years up to 80 percent have been offered jobs by their co-op employers. But, he says, ''We're not into the vocational aspect of this.'' He ticks off the skills students acquire -- how to communicate, how to solve problems. And then he cites one more benefit: ''learning who they are and how they can participate and have more direction in their lives.''

HEADLINE: Stop The World (And Avoid Reality)

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has advised many Democratic politicians.

 BODY:
IN the early 1960s, a Broadway musical called ''Stop the World, I Want to Get Off'' was all the rage. But you hear the sentiment of that title a lot these days. 
 Opinion polls show that Americans are both weary with and wary of the rest of the world. It's as if they wish it would all just go away. Naturally, this sentiment is reflected in the current presidential campaign. Among Democrats, it may manifest itself in attitudes toward international trade that range from lukewarm support to outright hostility. Among Republicans, it shows up in attitudes toward immigration -- and most things foreign -- that border on xenophobia.
 Part of the Stop-the-World Syndrome clearly stems from despair over the Bush administration's foreign policies, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan. But part of it seems to have economic origins. Increasingly, Americans seem to be losing faith in globalization. Why?
 One very old reason is that the jobs destroyed by international trade are far more salient than those it creates. And with our huge trade deficit, imports do seem -- as a matter of arithmetic -- to be destroying more jobs than exports are creating. 
 But think about that simple arithmetic for a moment. We do not yet have full data for 2007, but in 2006 imports exceeded exports by a whopping 5.5 percent of real gross domestic product. Because jobs are roughly proportional to real G.D.P., it is tempting to conclude that trade ''destroyed'' 5.5 percent of all American jobs. Yet the unemployment rate in 2006 averaged 4.6 percent. Are we to believe that, if trade had been balanced, the unemployment rate would have been 5.5 percentage points lower-- making it minus 0.9 percent?
 Many Americans are justifiably distressed about rising income inequality, but foreign competition gets far too much of the blame. In fact, the best and most comprehensive studies of the inequality question assign international trade only a bit part in the drama. The main protagonists are all domestic, including changes in technology, the decline of unions, failures of public policy and changing social attitudes toward inequality.
 Americans who want to stop the world fear that the nation either already is or is destined to become a victim of globalization. Such pessimism seems downright un-American. It is also fundamentally illogical. After all, much of globalization amounts to Americanization -- as numerous foreign critics have ruefully observed. The United States has long been the biggest, most open, most market-oriented and most competitive economy on earth. Globalization is now spreading these practices to the rest of the world, creating a huge, open, competitive global marketplace. But Americans are past masters of this game. How can we lose if the rest of the world decides to play on our field?
 Fortunately, the Stop-the-World Syndrome has had only limited effects on the nation's policies so far. We have not yet succumbed to isolationism. On immigration, our bark has been frightening, but our bite has not yet gone very deep. On trade, we have lost our enthusiasm for liberalization, but we have not yet turned protectionist.
 The key word here is ''yet.'' Our country may now be approaching the danger zone in all three dimensions. If so, the next president faces a huge challenge. Briefly put, she or he will need to find ways to make Americans more comfortable with globalization.
 One part of the task involves using the presidential bully pulpit -- not to bully, but to explain why globalization is both (a) inevitable and (b) more an opportunity than a threat. She or he must find the right language to explain, first, that the world will not stop to let us off and, second, why we should not want to disembark anyway.
 Such hortatory language is important. But it must be backed up by actions that help the people hurt by globalization. What are some examples?
 Economists have long recognized that increased trade creates both winners and losers. So the United States has a variety of Trade Adjustment Assistance programs that are intended, at least putatively, to cushion the blow for trade's victims. Unfortunately, we have never taken the job seriously. T.A.A. has been around since ''Stop the World'' played on Broadway, but it has always been embarrassingly small and weak. It needs to be expanded, improved and, indeed, generalized so that workers who are displaced for any reason -- not just trade -- have a stronger safety net to catch them.
 That, in turn, means expanding some existing programs, like making unemployment insurance more comprehensive, and vastly increasing -- and improving -- job retraining programs. It also means enacting new programs like universal health insurance, guaranteed pension portability and so-called ''wage insurance.''
 As present, most Americans who lose their jobs suffer a catastrophic loss of income. The minority of job losers who are fortunate enough to be covered by unemployment insurance see perhaps half of their lost wages replaced. But most job loss is not covered by unemployment insurance. That should change. In addition, wage insurance would replace a portion of the wages lost by workers who do find new jobs at lower rates of pay. While wage insurance has been criticized for encouraging employers to pay low wages, it would also encourage the unemployed to find and take jobs more quickly. 
 Americans who lose their jobs are also likely to lose their health insurance coverage. And some also lose their accumulated pension benefits. None of this should be allowed to happen in a civilized society. We cannot stop the world from spinning on its axis, but we can fix these problems.
 On the trade front, a number of agreements, starting with Nafta but notably also those with Jordan and Peru, have demonstrated that it is possible to design reasonable safeguards for the environment and labor without interfering much with trade. These precedents point to what could become a bipartisan compromise on trade that would enable America to regain its accustomed leadership position.
 Speaking of workers' rights, how about applying some of those ideas at home? Hypocritically, we urge other nations to sign on to the International Labor Organization's ''core labor standards'' while we refuse to do so ourselves. The government should be protecting, rather than undermining, American workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively.
 This wish list is not pie-in-the-sky. It is an agenda that can be accomplished in a single presidential term. Even if it were all enacted, some Americans -- sad to say -- would still lose their jobs to competition from trade, and for many other reasons. But job loss would lose some of its current vicious sting, the global economy would not look quite so frightening, and maybe some of that good old American optimism would come back.

HEADLINE: Commuting by Road, but Not by Car

BYLINE: By DAVID McKAY WILSON

 BODY:
FOR eight years, Brenda J. Murtha, a pension consultant with Aetna, drove 50 miles round-trip from her home in Colchester, Conn., to her job in downtown Hartford. But when Aetna recently announced that employees would be charged to park, she decided to try CT Transit's Marlborough-Colchester Express bus. 
 Two months later, Ms. Murtha is still enjoying the ride. She says she saves about $300 a month in gas by leaving her Ford Explorer in Colchester, and with Aetna's monthly mass-transit incentive jumping to $50 this month, she will be spending just $15 a month to commute. 
 ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this makes sense,'' said Ms. Murtha, 47. ''I'm all for saving money -- it's better in my pocket than in the pocket of some oil company.''
 As $3-a-gallon gas prices remain common around the region, and mass-transit advocates urge commuters to leave their cars at home to ease congestion on the roadways and cut air pollution, bus systems are attracting new riders like Ms. Murtha. Over the past year, ridership is up in Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester and on Long Island. Improvements are planned throughout the region: from a new fleet of hybrid buses in Westchester that will run on a mix of electricity and low-sulfur diesel fuel to a rapid-transit bus system in Connecticut that is planned to run on a partly inactive Amtrak railroad right-of-way from Hartford to New Britain.
 ''It makes sense for people to commute by bus,'' said David A. Lee, general manager of CT Transit. ''It can be more comfortable, convenient and economical, especially if you have to pay to park.''
 Buses in the metropolitan region have two customer bases: commuters, like Ms. Murtha, who can drive to work but choose not to, and people who do not own a car and need buses to get around. Bus systems throughout the region are rolling out plans to appeal to both groups. 
 In Westchester County, the Bee-Line System is adding buses to eight of its busiest routes in the southern part of the county, to cut waiting time and add seats. Several of the routes travel through city streets in Yonkers and Mount Vernon to connect with New York City subway stations in the Bronx. 
 ''That's really good because sometimes it seems like you are waiting forever for a bus,'' said Christina Garcia, who takes two Bee-Line buses from her home in the Bronx to her job in Yonkers. 
 These southern Westchester routes have become increasingly popular since April, when Westchester became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's regional fare collection system. That enabled Westchester riders to buy monthly transit passes from the authority, allowing them to transfer to a New York City bus or subway for 25 cents. Previously, Westchester riders had to buy tickets or monthly passes in Westchester and New York City if they used both mass-transit systems. 
 The county transportation commissioner, Lawrence C. Salley, attributes the 6 percent increase in ridership in 2007 to the MetroCard's introduction. The county is projecting 6 percent growth again this year.
 ''The MetroCard is tremendously good for our passengers,'' Mr. Salley said. ''For many, it cut their commutation costs in half.''
 But joining the Metropolitan Transportation Authority fare collection system meant that Westchester lost some control over fares. The authority is expected to raise monthly bus passes throughout the system this winter to $81, from $76, while keeping the single-fare ticket at $2. 
 Long Island Bus, an M.T.A. agency that operates 54 routes in Nassau County, saw ridership grow by less than 1 percent in 2007. The system has no plans to improve service in 2008, said the director of communications, Jerry V. Mikorenda.
 ''We are trying to maintain status quo,'' he said. 
 While fares are rising in Westchester and on Long Island, New Jersey Transit and CT Transit are holding the line on fares for 2008, with New Jersey Transit's single-ride fare holding at $1.35 and CT Transit's remaining at $1.25. 
 In New Jersey, bus ridership was up 1 percent in 2007. Daniel E. Stessel, a New Jersey Transit spokesman, said officials were developing ways to make it easier for riders to transfer between trains and buses. For example, a dedicated bus lane for rush periods is being built over four blocks in Newark, along congested Raymond Boulevard, between Raymond Plaza East and McCarter Highway, to benefit riders who transfer from trains at Newark Penn Station to New Jersey Transit buses. The bus lane uses new traffic-signal synchronization, changeable message signs and pavement stripping.
 ''Those four blocks can be subject to severe gridlock,'' Mr. Stessel said. ''We expect that riders will experience a noticeable time savings during the evening rush.''
 In Connecticut, transportation officials are moving ahead with plans for a 9.4-mile busway from Hartford's Union Station to downtown New Britain. The project, estimated to cost $500 million, will include nine stations along the route, which passes through New Britain, Newington and West Hartford on its way to Union Station. Stops will be near large employers like Aetna and Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. 
 Transportation officials decided to move forward on the busway after studying other options to alleviate congestion on Interstate 84, the state's heavily traveled east-west corridor. Alternatives included adding more lanes, establishing high-occupancy vehicle lanes, or a light-rail system. Several cities, like Pittsburgh and Ottawa, have had success with busway systems. 
 The 9.4-mile trip would take about 14 minutes, compared with the 25 to 40 minutes it takes commuters at peak periods now, said Michael A. Sanders, the transit administrator for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. He estimated that up to 15,000 riders a day would take buses along the route. 
 State officials are seeking up to $300 million in federal aid to help pay for the project. Construction is expected to begin in August 2009 and be completed in 2012.
 ''This will get you to work faster than if you drive,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''It's really going to speed up travel time for the buses.''

HEADLINE: Harry Macklowe's $6.4 Billion Bill

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
IN August 2003, Harry B. Macklowe raced from lender to lender to round up a record-breaking $1.4 billion to buy the General Motors Building, the 50-story commercial skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan that is one of New York's trophy properties. 
 Then 66, he gambled mightily to outmaneuver rival bidders and to vault back into the top ranks of New York developers. He went so far as to put down a nonrefundable $50 million deposit and sell many of his residential buildings to raise cash. Some bankers and real estate executives scoffed at the deal, privately suggesting that Mr. Macklowe had overpaid and would drown in an undertow of debt.
 Not for the first time, Mr. Macklowe, an acknowledged master of winner-take-all real estate poker, proved his skeptics wrong. He expanded and enhanced the valuable retail space of the G.M. Building -- on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street -- by creating a glass cube for an Apple store that has become a popular tourist destination. As the market soared, Macklowe Properties refinanced the tower twice, most recently in a deal that values it at about $2.7 billion. 
 But these days Mr. Macklowe is scrambling for financing yet again. He has a $6.4 billion debt payment coming due next month in connection with his purchase of seven other Midtown Manhattan office buildings a year ago. When he bought those buildings from Equity Office Properties, he more than doubled the size of his real estate portfolio and used only $50 million of his own money to do so; he borrowed $7 billion to finance the rest of the purchase. 
 As often happens in real estate, a once-frothy national cycle is losing steam and the market has turned against many buyers. Mr. Macklowe, with his empire of 15 prime office towers and two development sites in one of the world's best business districts, is awash in expensive, short-term debt at the very moment that financial backing for megadeals has all but shut down. One of his loans is backed by a $1 billion personal guarantee, and he is already in default on $510 million in development loans for a Park Avenue project. 
 Mr. Macklowe's predicament marks the denouement of an unprecedented four-year period in which developers threw gobs of money at real estate as prices for office towers, especially in Manhattan, doubled and tripled almost as fast as sales could be recorded. Investment banks avidly underwrote the binge, often basing loans not on existing rents but on projections of rental income well into the future. 
 All of this worked swimmingly so long as the economy hummed along and banks could pool the loans and sell them to investors. Now, the economy is showing signs of stress, and Wall Street's repackaging machine is sputtering.
 ''In hindsight, everybody should have been more cautious,'' said Robert Bach, the chief economist at Grubb & Ellis, the national real estate brokerage firm. ''We all knew this wasn't going to last, but we hoped it would end with a whimper, not a bang.''
 Analysts, bankers and developers are not predicting the imminent collapse of the commercial real estate market, a reprise of the early 1990s, when property values dropped by half, vacancies soared and banks were crushed under the weight of soured real estate loans. But developers who jumped in at the top of this market are likely to feel some pain because purchases were built on the assumption that rents would keep escalating and that the value of buildings would keep appreciating.
 With building owners no longer able to refinance their properties and pull out cash, Mr. Macklowe and his son, William S. Macklowe, have only a month to repay $7 billion, work out a new deal with their bankers or risk the breakup of their empire. There is widespread speculation in the real estate industry that the Macklowes may be forced to unload some of their properties at a discount to creditors -- including a sizable stake in the G.M. Building. At worst, they could be forced to shed much of their portfolio.
 ''This is very high-stakes poker,'' said Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a real estate finance and brokerage company in New York. ''To owe more than $5 billion in this environment is tremendously risky. There are a very, very limited number of lenders who can make multibillion-dollar loans now.''
 For his part, Mr. Macklowe -- a fierce competitor who still races his custom 112-foot yacht in regattas off the coast of Sardinia -- coolly plays down the crisis. He went sailing in the Caribbean three days before Christmas while his son stayed home negotiating with the family's bankers. 
 ''Our lenders have supported us in the past to an extraordinary degree,'' Mr. Macklowe said in an interview in his stark white offices on the 21st floor of the G.M. Building, the evening before he flew south. ''We're pretty confident that, going forward, we'll be able to achieve accommodations and extensions from our group of lenders.''
 THE Macklowes aren't the only real estate barons in a tight spot. The Kushner Companies, also family owned, plunged into the Manhattan real estate market in 2006, paying $1.8 billion for 666 Fifth Avenue, at 53rd Street. The cash flow from 666 Fifth represents only about two-thirds of the amount needed to service the debt on the building -- a shortfall of about $5 million a month -- according to Real Capital Analytics, a research company in New York.
 In Los Angeles, the developer Robert F. Maguire III may be forced to sell his publicly traded company, Maguire Properties, after buying a portfolio of buildings from the Blackstone Group just before the subprime credit crisis sent many of his tenants into bankruptcy. An Australian company, the Centro Properties Group, is putting itself up for sale after failing to refinance billions of dollars of short-term debt stemming in part from its acquisition of an American shopping center company.
 To be sure, some bright spots remain. Though vacancy rates are up nationally, the Manhattan market remains healthy, with the vacancy rate in Midtown, the most desirable business district, just 5.5 percent. Because relatively little new space is coming on line in Manhattan in the next few years, the New York market appears to be relatively solid.
 But fewer deals are being made and rent increases have slowed, if not stopped. If financial institutions continue cutting payrolls, much vacant space could come back on the market and drag down rents, even in Manhattan.
 Despite the problems hanging over Mr. Macklowe's holdings, some analysts say that it would be a mistake to count him out. This is the third time Mr. Macklowe has stumbled since he started in the real estate business about 48 years ago, and each time he has come roaring back. He has a knack for enhancing the look and cash flow of his buildings, and he is regarded as a shrewd, brass-knuckled negotiator in a rough-and-tumble industry.
 A senior member at a major real estate investment firm, who described Mr. Macklowe as a friend and asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize their relationship, said the developer has ''assets with enough value to pay off his bridge loans.'' But, this person asked, can Mr. Macklowe ''do it with everybody smelling blood in the water and looking to buy a bargain?''
 Some of the wiliest players in the real estate business have already been circling Mr. Macklowe. 
 This past fall, Vornado Realty Trust, of which Steven Roth is chairman, bought a stake in loans collateralized by four of Mr. Macklowe's buildings on an apparent bet it might snare some great real estate on the cheap, bankers and real estate executives said. 
 For the last month, Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of the real estate company Related, has been talking to Mr. Macklowe about a deal for Macklowe Properties' coveted Drake Hotel site, at Park Avenue and 56th Street, an executive involved in the talks said. Real estate executives say another rival developer, Sheldon H. Solow, may buy some of Mr. Macklowe's debt in a bid to gain control of the G.M. Building, although a spokesman for Mr. Solow said Mr. Solow was not trying to acquire any of the debt.
 THE Macklowes readily acknowledge that they are looking for equity partners. Mr. Macklowe's son, William, emphasizes the quality of the buildings in his family's Manhattan portfolio, which includes 2 Grand Central Tower, Park Avenue Tower and Worldwide Plaza. He points out that the buildings are also largely full. 
 ''It's not a real estate crisis but a capital markets crisis,'' the younger Mr. Macklowe said. ''Our legacy and acquired portfolios are renting at market rates or better. In August, when the world took a 180-degree turn, we and others got caught up in it.''
 As it now stands, the Macklowes say they owe Deutsche Bank a $5.2 billion payment in February, in connection with the Equity Office transaction. They owe the Fortress Investment Group, a leading private equity and hedge fund firm, $1.2 billion for a bridge loan backed by a limited partnership interest in the G.M. Building, stakes in 11 other Macklowe buildings and a personal guarantee from the Macklowes for $1 billion. 
 The Macklowes are in default on a $510 million loan connected with a project planned for the Drake site. Although the Macklowes have a nonbinding agreement with an anchor tenant, a Nordstrom department store, they have not acquired all the land for the project. A spokesman for Nordstrom said the company was also talking to other developers.
 At the same time, the family is trying to obtain a new construction loan for a 30-story office building being built at 510 Madison Avenue, at 53rd Street.
 Even during this tense period, Mr. Macklowe often interrupts an interview with jokes. And those who know him say that he can be both endearing and notoriously tough. He has tangled with lenders, regulators, city officials, tenants and even his former East Hampton neighbor, Martha Stewart.
 ''Dealing with Harry can be a charming experience, and it can be like a trip to the dentist without anesthesia,'' said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of the real estate investment services firm Eastern Consolidated. ''At the end of the day, Harry's operative phrase is: It's just business.''
 DESPITE Mr. Macklowe's hard-edged business reputation, friends say he also devotes considerable time to his grandchildren, his collection of modern art, golf at the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton and, of course, sailing. 
 The son of a Westchester County garment executive, Mr. Macklowe was a college dropout when he started as a low-level real estate broker in 1960. Three years later, he and his supervisor formed their own company, Wolf & Macklowe. By the 1980s, he was building a succession of towers, including the angular black-glass Metropolitan Tower, on 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues; 2 Grand Central Tower; and the residential building RiverTower, on the East Side, where he and his wife, Linda, have a duplex.
 Mr. Macklowe would like to be known for his building designs, or his art collection. But what many New Yorkers recall is that in 1985, Mr. Macklowe's company was involved in the illegal, nocturnal demolition of two single-room-occupancy hotels near Times Square, only hours before a law went into effect protecting the buildings. He was not indicted in the incident, but one of his executives pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment. Five years later, he opened the Hotel Macklowe on the site. 
 As his purchase of the G.M. Building demonstrated, Mr. Macklowe often gets the timing right. On the day the stock market crashed in October 1987, he sold a package of 15 buildings to Joseph Neumann for $350 million, or $120 million more than Mr. Macklowe and his partners paid for them 10 months earlier. Mr. Neumann's empire subsequently collapsed.
 Like many other developers in the early 1990s, Mr. Macklowe took a beating during a severe real estate recession, ultimately returning both the Riverbank West tower on 42nd Street and the Hotel Macklowe, now known as the Millennium Broadway Hotel, to the lenders.
 Rather than disappear, Mr. Macklowe did a series of smaller projects in the mid- to late 1990s, building less-glamorous apartment houses or renovating office buildings on Madison Avenue. In 2003, he bought the G.M. Building, a move that left many of his peers describing him as a real estate genius. The building was built for General Motors in 1968 and now houses tenants like hedge funds, the investor Carl C. Icahn and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Mr. Macklowe suggests that the building is worth $3.5 billion or even $4 billion, though it may be hard to find a lender or investor who agrees.
 By the fall of 2006, Mr. Macklowe was sitting pretty, primarily because the value of the G.M. Building had jumped so handsomely. He was putting together a premier development centered on what was once the site of the Drake Hotel, which he bought in 2006 for $418.3 million. He and his son were also building a hotel and apartment house at Madison and 53rd Street. After the residential market appeared to slow, they nimbly converted it into an office building for hedge funds, complete with a swimming pool and a luxurious health club.
 Earlier this year, Mr. Macklowe decided to try his luck again. After the Blackstone Group, a private equity powerhouse, beat back Vornado to take over Equity Office with a $39 billion bid, Blackstone quickly decided to sell most of Equity Office's Midtown Manhattan buildings without taking possession of all of them. During 10 days of whirlwind deal-making, Mr. Macklowe secured financing and stepped in to buy seven of the buildings for $7 billion.
 The timing looked propitious. Credit was so readily available that Mr. Macklowe needed to put down only $50 million. He borrowed the rest in short-term loans from Deutsche Bank and Fortress. But that left him in the dicey position of having to find new sources of permanent financing or equity to pay off the short-term debt.
 ''He went from utter comfort to being on the precipice again,'' said one real estate executive who has worked with Mr. Macklowe and asked not to be identified to retain a relationship with the developer.
 The annual rent for the seven Midtown buildings was generally $55 to $59 a square foot, according to William Macklowe, but Deutsche Bank and Fortress underwrote the deal on the assumption that rents would soon rise to $100 a square foot. 
 After all, the commercial real estate market was higher than ever. The vacancy rate had fallen to record lows, while high construction costs made new buildings prohibitive. Landlords at prime office buildings were getting more than $100 a square foot annually, while the average rents for first-class Midtown buildings rose to $73.31 by the first quarter of 2007 from $55.21 in the first quarter of 2005, according to Reis Inc., a New York office research company. 
 At the same time, average prices for large office buildings in Midtown more than doubled, to $745 a square foot from $357, according to Real Capital Analytics. Investment banks and foreign companies began pouring capital into real estate. Lenders, in turn, took more risks, often providing financing for 90 to even 100 percent of a building's price. Investors became ever more willing to accept a lower initial rate of return, known as the capitalization rate.
 As with the residential market, the money flowed easily because lenders did not keep these risky loans on their balance sheets -- as the commercial banks and savings-and-loan associations did to their peril in the early 1990s. Instead, Wall Street repackaged hundreds of billions of dollars of loans as commercial-mortgage-backed securities and sold them to investors.
 ''Loans with more aggressive terms that weren't available in '03 and '04 became the norm in '06, when suddenly lenders became very accommodating,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in real estate investment trusts. ''The attitude was, 'Gee, we're not going to own this stuff; we get terrific fees for underwriting these loans, and we can blow it out in a C.M.B.S. deal in three months.'''
 EARLIER this year, however, the real estate winds shifted. In April, just two months after Mr. Macklowe bought the Equity Office properties, Moody's Investors Services, the bond rating agency, said it planned to readjust how it rated commercial-mortgage-backed bonds to better reflect their risk. The agency complained that lenders were making overly optimistic projections about rent growth.
 By last summer, as the subprime mortgage crisis hit residential lending and credit markets tightened, opportunities evaporated for developers like Mr. Macklowe to refinance expensive short-term debt.
 Perhaps slow to realize the severity of the credit problem, Mr. Macklowe paid nearly $60 million in June for virtually the entire seventh floor of the Plaza Hotel, the Manhattan landmark that has been converted into condominiums. He hired the architect Charles Gwathmey to design a 13,000-square-foot apartment, which offers a view across Fifth Avenue to the G.M. Building. 
 But in September, the Macklowes hired the investment banking guru Joseph R. Perella to help them find new equity partners. They flew to the Middle East to visit what cash-starved developers call ''the Big Four'' -- Kuwait, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai -- in an unsuccessful hunt for fresh capital. 
 ''We knew we could get higher value'' for the Equity Office buildings, ''but it wasn't going to come in years two, three or four,'' William Macklowe says. ''We had a plan for a permanent capital solution. The events of the late summer slowed that down.''
 The Macklowes say they also spent more than $150 million paying off short-term lenders at the Drake Hotel site and received an extension on their senior debt, which has since expired. But the Macklowes still have to contend with a $510 million note backed by the site. 
 ''There are people out there who are very eager to acquire it if Macklowe decides not to build, or something untoward happens,'' Harry Macklowe said. ''We're talking to several of our peers who've asked to join us in that development. We're evaluating.''
 There is increasing pressure, meanwhile, to persuade Deutsche Bank and Fortress to extend their deadline beyond Feb. 8 for at least $6.4 billion in debt, allowing the Macklowes more time to find new equity partners. 
 Bankers and real estate executives are divided over whether the Macklowes will be forced to sell some properties -- maybe even some of the most valuable assets. Some also argue that layoffs in the financial industry this year will almost certainly depress the market and the value of commercial property.
 Others, like Scott Latham, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield, contend that the vacancy rate is so low that it would take tens of thousands of layoffs to turn Midtown into a tenants' market. Rents will not go up as fast as they have in the past 12 months, he said, but almost no one is predicting that rents will fall.
 Mr. Macklowe ''may shed some assets, just because it allows him to control whatever he holds onto,'' Mr. Latham said. But there are still enough foreign investors interested in the Manhattan market, he said, ''that Mr. Macklowe may not have to sell his core properties.''
 A friend of Mr. Macklowe, who asked not to be identified to preserve a business relationship with him, put it another way. ''Somehow he always manages to pull it off,'' the friend said. ''But he won't do anything until the bitter end. He will play it out all the way.''

CHART: RISK, REWARD AND A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE: With Manhattan office building prices nearly doubling in five years, buyers like Harry B. Macklowe were willing to accept dwindling capitalization rates, or a lower initial rate of return. But now, heavy debt loads and those lower rates of return are squeezing investors like Mr. Macklowe.

HEADLINE: Going for Growth, Even in a Slowdown

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN times of economic uncertainty, you would think that investors would flock to traditionally defensive stocks, like shares of stable utility companies or value-oriented dividend-payers. 
 Yet in the current slowdown, which may turn into a full-blown recession, money managers are betting on what has often been a riskier segment of the market: growth stocks. 
 These stocks are shares of fast-growing companies whose earnings tend to expand more rapidly than the market as a whole, and they are often more volatile than the broader market, too. 
 So far, growth has been a winning bet. Since the stock market became jittery in July amid fears about a slowing economy, growth stocks in the Russell 1000 index have advanced 2 percent. By comparison, defensive-minded value stocks -- beaten-down or overlooked shares that tend to appeal to cautious investors -- have lost more than 7 percent.
 Even as slowdown fears are turning into recession worries this year, many investors still favor growth. ''I still think growth is where you want to be,'' says Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services in Boston. Mr. Kleintop said he particularly favors large-capitalization growth stocks in the technology, health care and industrial sectors.
 A recent survey of investment managers by the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash., found that three out of four money managers described themselves as ''bullish'' on large-cap domestic growth stocks. And nearly four in five were optimistic about technology stocks. By comparison, less than half described themselves as bulls on emerging-market stocks and less than a third were upbeat about value.
 But why bet on growth stocks, which are riskier and throw off less dividend income than value shares? There are several compelling reasons. 
 For starters, until last year, large-cap growth stocks had long underperformed the broad market. From 2000 through 2006, such stocks lost nearly 5 percent a year, in contrast to annual gains of nearly 8 percent for value shares and about 2 percent for the broader stock market. So the argument goes like this: If the stock market is on the verge of a recession-driven downturn, growth may have less room to fall. 
 Moreover, the Federal Reserve has recently been lowering short-term interest rates to bolster economic activity and head off recession. Many market watchers expect the Fed to keep lowering rates this year, especially if the housing market continues to cool.
 Historically when the Fed cuts rates, growth stocks benefit. Since 1974, growth stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have advanced 11 percent, on average, in the six months after the first in a series of Fed rate cuts. During those same periods, value stocks gained just 7.9 percent, according to an analysis by Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief investment strategist.
 Money managers recommend focusing on stable growth companies for another reason. In times of slowing growth, investors are apt to choose companies with more reliable earnings growth, said Ernest M. Ankrim, Russell's chief investment strategist. This would point to traditional growth sectors like technology and health care.
 Sure enough, growth stocks have shown stable -- and enviable -- earnings of late. 
 Consider the third quarter of 2007. While profits among companies in the overall S.& P. 500 fell nearly 5 percent, on average, earnings of tech companies in the index rose 17 percent, and those of health care companies in the index grew 13 percent. 
 More of the same is expected for the fourth quarter. The consensus on Wall Street is that the tech earnings grew 22 percent and the health care earnings 15 percent in the final three months of last year. Those figures are in stark contrast to the 9.5 percent drop in overall fourth-quarter S.& P. 500 profits that analysts are bracing for, according to Thomson Financial.
 Here are some other reasons to consider growth sectors in this slowing economy:
 TECHNOLOGY Tech sector funds returned more than 17 percent, on average, in 2007, one of the best years for the sector since the Internet bubble burst in 2000. ''Big-cap tech had a great year, and I wouldn't see any reason why that would change,'' said Michael J. Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfolio, a mutual fund that invests in stocks, bonds and alternative assets.
 Would a potential recession throw a wet blanket on this comeback? Perhaps. But keep in mind that 55 percent of tech sector revenues are now derived overseas, making technology one of the most globally oriented sectors in the S.& P. 500.
 And because there are greater fears of a recession occurring in the United States than in the global economy, tech may be able to withstand trouble here better than some other sectors, market strategists said.
 HEALTH CARE This sector in general, and pharmaceutical shares in particular, have been a disappointment lately because of a dearth of new blockbuster drugs. 
 But among classic growth sectors, health care is considered relatively recession-proof. After all, no matter how healthy the economy, people still get sick. And after years of being unloved, health care stocks in the S.& P. 500 are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 15, on average. That's roughly in line with the ratio of the overall index, though health care stocks have traditionally traded at a significant premium.
 INDUSTRIALS While it's true that the industrial sector is economically sensitive, it is now sensitive to the global economy. More than two out of five dollars generated by domestic manufacturers now come from overseas, according to S.& P. 
 And thanks largely to the falling dollar, the cost of doing business with domestic manufacturers is tumbling, making the sector even more appealing. David A. Rosenberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, noted in a report that unit labor costs for domestic manufacturers were now 30 percent lower than the average for the rest of the industrialized world. 
 The dollar might weaken further if the Fed continues to cut interest rates, so concern about the economy could make the growth sector more attractive than other parts of the market -- not less.

HEADLINE: Economic Policy for Tough Times

 BODY:
As one economic pillar after another began to buckle in 2007 -- lending, home sales and house prices, factory orders, holiday shopping -- economists kept saying that recession was avoidable as long as employment held up. A job means a paycheck, a paycheck means spending, and spending means hope for the economy. 
 On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employment in December had buckled as well. Over all, a meager 18,000 jobs were created. Even worse, hiring in the private sector contracted by 13,000 jobs, a harbinger of recession. The figures are subject to change, but job growth has been slowing since June, making a big upward correction unlikely. The unemployment rate, which is not subject to revision, also jumped in December, rising to 5 percent. As recently as last March, unemployment was only 4.4 percent. Such a big swing in such a short time also suggests a recession. 
 If the unemployment rate continues to rise in the next month or two, Congress and the administration will have to step in to try to spur the economy. The best hope of doing that is with stimulus measures to increase spending and, in the process, lessen the impending economic harm to the most vulnerable families. 
 Unfortunately, there is no sign that President Bush -- for whom tax cuts are always the answer no matter the question -- realizes what is needed. After meeting with his economic advisers on Friday, just hours after the release of the jobs report, he insisted that the best economic move now is for Congress to work with him to ''make sure taxes remain low.'' A day earlier, one of his aides told reporters that among the president's economic priorities this year would be a push to make his signature tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, a permanent part of the tax code. 
 That is not new, and it is wrongheaded. The promise of tax relief in 2011 would not increase spending in 2008. And economic stimulus is, by definition, temporary, intended to counter poor economic conditions. Permanent tax cuts could actually hurt the economy by worsening the outlook for the budget deficit for years to come. 
 Congress should not take its cues from the White House. Instead, lawmakers must come up with a stimulus package that addresses the country's clear and present threat of recession. To be effective, stimulus must be targeted at low- and middle-income Americans. As a group, they will spend most, if not all, the assistance they receive, giving the economy an immediate lift. 
 Economic research is compelling that the most stimulative measures in a downturn are enhanced unemployment benefits and direct aid to states -- which can be tailored by the states to best fit residents' needs. A one-shot tax rebate can be effective if it is targeted to people who will spend the largess. That argues against tax cuts for investment income -- a centerpiece of the Bush tax cuts -- because those are skewed to high-income Americans who tend to save rather than spend their extra dollars. 
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already appointed a team of lawmakers to devise a stimulus plan that could be adopted quickly if conditions worsen. The toughest part of their task will be getting the White House to finally recognize that more tax cuts is not what the country needs and will not head off a recession.

HEADLINE: The Grapes of Wrath

BYLINE: By ALEKSANDRA CRAPANZANO. 
Aleksandra Crapanzano is a screenwriter who lives in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
It was mid-July, 10 days into a heat wave so unrelenting that it had penetrated the thick stone walls of my parents' Umbrian farmhouse, and there was no relief to be found, indoors or out. There was also a big fresh Mediterranean fish waiting in the fridge -- its name, in Italian, is ombrina. But not one of us felt like eating, let alone going anywhere near a stove. By the time the sun finally set that night, it was nearly 9:30; we jumped into the pool, cooled off and suddenly realized we were famished. Improvising with what was at hand, my mother, a superb cook, braised the ombrina in a quick sauce of tomatoes, garlic and saffron, and then, reaching for the nearest bottle, splashed some grappa into the pan -- and so a favorite family recipe was born. 
 It was the grappa that transformed that rather simple sauce into a potent remedy for the day's heat-induced stupor. Grappa is a fiery drink, not for the mild of heart or palate. Or as the Italian writer Italo Calvino memorably described it: ''suitable only for defrocked priests, unemployed bookkeepers and husbands who have been cuckolded.'' A cheap grappa, often at upward of 80 proof, is little more than a burning liquid flame that sears your throat and wakens your spirit before knocking you flat. A great grappa, on the other hand, is smooth and complex and leaves a long, blossoming finish. 
 As temperatures started to drop this winter, I couldn't help remembering our improvised summer meal. So I decided to call my favorite chefs and ask what cold-weather dishes I might make with grappa. To my surprise, the ideas poured in. While tasting one of the better grappas -- like Nonino's Picolit or Jacopo Poli's Vespaiolo -- is certainly a revelation, cooking with it reveals its character without the hangover. It is a surprisingly versatile ingredient, equally effective in savory and sweet dishes. For Andrew Carmellini, the chef of A Voce, grappa gives that important note of acidity that rounds out the flavors in his roast pork with plums. The grappa cuts the richness of the meat and counters the sweetness of the plums, turning what might otherwise be too sweet a sauce into a sophisticated dialogue of flavors. I tried substituting prunes for the plums and found the resulting dish even silkier and more nuanced. Carmellini's Italian grandmother lived 35 miles from Nonino, so grappa flows in his blood. And polished though his cooking at A Voce is, he confessed to me that at home he likes to splash his favorite all-American butter pecan ice cream with grappa for a quick lift. 
 The beauty of cooking with grappa, I discovered, is to be found in its split personality. Straight from the bottle, it adds vibrancy, but cooked down, the alcohol evaporates, leaving an elegant, lingering complexity. Fabio Trabocchi, the chef of Fiamma in SoHo, took his first job in the Veneto region of Italy, where at around 10 every morning, the men in his village would gather for a caffe correcto -- coffee spiked with grappa. Perhaps it's the memory (or trauma) of this head-banging custom that persuaded Trabocchi to cook his brandy down until not a trace of alcohol remains. His delicate pear risotto glows with merely a subtle hint of grappa -- like the trailing vapor of vermouth in a fine martini.
 But grappa needn't be limited to Italian cooking. Chef Saul Bolton of Saul in Brooklyn uses Clear Creek's muscat grappa -- an American grappa from Oregon -- to add a floral note to his perfect cured salmon, giving it a faintly sweet undertone, a welcome change from the usual gin- or vodka-cured gravlax. Perhaps the best American grappa producer, Clear Creek, has grown so popular of late that Stephen McCarthy, the owner, doubled the size of his distillery 18 months ago yet says he still can't keep up with demand. 
 I have nothing against Clear Creek, but when I think of grappa, I never think of Oregon. I think of Umbria. I think of the sun. I think of my mother's delicious ombrina. I think of our plates practically licked clean, and the bottle of grappa sitting half empty on the table. And I remember the storm that blew in that night, lifting the heat and leaving a cool dew on the grass by morning. If there is one drink certain to start a storm, it's grappa. A talisman of sorts that I won't forget next summer when the sun begins to bake us dry.

 Pork Arrosto With Prunes and Grappa
 1 center-cut pork loin roast, 4 to 5 bones (between 3 and 5 pounds)
 For the brine (optional):
 1 1/2 cups kosher salt
 1 1/3 cups sugar
 For the spice rub:
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary 
 10 sage leaves
 2 tablespoons kosher salt
 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
 2 tablespoons olive oil
 For the prunes:
 1 3/4 cups prunes
 1/2 cup sugar
 Juice of 2 lemons
 2 bay leaves
 Pinch of crushed 
 black pepper
 1/4 cup grappa
 Salt.
 1. If you choose, brine the meat. In a large pot, bring the salt, sugar and 2 quarts of water to a boil and stir until the solids dissolve. Transfer to a heatproof container and cool completely. Cover pork with the brine and refrigerate for 45 minutes. (The brine will make the pork very tender, so it's worth doing, but if you don't have time, you can skip this step.) Pat pork dry with paper towels. 
 2. Set the oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Make the spice rub. On a cutting board, mix together the garlic, fennel seeds, thyme, rosemary, sage, salt and pepper and finely chop using a chef's knife. Pour the olive oil over the mixture. With your fingers pressing on the flat side of the knife, grind the herbs and spices by rocking the knife back and forth and pulling the mixture across the board holding the knife at a slight angle. Be careful not to cut yourself; the mixture is slippery. Alternatively, grind in a mortar and pestle. Grind until the mixture has the consistency of wet sand. 
 3. Rub the pork all over with the spice mixture and set in a roasting pan. Cook in the oven until the internal temperature registers 140 degrees, for medium, between 60 to 90 minutes, depending on its size. Let rest for 15 minutes.
 4. Meanwhile, prepare the prunes. In a nonreactive medium saucepan, combine the prunes, 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, lemon juice, bay leaves and black pepper. Simmer until the prunes just start to break apart, about 20 minutes. Add the grappa and simmer for 5 minutes more. Season to taste with salt.
 5. Slice the pork into chops. Serve each topped with the prune sauce. Serves 4 to 5. Adapted from the forthcoming ''Urban Italian'' (Bloomsbury).

 Ombrina in Grappa
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1 (14-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes, chopped, with juices 
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
 1 2-pound ombrina or 1-pound tail-end fillet of striped bass
 1/4 cup grappa
 Finely chopped parsley, to garnish.
 In a large saucepan, heat the garlic in the oil until fragrant. Add the tomatoes and their juices and a pinch each of salt and pepper and cook for 5 to 10 minutes to reduce. Add the saffron and 1 1/4 cups of water, mix well and cook for 5 minutes more. Slip the fish into the pan and simmer, covered, until the fish is opaque, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the grappa and let the alcohol burn off. Sprinkle in the parsley and serve immediately. Serves 2. Adapted from Jane Kramer, the author's mother. NOTE: The recipe can easily be double or tripled. 
 ----
 Grappa-Cured Salmon
 2 pounds center-cut salmon fillet, boned
 2 tablespoons fennel seeds
 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
 2/3 cup kosher salt
 1/3 cup light-brown sugar
 1/3 cup sugar
 1/2 cup grappa
 Toasts (optional). 
 1. The day before, prepare the salmon. Place the fillet, horizontally and skin-side up, on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut 1-inch-long, very shallow incisions that just break the skin across the length of the salmon, about 1 inch apart.
 2. In a skillet over low heat, toast the fennel, coriander and peppercorns until fragrant. Place in a coffee grinder with 3 tablespoons of the salt and pulse until fine. Combine the spice mixture with the remaining salt and the sugars.
 3. On the counter top, lay overlapping strips of plastic wrap large enough to envelop the salmon fillet. Eyeball what the footprint of the salmon would be on the plastic and sprinkle half of the spice mix over the footprint. Drizzle half of the grappa over the spice mix and then place the salmon on it. Cover the other side of the salmon with the remainder of the spice mix and then the grappa. Tightly wrap first in the plastic and then in aluminum foil. Put on a plate and set a weight on top. Refrigerate for 16 to 20 hours. Halfway through the curing, flip the wrapped salmon over so the juices get equal time on both sides of the fish.
 4. Unwrap the fish and gently brush off the spices. Rewrap until ready to use. Serve thinly sliced with, if you choose, toasts or a shaved fennel salad. Serves 8. Adapted from Saul in Brooklyn.

 Risotto With Grappa, Pears and Taleggio Cheese
 9 cups chicken stock
 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
 1 shallot, minced
 3 cups carnaroli rice
 Salt
 2 1/2 cups dry white wine
 3 medium pears (like Forelles), peeled and diced
 1/4 cup grappa
 1/2 pound taleggio cheese, rind removed and diced
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 Freshly ground white pepper.
 1. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the chicken stock to a simmer. Keep warm over low heat.
 2. In a separate saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. When it sizzles, add the shallot, stir with a wooden spoon and cook gently until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and a large pinch of salt and mix for about 2 minutes more, cooking the rice until the grains are translucent.
 3. Add the wine and stir until it has completely evaporated. Begin to incorporate the hot stock, one ladle at a time, adding the next when the stock is almost completely absorbed. Stir continuously. Cook for a total of 16 to 21 minutes. Add the pears and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.
 4. In a small saucepan, heat the grappa to a simmer to let the alcohol evaporate. Add the hot grappa to the risotto, along with the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and the cheeses. Continue stirring until the risotto reaches a smooth, creamy consistency, adding more stock if needed. Season with salt and white pepper to taste and serve immediately. Serves 6. Adapted from Fiamma in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: A Turning Point for Transit

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
YOU don't need Nostradamus to know that traveling to work, visiting Manhattan to catch a play or heading to the shopping mall is going to get more expensive in 2008.
 Not only are gasoline prices heading toward new highs, but bridge, tunnel and highway tolls, as well as fares on New York's subways and commuter train and bus lines, are going to climb this year.
 This confluence of increases comes as record numbers of passengers in the metropolitan area are taking mass transit. Yet the agencies that operate the transportation systems are having difficulty finding the money to expand service and upgrade facilities, so they are asking drivers and riders to pay more.
 The toll and fare increases, though, will close only part of the financing gap, so lawmakers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are expected to wrestle with the thornier problem of how to pay for long-term transportation needs. 
 ''This is going to be a pivotal year,'' said Martin E. Robins, the director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University's school of planning. ''The questions of cost and finance are intertwined.''
 The most critical decisions may be made in New Jersey, where the Transportation Trust Fund, which maintains and upgrades the state's highways, is on financial life support. To replenish the fund and tackle the state's ambitious list of transportation projects, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, in his State-of-the-State address on Tuesday, will unveil the details of a plan to refinance New Jersey's toll roads.
 The governor is expected to propose starting a public corporation that would issue bonds backed by future toll increases. The proceeds from the bonds could help reduce debts and finance the widening of the New Jersey Turnpike and other multibillion-dollar initiatives.
 What is not known is how high the tolls on the turnpike and the Garden State Parkway -- and possibly the state's gasoline tax -- would rise to pay for all of this.
 Toll increases also await drivers who use the tunnels and bridges that span the Hudson River and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's crossings in New York City. Riders on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, and private bus lines in New Jersey and Westchester, will feel the pinch, too, because of their own fare increases.
 All this comes as a state commission in New York considers ways to reduce traffic in Manhattan, including a proposal by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to charge $8 to drive south of 86th Street. Even if the commission balks at that element of the plan later this month, it could still endorse introducing tolls on the four East River crossings -- the Brooklyn, the Manhattan, the Williamsburg and the Queensboro Bridges.
 An equally large question mark faces passengers at the region's three largest airports. Fares have risen during the past few months as airlines passed along their higher fuel costs. But a federal plan aimed at relieving congestion at Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International Airports could drive prices higher, too.
 Wherever prices are headed, though, transportation analysts say passengers and drivers will see only marginal improvements in service next year.
 ''In a nutshell, you have more people needing to use more facilities,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior transportation fellow at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit New York, New Jersey and Connecticut policy group. ''You have to provide more service, yet you don't have enough funds, so you have to raise prices with no guarantee you'll get an improvement.''
 Tunnels and Bridges
 Spring is a time of renewal or, in the case of drivers traveling in and out of New York City, a time of recalibration. On Friday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was expected to vote on its proposed toll increases on its Hudson River crossings. The changes, if approved by the Port Authority's board, will be put in place in March or April.
 Under the proposal, drivers paying cash would be charged $8, instead of the current $6, to use the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and the bridges to Staten Island.
 But the 80 percent of drivers who use E-ZPass during peak hours would lose their current $1 discount compared to cash and pay the same $8 as cash customers. To relieve congestion, E-ZPass users who drive the crossings outside the peak hours of 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and 12 to 8 p.m. on weekends, would pay $6, a $2 discount.
 The Port Authority, which has not raised tolls since 2001, said the increases would help finance its 10-year, $30 billion capital plan, which includes billions of dollars to rebuild the World Trade Center, overhaul the PATH train system and help pay for an additional rail tunnel into Pennsylvania Station from New Jersey.
 ''With road and rail networks already stressed, we must invest now to provide security, maintain our bridges and tunnels, improve mass transit and reduce congestion,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the Port Authority's chairman.
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is not standing pat either. This spring, drivers with an E-ZPass who use the Brooklyn Battery and Midtown Tunnels and the Throgs Neck, Triborough, Verrazano-Narrows and Whitestone Bridges will pay $4.15, up from $4. Those paying cash will soon pay $5, instead of $4.50.
 The increases, which will be accompanied by higher fares on the authority's subways and commuter lines, are about half of what was initially proposed.
 Highways
 The big question for drivers in New Jersey is how much money Governor Corzine hopes to raise in his highway rebonding program. The more money he seeks, the higher and faster tolls are expected to increase.
 Mr. Corzine has warned that drivers could be hit with substantial increases. His commissioner of transportation, Kris Kolluri, said tolls would need to rise by at least 45 percent just to cover the cost of repairing bridges (estimated at $13.58 billion) and widening the turnpike between Exits 6 and 9 (estimated at $2 billion). Because construction costs are growing, tolls could rise even faster to cover the expenses.
 Fearing a backlash from voters, some New Jersey state legislators, including Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, a Democrat of Middlesex County who is chairman of the powerful Transportation and Public Works Committee, have argued that raising the gasoline tax may distribute the burden more fairly.
 Riders in eastern New Jersey, he said, rely on toll roads more than residents in the western part of the state, but everyone pays for gasoline. Besides, New Jersey's gas tax is the third lowest in the country and has not been increased in two decades. Adjusted for inflation, the tax has declined more than 40 percent since 1988, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a commuter advocacy group.
 Tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, by contrast, were last raised in 2003, when drivers using cash were forced to pay 20 percent more.
 Mr. Wisniewski and other lawmakers have proposed that an increase in the gas tax -- now 14.5 cents a gallon -- replace a large toll increase or be coupled with a smaller one.
 As New Jersey waits, New Yorkers are girding for a toll increase on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. Drivers using E-ZPass would receive a smaller discount compared to cash. The New York State Thruway Authority has also proposed 5 percent toll increases in 2009 and 2010, saying the extra cash is needed to pay for its $2.1 billion highway and bridge improvement plan.
 Crossing the Tappan Zee Bridge would also cost a dollar more, or $5.
 Commuter Rail and Bus Lines
 Transportation analysts often note that prices for riding mass transit have gone up faster than highway and bridge tolls over the past few decades. But train and bus operators are also paying more for fuel, labor and land.
 With some fanfare, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said in November that it had found $220 million more than projected in its budget, obviating the need to raise fares as high as initially anticipated.
 ''The revised proposal responds to what we heard from the public while returning the $220 million to customers using each of our operating agencies,'' said Elliot G. Sander, the authority's executive director and chief executive.
 Under the new plan, $2 single-ride tickets -- which just 15 percent of riders buy -- would not change. But bonuses for multiple-ride MetroCards would fall to 15 percent from 20 percent, while the price of 7- and 30-day passes would rise as much as $5.
 Weekly and monthly passes on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, which the authority operates, will rise as much as 4.3 percent. One-way, round-trip and 10-trip tickets will increase as much as 7.7 percent.
 New Jersey Transit might seem beneficent because it is holding fares steady in 2008, but it raised fares last year by an average of about 10 percent. The DeCamp bus line in northern New Jersey and the Bee-Line buses in Westchester County also raised fares in 2007.
 Airports
 Perhaps the toughest place to gauge where prices are headed is at the region's three largest airports -- La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark.
 Some analysts argue that prices will remain steady, or even decline, because competition among airlines remains fierce on the most popular routes. But others note that rising fuel prices have forced airlines to raise their prices at least eight times since summer.
 Complicating matters, the United States Department of Transportation decided in December to reinstitute caps on the number of flights per hour during peak times at Kennedy and to introduce limits at Newark. Only 82 flights will be able to leave or land each hour at Kennedy, as opposed to an unlimited number now -- often as many as 110 in peak hours.
 At the same time, the airlines, while not losing any current slots, agreed to spread their flights out during the day to reduce aerial gridlock. This could lead airlines to lower some ticket prices to entice passengers to fly during less popular hours.
 ''This is a net positive for passengers,'' said Kate Hanni, who runs the Coalition for an Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights. 
 Ms. Hanni said the new rules would create an additional 40 to 60 flights a day. ''The airlines will absorb the underutilized time slots,'' she said.
 Passengers, she said, are already seeing a difference because JetBlue and Delta have voluntarily redistributed some flights to different times.
 But because fewer flights will be leaving during peak hours, prices for those tickets could rise, particularly for business travelers who have little choice when to fly and who often buy tickets at the last minute.
 If the record delays at the New York region's airports do not subside, passengers can take comfort in a new state law that would penalize airlines that fail to provide adequate services to passengers trapped on the tarmac for more than three hours. Airlines operating in New York can be fined up to $1,000 a passenger if they do not supply water, fresh air, power and working restrooms during such delays.
 The New York law, the first of its kind in the country, does not obligate the airlines to take passengers stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours off the planes, because the state does not have jurisdiction over the matter.

Out-of-Control Debt
 I am a 26-year-old living in New York City with what I think is average debt. I'm glad my parents encouraged me to go to the school I wanted, though it was very expensive, even with scholarships. But I just can't keep up with my loan payments. I have a decent-paying job, but that, coupled with higher and higher rent and cost of living, is just killing me. I work freelance jobs on my off time to catch up with bills. I don't want to give up my life here for someplace easier and cheaper. I would love some really specific advice -- maybe resources for getting organized.
 Lindsay Stadig, Brooklyn 
 CITY life can be pricey. A couple of restaurants a week (conservatively, $50) plus two nice glasses of wine ($16) add up to $264 a month. That doesn't mean you need to move home with the folks. But financial advisers recommend a first step, and it may feel like mild torture. Ready? 
 Sit down with all your statements and list each debt, interest rate, payment period and minimum payment. You can do this on paper or in a software program like Quicken, which allows payments to be tracked. Then follow one of three paths.
 Option one: The D.I.Y. approach. Start with a handy online debt calculator, like MasterCard's user-friendly version (www.debtknowhow.com), which compares income and debt and lets you know if what you've accrued is ''manageable.'' Advisers say to set a big goal (say, to have the loans paid off in three years) and create road markers for yourself along the way. Encourage friends to keep you honest. At www.43things.com, a personal-goal networking site, more than 7,000 people have listed ''get out of debt'' as an objective. ''Sometimes knowing that it's not just you is helpful,'' says Lynnette Khalfani, author of ''Zero Debt for College Grads.''
 Option two: Take your list to a credit counselor or a debt coach. It will cost up front, but if you are too right-brained to execute a plan on your own, having one made for you could pay off, Ms. Khalfani suggests. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (www.nfcc.org) and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies (www.aiccca.org) list accredited financial planners.
 Option three: Revisit the debt. Federal loans are automatically set up with a standard repayment structure, but three other formulas exist -- all likely to reduce monthly payments now (but increase the amount you'll owe later).
 Extended-term plans stretch out payments by up to a decade; income-based plans charge what you can afford according to government standards; graduated plans assume borrowers will be able to make exponentially higher payments in the future, allowing payments of as little as $5 a month now. 
 Call your lender about adjusting terms. While you're at it, ask for a lower interest rate, advises Robert Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt. Some lenders will do so by some fraction of a percentage point just for signing up for automated payments. 
 College Prep
 Surveys show that college admissions offices attach considerable importance to grades in college prep courses. My grandson's high school recently eliminated all Advanced Placement classes and substituted the International Baccalaureate program, which is a two-year commitment in all academic disciplines, culminating in exams at the end of 12th grade. My questions are these: What is the actual definition of a ''college prep'' course, and how can proficiency be evaluated for admissions since there is no exam grade available until after acceptance/rejection has already been decided?
 Eleanor Shore, Commack, N.Y.
 NOT to worry. Most of the 558 American high schools that offer the I.B. diploma program award letter grades for classes, so the college application process isn't altered for these students; also, up to two I.B. tests can be taken at the end of junior year and could show up on transcripts. 
 Along with A.P., honors classes and college courses taken while in high school, the I.B. program, which includes community service and an extended essay, counts as college prep.
 Parke Muth, director of the international admissions office at the University of Virginia, sees dozens of I.B. students' applications each year. He says he doesn't favor one college prep class over another but respects the I.B. program. He says he hears concern from students and parents that the program is tough on the G.P.A. But, Mr. Muth says, ''if a school offers those classes and a student doesn't take them, then do they want an academic challenge? We want them to do it as a challenge, and also to do well.''
 Degrees Behind Bars
 I am writing on behalf of my grandson, who is an inmate at Attica Correctional Facility. He has just earned a B.S. cum laude from Upper Iowa University. He would like to go on to a master's in writing. The difficulty is that he cannot communicate via telephone or computer and must use written communication only. Can you suggest any program that would work with him under such conditions?
 Sylvia Fidler, Great Neck, N.Y.
 ONLINE education has pretty much taken the place of snail-mail correspondence programs. The students who suffer the loss are prisoners, most of whom, for apparent reasons, are without access to e-mail or Web browsing. 
 ''We are seeing fewer inmates now in programs than we did 15 years ago,'' says Steve Steurer, executive director of the Correctional Education Association, a nonprofit national organization that administers educational programs in prisons. ''I don't see a lot of help for this guy.''
 Another complication: the more advanced the degree, the less likely it is to be offered in a strictly correspondence program. Once you get beyond a bachelor's, says Kay Kohl, the C.E.O. and executive director of the University Continuing Education Association, ''it's sort of assumed you are looking for a profession, and will go online.'' 
 One ray of hope: A smattering of writing classes is available through correspondence from a few accredited universities. Indiana University's independent study program offers them on both paper and video; Ohio University has some undergraduate-level writing courses and the Open University, out of Britain, offers several courses, but no degrees to United States residents.

HEADLINE: Downtown Moved Away

BYLINE: By LARY BLOOM. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Hartford 

 BODY:
 ON a Saturday afternoon in December, the midst of the holiday shopping season, a tale of two cities emerged.
 At 1 p.m., the parking lot at Ann Street and Asylum Avenue in downtown Hartford -- packed with commuter vehicles on weekdays -- held but six cars, one of them mine. Apparently, this was not enough volume to keep the collection booth open, so it seemed as if the spot I secured was free.
 Odd, as there was much going on in the city: the Festival of Trees and Traditions at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art; ''A Christmas Carol'' at Hartford Stage; John Patrick Shanley's ''Doubt'' at TheaterWorks (which is what brought us downtown); and the Bushnell's road-show version of ''Wicked.'' This was aside from the usual bustle at the Hartford Public Library -- a dramatically remodeled institution that, with its energy and diverse programming, seems to me the heart of town. 
 The axiom that culture encourages commerce, however, appeared to be outdated, as there was little commerce to be witnessed. Two of the city's finest restaurants, Feng Asian Bistro and Max Downtown, were closed for lunch, as usual on Saturdays. Thank goodness for Trumbull Kitchen, an innovative place (try the dessert tapas -- including, for just $2, a warm sticky bun). 
 Clearly, we were many holiday seasons removed from the busy sidewalks that surrounded the old Civic Center mall, or the years when book lovers flocked to Huntington's. Never mind the way Main Street once teemed with shoppers who could catch a glimpse of the white-gloved Beatrice Fox Auerbach, owner of the retail mecca G. Fox and Co., which her grandfather founded in the mid-19th century. If shoppers were teeming in December 2007, they were doing it invisibly. 
 When we left TheaterWorks, we decided to pick up a few things for dinner. It would have been convenient to walk to Bliss Market, the food store that was supposed to open on the first floor of the residential complex where the Civic Center shops once stood -- the first downtown food market in decades. But that deal fell through. Instead of cheeses from Italy, the windows advertised rental space. 
 Even so, the Industry of Parking endures. The man at the lot's booth suddenly appeared. ''You owe me $8,'' he said, without acknowledging the weakness of the day's economic prospects. It then occurred to us that it is possible to shop for groceries from downtown Hartford -- by driving 3.6 miles to West Hartford's ambitious new development called Blue Back Square, which opened in November. 
 The tongue-twisting name was inspired by Noah Webster's first textbook, referred to as ''the Blue-backed Speller'' because of the color of its cover. Indeed, a shopper walking from the long-established part of West Hartford Center passes a statue of Webster and the public library named for him (after being closed 15 months for renovation and expansion, it reopens Jan. 6 at 1 p.m.). 
 Along with a six-screen theater and the Hartford Hospital Wellness Clinic, Blue Back Square mixes shops with living spaces, offices and institutions -- the juxtapositions that characterized downtown Hartford in its heyday. 
 On that Saturday visit, however, our foray was limited to the new grocery store, Whole Foods. Parking was at such a premium that an employee marked tires to determine whether someone other than a food shopper was making use of the free space. 
 A few days later, I returned to Blue Back to get a more intimate look at the contemporary version of ''downtown.'' It is at once cozy and bustling. I mistakenly assumed I could walk into the Cheesecake Factory for lunch on a Friday without having to wait an hour for a table. So I made do across the street at Barnes & Noble, where the coffee bar served a sandwich of grilled focaccia with chicken that was still cold, which takes some doing. With a ''tall'' Starbucks and a hunk of brownie, this unsatisfying lunch set me back about $11, but, hey, this was hip West Hartford.
 There was so much to take in. Crate and Barrel has drawn big crowds. And there is a variety of specialty shops. The architecture of this innovative district is pleasing enough, with touches of classic urban design, though some denizens have complained that the scale is too imposing in 550,000 square feet. And, if you were to say it all seems a bit Disneyesque, you wouldn't be off base. Even so, there is a distinct reality to the phenomenon. A lawyer who has worked for many years for a top firm in Hartford told me that he had no choice but to move from the city to Blue Back Square -- ''My clients won't come downtown anymore.'' 
 There had been opposition to Blue Back, much of it orchestrated by the Taubman Centers Inc., which owns nearby Westfarms Mall and sued to stop the development (the case was ultimately dismissed). Now the majority of the town's residents seem to embrace this retro district (though they already complain about parking). There is talk, too, that this is the new Hartford. Even so, it has no chance to attract the diversity of cultures and ideas that make a true downtown. For provinces like ours, those days seem over.

HEADLINE: For Those Who Remember the Neediest, Helping Others Is Its Own Reward

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
Since Nov. 4, The New York Times has been printing daily profiles looking into the lives of New Yorkers who have overcome hardships with help from one of the seven agencies supported by The Neediest Cases Fund. 
 They are people like Stephanie Womble, who left a homeless shelter for a fresh start; Oscar and Maria Mayorga, raising their grandchildren since their daughter was killed by her husband, who then killed himself; and Jonathan Rosario, who is going to college after an unsettled upbringing. They represent the thousands of people who are helped annually.
 Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the Neediest Cases Fund, said: ''This is turning out to be a remarkable Neediest campaign. The present sluggish economy inflicts increasing distress on many families.'' Yet the dollar amount is ahead of last year by 12 percent, he said, and the number of donors so far has risen by 45 percent. ''The jump in donors is explained by a huge increase in online contributions made through nycharities.org,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''What makes that especially gratifying is that online donors are likely to be younger -- demonstrating compassion and conscience across the generations.''
 Here are comments from several donors whose support continues 96 years of giving:
 ''I think the articles in The New York Times are important. They tie in the humanity of why people need help and that it cuts across all ethnic and social parts of society.'' 
 Jon Preizler, Westchester County 
 ''The articles on The Neediest Cases have inspired me, and I appreciate that each of us collectively can make a difference in the lives of those about whom I read.''
 Susan Bartolone, Manhattan
 ''Thanks to The New York Times for reminding us -- in particular those of us who have material resources in abundance -- that small targeted gifts can change lives.''

HEADLINE: Condo Confections Hit a Snag

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
ASBURY PARK and Vernon are two communities offering up cautionary real estate tales to start the year: a grand development project in each has taken a sharp turn for the worse. In Vernon, work has ceased prematurely on a ski-resort village, and in Asbury it has screeched to a halt at the Esperanza, a condominium complex front and center in the effort to revive the beachfront.
 In each case, developers ascribed their sudden inaction to increasingly dismal market conditions -- sluggish sales and foot-dragging lenders. 
 The Vernon case concerns Mountain Creek ski resort, whose owner and developer, Intrawest, is being sued over a promise made to a group of condo buyers that a four-season resort would grow up around them. 
 In Asbury Park, a work stoppage at the Esperanza as of Dec. 11 stunned city officials, who began scrambling to counter the potent symbolism of work halted on a project whose name means ''hope'' in Spanish. The Esperanza was just starting to rise above ground level on the site of a previous unfinished building whose builder had gone bankrupt, and whose rusted skeleton had haunted the derelict shoreline area for more than 20 years. 
 Now, some market watchers discern the reappearance of the time in the 1980s when the first Asbury redevelopment plan collapsed, merging into a sea of such failures across the country. 
 ''I think we're just beginning to realize the scale of the excesses that took place in the '02-to-'06 period,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, as he contemplated the setbacks in Vernon and Asbury Park. 
 ''The period from 1982 to 1988 was very similar, nationally, and in New Jersey: lending without verification; very little down payments, if any, required,'' he said. ''This current nightmare is a repeat,'' he added, with ''projects conceived in heavy boom years falling apart as we head toward economic recession.''
 Dean Geibel of Metro Homes, the builder of the Esperanza, cited the impact of the ''national mortgage crisis'' in announcing his company's work stoppage.
 Other developers and market analysts said they assumed that Metro had not garnered enough sales contracts at the 224-unit project -- which has the most amenities and highest prices of any of the three large residential complexes taking shape on the beachfront -- to persuade lenders to finance the next stage of construction.
 In late summer, Mr. Geibel said that 57 units had been sold at the complex, which has a striking wavy-sided design, a large recreation area with pool over the parking garage, a ground-floor restaurant and shops.
 A week ago, Mr. Geibel said he was working on several options for restarting the project and perhaps scaling it down, in concert with city officials and redevelopment project managers, including Madison Marquette, a Las Vegas-based company brought in last year to oversee retail and entertainment redevelopment.
 He acknowledged ''the possibility of some sort of collaboration with Madison Marquette,'' adding that he did not believe this would mean subtracting housing or adding retailing. He noted that Madison had expressed interest in ''participating'' in the residential part of the Asbury Park redevelopment.
 In fact, said Terence J. Reidy, the city manager, Madison has also met with Westminster Properties, which built the first phase of Wesley Grove, a town-home complex at the south end of Asbury's mile-long beach. With 91 condos complete, and the early burst of sales having dissipated as the market cooled, Westminster is looking to sell its interest in finishing that project.
 Mr. Reidy asserted that he had been meeting with a steady stream of investors still looking to get in on the ''renaissance'' in Asbury despite the overall real estate slowdown. According to him, the current master plan for redevelopment was specifically designed to include many developers, so it could not collapse based on the fortunes of just one, as happened at the Esperanza site in the 1980s.
 Mr. Geibel, whose company is proceeding with three other large projects in Hudson County, including the Trump Plaza Jersey City, said he remained committed to Asbury. Last week, he said he was searching for a new concrete contractor for the Esperanza, because the one hired earlier had not worked up to speed. 
 In Vernon, there is no movement at all to restart work on the elaborate Appalachian ski village planned by Intrawest, which bought the faltering Mountain Creek ski area and water park in 1999 and immediately upgraded both facilities.
 Intrawest owns many of the most successful ski resorts in North America -- including Whistler/Blackcomb, Tremblant and Stratton. It bedazzled skiers with the improvements, and potential buyers with gorgeous renderings and a DVD played round the clock in a special theater built at the base of the ski slope.
 ''It was going to be Vail in New Jersey, with more than 1,000 homes, little shops everywhere, and hotels, and entertainment,'' said Steven I. Kern, who bought a condo several years ago at the first residential offering, Black Creek Sanctuary, where just 133 units have now been completed and roughly 80 sold.
 A year and a half ago, Intrawest also opened a four-story condominium hotel, called the Appalachian. But its sales have not reached 75 percent, typically the point at which a residents' association takes over management. Nor has any retail shop, restaurant or bar opened as planned at the hotel, although it was announced three weeks ago that a Starbucks has agreed to come.
 Mr. Kern is among 38 Black Creek owners suing Intrawest for breach of promise, seeking to recover their losses after investing in what they were told would be properties they could easily rent out when the resort village came alive, he said.
 Intrawest, which was subsumed last year by Fortress Investment Group, said through representatives that it could not comment on the pending lawsuit. But last spring, as the real estate picture began to cloud up, the company issued a daunting statement to homeowners.
 ''During the last two years Intrawest and the resort industry in general has experienced a significant softening of the real estate market, which has included Mountain Creek,'' the company asserted, adding that it could not commit to completing the village.
 ''All of a sudden they took away all the pictures of what the village was going to look like,'' said Dana Lieberman of Long Island, who bought at Black Creek two and a half years ago. ''Everything that we were promised, it was gone, just like that.''

HEADLINE: Many Unhappy Returns

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
Returned Goods
 Malls and stores become far quieter in January, as the holiday shopping frenzy fades. But the calm masks the arrival of a different but related season for the retail trade. Masses of unsatisfied gift recipients set in motion a season of returns, sending vast quantities of goods back into the complex supply chain from which they came. While this activity hits a peak around this time of year, it's fairly constant year-round. By one estimate, we return $100 billion worth of products annually. Where does it all go?
 According to Vaidyanathan Jayaraman, an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied ''reverse logistics'' for years, companies have become more efficient at answering that question. In part, this has been a response to ecological concerns -- minimizing the tonnage of your unsatisfactory purchases that end up in landfill. But, he says, it is also because companies have gotten better at converting returned goods into revenue. A paper that he and a colleague, Yadong Luo, published earlier this year in a journal called Academy of Management Perspectives included examples in categories like clothing, cosmetics and electronics. 
 For makers of computers and peripherals, the returns issue is particularly important, both because of concern about discarded electronics, or ''e-waste,'' and because such products become outdated so quickly by new innovations. They are, in a sense, ''perishable,'' as Jayaraman puts it. He says one way that firms like Hewlett-Packard, which he has followed since the late 1990s, have improved is the speed with which they categorize returns: the truly broken product, the still-good-as-new item sent back because of buyer's remorse and the various possibilities in between. The point is to figure out what's in good-enough shape to resell. ''There's a huge market'' for returned electronics, Jayaraman says.
 Much of this process is usually jobbed out to third-party specialists like Genco, which is based in Pittsburgh. Genco has 48 centers where thousands of specialists sort through returned merchandise in most every consumer category. Curtis Greve, an executive vice president at the company, explains that some of the things it handles go to wholesale salvage buyers or merchants abroad who buy by the pallet or truckload, and others flow to consumers willing to buy used products via eBay or other vendors. Retail Surplus, one of the company's storefronts on eBay, for example, recently offered a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet D2430 printer, described as ''an open-box return that 'looks new,' '' meaning the packaging ''may be worn and retaped'' but ''the item should function properly.'' (It sold for $14.49.) Another one of Genco's eBay storefronts, Chance Deals, features even lower prices -- and a blunt caveat emptor. (Greve says with a laugh that the only thing guaranteed about, say, a DVD player sold through Chance Deals is that at some point it really was a DVD player -- though he also notes that Chance Deals has a positive feedback rating of 95 percent.) In all, Greve says, Genco liquidates about $3.5 million worth of merchandise a day.
 Hewlett-Packard is one company that explicitly treats ''reuse'' situations as part of its efforts to be a good corporate citizen by reducing e-waste. Jayaraman says the best systems also involve recycling components from truly broken products. Still, it would be an overstatement to say that even such improved efforts have halted, much less reversed, that problem: Greenpeace, in its most recent assessment of various electronic manufacturers' performance, notes that electronic-product life cycles have accelerated drastically in recent years, making such goods more ''perishable'' than ever. 
 Those who work in or study the front lines of the rejected-product economy have some interesting tales about how dissatisfied consumers are created -- and what role we play in the process. Jayaraman, for example, mentions a printer company that found pages from school reports left behind by students who became suddenly unhappy with their purchase, immediately after the end of a semester. Genco's Greve has an anecdote about a bread-making appliance that was being returned in perfectly functioning condition by a surprising number of buyers; the problem, it turned out, was that while the picture on the package showed a rectangular loaf, the thing actually made round ones. In recent years, Greve adds, the crush of postholiday returns has actually eased a bit. Is that because of improved product quality, perhaps? No, it's the rising popularity of something else: ''Gift cards,'' Greve says.

HEADLINE: A Defensive Strategy For REIT Investors

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
AS concerns mount about the credit crisis and its effects on the economy, money managers have been urging investors to use a more defensive tack when choosing real estate investment trusts. For many investors, however, that may take some getting used to. 
 REITs, after all, were the darling of Wall Street for several years, providing average annualized returns of 23.6 percent from November 1999 through January 2007, outperforming the overall stock market. 
 But last year, property REITs -- companies that own portfolios of commercial real estate like hotels and office buildings, and make up the bulk of the market -- posted negative returns of 15.7 percent, on average, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. 
 Many investors had fled everything related to real estate because of the sagging housing market, though industry analysts attributed the reversal of fortunes for REITs largely to the credit problems that started in the subprime mortgage market. There are worries that these problems could eventually weaken the economy and stifle demand for commercial space. 
 Although economists are split as to whether the economy will fall into a recession this year, most of them expect at least a slowdown. Last fall, the Federal Reserve Board forecast that the gross domestic product would grow by as little as 1.6 percent in 2008.
 Some REITs are more likely than others to weather a downturn and continue producing dividends and earnings. Finding them, however, may be more challenging these days, said John J. Stewart, an analyst at Credit Suisse, partly because REITs have become a more widely accepted asset class and therefore are more volatile than they used to be. 
 ''You've got to be a bit more careful today when it comes to defensive investing in REITs,'' Mr. Stewart said. 
 David Harris, a REIT analyst at Lehman Brothers, agreed. ''It's kind of looking at who's the least worst,'' he said in a recent interview. 
 In choosing the better REIT stocks, Mr. Harris said he looks at a company's balance sheet, particularly at the level of debt; the quality of its portfolio, especially property location; the dividend history; management experience; and the development pipeline. (In a downturn, the fewer projects in the works, the better.) 
 Mr. Stewart, meanwhile, has created a ranking of so-called defensive REITs. The list of 61 companies, which initially came out last summer and was recently updated, is based on 10 criteria, including a company's size, earnings stability and growth and dividend record. It also takes into account the duration of property leases.
 Topping the list is the largest REIT by market capitalization -- the Simon Property Group, which owns and operates shopping malls throughout the world. Most of the top-ranked REITs are also in the retail sector, including Kimco Realty and Realty Income, which Mr. Stewart recommends.
 Entertainment Properties Trust, which owns and develops megaplex theaters and entertainment retail centers nationwide and in Canada, was also ranked highly. The chief executive, David Brain, said he was confident the company would hold up well in a softer economy. For one thing, he said, ''our properties are very high revenue producers and also produce a present cash flow level of about two times the rent obligation.''
 And, ''as the economy gets worse, it gets a little good,'' he added, because consumers are likely to be looking for less expensive entertainment options like movies. ''If you go to any kind of sporting event or concert, those are $50 to $60 price points easily,'' Mr. Brain said. ''For a tenth of the cost, you get a very high-quality production.'' 
 Many retail REITs are also well insulated, Mr. Stewart said, because they have both high occupancy rates and long-term leases. ''If you look at Realty Income, it has one of the longest lease terms in the universe -- 13 years, on average,'' he said. (Entertainment Properties has some leases in the 10- to 20-year range as well, according to Mr. Brain.) 
 ''Of course, the downside is you don't have the same benefit in a rising economy,'' Mr. Stewart said.
 REITs with community shopping centers anchored by grocery stores and discount retail chains -- like Federal Realty Investment Trust, Equity OneandRegency Centers -- are also ranked highly. ''The demand for that type of retail doesn't really fluctuate too much,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a real estate research company in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 Also on Credit Suisse's defensive ranking list are several industrial and office REITs, including ProLogis Trust, AMB Property and Boston Properties. ''ProLogis has less direct exposure to the U.S. economy than any other REIT,'' Mr. Stewart said.
 Mr. Harris favors Boston Properties as well, along with Douglas Emmett, which owns offices and apartments in Los Angeles, and Vornado Realty Trust, which owns office and retail property and has been diversifying outside New York City. While he was concerned about weakness in office space demand from financial service tenants in 2008, he said the defensive attractions of long-leased properties provided a counterbalance. 
 Largely absent from most analysts' safety lists were REITs that specialize in apartment buildings. ''We are most concerned about multifamily REITs,'' Mr. Stewart said. When the housing market was strong, he noted, ''apartments got crushed because people were moving out and buying homes.'' But now they face new challenges: the single-family homes that aren't selling are being turned into rentals in certain markets. 
 Mr. Harris and his team offered similar observations, writing in a recent report about the REIT outlook for 2008: ''We remain concerned about the overheated coastal residential markets and the Sun Belt, with its high supply and its low-price competition from single-family homes.''
 ''We see an excess of overall residential supply and weak demand from a slower economy,'' he added. 
 But Mr. Harris had some exceptions. Essex Property Trust, which focuses on Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area and the Seattle metropolitan area, remains a favorite. ''There is a long-term imbalance in residential supply and demand in many locations in the West Coast states that favor apartment owners,'' he wrote. He said he also liked Equity Residential, citing what he called its ''strong balance sheet, secure dividend, minimal development relative to its size and share buyback program.'' 
 Mr. Kirby would add the hotel sector to the list of REITs of which to be wary. ''They tend to be the outperformers when times are really good and underperformers when things turn south,'' he said.
 But he is generally bullish on the health care sector, which holds properties like hospitals, nursing homes, assisted-living complexes and medical office buildings. 
 On the Credit Suisse list, companies with health care- and medical-related properties include Washington Real Estate, Duke Realty and Alexandria Real Estate Equities.
 ''Properties owned by various health care REITs tend to be less economically sensitive than, say, apartments and office buildings,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''Demand for health care is impervious to the goings-on in the economy.''
 Mr. Harris agreed, but with one strong caveat: that sector, he said, could be affected by this year's general election. Health care ''is very much connected with public policy issues,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Economy Looks a Lot Like Pizza

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
HIGHER commodity prices. Weak consumer spending. And heavy borrowing. 
 If the recent problems of Domino's Pizza sound a lot like the issues hanging over the broader American economy, it's no coincidence. With its dependence on consumers, its sensitivity to the run-up in dairy and wheat prices and a risky decision last year to double its debt in order to pay a huge one-time dividend, the pizza chain's recent troubles speak volumes about the challenges facing both companies and consumers in the year ahead.
 But Domino's trajectory isn't just another tale of economic gloom and doom. It's also a story of how large investors -- including none other than Michael S. Dell -- have kept the faith in the sliding shares of Domino's, much as they have stuck with the overall stock market despite earnings worries and other fears. 
 The battle over Domino's encapsulates the uncertainty facing Wall Street in 2008, with money managers remaining bullish even as veteran strategists like Byron Wien of Pequot Capital Management forecast a recession and a 10 percent drop for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 So far, at least in the case of Domino's, the pessimists have the upper hand. Domino's shares closed Friday at $11.72, down from $20 last summer. And on the first trading day of 2008, Joe Buckley, a Bear Stearns analyst, cut his rating on the entire restaurant group, warning that the combination of higher food and labor costs and slow growth equals a ''perfect storm'' for the sector.
 Mr. Buckley was prescient in getting the Domino's story right, warning in April that sales could be weaker than Wall Street expected. Since then, he adds, its archrival Pizza Hut has outmaneuvered Domino's, in part by doing a better job of hedging against soaring prices for cheese, which jumped 42 percent last year.
 But there are signs Domino's is learning how to handle those high commodity prices, Mr. Buckley says. A new contract with cheese suppliers and the ability to more quickly pass on high wheat costs to franchisees might help earnings improve later this year, he says.
 With oil hitting $100 a barrel for the first time last week, the ability to manage high commodity prices is a skill other companies will have to master this year.
 The parallels with the broader United States economy do not end there. Like more traditional giants, including General Electric and Boeing, one of the few bright spots for Domino's lately has been international growth. The chain sells distinctly local offerings like the Peppy Paneer in India and the Savoyarde in France, which features potatoes, bacon and creme fraiche.
 And, like the broader market -- which trades at 14 times 2008 earnings -- Domino's stock is reasonably priced, selling for about 11 times earnings. That is a crucial reason institutional investors do not seem dissuaded by negative news.
 In November, the firm that manages the fortune of Mr. Dell and his family, MSD Capital, disclosed that it had acquired a 5.1 percent stake in Domino's. Mr. Dell's firm has been an investor for some time, said Lynn M. Liddle, a spokeswoman for Domino's, but this was the first time its stake rose above 5 percent.
 Mr. Dell's role is hands-off, Ms. Liddle says. ''Does Michael Dell come and make pizza? No. I don't think he speaks to us. His folks do.''
 MSD CAPITAL declined to comment on its stake in Domino's, as did Mr. Dell. But another major holder, Andy Brown of Cedar Rock Capital, remains bullish on Domino's despite obvious problems like higher commodity prices. 
 ''We cherish a business like this as long-term investors,'' says Mr. Brown, whose firm manages about $5 billion and holds a roughly 8 percent stake in Domino's. He says he still supports Domino's decision to borrow nearly $1 billion to pay out a special dividend of $13.50 a share last spring, despite the decline that followed.
 ''I'm not happy about commodity prices, but we're happy with how Domino's returned capital to their shareholders,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Exit Polling Suggests Election Victory for Georgia's Pro-Western President

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia 

 BODY:
Georgia's pro-Western president seemed close on Saturday to winning an early election called after he declared a state of emergency this fall to deal with protesters. 
 An exit poll suggested that President Mikheil Saakashvili would win with more than 50 percent of the vote, avoiding the need for a runoff election and securing a victory for a government that is a close ally of the Bush administration. 
 The poll projected Mr. Saakashvili finishing with 54 percent of the vote. The poll reported having a margin of error of two percentage points. 
 The main opposition candidate, Levan Gachechiladze, challenged the accuracy of the poll, which was conducted by four Georgian television stations. It found him trailing with 28 percent. 
 Badri Patarkatsishvili, a billionaire who had promised to pay a stipend to the unemployed from his personal fortune, was projected to finish third, with 6 percent. 
 The Central Election Commission had not released official results as of early Sunday. Also on the ballot was a referendum on Georgia's bid to join NATO, which was expected to pass. 
 Mr. Saakashvili's campaign claimed victory based on the exit poll's results. ''I congratulate citizens of Georgia on Mikheil Saakashvili's election for a second term,'' the campaign spokesman David Bakradze, said after the polls closed. 
 The Bush administration has cited Mr. Saakashvili's government as an example of democratic success in a region where that has been scarce. 
 Georgia has deployed 2,000 soldiers in Iraq and is the third-largest contributor of troops there, after only the United States and Britain. The government named a street in Tbilisi, the capital, after President Bush. 
 Mr. Saakashvili, 40, a graduate of Columbia University, is a former employee of the New York law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler.
 He had about a year more in his five-year term but called the election early in hopes of winning a new mandate to govern after he ordered a police crackdown on protests and declared a state of emergency on Nov. 7. In the dispersal of demonstrators, more than 500 people were injured, none fatally.
 The police also closed a television station managed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, saying reporters were inciting a riot. These actions brought criticism down on the government at home and abroad. 
 ''They made a mistake,'' Vaja Rostiashvili, a 42-year-old unemployed engineer, said of Mr. Saakashvili's government while standing in line at a Tbilisi polling place. ''They felt guilty and wanted to correct their mistake. That is the meaning of this election.'' 
 International observers called the election Saturday fair. ''Everywhere I went today, I have seen no evidence of systematic fraud,'' said Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, who led the observer mission for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He said fears of a violent protest movement diminished as the election seemed to have been carried out smoothly. 
 But by early afternoon, opposition groups said that they had documented fraud. The Labor Party, which fielded one of the seven candidates in the race, said city buses had been diverted from their normal routes to ferry Saakashvili supporters to polling places to vote more than once. 
 Kakha Dzagania, the Labor Party spokesman, called the buses a ''carousel'' in which voters made the rounds of polling places. The Election Commission and Mr. Saakashvili's campaign denied the accusation. 
 In a town in the Kakhetic region in the eastern part of the country, though, the Justice Ministry arrested a man accused of ballot stuffing. 
 The leading opposition group, a coalition of nine political parties, is also pro-Western and favors Georgia's bid to join NATO. 
 But David Usupashvili, chairman of the Republican Party and a member of the coalition, said Mr. Saakashvili's close relationship with the Bush administration had blinded the United States to what Mr. Usupashvili called authoritarian tendencies in his government. Mr. Saakashvili has weakened Parliament to eliminate checks and balances on his rule, Mr. Usupashvili said in an interview. 
 The main opposition candidate, Mr. Gachechiladze, ran on a platform that called for the transformation of Georgia into a parliamentary republic within 200 days of the election. He had said he would resign and abolish the presidency if he won.

HEADLINE: Ghosts That Haunt Pakistan

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, England 

 BODY:
 WHEN Benazir Bhutto was assassinated, the killers struck in Rawalpindi, an ancient garrison town, on the edge of a leafy park named for another Pakistani who had served as prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan; he was assassinated in the park in 1951. Barely a mile away, Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, another former prime minister, was hanged in 1979 at the city's central jail. One of the doctors who failed to reanimate Ms. Bhutto at a Rawalpindi hospital was the son of a doctor who similarly failed to save Liaquat Ali Khan. 
 The killings varied widely -- Liaquat Ali Khan was shot by a Pashtun separatist; Mr. Bhutto was hanged after a court appointed by a military dictator found him guilty of murdering a minor political opponent from Baluchistan; and the question of who sent the suicide bomber and the gunman who attacked Ms. Bhutto on Dec. 27 is the subject of an investigation in which the Pakistani police will be assisted by experts from Scotland Yard. 
 Still, the historic coincidence of all three leaders dying in Rawalpindi, in the same quarter of the city, has underscored how often violent death has rewritten the political map of Pakistan, and, too, how slender is the thread that sustains the country's hopes of establishing a stable democracy. 
 For 60 years since its founding in the partitioning of British India, Pakistan has seesawed between military dictatorships and elected governments, and now new hope for stability is being placed on the chance that democracy there can be revived.
 But while attention is currently focused on the failings of Pervez Musharraf, the latest in a long line of military rulers, Pakistan's civilian leaders, too, have much to account for in the faltering history of Pakistani democracy. Over the decades, their own periods in office have been notable mostly for their weakness, their instinct for political score-settling, and their venality.
 Now more than ever, hopes of the country achieving lasting stability weigh far beyond Pakistan's border. For the United States, the stakes include the prospects of prevailing against Al Qaeda and the Taliban along Pakistan's Afghan border; linked to that is the sobering issue of who will control Pakistan's nuclear armory. 
 With President Musharraf facing mounting popular opposition, the United States has used its influence to persuade him that the best and perhaps only hope of restoring stability is to allow a revival of a form of democracy -- elections for a new government that would co-exist with him as president. It is a long shot, and the odds against it have lengthened considerably with the killing of Ms. Bhutto. But even as plans for an election proceed, there is reason to fear that a return to elected government would be anything but a panacea. 
 While widely lauded in the West, Pakistan's current generation of civilian politicians -- indeed, most of its civilian political leaders, going back to the country's origins in the portioning of British India in 1947 -- have repeatedly failed to bring the stability and prosperity they have promised. And the reasons for their failure, many who know Pakistan's history have concluded, rest about as heavily with the politicians as with the generals.
 As much as anybody in Pakistan's history, Ms. Bhutto built a reputation as a campaigner for democracy, and it is for that that she has been principally eulogized. Twice prime minister in the 1990's before moving into self-exile abroad, she returned in October saying she hoped to rescue Pakistan from nearly a decade of rule by Mr. Musharraf, one of four generals who have held near-absolute power for just over half of Pakistan's existence. But her death raises anew the question that has dogged Pakistan from its founding: when, or perhaps whether, Pakistan will begin the long march toward building a democracy worthy of the name. 
 The legend cultivated by Pakistani politicians like Ms. Bhutto and her principal civilian rival, Nawaz Sharif, cast the generals as the main villains in stifling democracy, emerging from their barracks to grab power out of Napoleonic ambition and contempt for the will of ordinary Pakistanis. It is a version of history calculated to appeal strongly to Western opinion. But it has been carefully drawn to excuse the role the politicians themselves have played in undermining democracy, by using mandates won at the polls to establish governments that rarely amounted to much more than vehicles for personal enrichment, or for pursuing vendettas against political foes.
 William Dalrymple, a British author who has written widely about India and Pakistan, put it bluntly in an article for Britain's left-of-center Guardian newspaper in 2005. ''As Pakistan shows, rigid, corrupt, unrepresentative and flawed democracies without the strong independent institutions of a civil society -- a free press, an independent judiciary, an empowered election commission -- can foster governments that are every bit as tyrannical as any dictatorship,'' he wrote. ''Justice and democracy are not necessarily synonymous.'' 
 Historians trace some of Pakistan's problems to the British conquest of Moghul India, when centuries of Muslim rule in the subcontinent gave way to an era when Muslims, alwaysn suspect among the British for resisting their new colonial masters, became ever more an underclass. 
 When the struggle for Indian independence began in earnest in the 1920's, the leadership rested mainly with Hindus -- especially Gandhi, whose philosophy was egalitarian, secular and nationalist. In the 1930's, the Muslim League began agitating for a separate Muslim homeland, but power within the league rested with Mohammed Ali Jinnah, an elitist, British-educated Bombay lawyer with a taste for expensively-tailored suits and little affinity for the common man. He would become Pakistan's founding father.
 Many of those who gathered around Jinnah were from the feudal landowning class, and tribal leaders. With scant interest in democracy, their concerns centered more on the protection of their ancestral privileges. When the British abandoned the struggle to fashion an independent India that would keep Hindus and Muslims together, the landowning aristocrats and the tribal chiefs became the political elite of Pakistan. From the beginning, they vied for power with the generals, in a struggle that intensified when the revered Jinnah died soon after Pakistan was established.
 Partition in 1947 was accompanied by widespread killing by Hindu and Muslim militants, and more than 10 million people migrated across the new frontiers. For Pakistan, much the smaller of the two new nations, survival as an independent state became the prevailing concern, empowering the generals. Three wars with India further entrenched military power. And in 1958, after a decade in which the army worked behind the scenes to unseat weak civilian leaders, Gen. Ayub Khan, Pakistan's first military ruler, declared martial law.
 Beginning in the 1950's, the United States wielded strong influence with the generals, who allied Pakistan with the West in the cold war, then in the struggle in the 1980s against the Soviets in Afghanistan and, since 2001, in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Long before President Bush made Mr. Musharraf an ally, American policy was based on a hard-nosed assessment of America's strategic interests that favored the generals over civilian politicians.
 The politicians made these choices easier by their own failings in power. Among these was Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He came to prominence as foreign minister under a martial-law government led by Gen. Yahya Khan, then emerged from the civil war that gave birth to Bangladesh in 1971 to win election as the first civilian head of government in a truncated Pakistan. 
 A charismatic leader with a bent for political intrigue, Mr. Bhutto set the path for much that followed. Pakistani historians say his six years in power were marked by rampant disregard for the constitution he drew up in 1973, by widespread arrests of political opponents, and by deployment of the army to quell restiveness in the provinces. 
 Having founded the Pakistan People's Party with a strongly egalitarian charter, he turned it into a vehicle for enhancing his personal power, abused civil liberties he had championed on the hustings, and showed little interest in social programs. Overthrown by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in 1977, he was given what many Pakistani lawyers regarded as a perfunctory and stage-managed trial for the murder of the Baluchistan politician, and hanged.
 CIVILIAN rule was restored after General Zia died in an air crash in 1988, and the next 11 years were spent with a revolving door of elected governments, two headed by Ms. Bhutto, two by Mr. Sharif, before General Musharraf overthrew Mr. Sharif in a coup in 1999. The two civilian leaders governed so poorly, and so corruptly, in the view of many in the educated middle class, that the dismissal of all four governments before they had served their parliamentary terms occasioned little protest. When Ms. Bhutto was removed on the orders of a civilian president she had picked from her own party in 1996, on charges of government incompetence, protests by her supporters subsided in 48 hours.
 The Harvard- and Oxford-educated Ms. Bhutto, a populist like her father, promised voters she would lift up Pakistan's downtrodden millions with radical reform programs, improving education, health and women's rights. In power, neither she nor Mr. Sharif did much on any of these fronts. Poor Pakistanis ended the 1990's about where they were under General Zia, with levels of illiteracy, malnutrition, infant mortality and abuse of women that were among the worst in the world.
 Ms. Bhutto, from a wealthy land-owning family in the southern province of Sindh, and Mr. Sharif, son of a Punjab family whose industrial empire floated on huge government loans that were never repaid, surrounded themselves with cronies from similar backgrounds and seemed immune to the state of near-collapse to which their policies drove Pakistan. Both governments had reputations as deeply corrupt. In 2005, Transparency International, a London-based agency that monitors corruption, said Pakistan under Ms. Bhutto had been the second-most-corrupt country in the world. 
 An investigation by The New York Times in 1998, drawing on dozens of bank statements and letters handed to British and American investigators by a disaffected Bhutto family lawyer in Switzerland, showed that French, Swiss and Middle Eastern companies, among others, had paid tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks on Pakistan government contracts into offshore bank accounts held by Ms. Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari. When a reporter showed copies of the bank documents to Mr. Zardari in Karachi's central prison, where he was held by Mr. Sharif's second government, he leafed casually through the papers before handing them back. 
 The bank statements were genuine, he said airily, as though confident -- justifiably, as it transpired over the next eight years, which ended with his release from prison and flight, like Ms. Bhutto, into self-exile -- that nothing much would ever be proved against the couple in a Pakistani court. But what bothered him, he said during a conversation in the prison governor's office, was not so much the fact that a lawyer the couple had trusted had leaked their personal banking documents to investigators; it was The New York Times's decision to investigate the financial dealings of himself and Ms. Bhutto, rather than others, including Mr. Sharif, who, he said, had grown rich in power. 
 ''You could investigate anybody who has held power in this country, and you'd find the same.'' he said. ''Why us?'' 
 In many respects, the country's military rulers have governed little better, and, many Pakistanis would argue, in some ways even worse. But until relatively recently, when the growing brazenness of Islamic militant attacks and the army's heavy-handed responses began to seriously erode his support, General Musharraf won popular approval with economic policies that attracted the heaviest foreign investment inflows in Pakistan's history, and an annual growth rate that came close to matching India's, averaging about 7 percent. Many in the middle class who now clamor for his removal spoke of the general with admiration, acknowledged that he seemed personally uncorrupt, and remarked on how matters had improved with the removal of Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif.
 But if elected governments have yielded Pakistan little until now, those who see democracy as the solution to the country's problems still have an argument that is hard to refute. If civilian rulers have failed, these advocates of popular rule say, it is because the generals who kept interfering never gave democracy a chance to mature. 
 ''Since democracy was effectively killed in its infancy, the later stages of maturity and experience could not be reached,'' Irshad Ahmed Haqqani, a former information minister and newspaper columnist with a wide following in Pakistan, wrote in an article published in 2006 in The Muslim World, an American journal devoted to the study of Islam. ''Pakistanis are a normal people and can go as far on the road to democracy as any other nation can. This road we must take; we cannot do without it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 20, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Pakistan's history of difficulty in sustaining democracy misstated the crime for which the former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged in 1979. Mr. Bhutto was found guilty of conspiring to murder a minor political opponent, not of murdering him. (The opponent survived an assassination attempt, in which his father died.) The article also misstated the opponent's home region. It was the Punjab, not Baluchistan.
A Week in Review article on Jan. 6 about Pakistan's history of difficulty in sustaining democracy misidentified the military leader under whom Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who would later become prime minister, served as foreign minister in the 1960s. The leader was Gen. Ayub Khan, not Gen. Yahya Khan. The article also misstated the timing of the disputed parliamentary election that left Mr. Bhutto in a position to emerge from a civil war in 1971 as the first civilian head of government of a truncated Pakistan. The election was held before the war in 1970, not after the war.

HEADLINE: Scratch an Independent Bloomberg and Get a Democrat, Positions Show

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Diane Cardwell and Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hundreds of miles from the hustings of New Hampshire lurks a possible presidential candidate who supports gay marriage, abortion rights and stricter regulation of handguns. Who doesn't mind taxing the rich on their income or big companies on their carbon emissions. Who says that deporting illegal immigrants would destroy the nation's economy. And who is not necessarily averse to adding more bureaucrats to the government payroll.
 That politician -- Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York -- has spent months laying out his vision for a post-partisan approach to politics that would take the best from left and right. 
 Yet a close reading of the policies Mr. Bloomberg has promoted during his mayoralty suggests that Mr. Bloomberg actually has a lot in common with one party's leading candidates -- the Democrats -- and not so much with the other's. Indeed, on issues like gay marriage and gun control, Mr. Bloomberg stands well to the left of top-tier Democratic candidates like Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has long coyly denied rumors that he would undertake an independent bid, even as some of his aides have laid the groundwork for one. On Sunday in Oklahoma, Mr. Bloomberg was scheduled to meet with a bipartisan group of elder statesmen to discuss ways of defeating ''partisan polarization,'' according to organizers, and to urge the creation of a national-unity government. But judged strictly on the issues, it is hard to discern the grounds on which Mr. Bloomberg might midwife a new kind of fusion politics, even if he wants to.
 ''If you want to place him in the spectrum of American politics, he's a liberal Democrat on all the major litmus test issues, and he's a liberal Democrat on taxing and spending,'' said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor at the Baruch College School of Public Affairs. ''I don't see the product differentiation, except for the $4 billion bank account and the aura of the philosopher-king.'' 
 Privately, Mr. Bloomberg's supporters and advisers say that the mayor's stances on a few hot-button issues are beside the point. His large personal fortune and ability to self-finance a campaign, they argue, would insulate him from the demands of special-interest groups, allowing him to serve as an honest broker in the White House, much as he has in City Hall.
 Moreover, Mr. Bloomberg's appeal to a national electorate could be rooted in broader qualities: His emphasis on accountability in government, openness to private-sector thinking and ability to build consensus on complicated problems.
 ''The space for what I'll call 'fusion politics' is at least as much a matter of tone and temper and basic orientation as it is policy specifics,'' said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 ''It's a tone of very self-conscious bipartisanship,'' said Mr. Galston, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton for president. ''It's a tone of uttering certain uncomfortable truths that partisans of both parties don't want to hear. And it's a way of leading that seems oriented towards unity rather than division. There is definitely a market for that kind of politics.''
 In areas like education and poverty, some experts say, Mr. Bloomberg has blended traditionally liberal and conservative policies with notable success. 
 In city schools, for example, he has pursued greater centralization, stringent performance accountability measures and merit pay -- the last of which has few adherents among Democratic candidates -- while sharply increasing teacher salaries. He has proposed a new, nuanced definition of poverty, something liberals have long supported, while starting a pilot program that offers cash incentives to the poor to attend school or job training, a policy that echoes the thinking of some conservative scholars.
 ''The mayor's style is to look at the facts -- what we know and can measure -- and listen to smart people on both sides,'' said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg. ''It's about finding the best solution, not toeing a party line. And that's what's worked in New York.'' 
 But Mr. Bloomberg has also presided over one of the largest expansions in the city budget in decades, increasing spending 23 percent, adjusted for inflation, since 2002. Early on, he also raised income taxes on upper brackets to help preserve government services during the post-9/11 recession, though the increase has since lapsed.
 ''He may not have an ideology about political parties, but he definitely has an ideology about government -- that it has a progressive role in our lives,'' said Andrea Batista Schlesinger, executive director of the Drum Major Institute, a New York-based liberal research group. ''The idea that he's some kind of middle-of-the-road candidate doesn't do justice to his own values.''
 Moreover, on some of the issues that have figured prominently in past presidential campaigns, Mr. Bloomberg appears to be more conventionally liberal.
 He has started a national campaign for stricter rules on handguns, something even most Democrats in Washington gave up on years ago because it was too politically risky. And he has come to publicly support the right of gay couples to marry, which most Americans oppose.
 ''If you put him on the national Congressional spectrum,'' said Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University, ''he would be in the middle -- of the Democratic Party.'' 
 In running for president, some Democratic leaders quietly worry, he would draw heavily from their own voters, making a Republican victory possible.
 Mr. Bloomberg has also said it is crucial for the next president to recruit talented people to government, regardless of party, and has been widely praised for the quality and competence of his own political appointees. But in Democratic-dominated New York City, he has had, at best, a limited opportunity to test the proposition. Indeed, according to public records, of Mr. Bloomberg's seven deputy mayors, all but one are registered Democrats. 
 Similarly, Mr. Bloomberg has often shown a deft touch in negotiations with Albany Republicans and the Bush administration. But much of his reputation for consensus-building rests on his work with labor groups and the Democratic-dominated City Council, who are relatively close to him ideologically. As a unity presidential candidate, Mr. Bloomberg would need to find common ground with people and groups that are more politically and culturally conservative, while still trying to build a majority-winning coalition.
 ''You can't extrapolate how he did in New York City with how he might appear to voters on a national level,'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who was a consultant to Joseph I. Lieberman's independent senatorial campaign in 2006. Voters nationwide respond very positively to messages about bipartisanship and unity, Mr. Newhouse said. But they tend to vote for major-party candidates. And Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who was elected mayor as a Republican, abandoned the G.O.P. to become an independent this summer. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's hosts in Oklahoma don't see that as a problem. In a letter to invited guests, the conference organizers, the former Democratic senators David L. Boren and Sam Nunn, blame ''partisan polarization'' for the lack of progress on important issues. They also attack the current crop of candidates, Democratic and Republican, for ostensibly refusing to lay out plans for change.
 Still, their own proposals are also vague, referring to a need to ''restore our standing, influence, and credibility in the world'' and to ''our fiscal challenges, our educational challenges, our environmental challenges.''
 Exactly where a Bloomberg presidential platform would fit in -- or would not fit in -- is hard to discern. In a June speech that many viewed as an unveiling of his own national platform, Mr. Bloomberg spoke at length about applying a ''nonpartisan, results-oriented approach'' to government, illustrating his point with examples from his time as mayor. 
 But he laid out few specific proposals on national issues like health care, Social Security or the federal budget deficit, focusing instead on management principles that he said should be applied to the federal government. 
 His proposal for a national immigration plan, laid out in a May 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, was much more detailed -- but, tellingly, was not all that different from those of some Democratic contenders.
 ''If your only calling card is, 'I can execute your program more competently,' no one is going to vote for you'' Mr. Galston said. ''You have to take bold positions.''

HEADLINE: Huckabee Sales Tax Plan Appeals, but Is It Fair?

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
Long before Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, began campaigning for president, advocates for replacing the entire federal tax system with a national sales tax were campaigning to convert him to their cause.
 They succeeded. ''Am I running for president to shut down the federal government? Not exactly,'' Mr. Huckabee says on his Web site. ''But I am running to eliminate all federal income and payroll taxes. And I do mean all -- personal federal, corporate federal, gift, estate, capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, self-employment.''
 ''Instead,'' adds Mr. Huckabee, who demonstrated his appeal to voters with his victory on Thursday in the Iowa caucuses, ''we will have the FairTax, a simple tax based on wealth.''
 Under the plan, Americans would pay only one federal tax, which would be applied to just about everything they buy: not just the goods people buy at stores on which most states assess a sales tax, but nearly all services, including health care and insurance, the purchase of a new home or rental of an apartment, even things like a teenager mowing a lawn or baby-sitting for a neighbor. 
 But the FairTax, as its many fervent backers call it, is not as simple as its supporters describe. And, to most tax experts who have looked at the proposal, it is anything but fair. For one, its burden would fall disproportionately on middle-income people.
 Still, the plan has undeniable appeal. ''There is a yearning across the political system to make the tax system better,'' said William G. Gale, a critic of the proposal who is a leading tax economist at the Brookings Institution, the liberal-leaning research organization in Washington. ''Right now the only people talking about tax reform are the sales tax advocates.''
 Supporters, including a handful of tax experts like Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, contend that a rate of about 23 percent, applied across the board, would bring in just as much money to the Treasury as all the taxes the federal government now collects.
 It is not the same as a normal sales tax, however. Under the proposal, the tax is included first. That means a $100 item would cost $130, or 30 percent more. The plan's supporters say that works out as a 23 percent rate because $30 is 23 percent of $130. Americans would no longer face federal withholding from their paychecks. But most analysts say the tax rate necessary to replace current federal revenues, under any likely plan, would actually need to be much higher. By some estimates it could add 40 percent, if not more, to the cost of living.
 Whatever the rate, critics say, a steep federal retail tax, piled on top of existing state sales taxes, would encourage widespread illegal tax evasion, black market transactions and other forms of cheating, creating a cycle that would require even higher tax rates.
 ''The main weakness of the FairTax is its comprehensiveness,'' said Dale W. Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard who opposes the plan but whose research into problems with the current system is sometimes cited by supporters. ''It tries to roll everything into one tax, which simply can't carry all that weight.''
 Mr. Huckabee, according to polls, won the Iowa caucuses largely on the strength of his appeal to evangelical voters and voters' desire for change. But his campaign received much of its early backing from FairTax advocates who flocked to his banner and continue to fill seats at campaign rallies and provide financial support.
 In May, at a rally in Columbia, S.C., about 10,000 supporters of the proposal turned out to hear Mr. Huckabee declare, ''I realize that the FairTax organization does not endorse candidates, but let me be very clear: I endorse you.''
 Supporters of the sales tax plan are particularly drawn to the feature that calls for repealing the 16th Amendment and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. That fits with the insurgent, populist-tinged nature of Mr. Huckabee's campaign. 
 ''The public desperately desires a better way to collect federal taxes for the common good and recognizes the current system as both inherently flawed and then further corrupted by inside-the-Beltway machinations,'' Leo E. Linbeck Jr., the multimillionaire founder of Americans for Fair Taxation, wrote in a recent letter defending the decade-old proposal. ''It is understood by those who are joining our effort that overcoming the self-interest of the increasingly disdained Congress and the army of income tax system defenders is no small task.''
 For Mr. Huckabee, the sales tax plan also helps provide political cover against attacks from antitax Republicans, who suspect, based on his actions as governor, that he might be tempted to raise taxes in the White House.
 ''It would certainly help limit runaway government spending,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said. ''Everybody would understand that there is a single tax: the government spends more, everybody's tax rate will go up.''
 Like any tax on consumption, the biggest burden, comparatively, would fall on the poor. To help compensate for this, the plan would provide a monthly check from the government to every American household, rich and poor alike. 
 The rebate amount would be set to equal what a household living at the poverty level would pay in taxes, leaving some of the poor better off and cushioning the proposal's impact on the middle class.
 But, apart from the administrative nightmares associated with giving every household a rebate, it would still not prevent transferring a substantial part of the current tax burden from those with annual incomes above $200,000, who tend to save a large part of their income rather than spending it, to those earning less.
 ''Even with the rebate counted the way FairTax supporters want it calculated,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative tax analyst and policy maker in the Reagan administration who has emerged as one of the proposal's most powerful critics, ''there would be an enormous shift in the tax burden from the wealthy to those with lower and middle incomes.''
 Advocates for the proposal look at the distribution of taxes differently. Mr. Kotlikoff argues that over a lifetime most people spend just about everything they earn from their work and investments, so that those who avoid taxes on their savings now would end up paying later when they consume their wealth.
 ''The FairTax, looked at correctly, is actually pretty progressive,'' contends Mr. Kotlikoff, who has been paid by the FairTax organization for his research. ''Liberals should love it: it lowers taxes on wages and imposes a tax on wealth.''
 Like many single-issue causes of the past, including the ''Cross of Gold'' campaign of William Jennings Bryan at the turn of the 20th century and the Depression-era ''Every Man a King'' plan of Huey Long to redistribute wealth, supporters make plenty of grandiose claims for the sales tax plan.
 Advocates say that businesses, no longer required to pay taxes themselves, would pass on their savings to consumers through lower prices. The plan would also eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars to comply with the income tax, provide a huge jolt to economic growth and give American companies a competitive advantage against foreign producers. 
 But even though critics acknowledge that there would be some economic benefits from introducing a broad-based consumption tax, Mr. Gale of the Brookings Institution said that the proposal itself was ''fundamentally a ruse.''
 ''The notion that there is a 23 percent rate that solves all our problems,'' he said, ''is politically unrealistic and mathematically impossible.''

HEADLINE: Democrats In Sync, Mostly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
DEMOCRATS might be forgiven for wearing shades, so bright are their days just now. 
 The Democratic turnout in Iowa more than doubled that of the Republicans. National polls show the party's top candidates edging out the best of the Republican field. They have also declined to feast on each others' entrails, although that could change as the campaign and the candidates grow more frenzied.
 And, whatever their differences in emphasis and philosophy of government, the Democrats have danced to remarkably similar themes. They favor universal health care, withdrawing troops from Iraq, combating global warming, hiking taxes for the very rich, and slashing taxes for the working and middle classes. 
 It's all poll tested and much applauded by the party faithful.
 ''It's a remarkable consensus,'' said Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor in the Clinton administration and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ''This is the greatest degree of unanimity I've seen in at least three decades and we owe it to George Bush and all he represents.''
 Such consensus also reflects the passing of a divisive era. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the stunning decline of crime and welfare in the 1990s, removed issues that had pitted Democrat against Democrat for a generation.
 ''The emotional social issues have been systematically taken out of the debate,'' said Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime warrior for a centrist brand of Democratic politics.
 That said, today's comity is more complicated than it might appear. As Barack Obama takes his Iowa victory to New Hampshire, with John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton on his heels, the three candidates, as Princeton historian Sean Wilentz notes, represent different and often divisive approaches to politics and solving problems.
 Mr. Obama is the anti-politician, the idealist who would transcend politics. His lineage extends from Bill Bradley to Paul Tsongas, Jimmy Carter and Adlai Stevenson. Ms. Clinton is the liberal pragmatist, a role taken by her husband, former President Clinton, not to mention Lyndon Baines Johnson and Harry Truman. Mr. Edwards has wrapped himself in a populist cloak, a potentially potent and explicitly partisan approach.
 Not long ago, these factions split over welfare, the death penalty and race in terrifically gory party clashes. In 1980, Ted Kennedy, who ran as something of a populist, pouted and barely could bring himself to endorse President Jimmy Carter at the Democratic convention. In 1988, the populist Jesse Jackson kept stony counsel before giving his nod to the pragmatist Michael Dukakis. 
 The current band seems tamer. The populist Mr. Edwards might lash the pharmaceutical companies in pursuit of health care reform while the idealist Mr. Obama might invite them to a bipartisan luncheon. But that difference hasn't set the candidates to lancing each other. At least, not yet.
 ''You have to be a Talmudist or into deep textual analysis to a find a substantive argument,'' Mr. Reich said.
 On broad goals, that is. Foreign policy still opens up visible fissures, as it did four years ago, when the Democrats stood divided between doves and those like Senator Joseph Lieberman, who believed, as President Bush did, that the world is a dangerous place best policed by a steely American imperium.
 Hillary Clinton hews closest to this view. She voted in 2002 to authorize the march to war in Iraq and more recently voted to label Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist force. But she talks now of wedding toughness to vigorous diplomacy, and so repairing the American image abroad.
 Mr. Obama sounds this theme, too, opposing the Iraq war but cautioning against the ''arrogant bunker mentality'' of the United States. (He missed the vote on Iran's Revolutionary Guard.)
 Mr. Edwards has proven an aggressive dove, apologizing for his own 2002 vote for the war and calling for a quick and complete withdrawal from Iraq.
 On domestic policy, the Democratic candidates invoke two words -- ''middle class'' -- with nearly every breath. They would offer health insurance to almost everyone, make college loans more affordable and provide tax relief to the middle class. But they have different visions of how government would accomplish those goals. Ms. Clinton tends to favor economic incentives and narrowly tailored policies, like focused tax cuts. Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards prefer a more sweeping and muscular governmental hand. This debate about government's role at home has transfixed a generation of Democratic candidates. 
 On social and cultural questions, the Democrats tend to answer sotto voce. To wit, we support gay rights, stem cell research and a woman's right to choose an abortion, but please, please, please don't make us talk about these topics too loudly during the general election.
 What Democratic candidates should talk loudly about, Mr. Reich argues, is that middle-class voters have 70 percent of their wealth wrapped up in homes that are rapidly declining in value. They can also pit the ''middle-class'' against the 2 percent of Americans who are rich beyond measure.
 ''The biggest rift in American society used to be between the poor and the middle class and the Republicans exploited that brilliantly,'' Mr. Reich said. ''Now the words 'middle class' have become shorthand for the working poor, the working class and the middle class. Whether you make $16,000 a year or $66,000 a year, your job is more precarious, you have no pension.''
 ''It's much easier for the candidate to talk about unfairness,'' he said.
 Perhaps, but not all Democrats are so optimistic. Some see a party still a bit traumatized by past defeats. Democrats, after all, expected to win the presidential contests in 2000 and 2004.
 Republicans, moreover, are well practiced at pushing Democrats off their thematic toes. In the last election, the Republicans blasted Democrats as being weak on terrorism, and now, some Democratic analysts expect a Republican attack on immigration, the better to drive a wedge between anxious middle-class voters and the Democratic Party's growing number of Latino voters.
 Nothing, Democrats remind themselves, is assured, not even the wary peace that has held among the candidates.
 ''There is a unity but right now its born of 40 years of howling at the moon,'' said Mr. Wilentz, the Princeton historian who has written the coming book ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974-2008.''
 ''By all historical precedents, the Democrats should be poised for a big comeback,'' he said. ''But there are no guarantees.''

HEADLINE: Relief for Distressed Borrowers

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
WHEN President Bush signed the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act into law late last month, the move touched off a now-familiar debate among housing advocates and analysts: will it have much impact?
 Bankruptcy lawyers said that the measure, which grants tax relief to people trying to save their homes, would have limited effect in the New York area and beyond. But housing counselors were far more optimistic.
 ''It's no panacea, but we think it's a real good step in the right direction,'' said Colleen Hernandez, the executive director of the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides counseling for borrowers facing foreclosure, among others. ''Along with some of the other efforts being put in place, it spells relief in an important way.'' 
 The legislation reverses a longstanding tax policy that treated forgiven housing debt as income. So when a financially distressed borrower worked out a new mortgage with a lender that essentially reduced the borrower's debt by $30,000, for example, the borrower was required to include that amount as taxable income on his or her tax return.
 Housing advocates said this policy discouraged some borrowers from seeking ''work around'' arrangements. 
 According to Ms. Hernandez, the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, which provides free telephone counseling, advised about 700 people in one day in late December. Of those, about 25 percent were in a situation where their best hope for keeping a home was a ''short sale,'' in which a borrower sells a house for less than the mortgage amount, and the lender forgives the remaining debt. ''When you remove the impediment of paying taxes on that so-called profit,'' she said, ''it's a big help.'' 
 Some bankruptcy lawyers disagree. Jay Fleischman, the president of the Bankruptcy Law Network, a consortium of independent bankruptcy lawyers, said, ''I think the new law is a lot of window dressing.''
 Mr. Fleischman, whose practice is based in Brooklyn, said that as long as a homeowner is deemed insolvent, forgiven mortgage debts are not recorded as taxable income. ''You don't even have to go into bankruptcy,'' he said. 
 Mr. Fleischman and other bankruptcy lawyers in the New York region said they had seen a sharp rise in mortgage-related bankruptcy inquiries in the last year, and expected more as rates on adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, rise beyond the discounted introductory level. 
 The Bush administration announced last month that lenders would freeze ''teaser rates'' on ARMs made to those with poor credit, but only for borrowers who had been keeping up with their payments and who could not afford higher payments.
 That is precisely the type of borrower who will benefit from the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, said Diane Gray, the director of counseling and education at Novadebt, a nonprofit debt counseling group based in Freehold, N.J.
 Because these borrowers are not yet insolvent -- but probably will be when their interest rates rise -- the tax relief will help.
 In areas with falling real estate prices, borrowers looking to rework their mortgages with lenders often face a situation in which their mortgage is suddenly higher than the value of their home. 
 In such instances, a refinanced mortgage could include forgiveness of outstanding debt. ''For these people,'' Ms. Gray said, ''it's fantastic that they won't have to worry about tax issues.''

HEADLINE: Kenyan City Is Gripped By Violence

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: KISUMU, Kenya 

 BODY:
Oginga Odinga Street, the main thoroughfare in town, is a testament to rage.
 Dozens of stores have been looted, torched and smashed by rioters and then picked clean by an army of glue-sniffing street children searching for whatever was left. The scorched Ukwala supermarket looks as if a bomb blew up inside it. The gates of Zamana Electronic are mangled.
 People here say this is just the beginning. 
 ''We will never surrender!'' yelled a man who attended a rally for opposition leaders on Saturday.
 ''We want guns, guns!'' another man added.
 While much of Kenya is trying to get back to normal after a week of post-election violence that has claimed more than 300 lives nationwide, Kisumu, Kenya's third-largest city, is still quivering with anger. Few places have been so thoroughly gutted by the turbulence as here.
 With Kenya's leaders still at an impasse despite the efforts of Jendayi E. Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for Africa who met with both sides on Saturday, it looks as if the tensions will linger dangerously for some time.
 Kisumu is the stronghold of Raila Odinga, the opposition leader who said he had been cheated out of the presidency, and the town's main street is named after his father, a local hero.
 The people here followed the election so closely that they remember the precise hour last weekend, on Saturday, when the vote count suddenly changed, and Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president, went from trailing badly to winning with a suspiciously thin margin of victory. 
 The town exploded, and a furious mob stormed up Oginga Odinga street. The biggest businesses are now in ashes. Fuel, food and cellphone credit are in short supply. And around 2,000 people from Mr. Kibaki's tribe, the Kikuyu, are camped out at the police station, trying to escape a wave of revenge killings.
 ''If I stay here, I'll be lynched,'' said Waweru Mburu, a Kikuyu, as he nervously waited outside a supermarket, one of the two open in this town of half a million people. His wife had been waiting for hours, trying to buy milk.
 Trucks carrying Kikuyu and evacuees from another tribe, the Kisii, many of whom supported Mr. Kibaki, are jeered at as they pull out of town. Those doing the jeering are mostly Luo, like Mr. Odinga, who live here in great numbers.
 ''Traitors!'' some Luo shouted on Saturday as a truck passed.
 People on both sides said the tensions would not ease as long as Kenya's political leaders refused to even speak to each other, which has been the situation since the election on Dec. 27. 
 On Saturday, Mr. Kibaki indicated that he was ready to form ''a government of national unity.'' Mr. Odinga did not reject that outright but said he would not entertain any offers until the two sides sat down in the presence of foreign mediators.
 The government initially rebuffed outside help, but seems to have relented slightly and sent a diplomat to Ghana to discuss a role for the African Union, according to Reuters.
 Ms. Frazer met separately with Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga and urged them to work together to solve the crisis, which has dented Kenya's image as one of the most stable countries in Africa and could cause permanent economic damage if peace is not restored soon.
 It seems that momentum is growing toward negotiations. ''There is slow progress being made,'' said Salim Lone, a spokesman for Mr. Odinga.
 Kenyans are waiting. Some areas, like the capital, have quieted down considerably. In the Rift Valley, the area most torn by violence, fewer killings have been reported in the past few days, but tens of thousands of people are displaced and in need of food.
 In Kisumu, the killings have stopped, for the most part. But the banks are running out of money, few stores are open and the looting continues.
 There is some opportunism to all this. The rage that swept through town was selective, striking at electronics shops, cellphone kiosks and shoe stores but leaving the drapery dealer alone.
 On Saturday, Monica Awino tiptoed through the shattered interior of a Bata footwear store. Glass was everywhere. She used to work here and now is out of a job at the best time of year. No after-Christmas or back-to-school sales for her.
 ''I'm angry at everybody,'' she said.
 Up the street, Bernard Ndede, a high school English teacher, watched street children carefully sift through inches of rubble on the floor of a charred supermarket, as if they were urban archaeologists.
 He said he did not approve of the looting, but he understood the anger. 
 ''People woke up so early that day to vote for change,'' he said, referring to election day and the millions of people who voted for Mr. Odinga. ''They felt robbed.''
 For some, the disappointment was lethal. On Saturday, Albert Ojonyo, an insurance agent, went to the city morgue to pick up the body of his brother, Daniel. More than 40 people were killed here in election-related violence. Many bodies have not been identified and wait in a sweltering room under strips of red cloth with their feet poking out.
 Mr. Ojonyo said his brother, who was 27, had been shot in the head, most likely by police officers trying to quell the rioters.
 ''Daniel felt very strongly about these elections,'' he said. ''Afterward, he was a very bitter boy.''

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
 IF it's a question of ''experience'' versus ''change,'' change will win every time. Hillary Clinton, of all people, should have known that. Doesn't she remember 1992? That was when her husband made ''change'' his mantra and chanted it all the way to the White House. This year, Mrs. Clinton tried to suggest that Barack Obama does not have enough experience to be president. He hung her experience around her neck and chanted the change mantra himself. 
 An Obama presidency would, in fact, be a huge change in all sorts of obvious ways. Yet on the Republican side as well, there is talk of change. Of course it is trickier with a sitting Republican president. But that hasn't stopped one of the candidates from seizing on the word and using it as the centerpiece of his campaign. 
 It's not the candidate you would have guessed if you haven't been listening to them: it's Mitt Romney. Nothing better illustrates the mystical power of ''change'' in American politics, and its malleability, than its selection by the expensively engineered Romney machine, even though the word doesn't seem to apply in any way to the man or his campaign. 
 It's hard to say what Mr. Romney's campaign is really about. He would clearly do or say anything or its opposite to become president. But, in general, he seems to be trying to make himself as conventional a Republican as possible, calling for tax cuts blah blah blah, supporting President Bush 100 percent on Iraq, shedding any aberrant views on abortion or gay rights that he may have picked up by accident in Massachusetts. 
 He radiates conventionality, with his ''Leave-It-to-Beaver''-and-then-some family and his good looks straight out of ''Mad Men,'' the TV series about Madison Avenue in the early 1960s. (I was a few years behind Mr. Romney at a small private high school in Michigan. He graduated in 1965 and looks exactly the same now as he did back then.) If anything, his message ought to be stability: things do not have to change. 
 Mr. Romney's actual mantra is ''change in Washington,'' but that is no more helpful in the logic department. He is not campaigning for Congress. Bragging that he will bring ''change in Washington'' is either a purposeful insult to a sitting president of his own party, or it means nothing at all. Clearly, it means nothing at all. 
 Of the two leading Republicans, it is Mike Huckabee who is the more obvious agent of change, for his party and the country, with his ambitious plans for destroying the economy with a national sales tax and his Democratic-sounding attacks on wealth and privilege. But Mr. Huckabee has let Mr. Romney steal the word from him. 
 The appeal of ''change'' as a cri de coeur is that it sounds dynamic without committing you to anything in particular. Any slogan shared by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is going to be pretty meaningless. Not only can voters give it any meaning they wish, it can have different meanings for different voters.
 Best of all, being the candidate of change in some vague and meaningless way gives you cover to come out for stasis in most of the particulars. Americans say they want change, and think they want it, but there is room for doubt. The candidates of real, serious change, like Dennis Kucinich or Ron Paul, are going to be dropping like petals. And no wonder: they are scary. Change is scary. 
 What are the candidates actually promising? As often as not, it is protection from change. They will not muck around with your Social Security. They will make sure that you don't lose your health insurance -- and that you will always be able to keep your own doctor. The world is changing fast, but they will protect you from any dire effects. They won't let the country get flooded with poisonous toys from China or workers from Mexico or (a Mike Huckabee offering) terrorists from Pakistan. A fence, that's what we need. A fence to cower behind, to keep out change, or at least to slow it down. 
 There is nothing contemptible about a reluctance to change. Most of us have it pretty good in this country, and can't be blamed for wanting things to stay that way. For that to happen, though, will require some wrenching changes. The list isn't surprising, or really very long, compared with the list of our blessings. We need to use less energy and borrow less money. We need to fix our schools and reform our health care system. We need to end a stupid war. 
 Is this what people mean when they demand ''change''? Are these things what the candidates have in mind when they promise to deliver it? If so, great. But all of these (except, maybe, ending the war) will require some changes that are unpleasant. We as a society have shown no tolerance for unpleasant changes, and politicians have shown no enthusiasm for trying to persuade us that they might be necessary. 
 If all you want is happy changes, you really don't want change at all.

HEADLINE: Sharp Clashes In Hectic Days Before Primary

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Julie Bosman from Portsmouth; Michael Cooper and Jeff Zeleny from Manchester; Patrick Healy from Penacook; David D. Kirkpatrick from Londonderry; Michael Luo from Derry; and Marc Santora from Peterborough.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The presidential candidates rushed into a final weekend of compressed and often harsh campaigning here Saturday, as they presented new themes to New Hampshire voters and tried to keep pace with a schedule that left little room for error before the primary on Tuesday.
 The day ended with heated back-to-back, nationally televised Republican and Democratic debates, including a moment when the candidates from both parties shared the stage. For a few minutes, six Republican candidates and four Democrats mingled in front of the cameras, shaking hands, embracing and talking as the audience applauded.
 In a tense 90-minute debate among the Democrats -- marked by bouts of shouting and finger-pointing -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York went after Senator Barack Obama of Illinois aggressively, contending that he had switched his positions on crucial issues, including health care and financing the Iraq war. Mr. Obama said she was distorting his record. A third Democrat, John Edwards of North Carolina, briefly joined forces with Mr. Obama, asserting that they were both ''agents of change'' and describing Mrs. Clinton as a force of ''the status quo.'' 
 Mitt Romney, a Massachusetts Republican, was the target in the Republican debate. He was attacked by two rivals -- Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who beat him in Iowa on Thursday, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is leading in polls here -- on issues like immigration and on his history of shifting some positions.
 ''We disagree on a lot of issues,'' Mr. McCain said at one point, setting up a shot intended to illustrate perceptions that Mr. Romney had recalibrated his positions on issues to make himself more attractive to Republican voters. ''But I agree you are the candidate of change.''
 The debates were an intense finale to a day of events that unfolded across New Hampshire from morning through night as the candidates sought to retool their appeals for this new stage. That reflected the different nature of this electorate but also -- especially for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Romney, still reeling from their losses in Iowa -- the lessons learned from that defeat. Mr. Romney went through an entire town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire Saturday morning without mentioning abortion or gay rights, issues that he had once emphasized as he sought to build support among social conservatives in states like Iowa.
 Among the Republicans, Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney appear to be dueling for first place in New Hampshire, polls suggested, though the fight for the party's nomination remains wide open. Among the Democrats, New Hampshire is largely a showdown between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, with Mr. Edwards hoping that a strong performance on his part -- or a weak one by one of the other two -- could open up that race. 
 Mr. Obama on Saturday morning found a crowd of 2,500 people waiting for him inside -- and outside -- a gymnasium at North High School in Nashua, where he warned about the danger of partisanship in Washington and urged voters here to follow up on what Iowa caucusgoers began. 
 ''We started something on Thursday, but it was just the start. It was just the beginning,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking over waves of applause. ''The assumption is that the American people will succumb to fear and doubt and will not trust their instincts and will not follow up what we can do.'' 
 He continued, ''What we saw during this past week was the American people rising up and saying to each other that we are on the cusp of creating a new majority, a majority that will help us win this nomination, a majority that will help us win an election in November.'' 
 ''But more importantly,'' he said, ''a majority that will help us govern in the way that we have not governed in a long time, a majority that will actually deliver on the promises of health care.''
 To bolster his appeal among independent voters, who may cast a ballot in either primary in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama on Sunday will collect the endorsement of Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who ran for president eight years ago on a strong appeal with independents.
 Mrs. Clinton dispensed with her stump speech earlier in the day and, breaking with past practice in Iowa, took extended questions from voters in Penacook, where she offered an ''economic action plan'' that included help for families facing mortgage foreclosures. Later Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton met with an audience of undecided voters at Bagelry, a student hangout near the University of New Hampshire in Durham, as part of her effort to appeal to young and independent voters, who had flocked to Mr. Obama in Iowa.
 Mr. Romney invoked Mr. Obama's victory in Iowa to a Republican audience Saturday morning as evidence that the nation was looking for change and that Iowans had rejected longtime Washington hands like Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain.
 Mr. Romney warned his audience that unless the Republicans put up a candidate who could counter Mr. Obama's message of change, ''the same thing that happened to Hillary Clinton will happen to our nominee.''
 ''He just trounced her there because all that experience isn't what they wanted to hear about -- they wanted to see somebody who said they would do something new and change Washington,'' Mr. Romney said. 
 ''And,'' he added, ''we cannot afford Barack Obama as the next president. He's a very nice fellow and he's a well-spoken fellow, but he's never done it.'' 
 Mr. McCain filled the television airwaves here with a sentimental advertisement invoking his victory in the 2000 Republican primary in New Hampshire, declaring, ''My friends, it's a different time, but it's the same place.''
 At noon, he held what his campaign said was his 100th town-hall-style meeting here -- Mr. McCain routinely holds meetings with voters on the day of a debate as a warm-up -- and gazed at a hall so crowded that people were spilling out the door after the local police barred anyone else from entering. 
 Mr. Edwards was moving to try to at least make a showing here after coming in second to Mr. Obama in Iowa. On the Republican side, Mr. Huckabee was trying to show his strength beyond Iowa.
 Mr. Edwards, who appeared to be taking a slightly less aggressive stance than he did when he fumed his way across Iowa, presented himself as the antiestablishment candidate, going up against opponents with more money and celebrity.
 ''The people of New Hampshire need to hear this message,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''We're up against millions and millions and millions of dollars.''
 The extent of the transformation of Mr. Romney's campaign became clear as he appeared Saturday morning with a new banner attached to the wall reading ''Washington is Broken.'' 
 Mr. Romney asked his audience at one point, ''Is there anybody who agrees with me Washington is badly broken?''
 Almost all hands went up.
 In an interview with reporters at a home in Bedford, he said, ''My message is Washington is broken.'' He added: ''Senator McCain cannot be the candidate of changing Washington. He is Washington.'' 
 He raised, in the interview and in public appearances, what his aides said would be a central issue that they would use against Mr. McCain in the next 72 hours: Mr. McCain's authorship of legislation that would have givensome illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship.
 ''That is a form of amnesty,'' Mr. Romney said at the Saturday morning event. ''It's one more effort to pull the wool over our eyes. It will not fix illegal immigration. I will.''
 Although he seemed upbeat and chipper, Mr. Romney, toward the end of his speech, appeared to forget momentarily where he was, seeming to confuse his New Hampshire audience with Iowans -- or perhaps what season it was. 
 ''I'm told I have to let you go,'' he said. ''You've got some harvesting to do.''
 The land in this state this weekend is frozen and covered with heaps of crusty snow. 
 Mrs. Clinton drew a contrast with Mr. Obama in her morning appearance in Penacook to discuss health care. ''This is one of the issues in this campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''One of my leading opponents proposed a plan that doesn't cover everybody. It's a mistake on the merits for a Democrat to propose a plan that doesn't cover everybody, and it's a mistake politically because it cedes to the Republicans that we can't do it.''
 Mr. Huckabee, who kept a light schedule, seemed to be running against both parties as he tried to build on his Iowa success. He faulted Republicans as failing to understand the plight of families dealing with high gasoline prices and health care costs. 
 Still, his speech remained light on policy details, as he talked about making insurance more widely available and portable from job to job. He emphasized preventive care for those currently uninsured and incentives for healthy behavior. 
 There were so many candidates and so little time that some of them were forced to go to unorthodox ends to win attention. Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, whose campaign has shown little signs of traction here, rode into his first speech of the day, at a robotics convention in Manchester, on a scooter.
 ''This is fascinating,'' he said. ''Unbelievable. I think I'm going to keep it.''

HEADLINE: We Agreed To Agree, And Forgot To Notice

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AS Martin Bunzl was getting on a plane in 1966, something happened that would stick in his head for the next four decades. A man taking his seat looked around and announced, loudly enough for all to hear: ''Oh, geez, not a Negro stewardess.''
 The remark stuck because it came at a threshold moment when culture and politics and norms of behavior were all in flux, said Dr. Bunzl, a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University. A few years earlier, a comment like that might have been unremarkable, and a few years later it would be intolerable. The man on the plane was shouting through an open window between worlds.
 Whether the results of the Iowa caucuses on Thursday will be seen by future generations as a threshold moment of change or a footnote to a story yet unwritten is anyone's guess, of course. The victories by Barack Obama, the Democratic senator from Illinois, and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican not in the traditional mold, are tiny steps on a long road that may not lead to the White House for either man. 
 But there's no doubt that for one night, in one state, Americans dramatically changed the subject. Race didn't matter -- even though Mr. Obama was an African-American running in a nearly all-white state -- but talk of unity and common ground did, as Mr. Obama galvanized his supporters by promising to toss historical and political division aside.
 How far rhetoric and passion can take a man, or a nation, is another question, and there's plenty of reason to doubt we're anywhere near a transformative era in 2008. Look around today, Dr. Bunzl and other social theorists say, and it's easy to see nothing but cynicism, apathy, polarization and political gridlock. 
 But if you listen closely, you might hear something -- a faint but persistent tapping at the window that economists, criminologists and biologists say is the sound of change arriving anyway. From capital punishment to global warming to homosexuality to abortion, many of the social issues that divide us are shifting and evolving -- perhaps even in some instances into a new consensus, or at least, and no less profoundly, toward a reframing of the old debates.
 POLITICS might be stuck in the slow lane, but science, capitalism and American culture and society are decidedly not, and all are making creative end runs around the gridlock. Mr. Obama's call in his Iowa victory speech -- for ''a coalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states'' -- evokes an earlier time in America, but it also suggests a future that may be unfolding no matter what politicians like him say or do.
 ''New ways of looking at the world are emerging, but the language of talking about them and what they mean hasn't caught up,'' said Anne Fausto-Sterling, a professor of biology and gender studies at Brown University.
 In her field, Professor Fausto-Sterling said, a divide that has gripped society for decades over nature vs. nurture -- specifically, whether homosexuality is ordained in the womb or developed in puberty -- has been thrown into irrelevance by advances in the study of human genetics. Nature and nurture, it seems, are both too simple to explain everything; genes set the pattern, but environmental conditions then decide whether those genes are turned on or off. 
 On the equally tangled landscape of capital punishment, there have been legal challenges to the injected drug cocktail in use since the 1970s, as well as front-page exposes from all over the country about death-row inmates cleared through DNA analysis. Both are forcing a reconsideration of the death penalty in state legislatures and courts at a time when crime is far less a front-burner anxiety than it was a generation ago. 
 In the marketplace, consumer choices and social goals have melded, once again bypassing the political system. Though some of the efforts are probably no more than public relations and pandering to the latest fad, others cannot be so easily dismissed. Those include hybrid vehicles, which are carving out a kind of middle-brow fuel efficiency: not an all-electric car or a bicycle, but not a Hummer, either.
 As for abortion, the divisions are probably as deep as ever, but the underlying terrain has shifted. If human stem cells, which can be used to grow new organs, can be made from skin cells rather than embryonic cells, as a recent study suggests, then a whole corner of the abortion debate fades away: There's no prospect of a global industry in destroying embryos for medical harvest. 
 And while concerns over privacy will persist no matter what happens to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark case legalizing abortion in 1973, the threat of the back-alley abortionist with a coat-hanger that haunted society before Roe perhaps has been muted too by the abortion pill, RU486, which would presumably still be available (if in some cases illegally) no matter what.
 Many of the great debates, in short, have become a bit passe, precisely as anticipated by President John F. Kennedy. ''Most of us are conditioned for many years to have a political viewpoint -- Republican or Democratic, liberal, conservative or moderate,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a 1962 news conference. But, he said, most problems had become ''technical problems, administrative problems; they are very sophisticated judgments which do not lend themselves to the great sort of passionate movements which have stirred this country so often in the past.''
 Echoing Kennedy's thought somewhat more acerbically last week was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, the billionaire stoking talk of an independent presidential run with a political gathering in Oklahoma this weekend. ''If you have complex problems, there probably are no simple, cost-free solutions to them, because if there were, somebody would have solved them,'' he said on his radio call-in program on Friday. But he voiced impatience with what candidates have offered so far. ''I would just like to get them to address the important issues with more specificity of what they'd actually do,'' he said.
 Some researchers say it's easy to read too much into scientific breakthroughs and opinion polls. Patterns of behavior don't change on a dime. For example, it took a decade for tobacco use to start falling after the 1964 surgeon general's report on smoking and cancer. Others say the political system is broken, and that improvisation -- unpredictable by definition -- is the only way forward.
 If euthanasia can't be made legal through politics, then the medical world, through the winks and nods of mercy killing, will find a way. If people want affordable food on the table, the economic system will get the lettuce and strawberries picked with low labor costs even as the squabbling over illegal immigration goes on.
 And so the winds shift. The most recent Gallup poll on crime, in May 2006, found that only 34 percent of people thought the death penalty helped lower the murder rate, down from 62 percent in 1985. In 19 states, from California to Mississippi, executions have been put on hold pending a resolution to a Supreme Court case challenging lethal injection in Kentucky. And New Jersey tossed out the death penalty altogether late last year.
 In such an environment, the real challenge for politicians, whatever their party, is how to transcend partisanship not just in thought but in deed. 
 In a New York Times-CBS News poll last April, 43 percent of the respondents who thought the weather had become stranger lately volunteered that global warming was the probable cause, up from only 5 percent a decadeago. But asked in the same survey whether they'd support an increase in gasoline taxes if that might help fight the climate problem, a resounding 58 percent said no.
 ''Al Gore did a brilliant job of selling the message of global warming -- he packaged it and sold it to America and I think the world,'' said Laura Ries, the president of Ries & Ries, a marketing strategy firm in Atlanta. ''But go to the checkout counter, and people are not always walking the walk.''
 Ideas can and do break the barriers between thought and action, between the academy and the shoe-leather reality of the barricades, and sometimes it happens suddenly.
 In the 1960s, the demographics of black migration from the South, charismatic leadership and televised images of the racist backlash combined to jar a nation and a Congress to consciousness. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton stepped away from Democratic Party orthodoxy on welfare and broke the logjam, leading to a historic rethinking of the subject. In 2005, a decision by the Supreme Court affirming the right of the government of New London, Conn., to take property, pay the owners compensation, and give it to someone else for development led to an instant uprising against the practice in statehouses and city halls all over the nation.
 ''One day it's the Roman Empire and everybody believes in the pagan gods, the next day it's Christian -- how does that happen?'' said Thomas Habinek, a professor of classics at the University of Southern California. Or the ''rights of man,'' which became a rallying cry of the French Revolution. ''Nobody mentions it, and then a few years later there's a revolution over it,'' he said.
 But an equally important question is why some ideas don't break through.
 Darwin's theory of natural selection in evolution, for example, is the bedrock of modern biology, but it had an early life, long-since faded, as a social idea, ''survival of the fittest,'' that justified every racist thought and act of rapacious capitalist exploitation.
 And nearly 150 years after the theory's publication in ''The Origin of Species,'' millions of people, including some running for president, say they don't believe in evolution because it remains an ''unproven'' theory (while other theories, like relativity, are accepted without much question).
 Other times, society gets on with it, historians say, by simply turning the page, as occurred in the early 1800s, when deep divisions over religion, science and morality were papered over by a giant mental compromise that became known as the Victorian Age. The Victorians didn't resolve the tensions over romanticism and materialism that had festered in Europe for centuries; they denied and suppressed them.
 Today, pop entertainment, sophisticated marketing and the Internet can shift public thinking and taste as fast as a Britney Spears news cycle. Are the evolving attitudes that poll takers find about homosexuality, for example, a reflection of new science and genetics, or ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' or simply the fact that young people are more comfortable with gay friends who are acknowledging their sexuality earlier and more openly?
 In a New York Times-CBS News poll in October 2006, only about one in three respondents, 34 percent, said homosexuality was a choice, down from 44 percent in the mid-1990s, and the number who said homosexuality was ''morally wrong,'' had fallen faster, from 55 percent to 37 percent.
 It's a social shift that heartens some only up to a point. ''The way in which acceptance of homosexuality is growing, and I say this as a gay man, has become just another niche for the marketing of certain commodities,'' said Mr. Habinek, the classics professor. 
 In fact, some sociologists say, the new niches of consumer choice are just another way to divide us, the way the Republicans segmented vehicle owners in the 2004 presidential campaign, pitching President Bush as the logical choice for big S.U.V.-drivers who lean Republican, and assuming Volvo and Subaru owners were for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee.
 So products become conservative or liberal depending on the sales job. Certified Fair Trade coffee, grown under conditions that are meant to give small growers in poor countries better economic conditions, is now the fastest-growing segment of the specialty coffee market. Through the (Product) Red campaign co-founded by the rock star Bono, a consumer can contribute two weeks' worth of anti-viral AIDS drugs to Africa by buying a T-shirt at the Gap.
 The Toyota Prius hybrid sells well in California -- 20 percent of the market is in Los Angeles and San Francisco -- and in the Northeast. The market, a Toyota spokesman said, is coastal and liberal, with Middle America not yet tuned in.
 And a recent commercial for the Ford Escape Hybrid appears to be trying to exploit that division, some say.
 In the ad, a father and daughter are walking toward their vehicle and she bemoans being driven to a certain part of town in a gas-guzzling S.U.V. People over there walk and drive hybrids and have different attitudes about the environment, the daughter says. The dad responds that their new Ford is a hybrid, too. Well, why didn't you say that, she asks. 
 ''I never thought I needed to,'' the father replies.
 Some marketing analysts say the commercial is just a clever swipe at Toyota, which has marketed a whole lifestyle choice around the Prius. 
 But Keith Brown, who is finishing a Ph.D. dissertation in economic sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, writing about ethical tradeoffs in consumer choice, said he thought Ford was really speaking for the middle-of-the-road consumer who doesn't want to be a vanguard environmentalist, and who perhaps fears and loathes all those liberal, coastal Prius buyers.
 ''The depressing thing to me is that the father is criticizing the people who are making the biggest change,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The girl is talking about morals, and the father represents the great bulk of the people who don't want to talk about any such thing.''
 So does that make the father in the ad less an agent of change, or even more of a revolutionary by saying that hybrids and the environment are now no longer something we even need to talk about?
 Professor Bunzl at Rutgers, who works on climate change and energy issues, said that the quieting of controversy could speak louder than the clamor of the fight itself.
 ''There is much more change going on than we realize,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''And one way it expresses itself is how all of a sudden we realize that what was an issue no longer matters.''
 Indeed, in his Iowa speech, Mr. Obama seemed to suggest that even having a conversation about healing and coming together was outdated, and that it's what you do next, with a consensus and a community made real through action, that matters.
 ''We are one nation, we are one people,'' he said. ''And our time for change has come.''

HEADLINE: Independents Are the Prize In This Race

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Reporting was contributed by Michael Falcone and Sarah Wheaton from Hudson, Michael Luo from Bedford, Adam Nagourney from Manchester and Marc Santora from Peterborough.

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H. 

 BODY:
The race for president, steeped in appeals to each party's base for nearly a year, is for the next few days largely in the hands of voters who identify themselves as neither Republican nor Democrat.
 Candidates are feverishly appealing to independents ahead of the primary on Tuesday in New Hampshire, where unaffiliated voters are permitted to cast ballots in either party's contest. 
 There is competition in the parties for undeclared voters, but the most intriguing matchup is between two candidates from opposing sides who have cultivated antiestablishment images: Senators Barack Obama and John McCain.
 Driving these voters, campaign strategists in both parties say, is a thirst for change and a strong desire to break with the Bush administration. Concern over the war in Iraq, despite recent advances in security there, also remains on the minds of independent voters and has contributed to a shift toward Democrats in New Hampshire. 
 Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, implored voters here Saturday ''to come together as Democrats and Republicans and independents and say that we are one nation, we are one people and our time for change has come in 2008.''
 At the same time, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, appealed to independent-minded voters who helped him to upset George W. Bush in the Republican primary here eight years ago. ''You haven't changed,'' Mr. McCain said, ''and neither have I.''
 The scramble for the independent vote -- the nearly 45 percent of the electorate here who are registered as neither Democrat nor Republican -- is evolving partly into a battle between the two mens' campaigns. 
 Polls here say that almost two-thirds of these voters are leaning Democratic, making them particularly critical to Mr. Obama's effort to win a second contest in a row. Meanwhile, Mr. McCain is trying to tap into this pool of voters to edge out former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.
 ''McCain is in a two-way war in New Hampshire,'' said Fergus Cullen, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ''He is competing with Romney for Republican voters, and he is competing with Obama for independents.''
 In addition to making appeals to independents based on change and qualities like integrity, the candidates are citing issues on which they say they can work across the aisle to get things done in Washington to help people. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York tapped into that feeling Saturday. ''We're Democrats,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We should stand for universal health care, and more independents and Republicans are finally understanding that it's morally and economically imperative.''
 Mr. Romney did the same on the Republican side. He reminded voters in Bedford that some establishment conservative groups had been the chief critics of his health care plan in Massachusetts, a departure from the way he normally talks about the subject.
 ''You can't win an election in New Hampshire on Democratic or Republican votes alone,'' said Representative Paul W. Hodes, Democrat of New Hampshire, who relied upon support from these undeclared voters when he upset a Republican incumbent in 2006. ''The independent vote is always the most important vote.''
 At overflowing political rallies, at house parties and in television commercials, the partisan roar softened a bit as Republican and Democratic candidates navigated the complicated terrain of late-deciding voters. In this election, their motivation is heightened by daily polls showing the tightness of the race on both sides and by their awareness of what a difference independent voters could make.
 At a town-hall-style meeting for Mr. McCain in Hudson, N.H., an independent, Emily Rocheleau, 22, said she was weighing her choices between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama. 
 ''It doesn't necessarily mean that all of their positions are really moderate,'' Ms. Rocheleau said, ''but their rhetoric and their approach to politics is more about unifying the country.''
 Conversations with voters at Mr. Obama's rally here Saturday turned up several examples of voters who said they were open to either candidate.
 The Obama campaign was taking no chances, and advisers were quick to point out Mr. McCain's fervent support for the Iraq war.
 ''We're not running in the primary against Senator McCain,'' said David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama's campaign. ''I don't think it's a secret that he's a strong supporter of the war.''
 In Iowa, there were signs that Mr. Obama was successful in attracting the support of those who identified themselves as independents. Fifty-two percent of voters said they backed the candidate who would bring change, and Mr. Obama won 51 percent of their support.
 Mr. Obama and the rest of the Democratic field helped to bring out a record number of voters to the Iowa caucuses Thursday night, including many who had never attended one before. Officials in New Hampshire are also predicting a heavy turnout on Tuesday. If independents vote for Democrats in large numbers, it will be evidence that the strong desire on the left for a clear break from the policies of President Bush is shared by a group at the center of the electorate.
 The New Hampshire secretary of state, Bill Gardner, said Friday that he expected about 500,000 people, including about 150,000 independents, to vote in the primary. 
 Edmund Case, a 38-year-old marketing executive, walked away from a rally for Mr. Obama here on Saturday impressed by his call to bridge the partisan divide. He said that he would not choose his candidate until Tuesday but that he was also impressed that both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have spoken out against torture.
 ''Anyone who recognizes the value of bringing both parties to the table -- that means real compromise -- then that's good,'' Mr. Case said. ''Obama has that. McCain seems to have that, too.''
 Eight years ago, Mr. McCain's presidential candidacy was resurrected by a wave of independent voters who helped him defeat Mr. Bush by 18 points in New Hampshire. But this time around, Mr. McCain's support for the Iraq war has complicated his effort to win over many of the same unaffiliated voters in his fight here to defeat Mr. Romney; former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who won in Iowa; and other Republican candidates. 
 ''I'm sure we will do well with the independents,'' Mr. McCain told reporters Saturday. ''But they will make up their mind late.'' 
 Almost two-thirds of undeclared voters, who can vote in either primary, planned to choose the Democratic primary, according to the most recent CNN/WMUR poll. Those who were planning to vote Democratic divided 34 percent for Mr. Obama and 29 percent for Mrs. Clinton. 
 Of the undeclared voters who plan to vote in the Republican primary, 36 percent said they would vote for Mr. McCain, and 25 percent favored Mr. Romney. The statewide telephone poll was conducted Dec. 27-30, before the Iowa caucuses.
 While New Hampshire voters have a history of repudiating a decision from Iowa, Mr. Obama's advisers hastily created a television commercial here showing glimpses of his victory speech. 
 ''Undeclared voters could basically crash the party on Hillary Clinton on behalf of Barack Obama,'' said Dante J. Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire. ''He does much better than Clinton among undeclared voters.''
 While aides say Mrs. Clinton has been focusing on independent voters -- particularly women -- for months, she is refining her efforts in the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary. On Saturday, she held events specifically geared toward undecided voters, and she is working to improve her standing with young voters.
 Still, advisers to Mrs. Clinton have long viewed the wave of independent voters as a complication to her winning New Hampshire. And after the results of the Iowa caucuses, fueled by an unusually high turnout of independent voters, the challenge in New Hampshire is viewed as urgent.
 Even though the results in Iowa have dominated news coverage here, conversations with voters attending weekend political events suggest that many have yet to make up their minds. 
 ''I'm kind of checking them all out,'' said Rose Thorn, 50, of Nashua, who attended a rally Friday evening for Mr. McCain and intended to catch Mr. Obama here Saturday. 
 ''I haven't been paying a lot of attention to what's going on in the media because I really don't want to be swayed by that,'' Ms. Thorn said. She added that she would be focused on what the candidates said at the debates Saturday night.
 Among the Republican candidates, Mr. McCain is hoping to win over people like Ms. Thorn and her husband, Ed, who helped contribute to his landslide victory here in 2000. While Mr. Thorn declared that he had voted for Mr. McCain before, he said he had yet to make up his mind this time.

HEADLINE: Under Investigation Dec. 30 - Jan. 5

 BODY:
THE NEWS The Justice Department elevated its inquiry into the destruction of Central Intelligence Agencyinterrogation videotapes into a criminal investigation.
 BEHIND THE NEWS C.I.A. officials long feared becoming entangled in a criminal inquiry of secret counterterrorism programs. Now Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey has directed prosecutors to examine whether C.I.A. officers obstructed justice or committed other criminal acts in destroying tapes of interrogations of two operatives from Al Qaeda. Top Bush administration lawyers debated whether to destroy the tapes but it is unclear if anyone outside the C.I.A. endorsed the idea. 
THE NEWS Kenya's attorney general called for an inquiry into the outcome of the presidential election, which resulted in an explosion of ethnic violence.
 BEHIND THE NEWSMwai Kibaki's razor-thin re-election on Dec. 27 was greeted by charges of vote rigging and ignited chaos and ethnic fighting across the country. Hundreds have died, including up to 50 people hiding in a church who were burned alive. The attorney general, Amos Wako, broke ranks with the president in calling for the independent probe, a move that suggested a growing divide within the government. Kenya had been one of Africa's most stable nations, celebrated both for its wildlife and robust economy.
 THE NEWS President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan asked Scotland Yard to help investigate the murder of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Musharraf said he asked for the help to alleviate suspicions of foul play and denied that he or any members of the Pakistani military or intelligence agencies played a role in her assassination. The British investigators will face a challenge: no formal autopsy was performed on Ms. Bhutto's body, and the site of the shooting was hosed down shortly after the attack. Pakistani officials have suggested a militant linked to Al Qaeda was responsible but American intelligence analysts are not convinced. 
 THE NEWS A top law enforcement official asked for a special prosecutor to examine the 1988 murder of a Long Island couple after the conviction of their son was overturned.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Suffolk County's district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, said he would dismiss all charges against Martin H. Tankleff, who was 17 at the time of the murders and spent 18 years in prison. He also asked Gov. Eliot Spitzer to appoint a prosecutor to re-examine the murders. New York's Commission of Investigation is already looking into the handling of the case. In overturning Mr. Tankleff's conviction, a state appellate court cited the ''cumulative effect'' of new witnesses and evidence. 
 THE NEWS The Federal Bureau of Investigation has ''reignited'' its investigation into the case of the man known as D. B. Cooper, who parachuted out of a hijacked airliner 36 years ago with $200,000 and disappeared.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Who was the polite man in his mid-40s who claimed to have a bomb? Did he survive the jump over the Pacific Northwest on a cold November night in 1971, clad in loafers and a trench coat? It remains one of the F.B.I.'s great unsolved cases. The agency is seeking help from the public by releasing new details of the crime and fresh insights about Mr. Cooper: that he was not an expert sky diver, and had no help on the ground. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: Kenya Kikuyus, Long Dominant, Are Routed From Rivals' Land

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAKURU, Kenya 

 BODY:
Kenya's privileged tribe is on the run.
 Over the past few days, tens of thousands of Kikuyus, the tribe of Kenya's president, have packed into heavily guarded buses to flee the western part of the country because of ethnic violence. On Sunday, endless convoys of buses -- some with their windshields smashed by rocks -- crawled across a landscape of scorched homes and empty farms. 
 It is nothing short of a mass exodus. The tribe that has dominated business and politics in Kenya since independence in 1963 is now being chased off its land by machete-wielding mobs made up of members of other tribes furious about the Dec. 27 election, which Kenya's president, Mwai Kibaki, won under dubious circumstances. In some places, Kikuyus have been hunted down with bows and arrows.
 The hospital in Nakuru, a town in the Rift Valley, is full of Kikuyu men with deep ax wounds, fingers cut off and slash marks across their faces. 
 ''It was the Kalenjin,'' said Samuel Mburu, a Kikuyu farmer with rows of stitches in his head, when asked who had nearly killed him. The Kalenjin are one of the bigger tribes in the Rift Valley, and they have fought fiercely with the Kikuyus before, mostly over land.
 Many Kalenjin are unapologetic. Robert Tutuny, a Kalenjin farmer, stood on a hillside on Sunday with an iron bar in his hands and looked down at the charred remains of a Kikuyu village that was razed a week ago.
 ''We hate these people,'' Mr. Tutuny said.
 The election -- and the unresolved battle about who won -- has ignited old tensions in Kenya, which in a week and a half has gone from being one of Africa's most promising countries to another equatorial trouble zone.
 The political impasse continued Sunday, with Jendayi E. Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for African affairs, meeting again with opposition leaders and government officials, but no resolution was in sight.
 The heavy fighting that claimed more than 300 lives last week has subsided and many people have gone back to work in the capital, Nairobi. There, people from different tribes live side by side and often work in the same office. They are aware of ethnic differences and sometimes joke about them, but it usually does not go further than that.
 But out here -- where little towns rise from the veld like mirages and where there is so much wide-open space it seems incongruous to fight over land -- these differences matter. A tribal war is shaping up between the Kalenjin, who mostly support Kenya's opposition leaders, and the Kikuyus, who voted heavily -- up to 98 percent in some areas -- for the president. 
 Tens of thousands of Kikuyus are camped out at police stations and churches for protection, waiting for buses guarded by military escorts to evacuate them to the central highlands, the traditional Kikuyu homeland. There, amid the lush tea fields and rolling green hills, they are safe because almost everyone who lives in the highlands is Kikuyu.
 Ethnic conflict is now threatening the decades of stability that has set Kenya apart from so many of its neighbors, like Congo, Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan. But Kenya has struggled with ethnic violence before. Its rare bursts usually come around election time.
 ''You have to understand that these issues are much deeper than ethnic,'' said Maina Kiai, chairman of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. 
 ''They are political,'' he said, and ''they go back to land.''
 The last time the Rift Valley was this violent was in 1992, another election year in Kenya and a time of turbulent transition between dictatorship and democracy. Kalenjin militias, stirred up by politicians who told them that the valley was Kalenjin ancestral land, massacred hundreds of Kikuyus in a bid to steal their farms. 
 Since then, Mr. Kiai said, ''Emotions have been festering, resentments have been building and we sat around pretending ethnicity didn't exist.''
 Kenya has more than 40 tribes, but the Kikuyus have almost always been on top. They run shops, restaurants, banks and factories across the country. One reason Mr. Kibaki has engendered so much resentment from other tribes is because many of the top officials in his government -- including the ministers of defense, justice, finance and internal security -- are Kikuyus.
 The Kikuyus are the biggest tribe in Kenya but far from a majority, at 22 percent of the population. The Kalenjins make up about 12 percent.
 In the Rift Valley, the anti-Kikuyu grudge goes back to independence, when the British government bought out Britons who owned huge, picturesque farms. But instead of redistributing that land to the impoverished people who had lived here for centuries, like the Kalenjin and Masai, the newly formed Kenyan government, led by Jomo Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, gave much of it to Kikuyus from other areas.
 Most of the Kikuyus here are hardly rich. The men lying on bloody sheets at the Nakuru hospital are emaciated farmers with threadbare clothes. The same goes for the Kikuyus who have been slaughtered by gangs of opposing tribes in Nairobi's slums, causing an exodus from there, too. They lived in iron shanties just as their non-Kikuyu neighbors do. 
 But in many cases, the Kikuyus own kiosks or small patches of land or they are related to someone who does, and that makes them a little better off by local standards.
 ''Land is very important to us,'' said Anthony Kirunga, a Kikuyu, who sells spare car parts in Nakuru. ''It's not our fault that other people are jealous.''
 This election stirred up anti-Kikuyu jealousies like never before. Raila Odinga, the top opposition candidate and a member of the Luo tribe, built his campaign on a promise to end Kikuyu favoritism and share the fruits of Kenya's growing economy with all tribes. 
 Early election results had him way ahead and his party winning the most seats in Parliament. But at the 11th hour of the vote-tallying process last Sunday, Mr. Kibaki surged. Election observers have said the president's party rigged the results to stay in power.
 Millions of opposition supporters across Kenya were outraged. Not only did their candidate lose, but it also seemed to them that their system, which until the election had been celebrated as one of the most vibrant democracies in Africa, had cheated them. 
 In western Kenya, where Kikuyus are vastly outnumbered, they became easy targets. In Kisumu, the third-largest city in the country, Luos went on a rampage, burning down Kikuyu shops and ransacking the downtown. 
 In the Rift Valley, Kalenjin gangs stormed Kikuyu farms. Police officers seemed reluctant to intervene. Dozens of Kikuyus were massacred, including up to 50 women and children hiding in a church who were burned alive. What has kept the death toll from rising even higher is the fact that few people here have guns; most of the clashes have been fought with clubs, knives and stones. 
 Jeremiah Mukuna, 75, a Kikuyu farmer, was attacked by a Kalenjin mob last Monday while he was sitting on the porch of his shack, his family said. His head was split open with an ax. On Sunday, he lay in a coma in the Nakuru hospital, taking short, shallow breaths.
 His wife, Grace, said she was leaving the Rift Valley.
 ''I will never come back,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Songs From an Unrecorded Minstrel

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
''This is a new song,'' Natalie Merchant announced onstage at the Hiro Ballroom on Friday night, at her first full New York City concert in four years. ''Try to absorb it here, now, 'cause I don't know when I'll make a record.'' 
 Ms. Merchant, who sold millions of albums in the 1990s, has an adoring audience and no record label behind her. She's not alone. As contracts end, more and more well-known musicians are trying to reinvent their careers for the era of mass downloading and plunging album sales. At the Hiro Ballroom, when a voice in the crowd asked when Ms. Merchant would release a new album, she said with a smile that she was awaiting ''a new paradigm for the recording industry.'' Another fan called out, ''Myth America,'' the independent label Ms. Merchant formed in 2003 to release ''The House Carpenter's Daughter,'' an album of rearranged folk songs. Ms. Merchant replied, ''Myth America is bankrupt.''
 So for the moment, Ms. Merchant is back to the age-old economic model of the troubadour. People who want to hear her latest songs will have to see her perform them. New songs filled her two-hour set at Hiro Ballroom, the first of six sold-out shows through Jan. 10. Although she has played some guest appearances and benefit shows during her hiatus, Ms. Merchant was slightly taken aback by current concert behavior: cellphones raised overhead to shoot photos and video. But she sang with thoughtful passion, traversing American music from folky fingerpicking to soul grooves to pop hymns. 
 Ms. Merchant, who had a daughter in 2003, has written songs around poetry by and for children. She also had new songs with her own lyrics and a setting of Shakespeare's 73rd sonnet, waltzing gently as she sang about ''bare ruined choirs'' and thoughts of lost love and mortality. 
 The new songs, like her catalog, offer sorrows, warnings and solace. A folky political parable described a ''golden child'' whose father did everything for him. A minor-key rocker held vows of ''giving up everything'' in a somber crescendo, with images of emptiness hinting at Buddhism. The children's songs brought out Ms. Merchant's playful side; she finds wonderful things in archives. She had a countryish setting for a Victorian poem about alternate plans ''if no one ever marries me,'' a vaudeville shuffle about falling in love with ''the janitor's boy'' and a Gypsy-tinged waltz about riddles posed by ''The Man in the Wilderness.''
 As she unveiled her own new songs, Ms. Merchant let herself be as moved as her audience. In a gospel-soul song about trying to find the courage to push through troubles, which mentioned New Orleans, and in a waltz that contemplated war and human strife and wondered, ''How can we have so far to go?,'' she burst into tears. They were a troubadour's live, spontaneous, here-and-now moments: nothing an album could contain. 
 Natalie Merchant will appear Tuesday through Thursday at the Hiro Ballroom, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; sold out.

HEADLINE: When Illnesses Vie for Our Dollars

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''Putting a Plague in Perspective,'' by Daniel Halperin (Op-Ed, Jan. 1), is correct that much of the money spent on AIDS would save more lives if placed in child health and family planning. 
 In the early 1980s, I was one of the first to draw attention to what I feared would be a global epidemic of heterosexual AIDS infections, and I was responsible for Usaid's first money for H.I.V. prevention in the developing world. 
 Fortunately, we can now be confident that the catastrophic level of heterosexual H.I.V. infection found in places such as Botswana or parts of South Africa will not spread to the rest of the world. 
 Sadly, with the passage of time I have seen rhetoric replace objective analysis and, like Mr. Halperin, I have watched with dismay as Western money for AIDS has distorted the larger picture of health priorities of the developing world.
 Malcolm Potts
 Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 1, 2008
 The writer is a professor at the School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley.
 To the Editor:
 I sincerely hope that Daniel Halperin is not suggesting a ''rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach to health problems in Africa. We are just now turning the corner with AIDS in that beleaguered region, thanks to those well-financed programs. To scale back on those efforts would set us back to the place we were in the late 1990s, when it appeared AIDS would consume the entire continent.
 Yes, there are other problems that need attention, but rather than trying to redistribute the currently inadequate resources at hand, let's make the foreign aid pie bigger to provide slices for clean water, immunizations and other basic health care needs. 
 One piece of legislation that would provide a boost to these other areas is the U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act. With 26,000 children dying each day from preventable causes, it's time to invest in the simple, cost-effective measures that could keep them alive. Congress can take the first steps in that investment with passage of this bill.
 Steve Valk 
 Atlanta, Jan. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Basic health care in Africa certainly needs improvement, but it should not come at the cost of well-financed AIDS treatment. While it is saddening that we do not sufficiently fight high mortality rates in Africa, AIDS is a scourge that afflicts the entire world and lacks a cure. It is especially important to study and treat large-scale infected populations to learn more about the disease. 
 From my perspective, here in Washington, where AIDS rates rival some of the worst from the third world, it is obvious that we must do more to fight this plague. If our extra efforts in Africa someday lead to a cure, the now seeming overinvestment may prove to be a truly worthy appropriation -- one from which the entire world would benefit.

 To the Editor:
 Daniel Halperin criticizes the candidates for president who have pledged $50 billion for global H.I.V.-AIDS programs, saying it would make sense only if it were ''not limited to H.I.V.-AIDS programs.'' 
 But, in fact, their promise is not limited to H.I.V.-AIDS programs. The candidates who signed our pledge did so knowing that one-quarter of the financing would go to programs that are not strictly AIDS-related. These programs would address tuberculosis, malaria, the needs of orphaned children (regardless of whether they were orphaned by AIDS) and the shortage of health care workers. 
 The candidates also pledged a significant increase in overall aid dollars, which would free up funds for neglected programs.
 Mr. Halperin is right to express outrage at the low level of financing for clean water and family planning. But he should direct more of his criticism at such candidates as John McCain and Mitt Romney, who have failed to make any specific commitment whatsoever on global development financing.

 To the Editor:
 Daniel Halperin implies that we are overfinancing AIDS and underfinancing other key health and development priorities. The truth is that financing for AIDS and other foreign assistance is too small. 
 Pitting health and development priorities against each other is simply asking for the financing pie to be cut up into smaller and smaller pieces, leaving developing countries to make impossible choices among many worthy goals. 
 The combined gross domestic product of the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2006 was $36,316.6 billion. If these countries allocated 0.7 percent of their G.D.P. to foreign assistance, as they have promised, there would be plenty of money to go around to fully support programs to fight AIDS and other key challenges in Africa and elsewhere. 
 Currently, the United States spends 0.19 percent of its G.D.P. for these purposes. Gregg Gonsalves

 To the Editor:
 One cannot overemphasize the many truths expressed in Daniel Halperin's Op-Ed article. Health workers recently returned from H.I.V.-AIDS clinics in Africa and Central America report that nongovernmental programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. are launched, but that they are embedded in gravely inadequate infrastructures that diminish the chances for success. Plans to distribute AIDS drugs to the infected mothers and children who need them for the rest of their lives, not just for the few days or weeks surrounding the birth, are inadequate.
 Most poor countries lack the laboratory capacity to conduct the necessary blood tests to measure drug efficacy and monitor for resistance and side effects. Also, we have begun to recommend breast-feeding of infants born to H.I.V.-infected mothers, even though breast milk is known to transmit the infection. Sadly, formula-feeding is an even greater hazard because the water needed to reconstitute the formula is filthy. 
 Thus, death due to infectious diarrhea is more certain than death due to H.I.V.

HEADLINE: Ex-Harvard President Meets a Former Student, and Intellectual Sparks Fly

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
In June 2006, Peter Hopkins, a civic-minded and idealistic 2004 Harvard graduate, trekked up to his alma mater from New York for a meeting with Lawrence H. Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary. Mr. Hopkins, who finagled the appointment through his friendship with Mr. Summers's assistant, had a business idea: a Web site that could do for intellectuals what YouTube, the popular video-sharing site, did for bulldogs on skateboards.
 The pitch -- ''a YouTube for ideas'' -- appealed to Mr. Summers. ''Larry, to his credit, is open to new ideas,'' Mr. Hopkins recalled recently. ''He grilled me for two hours.'' In the age of user-generated content, Mr. Summers did have one worry: ''Let's say someone puts up a porn video next to my macroeconomic speech?'' 
 It took awhile, but a year after that meeting, Mr. Summers decided to invest (''a few tens of thousands of dollars,'' he said, adding ''not something I'm hoping to retire on'') in the site, called Big Think, which officially makes its debut today after being tested for several months. 
 Big Think (www.bigthink.com) mixes interviews with public intellectuals from a variety of fields, from politics, to law to business, and allows users to engage in debates on issues like global warming and the two-party system. It plans to add new features as it goes along, including a Facebook-like application for social networking, and Mr. Hopkins said he would like the site to become a popular place for college students looking for original sources. 
 ''I've had the general view that there is a hunger for people my age looking for more intellectual content,'' said Mr. Summers, who resigned as Harvard president in 2006 after making controversial comments about the lack of women in science and engineering. ''I saw it as president of Harvard when I saw C.E.O.'s come up to my wife and want to discuss Hawthorne.'' (His wife, Elisa New, is a professor of English at Harvard). 
 A handful of other deep-pocketed investors also decided to chip in, including Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal, the online payments site; Tom Scott, who struck it rich by founding, and selling, the juice company Nantucket Nectars and now owns Plum TV, a collection of local television stations in wealthy playgrounds like Aspen, Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons; the television producer Gary David Goldberg, who was behind the hit shows ''Spin City'' and ''Family Ties''; and David Frankel, a venture capitalist who was the lead investor in Big Think.
 ''I tend to follow my own curiosities, and I know millions of people are like me,'' said Mr. Scott. ''I'm into this kind of thing. I do think there is a market for this.''
 Mr. Frankel, the lead investor, said, ''The initial investors may put in more. I imagine we will go out and raise more money in the future.''
 Mr. Hopkins and his partner, Victoria Brown, germinated the idea for Big Think while working together at PBS on the ''Charlie Rose'' show in 2006.
 When they surveyed the landscape, Mr. Hopkins, 24, and Ms. Brown, 33, saw a vast array of celebrity and sophomoric video content (remember the clips of cats urinating in toilets that caused a sensation on YouTube?). 
 ''Everyone says Americans are stupid -- that's what we generally heard from venture capitalists'' when trying to raise money, Mr. Hopkins said. Obviously, Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Brown felt differently, and the success of the business basically hinges on proving that Americans have an appetite for other kinds of content.
 Of course, Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Brown are not the first to see the Internet as an opportunity to further public discourse. It was invented largely by academics; numerous sites, like Arts & Letters Daily, an offshoot of the Chronicle of Higher Education, seek to serve intellectuals.
 Big Think's business model right now is rudimentary: attract enough viewers, then sell advertising. ''We're going to wait until it gets attention before going after advertisers,'' Mr. Hopkins said. 
 So for the time being, money will be flowing one way at Big Think, out the door. Over the last several months, Big Think's handful of producers, working from a pod of desks in a Manhattan office space, have amassed a library of about 180 interviews with leading thinkers, politicians and business leaders, like Mitt Romney, Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Richard Branson and the co-founder of Blackstone, Pete Peterson. Many of the interviews were conducted in a closet-turned-studio in a back room off the office kitchen.
 The interview style, which Big Think's founders said was derived from a technique used by the filmmaker Errol Morris, places the interviewer in an even smaller closet, behind a shower curtain, hidden from the subject and making the person asking the questions almost an afterthought. The subject hears the questions from a closed-circuit monitor. 
 The finished product even eliminates the interviewer's voice, and the questions appear as text on the screen. The goal is to not create a confrontation between interviewer and interviewee, or goad the subject into saying something provocative (but if it happens, that is a bonus.)
 ''The whole idea is really to take the interviewer out of the equation,'' said Mr. Hopkins. ''It allows people to be very candid. Pete Peterson went on about how his mother never loved him. It was like he was coming in for his last testament.''
 When Mr. Peterson left his interview, he surveyed the makeshift studio and said, ''You kids are really making lemonade out of lemons.''
 Tom Freston, the former chief executive of Viacom, has shown little interest in publicly reflecting on his 2005 firing by Viacom Chairman Sumner M. Redstone. But he agreed to discuss it with Big Think, saying in an interview, ''Say if you're a C.E.O. of a public company, a lot of it you're playing defense. You're dealing with problems or crises. At the moment in the smaller life I have for myself, I've got a lot less of that, which is a good thing.''
 Those videos stockpiled over the last months will be introduced piecemeal and used in a variety of ways. For example, the site may pose the question ''are two parties enough?'' and assemble clips from people like John McCain and Arlen Spector and Dennis Kucinich. Readers would then have an opportunity to submit their own views.
 ''The idea behind Big Think is that you do have to sit down for a few minutes and listen to people who know more than you do,'' Mr. Hopkins said.
 Mr. Hopkins knows his site will naturally appeal to secular East Coast intellectuals, but he wants to challenge their secularism with sections on faith and love and happiness. ''There's a ton of evangelicals,'' said Mr. Hopkins, including an interview with Rick Warren, the pastor and best-selling author of ''The Purpose Driven Life.'' 
 ''People, whether or not they believe in God, these issues really resonate,'' said Mr. Hopkins. ''Look at the success of 'The Secret' and 'The Purpose Driven Life.'''
 He also hopes the site can transcend partisanship and become a destination for thinkers open to hearing opposing views.
 ''We live in this hyperpartisan world with really smart people on each side,'' Mr. Hopkins said, invoking John Locke and John Stuart Mill, two enlightenment thinkers who believed in being open to hearing out the other side. ''But there's a lot of information not being exchanged because of these false barriers. People should expose themselves to the counterpoints.''

HEADLINE: From Hype To Fear

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The unemployment report on Friday was brutally bad. Unemployment rose in December, while job creation was minimal -- and it's highly likely, for technical reasons, that the job number will be revised down, showing an actual decline in employment.
 It's the latest piece of bad news about an economy in which the employment situation has actually been deteriorating for the past year. It's no longer possible to hope that the effects of the housing slump will remain ''contained,'' as one of 2007's buzzwords had it. The levees have been breached, and the repercussions of the housing crisis are spreading across the economy as a whole. 
 It's not certain, even now, that we'll have a formal recession, although given the news on Friday you have to say that the odds are that we will. But what is clear is that 2008 will be a troubled year for the U.S. economy -- and that as a result, the overall economic record of the Bush years will have been dreary at best: two and a half years of slumping employment, three and a half years of good but not great growth, and two more years of renewed economic distress.
 The November election will take place against that background of economic distress, which ought to be good news for candidates running on a platform of change.
 But the opponents of change, those who want to keep the Bush legacy intact, are not without resources. In fact, they've already made their standard pivot when things turn bad -- the pivot from hype to fear. And in case you haven't noticed, they're very, very good at the fear thing.
 You see, for 30 years American politics has been dominated by a political movement practicing Robin-Hood-in-reverse, giving unto those that hath while taking from those who don't. And one secret of that long domination has been a remarkable flexibility in economic debate. The policies never change -- but the arguments for these policies turn on a dime.
 When the economy is doing reasonably well, the debate is dominated by hype -- by the claim that America's prosperity is truly wondrous, and that conservative economic policies deserve all the credit. 
 But when things turn down, there is a seamless transition from ''It's morning in America! Hurray for tax cuts!'' to ''The economy is slumping! Raising taxes would be a disaster!'' 
 Thus, until just the other day Bush administration officials were in denial about the economy's problems. They were still insisting that the economy was strong, and touting the ''Bush boom'' -- the improvement in the job situation that took place between the summer of 2003 and the end of 2006 -- as proof of the efficacy of tax cuts. 
 But now, without ever acknowledging that maybe things weren't that great after all, President Bush is warning that given the economy's problems, ''the worst thing the Congress could do is raise taxes on the American people and on American businesses.''
 And even more dire warnings are coming from some of the Republican presidential candidates. For example, John McCain's campaign Web site cautions darkly that ''Entrepreneurs should not be taxed into submission. John McCain will make the Bush income and investment tax cuts permanent, keeping income tax rates at their current level and fighting the Democrats' plans for a crippling tax increase in 2011.''
 What ''crippling'' tax increase, which would tax entrepreneurs into submission, is Mr. McCain talking about? The answer is, proposals by Democrats to let the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year expire, returning upper-income tax rates to the levels that prevailed in the Clinton years. 
 And we all remember how little entrepreneurship there was, how weakly the economy performed, during the Clinton years, right? Oh, wait. (I've put some charts comparing job performance during the Clinton and Bush years on my Times blog, krugman.blogs.nytimes.com. It's pretty startling how comparatively weak the Bush era looks.)
 Never mind. The whole point of scare tactics is that they can work even in the face of inconvenient facts. 
 And what I'm not sure about is whether the Democrats are ready for the fight they're about to face.
 Not to put too fine a point on it, Barack Obama won his impressive victory in Iowa with a sunny, upbeat message of change. 
 But there's a powerful political faction in this country that understands very well that any real change will create losers as well as winners. In particular, any serious progressive reform of health care, let alone a broader attempt to reduce middle-class insecurity and inequality, will have to mean higher taxes on the affluent. And members of that faction will do whatever it takes to scare people into believing that change means disaster for the economy.
 I don't think they'll succeed. But it would be a big mistake to assume that they won't.

HEADLINE: Economists Say Movie Violence Might Temper the Real Thing

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Are movies like ''Hannibal'' and the remake of ''Halloween,'' which serve up murder and mutilation as routine fare, actually making the nation safer? 
 A paper presented by two researchers over the weekend to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association here challenges the conventional wisdom, concluding that violent films prevent violent crime by attracting would-be assailants and keeping them cloistered in darkened, alcohol-free environs. 
 Instead of fueling up at bars and then roaming around looking for trouble, potential criminals pass the prime hours for mayhem eating popcorn and watching celluloid villains slay in their stead. 
 ''You're taking a lot of violent people off the streets and putting them inside movie theaters,'' said the lead author of the study, Gordon Dahl, an economist at the University of California, San Diego. ''In the short run, if you take away violent movies, you're going to increase violent crime.'' 
 Professor Dahl and the paper's other author, Stefano DellaVigna, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, attach precise numbers to their argument: Over the last decade, they say, the showing of violent films in the United States has decreased assaults by an average of about 1,000 a weekend, or 52,000 a year. 
 Crime is not merely delayed until after the credits run, they say. On the Monday and Tuesday after packed weekend showings of violent films, no spike in violent crime emerges to compensate for the peaceful hours at the movies. Even a few weeks later, there is no evidence of a compensating resurgence, they say.
 The findings in their paper are part of a recent wave of economic research in what might be called the ''freakonomics era.'' Practitioners of the dismal science are transcending traditional subjects like labor and markets, and are now crunching numbers to evaluate matters like cheating among sumo wrestlers or the effects of a crackdown on cocaine. 
 In this case, the authors have waded into a long-simmering debate about media violence, with their findings likely to attract controversy: Their conclusion seems to collide with the research of psychologists, which has fed concerns by parents and policy makers that brutal imagery in films, video games and other media sows aggression in American life by rendering viewers insensitive to horrific acts. 
 ''There are hundreds of studies done by numerous research groups around the world that show that media violence exposure increases aggressive behavior,'' said Craig A. Anderson, a psychologist and director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University. ''People learn from every experience in life, and that learning occurs at a very basic level of brain function.''
 The study's authors acknowledge that their research does not refute and in fact lends credence to the findings of laboratory studies. Neither does it address the long-term effects of exposure to violent media, an influence they view as pernicious. 
 Rather, the research uses a decade of national crime reports, cinema ratings and movie audience data to examine what has happened to rates of violent crime during and immediately after violent films are shown. 
 Though such films may indeed stimulate a greater tendency toward aggression in audiences, Professor Dahl offers a rejoinder much favored by economists: Compared to what?
 Young men are the most likely to commit violent crimes. In opting to see a movie -- even one featuring, say, gang rape or chain-saw amputation -- they forgo activities that have a greater tendency to encourage mayhem, like drinking and drug use.
 ''Economics is about choice,'' Professor Dahl said. ''What would these people have done if they had not chosen to go and see a movie? Whatever they would have done would have had a greater tendency to involve alcohol. If you can incapacitate a large group of potentially violent people, that's a good thing.''
 Professor DellaVigna added, ''It's not as if these people watching violent movies would otherwise be home reading a book.''
 But critics of violent media worry that the study, with its focus on immediate effects, could distract policy makers from troubling signs of long-term harm to society and leave parents thinking that violent films may be the least bad way for their adolescent children to occupy leisure hours. 
 ''The study's premise strikes me as somewhat goofy,'' said Melissa Henson, senior director of programs at the Parents Television Council, a media watchdog based in Los Angeles. ''I'd hate for people to walk away with the message that, 'Oh, I ought to send my son to watch violent movies so they won't go out and drink or do drugs and commit violent crime.' What about going to the Y.M.C.A. and playing basketball, or after-school activities?''
 Professor Dahl seems an unlikely advocate for the crime-snuffing potential of sadistic cinema. A Mormon, he forbids his four children from watching violent films. He recently purchased a DVD player that strips out brutal or sexual images. He eschews violent films himself, professing discomfort even with ''Schindler's List,'' the epic portrayal of the Holocaust. 
 ''I don't like how I feel when I watch them,'' he said.
 Yet his rejection of violent media was, in a sense, the spark for his inquiry. 
 In 2005, he and his wife, Katherine, concerned about their children's viewing, consulted a Web site, kids-in-mind.com, that rates films for violence, sexual content and profanity. Professor Dahl was then working on another project employing a national database of crime reports. He wondered: Could one combine the movie ratings with the crime data and the numbers of people seeing films to explore how crime rates change with exposure to violent movies? 
 Analyzing the data, the authors found that ''on days with a high audience for violent movies, violent crime is lower.'' 
 From 6 p.m. to midnight on weekends -- when the largest numbers of people are in theaters -- violent crimes decreased 1.3 percent for every million people watching a strongly violent movie, the study found. Violent crimes dropped 1.1 percent for every million seeing a mildly violent film.
 In the hours after theaters close -- from midnight to 6 a.m. the next day -- violent crimes dropped 1.9 percent for every million people at a strongly violent movie, and by 2.1 percent for every million at mildly violent film. Strikingly, the data shows that crimes also drop, though not by as much, when large audiences see nonviolent films that young men find appealing. 
 In other words, Professor Dahl suggested, Hollywood could help cut crime in more palatable fashion by cutting out the gore while making movies that still attract male teenagers and 20-somethings.
 ''We need more Adam Sandler movies,'' he said. ''Even though I'm not a big fan of Adam Sandler, that's the implication.''

HEADLINE: Google's Lunchtime Betting Game

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
IT probably doesn't come as a huge surprise to learn that while employees in many companies sit in the cafeteria gossiping about work, or the boss, or the competition, at Google they are doing something else. 
 At Google, employees are encouraged to go online and place bets on a prediction market -- an exchange that tries to forecast events based on the money wagered on a particular outcome. 
 Prediction markets have been used for years to predict things like elections. At Google, they are used, of course, for business. In the last two and a half years, 1,463 employees have made wagers with play money (Goobles, as in rubles) on questions like: will Google open a Russia office? will Apple release an Intel-based Mac? how many users will Gmail have at the end of the quarter? 
 The lure, nominally, is accumulating those Goobles, which can be converted to modest prizes -- $10,000 worth each quarter. As it happens, Google employees were also taking part in an experiment on how information courses its way through the company. A study of those markets -- by two outside economists, Justin Wolfers of the University of Pennsylvania and Eric W. Zitzewitz of Dartmouth College, and a Google economic analyst, Bo Cowgill -- used the betting patterns of employees and their demographic details to try to find common factors among people with similar opinions -- is it type of job or level within the corporate structure, being friends or sitting close to one another? 
 According to the report, ''Using Prediction Markets to Track Information Flows: Evidence From Google,'' which was presented Friday at the American Economic Association meeting in New Orleans, the strongest correlation in betting was found among people who sat very close to one another, trumping even friendship or other close social ties. 
 This is tangible evidence, the authors argue, that information is shared most easily and effectively among office neighbors, even at an Internet company where instant messaging and e-mail are generally preferred to face-to-face discussion.
 It is an argument, the authors say, for giving greater importance to ''microgeography,'' or how people interact in the workplace. The finding that information moved fastest among people who were the closest together is also an endorsement of the company's ''third rule for managing knowledge workers: Pack Them In,'' the authors say. 
 ''Peoples' primary job isn't to trade these commodities,'' Mr. Zitzewitz said, putting the role of prediction markets into perspective, even at Google. ''What we are picking up is communication on 'low priority topics.' But that's how creative ideas come about.''
 The other crucial finding of the report was that there was a detectible ''optimism bias'' among Google employees. That is, results that were good for the company tended to be overpriced, particularly for ''subjects under the control of Google employees, such as, would a project be completed on time or would a particular office be opened.'' 
 This optimism was most evident among new employees, the report found, and it was bound to show up on days when Google stock had climbed. 
 This discovery largely jibes with what experts have found about the entrepreneurial mindset. If you take a job where much of the reward will come from the appreciation of company stock, you tend to see the silver lining within the cloud. (What is striking is that this bias was detected at Google during its greatest period of success. The stock more than tripled in the two-and-a-half-year period being studied, yet it was still possible to be too bullish about the company.)
 Beyond its findings, the report is fascinating for its inadvertent peeks into the secretive world of Googleland. 
 One learns, for example, that the researchers could determine ''physical proximity'' by using ''data on the precise latitude and longitude of employees' offices'' -- the better to find the closest burrito stand using Google Earth, I guess.
 Also, the authors report that ''employees moved offices extremely frequently'' during the time they were studying the company, about once every 90 days. ''You walk into their offices and no one packs from their moves,'' Mr. Zitzewitz said, a sign, he said, that Google was acting on the kind of insights the report described and was putting the right people next to one another.
 A question never addressed in the report is what would seemingly be most interesting to an outsider: Do prediction markets work? Unlike surveys, the markets rely on something, I think the technical term is ... oh, yeah, greed, to get their results.
 Ask me who I think will win a baseball game, an election and an Oscar, and I can try to be objective, but I can't help being influenced by who I would like to see win. (The Yankees, Fred Thompson, Pee-wee Herman; or is it the Yankees, Pee-wee Herman, Fred Thompson?) Put $5 on it, however, and suddenly I am willing to use all the information I have at my disposal to come up with the best answer. 
 When they exist exclusively within a company, these markets are a way of extracting hidden knowledge from the work force: if a floor salesman learns that a new TV model will be a dud, with a predictions market he can profit from that knowledge, and perhaps the chief executive can learn that as well.
 Google, however, is no ordinary company. As detailed in a footnote, one Google employee, looking to be a profitable trader, wrote the code for an extremely prolific trading robot. As a result, he ''was participating in about half of all trades'' and made a profit (in Goobles). 
 So the authors had to compensate for these trades. Who knew that someone from Google would try to game the system?

HEADLINE: Whose Century Is It Anyway?

 BODY:
The general election for president is still a ways off, but the New Hampshire primary campaign is providing a preview of the ultimate contest. So far, it's not looking so good for the Republicans. 
 On Saturday night, ABC News held back-to-back debates among the candidates for each party's nomination. The contrasts were vivid. 
 The six Republicans, who came first, were a study in grays, hunched over their desks like the officers of some restricted men's lodge. The only signs of life came when they all poured disdain on Mitt Romney -- Iowa's big spender and big loser -- or Ron Paul, who is so far behind in the polls we wondered why they bothered.
 Then came the four Democrats: the woman, the African-American, the Hispanic American, the coiffed Southern lawyer. They seemed younger, livelier and clearly to be living in 21st-century America.
 The Republicans sounded as if they were reading old copy from Ronald Reagan's debate book. They reminded us of Senator John McCain's quip during a visit to The Times when we asked why none of his party's candidates wanted to be seen as George W. Bush's heir. ''We're all still trying to be Reagan's heir,'' he said.
 On domestic policy, the Republicans offered trickle-down bromides, with the exception of Mr. Paul, who wants to scrap the tax code. The others touted the power of tax cuts to boost the economy, an odd dissonance when Americans see economic woes all around them. They spoke reverently of unregulated business, when Americans know the Bush administration's failures to regulate are at the root of the mortgage crisis that is driving the economy toward recession and are the reason they have to worry about lead in their children's toys and poison in pet food. 
 The Democrats fell over each other proclaiming their opposition to continuing those tax cuts. Unlike the Republicans, who never mentioned it, the Democrats took on the mortgage crisis, saying it demonstrated the need to regulate the banks that made irresponsible loans and the investment firms that profited from them.
 Except again for Mr. Paul, the Republicans tried to outbid the others' commitment to staying the course in Iraq. That included Mike Huckabee, who defended his criticism of Mr. Bush's foreign policy as ''arrogant,'' but offered no new ideas on how to manage Mr. Bush's arrogantly mismanaged war. We hardly expected calls for withdrawal, but none of the five who support the war offered the slightest sense of how to achieve the victory they said they wanted.
 The four Democrats debated ideas for ending the war, a service to American voters who overwhelmingly want it to end. Hillary Clinton, struggling for purchase against Barack Obama, who now owns the ''change agent'' mantle, came to life over this issue. She called for withdrawal but sensibly said it must be done carefully, and that Americans have to accept the consequences.
 It is too soon, in our view, to call either nominating contest, much less the fall election. But in a year in which voters are fed up with Washington (even Mr. McCain said on Sunday that his base was disillusioned), the Republicans have a long way to go to grasp the mood of the electorate in this 21st-century election.

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Less Spark for Bill Clinton

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH; Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.H. 

 BODY:
Is this what it would have been like had Elvis been reduced to playing Reno?
 Former President Bill Clinton has been drawing sleepy and sometimes smallish crowds at big venues in the state that revived his presidential campaign in 1992. He entered to polite applause and rows of empty seats at the University of New Hampshire on Friday. Several people filed out midspeech, and the room was largely quiet as he spoke, with few interruptions for laughter or applause. He talked about his administration, his foundation work and some about his wife. 
 ''Hillary's got good plans,'' Mr. Clinton kept saying as he worked through a hoarse-voiced litany of why his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, is a ''world-class change agent.'' He urged his audience to ''caucus'' on Tuesday for Mrs. Clinton, before correcting himself (''vote''). He took questions, quickly worked a rope line and left. 
 Maybe the sluggish day was a blip. It was, in fairness, the day after Mrs. Clinton finished third in the Iowa caucuses, behind Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and John Edwards of North Carolina. Mr. Clinton was working on 30 minutes' sleep. He traveled to New Hampshire from Iowa in the wee hours, and the university was on winter break. 
 But there was a similarly listless aura at the previous stop, in Rochester. And again, on Saturday in Bow, at just the sort of high school gym that the master campaigner used to blow out. Only 175 showed up in Bow -- about one-third the capacity of the room -- to hear Mr. Clinton hit his bullet points on the subprime lending crisis, $100 barrels of oil and how ''10 of Hillary's fellow senators have endorsed her.''
 ''The crowd seemed very passive,'' Arthur Cunningham of Bow said after the speech. ''Maybe they were tired.'' 
 Since Mrs. Clinton's performance in Iowa last week, one of the more intriguing narratives around her campaign has been the ''Bill to the Rescue'' conceit.
 People with ties to the campaign said Mr. Clinton has been increasingly engaged in strategy, talking regularly to James Carville, one of the chief architects of his 1992 campaign. Mr. Carville said that he spoke ''periodically'' with Mr. Clinton and that they remained close friends. 
 Publicly, the former president seems determined to lower his wattage, to eliminate any hint that he might be the headliner. Mr. Clinton speaks fast, in a conversational voice, somewhat ill-suited to the large rooms that the campaign has arranged for him.
 ''I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Hillary,'' Mr. Clinton said in Durham, ''and then when I'm done, I'm going to saddle back to this Democratic dinner, where I'm going to sit in the audience and clap for her.''
 Mr. Clinton's practiced self-deflation on the stump reflects something of a split within the campaign over how best to use him, campaign advisers say. There is a feeling among one faction that he was overexposed in Iowa, and that his presence became a distraction. 
 But there is also a belief, advisers say, that Mr. Clinton has a special relationship with New Hampshire, and that with his history in the state and his enduring popularity, he can be particularly effective there. 
 Mr. Clinton always had the knack for pumping out the sunshine on dark days. Few were darker than what he faced here, in 1992, during the left-for-dead stage of his first presidential campaign. 
 Against all odds and scandal, Mr. Clinton started attracting big and boisterous crowds. To this day, he waxes nostalgic about an appearance he made that winter in Keene, at which 400 people showed up -- 250 more than expected. ''I thought, I might actually win this election,'' Mr. Clinton said during a return to Keene last summer.
 Mr. Clinton managed a surprising second-place finish that year in the New Hampshire primary, behind Paul E. Tsongas. He called himself ''the Comeback Kid,'' the news media ran with it, and the Clinton era began. 
 Sixteen years later, Mr. Clinton is back in New Hampshire, in the service of his wife's hobbled campaign and extending the era.
 ''New Hampshire affords him the opportunity to return to his campaign roots,'' said Skip Rutherford, a longtime friend of the Clintons who worked on the 1992 campaign and is now the dean of the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. ''It reminds him of home, in that he has the chance to engage in that very personal brand of politics, meeting every voter until that last dog dies.'' 
 But it is more complicated this time than Mr. Clinton being irrepressible, shaking every hand and willing his wife to victory. He is not the candidate this time; instead, he is the statesman-surrogate-spouse, who operates without the crowd-building resources and advance people that a candidate typically has. 
 ''Expectations need to be scaled accordingly,'' said Joshua King, a veteran of political stagecraft who served as director of production in the Clinton White House.
 Still, unlike other candidates' spouses, Mr. Clinton will always bring rock star expectations. ''At first it's disorienting to see him anywhere that isn't the center,'' said Ted Widmer, a former speechwriter in the Clinton White House who is now a historian at Brown University.
 Mr. Clinton's presence is at the heart of the tricky two-step that Mrs. Clinton's campaign has been trying with mixed success -- to convince voters that it is wise to reach into the past to change the future; that these old familiar faces can convincingly sell a ''new beginning.
 As such, campaign advisers said, the riddle of ''What to do with Bill'' has perplexed Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, just as it did Al Gore's in 2000. 
 ''On strategic level, I think he's been very effective in that campaign,'' said Mr. Rutherford, citing behind-the-scenes contributions like making fundraising calls.
 But in more public roles, Mr. Clinton's challenge has been greater. Let Bill be Bill, and risk him outshining the candidate. 
 From time to time, Mr. Clinton has generated the wrong kind of attention, like when he said in Iowa that he had been against the invasion of Iraq from the beginning, a statement that did not seem to be in line with his public utterances at the time. But for the most part, his presentation is very much consistent with the campaign's message -- that Mrs. Clinton is best equipped to bring change because she has spent her entire career doing so. 
 Sheryl Crow's ''A Change Would Do You Good'' plays over a loudspeaker before Mr. Clinton's arrival. The song is, in a sense, the consummate Clinton anthem of the early 21st century, just as Fleetwood Mac's ''Don't Stop'' was to the late 20th century. It is a throwback song, originating in the 1990s, that pounds home the refrain of ''change,'' over and over.
 Politicians, none more so than Mr. Clinton, say they reap energy from big crowds. And when the former president finally drew a big one -- a boisterous 1,000 at a high school Saturday in Amherst -- he was buoyed, briefly. ''There's more than twice as many people here as we thought would be here,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And that's a good sign.'' 
 One of the more striking episodes of Mr. Clinton's return to New Hampshire occurred Friday at the end of his appearance at the University of New Hampshire. A woman voiced frustration to him about the ''game'' of candidates attacking each other. 
 ''Why not just change the game?'' said the woman, Carrie Sheridan of Guilford, Conn. She was paraphrasing a line from Mr. Obama, whom she said she would likely support.
 Mr. Clinton replied that in a survey of talk radio hosts, he and Mrs. Clinton scored one and two on a list of figures who are ''most vilified'' -- even higher, he noted, than Saddam Hussein.
 ''No one would like it better to end the vilification than me and Hillary,'' he said, adding that they were vilified during their eight years in the White House.
 The line scored scattered applause. But it also served as a reminder, fairly or not, of all the bitterness that the Clintons came to represent in the 1990s. 
 Mr. Clinton is, to be sure, effective and persuasive.
 ''I was leaning towards John Edwards,'' said Rick Lamontagne of Durham. ''But after hearing the president, I'd say I'm undecided again.''
 ''One thing I'm certain of,'' he added, ''I wish Bill were running again.''

HEADLINE: A Tax Scare at the Garden, Among Other Worries

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
These are not halcyon days for Madison Square Garden. The Knicks are rapidly affirming their place as the most uninspired team in basketball. Their coach, Isiah Thomas, is greeted nightly by a chorus of boos.
 And back-to-back sexual harassment lawsuits, one played out in sordid detail in a Manhattan courtroom before ending in an $11.5 million judgment, have made the once-proud arena, which owns the Knicks, and its chairman, James L. Dolan, easy targets for the tabloids -- and for City Hall. 
 For the third time in five years, the City Council is considering a resolution calling on the State Legislature to end the Koch-era exemptions that, since 1982, have freed the arena from paying city property taxes, estimated at $11 million to $12 million a year.
 City Council members pushed identical resolutions in 2003 and 2005. But without the support of the Council's speaker at the time, Gifford Miller, neither came to a vote. Things are different this year. 
 The Knicks, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Dolan are at a nadir in popularity. The city's budget writers are forecasting a downturn in the economy. And more important, the tax-exemption proposal, for the first time, has the support of the city's top two officials: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Miller's successor as speaker, Christine C. Quinn. 
 The Council's Finance Committee will hold its first hearing on the new resolution on Monday. But some council members have already made their feelings clear. At a full Council meeting last month, two members prominently displayed ''Fire Isiah!'' signs on the front panels of their desks. They might as well have read, ''End the giveaway.'' 
 ''I just think clearly the Garden has lost its direction,'' said Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr., a Democrat from Queens, and one of the two council members who posted the signs. ''Management is not connected to the needs of the city anymore.'' 
 The resolution, if it passes the full Council, would have to be followed by legislation in Albany, where Cablevision, the politically savvy owner of the Garden, has had a powerful ally in the past in the Assembly's speaker, Sheldon Silver. In 2005, Mr. Silver helped Cablevision quash Mr. Bloomberg's plan to build a stadium for the New York Jets on the West Side that the Garden viewed as potential competition. Mr. Silver's former chief of staff Patricia Lynch is among the high-powered lobbyists Cablevision has hired to stop the new resolution. 
 Mr. Silver's office declined to comment on the tax-exemption issue until the City Council's resolution is put before him. 
 Although council members say they would never tie their tax fight to the Knicks' performance on the court -- the team's 8-24 record is the third worst in the National Basketball Association -- the Garden's battered corporate reputation has not helped its cause.
 In addition to the sexual harassment suits -- one by a former Knicks executive that led to the $11.5 million judgment, and another by an ex-cheerleader for the New York Rangers who settled out of court -- The Daily News recently hammered the arena for charging the city $110,000, including $4,000 for confetti, to hold the police academy's graduation ceremonies. (Garden officials say that the services were provided at cost and that they made no profit.) 
 ''I'm not going to be so flippant as to say that the fact the Knicks have absolutely stunk up the basketball court is a reason to get rid of their tax exemption,'' said Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, one of the proposal's sponsors. ''But I think certainly the manner in which they've conducted their business otherwise has certainly left people feeling less than warm and fuzzy for them.'' 
 He added, ''It has perhaps created an environment in which people are willing to pile on.'' 
 The Garden negotiated its current tax deal when the city's morale was in the depths. Crime was high. The 1970s fiscal crisis was fresh on the public's mind. And the Garden, then a subsidiary of the Gulf and Western Corporation, was threatening to move the Knicks and the Rangers, the National Hockey League franchise that it also owns, out of the city to escape high tax, labor and energy costs. 
 Edward I. Koch, who was mayor at the time, said he believed that the exemptions would end after 10 years. Instead, the State Legislature, which granted the exemptions, kept the breaks in place for as long as the Knicks and the Rangers continued to play their home games at the Garden. 
 Mr. Koch has long since said the exemptions should end. 
 ''I doubt the teams would leave now,'' Mr. Koch said, ''even without the tax breaks.''
 The Garden's officials are trying to compare their deal with those recently granted to the Yankees and the Mets for their new stadiums and to the New Jersey Nets for an arena that will bring the team to Brooklyn. Those publicly owned venues, built by the teams or developers and leased back to them, will not be subject to property taxes either. Instead, the city will get annual payments in lieu of taxes, but that money will be used to pay off the tax-free bonds that are financing the projects instead of going into the general fund. 
 According to figures that the Garden plans to present at the Council hearing on Monday, the Yankees, Mets and Nets deals amount to nearly $1.4 billion in government subsidies over 40 years, including $230 million in property tax exemptions. Those numbers are drawn from estimates made by the city's Independent Budget Office, and do not include subsidies for a Metro-North station and parking garages to be built at the new Yankee Stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2009. 
 Officials at the Garden say they have reached out to the mayor for support and plan more discussions with him. In a statement, the Garden singled out Ms. Quinn. 
 ''With a more than $50 billion city annual operating budget, it is strange that Speaker Quinn would focus on M.S.G.'s abatement, which pales in comparison to the more than a billion dollars in benefits recently granted to all other pro sports teams in New York City,'' Barry Watkins, a Garden spokesman, said. 
 Ms. Quinn said the Garden was disingenuous to compare its deals with those of the other teams. 
 The Garden's ''tax break was given back in the 1980s to keep the teams from leaving, not as part of an expansion'' or new construction, Ms. Quinn said. 
 Ms. Quinn and Mr. Fidler said they did not want to be unfair to the Garden, which is considering building a new arena across Eighth Avenue from the current arena site. If that happens, they said, the Garden would be welcome to negotiate new incentives.
 But, Ms. Quinn said, after more than two decades, ''we have more than appropriately compensated them for staying in the city.''

HEADLINE: Iowa Caucus Results Put Pressure on Black Leaders for Endorsements

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Before the Iowa caucus returns were in on Thursday, the phones started ringing in the home of Fletcher N. Smith Jr., a black state legislator from Greenville, S.C. Like other black leaders, Mr. Smith finds himself being courted so assiduously by the campaigns of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama that he said he had thought, ''Gosh, maybe I should run for president.''
 In New York, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights advocate, said he was called all Thursday night by ''either the candidate themselves or someone high up in the top three campaigns'' suggesting he make up his mind. And Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio, who is active in the Clinton campaign, quickly put in a call to another black politician -- and fellow Delta Sigma Theta sorority member -- whose candidate had just dropped out.
 Mr. Obama's eight-point victory margin in overwhelmingly white Iowa changed the landscape of the presidential campaign, whittling away at doubts that a black candidate could be elected. In so doing, it has reinvigorated the scramble by the campaigns to win over uncommitted black leaders, shore up allegiances and, in the case of Mrs. Clinton in particular, fend off the possibility of black supporters defecting to the Obama camp. 
 Advisers to Mrs. Clinton and former Senator John Edwards played down any effects from Mr. Obama's victory in Iowa. But one prominent black supporter of Mr. Obama, Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, called this moment ''a very precarious time for the Clinton campaign.''
 ''For black elected officials who either stayed out of this race or have supported Senator Clinton, they're in a very dicey position right now,'' Mr. Davis said, ''because their black constituents are about to move overwhelmingly toward Barack Obama.'' Outright defections may be unlikely, he said, but he predicted some black Clinton supporters would become ''magically unavailable when the Clinton campaign calls them.''
 Asked whether he agreed with that assessment, Mr. Smith, the state legislator from South Carolina who had been supporting Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware until he ended his campaign after losing in Iowa, said, ''I'm not going to turn my back on the Joe Bidens or the Hillary Clintons or the Joe Liebermans of this world simply because they're white and we have a black candidate running.''
 Black leaders, like black voters, have been split in their support for the candidates. The Congressional Black Caucus is divided roughly evenly between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. A few members are backing Mr. Edwards, and a few remain uncommitted, including the chairwoman, Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, as well as Representatives Maxine Waters of California and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House leadership.
 Families, too, are split: the Rev. Jesse Jackson has endorsed Mr. Obama (though he has not been uncritical), and his son, Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., is a national co-chairman for the Obama campaign. But the wife of the elder Mr. Jackson is backing Mrs. Clinton. 
 Many younger black leaders like Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and Mayor Cory Booker of Newark are active in Mr. Obama's campaign. But other black officials have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards for reasons that have included Mr. Obama's inexperience, doubts about his electability and, for some, longtime ties to Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. 
 ''Hillary has great affection among African-Americans,'' the elder Mr. Jackson said. ''My wife has known Hillary more than 20 years. Her work with the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, legal assistance for the poor -- these are fairly strong ties. Most people I know are in this kind of one-two posture: Barack one, Hillary two. Hillary one, Barack two. It's not a hostile decision that many people have made.''
 But Mr. Jackson's son said the historic nature of Mr. Obama's candidacy meant that black leaders would have to ask themselves, ''Where were we? And what do we tell our children?'' Then he added, ''What's the answer? That 'I had a longstanding political commitment and a deal that dates back to when a road was built for me down the street and I got some sidewalks?'''
 In South Carolina, which will hold its primary on Jan. 26, Leon Howard, chairman of the South Carolina black legislative caucus and an Edwards adviser, said he got on the phone around 11 p.m. Thursday and began calling colleagues who had backed Mr. Biden and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who also dropped out of the race after Iowa. Mr. Howard focused on legislators from rural areas where he said there was a need for infrastructure, like trauma hospitals, that a candidate might promise to address and where Mr. Edwards had campaigned heavily.
 Mr. Smith, the Biden supporter, was watching the election returns in his living room with his wife and son, who are Obama supporters. (His other son, a student at Yale Law School, is supporting Mrs. Clinton.) He got his first call of the evening from an upstate South Carolina coordinator for the Obama campaign. Then came one from a fellow state representative from Spartanburg who is working for Mrs. Clinton.
 ''I told him, 'Your candidate will have to call me first before I make any kind of commitment to support her,''' Mr. Smith recalled. The Obama emissary got the same response. The following day brought two more calls from two other Clinton campaign members who, Mr. Smith said, said they would arrange for Mrs. Clinton to call him after the New Hampshire primary and meet with him in South Carolina.
 Mr. Smith, whose legislative district is 52 percent black and 48 percent white, describes himself as a believer in ''strong national defense'' and progressive social policy at home. A former political coordinator for the campaign of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut in the 2004 South Carolina Democratic primary, he said the potentially historic nature of Mr. Obama's campaign swayed him no more than that of Mrs. Clinton's.
 ''We're going to make history as Democrats one way or another,'' he said, adding: ''To me, it's not a question of race. It's a question of who's going to be the one to unify the country. I think that both of those candidates have the potential of doing it in a very dignified, professional way. I'm not going to vote for Senator Obama simply because he is a black candidate who happens to be the front runner.''
 Mr. Sharpton said he was holding out for ''specific commitments'' on things like reform of the criminal justice system and what kind of attorney general would be appointed. 
 He added, ''The head tells us, 'Look, we've got serious problems: Health care disparities, the economy, the criminal justice system.' That's your head. Your heart is saying, 'We can make history, we can have the first black nominee, let's go for it.' At the end of the day, if you just go with making a statement of history and not deal with the problems, what happens the next time you ask the troops to rally?''
 Several black elected officials backing Mrs. Clinton, and some backing Mr. Obama, said they did not expect to see leaders who had endorsed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards abandoning those campaigns. Ms. Tubbs Jones, who represents suburbs and areas of Cleveland in Congress, first endorsed Bill Clinton in 1992, has worked with Mrs. Clinton, and decided to back her more than a year before Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy.
 ''In politics, we all understand that the only thing you have is your word,'' Ms.Tubbs Jones said in an interview. ''You make a commitment to a person and you stick with them through thick and thin. My commitment is thick, and I'm in there for the long run.''

HEADLINE: After New Hampshire, A Rapidly Changing Race

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
This week New Hampshire becomes the gateway to a new political world, one that will engage multiple constituencies, play out over a vast terrain and shift the psychology of the competition.
 As the 2008 presidential campaign moves toward nominating contests in Florida, Michigan, Nevada and South Carolina, and then half the country on Feb. 5, the simplicity and careful planning of Iowa and New Hampshire will give way to a complex, high-velocity game of ''Survivor.'' The transformation begins here on Tuesday with the nation's first primary, when candidates and their advisers will sift exit polls in the early evening hours and confront their altered prospects.
 Even those who win will find it jarring. Around 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 1, 2000, in a hotel suite in Nashua, N.H., Senator John McCain of Arizona studied exit polls showing that he had routed George W. Bush and found himself face to face with his White House dream. 
 ''It was no longer fun for him at that precise moment,'' recalled John Weaver, Mr. McCain's strategist in that campaign. ''Mentally, it's tough for the candidate and the staff. You know, all of a sudden you're playing on a magnified stage. That adds a tremendous amount of pressure.''
 Different Blocs
 After courting mostly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic candidates will compete for Latinos in Nevada and blacks in South Carolina and the rest of the South. That heralds an increased focus on bread-and-butter economics and decreased attention to more esoteric discussions of political reform. 
 ''More church visits, more plant visits,'' says Donna Brazile, an African-American strategist who managed Al Gore's 2000 campaign. 
 The black vote represents an appreciating asset for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, so long as his campaign appears robust. A question facing Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, in Nevada and in the Western states that vote Feb. 5, is whether she can hold the formidable Hispanic support that she has marshaled so far. In California, Asian-Americans represent another wild card. 
 The Republican primary electorate grows more variegated as well, with the Irish, Italian and Polish ''Reagan Democrats'' of major cities like Detroit; Arab-Americans in Dearborn, Mich.; and Cuban immigrants in Miami. 
 More than the campaign's opening chapter, this phase rewards nimble candidates and magnifies mistakes.
 ''The mindset changes from the hard-core activists who pay attention to every nitty-gritty detail,'' said Karl Rove, President Bush's top strategist in 2000 and 2004, to people who ''are going on the skimpiest information. Every word you utter matters.''
 Broader Battleground
 The scale of the new battlefield represents an immense logistical, financial and management challenge. Not even the best-financed campaign has the time or the money to visit or advertise in the scores of media markets involved in the contest through Feb. 5; there are 35 markets alone in California, Florida and Michigan.
 But the compressed nomination calendar does offer pockets of relative advantage for candidates to capitalize on.
 If Southerners like former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina can stay alive, Feb. 5 offers contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia. 
 For Mr. McCain and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, there are votes in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico. For Mrs. Clinton, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, there are contests in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.
 ''There's going to have to be a lot of tarmac campaigning,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist. And where candidates cannot afford mass-market television time, radio stations catering to black listeners and Spanish-language cable television channels offer targeted and inexpensive alternatives.
 The Mental Toll
 Winning the psychological battle may be hardest of all. Candidates struggle to hang on while they contemplate the end of their careers. Staff members fear losing their jobs. Donors worry about throwing away good money. 
 ''There's a tremendous amount of personal insecurity,'' said Tom Rath, a Republican operative in New Hampshire who is backing Mr. Romney.
 But, said Carter Eskew, a longtime adviser to Mr. Gore who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, there is a long haul between Tuesday and Feb. 5. ''Once you get out of Iowa and New Hampshire,'' he said, ''you end the protest phase, and you start to enter a phase where people say, 'This is decisive.'''

HEADLINE: President Mike Huckabee?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM KRISTOL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
 Thank you, Senator Obama. You've defeated Senator Clinton in Iowa. It looks as if you're about to beat her in New Hampshire. There will be no Clinton Restoration. A nation turns its grateful eyes to you.
 But gratitude for sparing us a third Clinton term only goes so far. Who, inquiring minds want to know, is going to spare us a first Obama term? After all, for all his ability and charm, Barack Obama is still a liberal Democrat. Some of us would much prefer a non-liberal and non-Democratic administration. We don't want to increase the scope of the nanny state, we don't want to undo the good done by the appointments of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, and we really don't want to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory in Iraq. 
 For me, therefore, the most interesting moment in Saturday night's Republican debate at St. Anselm College was when the candidates were asked what arguments they would make if they found themselves running against Obama in the general election.
 The best answer came, not surprisingly, from the best Republican campaigner so far -- Mike Huckabee. He began by calmly mentioning his and Obama's contrasting views on issues from guns to life to same-sex marriage. This served to remind Republicans that these contrasts have been central to G.O.P. success over the last quarter-century, and to suggest that Huckabee could credibly and comfortably make the socially conservative case in an electorally advantageous way.
 Huckabee went on to pay tribute to Obama for his ability ''to touch at the core of something Americans want'' in seeming to move beyond partisanship. And, he added, Senator Obama is ''a likable person who has excited people about wanting to vote who have not voted in the past.'' Huckabee was of course aware that in praising Obama he was recommending himself
 I was watching the debate at the home of a savvy, moderately conservative New Hampshire Republican. It was at this moment that he turned to me and said: ''You know, I've been a huge skeptic about Huckabee. I'm still not voting for him Tuesday. But I've got to say -- I like him. And I wonder -- could he be our strongest nominee?'' 
 He could be. After the last two elections, featuring the well-born George Bush and Al Gore and John Kerry, Americans -- even Republicans! -- are ready for a likable regular guy. Huckabee seems to be that. He came up from modest origins. He served as governor of Arkansas for more than a decade. He fought a successful battle against being overweight. These may not be utterly compelling qualifications for the presidency. I'm certainly not ready to sign up. 
 Still, as the conservative writer Michael Medved put it, ''For the work-hard-to-get-ahead strivers who represent the heart and soul of the G.O.P., there are obvious, powerful points of identification.'' And they speak to younger voters who are not yet committed to the G.O.P. In Iowa, Huckabee did something like what Obama did on the Democratic side, albeit on a smaller scale. He drew new voters to the caucuses. And he defeated Mitt Romney by almost two to one, and John McCain by better than four to one, among voters under 45.
 Now it's true that many conservatives have serious doubts about Huckabee's positions, especially on foreign policy, and his record, particularly on taxes. The conservative establishment is strikingly hostile to Huckabee -- for both good and bad reasons. But voters seem to be enjoying making up their own minds this year. And Huckabee is a talented politician.
 His campaigning in New Hampshire has been impressive. At a Friday night event at New England College in Henniker, he played bass with a local rock band, Mama Kicks. One secular New Hampshire Republican's reaction: ''Gee, he's not some kind of crazy Christian. He's an ordinary American.''
 In general, here in New Hampshire he's emphasized social issues far less than in Iowa (though he doesn't waffle when asked about them). Instead he's stressed conservative economic themes, seamlessly (if somewhat inconsistently) weaving together a pitch for limited government with a message that government needs to do more to address the concerns of the struggling middle class. This latter point seems to be resonating, as headlines in local papers announce an increase in the national unemployment rate amid speculation about a coming recession.
 Some Democrats are licking their chops at the prospect of a Huckabee nomination. They shouldn't be. For one thing, Michael Bloomberg would be tempted to run in the event of an Obama-Huckabee race -- and he would most likely take votes primarily from Obama. But whatever Bloomberg does, the fact is that the Republican establishment spent 2007 underestimating Mike Huckabee. If Huckabee does win the nomination, it would be amusing if Democrats made the same mistake in 2008.

HEADLINE: A Safety-Net Hospital Falls Into Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and KEVIN SACK. 
ONLINE: Additional photographs and an audio report by Shaila Dewan on Grady Memorial Hospital. nytimes.com/national

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Pamela Vaughn is a Grady baby.
 Like tens of thousands of Atlantans over the last 115 years -- like Gladys Knight, the soul singer, and Vernon Jordan Jr., the presidential confidante; like more than one in three babies born here in the last decade -- Ms. Vaughn entered the world at Grady Memorial Hospital, one of the nation's largest safety-net hospitals. 
 Ms. Vaughn was not only born at Grady, she also works there, as a senior nurse in the diabetes clinic, where many of her patients are Grady babies, too. And now, like thousands of other Atlantans, she is hoping to save the teeming charity hospital that has provided her with both life and livelihood.
 To generations of Georgians, this city is unimaginable without Grady. Yet that has been the prospect facing the region for the last year, the result of a multimillion-dollar shortfall in the cost of providing charity and emergency care that no one -- not the counties, the state nor the federal government -- has been willing to cover, though Grady provides vital services to the entire region. 
 Once admired for its skill in treating a population afflicted by both social and physical ills, Grady, a teaching hospital, now faces the prospect of losing its accreditation. Only short-term financial transfusions have kept it from closing its doors, as Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Los Angeles County did last year. That scenario would flood the region's other hospitals with uninsured patients and eliminate the training ground for one of every four Georgia doctors.
 Ms. Vaughn feels the strain when she has to counsel 20 patients in a day, twice as many as she did only five years ago. Or when she has to tell diabetics at risk of blindness that it might take four months to get an eye appointment. ''It makes me sad,'' she says, ''that I'm a Grady baby and we have to go through all of this.''
 Although the hospital is unique in many ways, the code red at Grady is emblematic of the crippling effect America's health care crisis has had on public hospitals around the nation. Though Grady is among the most distressed of the country's 1,300 public hospitals, others have faced similar challenges in recent years, including those in Miami, Memphis and Chicago, said Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems. There are 300 fewer public hospitals today than 15 years ago, with hospitals having closed in Los Angeles, Washington, St. Louis and Milwaukee, Mr. Gage said.
 Dr. Carlos Del Rio, Grady's chief of medicine, calls the hospital ''the canary in the coal mine.''
 Like other public hospitals, Grady is operating on a business model that is no longer sustainable. A third of the hospital's patients, including those treated as outpatients, are uninsured, among them a rapidly growing group of immigrants. Another third are covered by Medicaid, which reimburses at rates well below Grady's actual costs. Many hospitals use their privately insured patients to subsidize indigent care, but at Grady, only 8 percent of inpatients fit the privately insured category.
 In large part, that is because in Atlanta, as in most other cities, better-financed private and nonprofit hospitals are able to market their services and high-tech equipment to patients with good insurance coverage, including those on Medicare, leaving Grady with little but those it was intended to help: the under-insured and those without insurance at all. The National Association of Public Hospitals says its members account for 2 percent of all hospitals, but provide 25 percent of the nation's uncompensated care.
 Over the years, the cost of caring for the uninsured and underinsured has grown while taxpayer support has stagnated. Suburban counties have declined to pay a share of those costs, though their residents regularly wind up in Grady's emergency room and its highly regarded centers for burn and poison treatment. Management problems within the hospital have played a role, and community pressure has kept Grady's politically appointed board from making deep cuts. As a result, the hospital has faced deficits for 10 of the last 11 years.
 It can no longer do so. This fiscal year's budget gap is projected to hit $53 million. Emory University and Morehouse College, whose medical schools supply the hospital's doctors and are its biggest creditors, are owed an accumulated $71 million and have threatened to bolt. 
 Grady officials estimate it would take $366 million to meet long-ignored capital needs, like replacing quarter-century-old beds, antiquated computers, and the trauma ward X-ray machine, which conked out two years ago. Department chiefs predict a growing difficulty in recruiting physicians and residents.
 And despite the efforts of the hospital's passionately committed staff, patient care is clearly suffering. There are interminable waits for appointments, some services have been discontinued and the hospital ranks below average on safety measures like preventing bed sores, infections, and even death in low-risk procedures. One study, for example, ranks Grady nearly dead last in the nation in following standards for treating pneumonia.
 The hospital, sandwiched between downtown and the neighborhood where Martin Luther King Jr. was born, was the place where victims of the 1996 Olympics bombings and countless other disasters have been treated. It is so intrinsic to the city's identity that Maynard H. Jackson Jr., the first black mayor, liked to say that Grady babies should be allowed to vote twice. 
 But Grady's value is more than sentimental -- it is essential to the region's health. With 675 beds and 16 operating rooms, the hospital handles more than 850,000 outpatient visits a year and admits more than 30,000 inpatients. It is home to the only Level 1 trauma center in north Georgia and the city's only emergency ambulance fleet. It has one of the country's largest AIDS clinics, a dialysis unit and a 24-hour emergency center for sickle cell anemia. 
 All are now at risk.
 The prospects that Grady could close, and that Atlanta's health infrastructure could crumble, have forced a civic re-examination of the region's commitment to its least fortunate, a reckoning that has revived old antagonisms over race, power and class.
 Virtually every aspect of Grady's operations has come under scrutiny: its nine neighborhood clinics, its subsidized pharmacy, its care for Atlanta's growing population of illegal immigrants, even its 60-year-old governance structure. Some have suggested that Grady must compete for paying customers in Atlanta's fierce medical marketplace, while others say that taxpayers should contribute more to continue its mission. Will Grady outsource, or simply downsize? And if it must downsize, which patients should be turned away?
 ''Grady is that last resort,'' said Sandra Crayton, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Health Care Industry Group, one in a long line of consulting firms hired to help the hospital bail itself out. ''The board has a very difficult, and in some cases nearly impossible, balancing act. It's sort of like Solomon and the baby. What are you going to do?''
 A Patchwork of Care
 The patient in Trauma 3 was a Grady baby, though no one could have guessed it when the ambulance pulled in at 1 a.m. that Saturday.
 He beat considerable odds by being white, and from suburban Cobb County, where most folks give Grady little thought until they need a surgeon in the middle of the night. 
 The bearded, middle-aged man was bleeding from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the left side of his chest. ''Don't let me go out in pain,'' he moaned in a drawl to the doctors and nurses treating his injury. ''I was born at this hospital.''
 Grady's chief of emergency medicine, Dr. Leon L. Haley Jr., smiled slightly: ''Well, tonight, he's not going to die at this hospital.'' And so the creaky but miraculously effective patchwork of an emergency room jolted into action. 
 The ER did not have a working X-ray machine that night, so doctors had to roll in a portable one to locate the bullet. The X-rays were produced on film rather than digitally, causing a 10-minute delay in diagnosis. There were gurneys without wheels, and a computer system so outdated that doctors had to call up four separate programs to compile records on a single patient. 
 But six days later, the patient was discharged in good condition.
 ''We've gotten really good at MacGyvering,'' said Dr. Philip H. Shayne, an emergency room physician. ''We use paper clips for a lot of stuff.'' 
 That may no longer be good enough. On any given day, a patient taken to Grady's storied emergency room, or to any other unit in the hospital, may still receive care as good as any in the city. But the signs of stress are everywhere, in overworked staff, in broken equipment, in outmoded systems.
 Last month, the Joint Commission, the country's leading health care accrediting agency, raised serious concerns about Grady's status after observing numerous significant shortcomings during a five-day inspection. Although the commission has not yet released a public report, hospital officials, speaking anonymously, said the commission's concerns included broken equipment, sanitation and the adequacy of staff supervision. 
 Those foreboding findings came only two years after the federal government threatened to deny Grady Medicaid payments because the hospital sometimes waited nearly two years to conduct reviews of patient deaths. That problem has been resolved, hospital officials say.
 But an analysis of hospital standards by Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, ranked Grady in the lowest fifth of all hospitals in the treatment of heart attacks in 2006, the lowest tenth for heart failure and in the lowest 1 percent for pneumonia. The hospital also lagged when compared with its inner-city peers.
 Other quality indexes, including one compiled by the Georgia Hospital Association, rank Grady well below the state averages for all hospitals and for those of similar size.
 The hospital's burden is most visible in the emergency room, where the hallways that recent night, as most nights, were chockablock with stretchers -- one man, shackled to his gurney, writhing through an acid trip; a woman fighting seizures; asthma patients sucking down oxygen. Their comings and goings -- more than 300 a day -- are tracked in doctors' script on a greaseboard, a relic rarely seen in an age of big electronic screens. Because of crowding, it can take 24 hours to move a patient to intensive care, Dr. Haley said. 
 Elsewhere in the hospital, there are long waits in the pharmacy. The equipment for cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging breaks with regularity. Because Grady often cannot pay suppliers on time, there have been temporary shortages of essentials like neck braces, electrodes and even saline.
 A third of the ambulances need to be put out of their misery, said Astria L. Benton, a paramedic supervisor. Every week or so, a vehicle simply gives out while in transit, and Ms. Benton prays that the patient will not die before she can orchestrate a rescue.
 ''No one wants to talk about it,'' she said, ''but it could happen.'' 
 The orthopedic department has a waiting list for elective procedures that one doctor quantified as ''infinity.'' Its doctors intermittently instruct other departments to not send them patients. That has been a particular problem for certain AIDS patients, who find themselves in wheelchairs because they cannot get needed hip replacements. 
 Ophthalmology was among the hardest hit departments in a recent employee buyout, losing 60 percent of its staff, including several experienced nurses, said Dr. Geoffrey Broocker, the department chief.
 Dr. Curtis Lewis, the hospital's chief medical officer, said in an interview that the quality of care at Grady has ''not declined to the point of danger.'' But, Dr. Lewis added: ''It would be naive to believe that hospitals that have more resources can't do more than those that don't.''
 Dr. Lewis and the hospital's general counsel, Timothy Jefferson, said the hospital had not been sued for malpractice in a case that related directly to inadequate resources. But a review of recent filings found several cases in which staffing appears to have been an issue.
 A lawsuit filed by the family of a 23-year-old man who died after suffering a brain injury in a 2004 skateboarding accident claims that for more than 12 hours he was seen only by medical residents -- doctors being trained in a specialty -- even as his condition worsened. The hospital is close to settling the case. 
 In 2006, a 27-year-old teacher who survived a fiery car crash nearly died in intensive care after nurses failed to detect and clear a blockage in his breathing tube, another lawsuit alleges. In a deposition provided by the patient's lawyer, a nurse testified that the intensive care unit for burn victims was short-staffed that day, and that the patient's nurse, who did not normally work in the unit, was caring for three patients instead of the customary two. 
 Finding Someone to Pay
 Michael B. Russell is a Grady baby -- of sorts.
 The son and successor of Herman J. Russell, the city's most prominent black general contractor, he was born in 1965 at the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, which Grady opened across the street in 1952 to serve a growing black middle-class too affluent to qualify for charity care. When integration eroded the demand for such a place, Hughes Spalding evolved, becoming a children's hospital. 
 In April, Mr. Russell was called upon to aid his birthplace. He and A. D. Correll, the chairman emeritus of Georgia-Pacific and an eminence grise of the Atlanta business world, were drafted to lead a task force on Grady formed by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce at the hospital authority's request. 
 That one co-chairman was white and one black was a not-so-subtle attempt to bridge the racial divide that has undermined Grady for decades. Grady's specialties, especially trauma care, are vital to the entire region and draw patients of all races from around the area. But it has long been viewed as a hospital that primarily serves blacks, who comprise 48 percent of the population of Fulton and DeKalb counties. 
 Only those two central Atlanta counties -- and none of their suburban neighbors -- make annual appropriations to the hospital's budget for the care of indigent residents, even though two in 10 Grady inpatients and one in 10 outpatients arrive from other counties, often by ambulance.
 Contributions from the two counties, themselves politically and racially divided, have stayed essentially flat for a decade, even as the population and its percentage of uninsured grew. The county commissions in Fulton and DeKalb have been reluctant to increase their contributions when the state has refused to do so, and when suburban counties will not contribute at all.
 Only the state can force other counties to pony up money for Grady. And the state legislature and the governor's office are controlled by white Republicans, whose core constituents have historically not viewed themselves has having a direct stake in the hospital's future. 
 In the coming session, however, the legislature, which has long viewed Grady as someone else's problem, seems moved by the magnitude of the current crisis to consider providing aid, perhaps by financing a statewide trauma network. Grady lost $42 million on charity care for trauma patients alone in 2005, according to the Georgia Hospital Association.
 Grady's ability to plead for public resources has been compromised over the years by its own actions. 
 There have been charges of corruption and cronyism, most notably in 2005, when a powerful state senator was convicted of using his influence to secure overpriced Grady contracts for his temporary services business.
 Handicapped by staff shortages and anachronistic technology, the hospital's administrative inefficiency is legendary. Over the last three years, one of every five Medicaid reimbursement billings has been kicked back by the state because of filing mistakes, according to the Georgia Department of Human Resources. 
 When the outpatient oncology clinic studied its 2006 billings, it discovered that the paperwork on one in four patients had vanished before Grady could even file for reimbursement, said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, who left as chief of oncology last summer. Grady's system for tracking aging equipment is so outdated it is difficult to anticipate needed replacements.
 The hospital board has long been reluctant to make money-saving changes that might reduce its traditional mission. Late last year, it rejected the advice of financial consultants and its newly hired chief executive to close an expensive outpatient dialysis clinic for the poor, fearing that many of the clinic's uninsured patients, including many illegal immigrants, would have nowhere else to go.
 But the board has also been politically clumsy, and prone to micromanagement. In May the board's own consultants concluded that ''Grady does not currently have the depth of leadership'' necessary to transform the hospital. 
 The Chamber's task force trod more gingerly. ''Grady's problems are nobody's fault,'' said its report, released in June. Yet, it insisted, the board must create a new nonprofit corporation to run the hospital, instead of the public authority that has run it up to now. The change would allow Grady to attract philanthropic dollars, expand into money-making services and remove politics from its day-to-day operations, the task force predicted. Mr. Correll promised at least $200 million in private donations if the nonprofit was formed.
 The task force's involvement was in keeping with ''the Atlanta way,'' the long-standing tradition of bringing together black political power and white business power to address civic problems like segregation and sewer construction. But there was no way to muffle accusations that white business leaders, who see the hospital as vital to the region's growth, were trying to take over one of the city's most prominent black-run institutions. 
 Even after the reorganization was endorsed by Shirley Franklin, Atlanta's influential black Democratic mayor, black board members who supported it were accused by Grady patients and other local black politicians of being ''sell-out Uncle Toms'' and worse. They asserted that the move amounted to privatization and would jeopardize Grady's mission. 
 When the board hesitated to turn over control to the nonprofit corporation without guarantees of increased financing, Republican state lawmakers threatened to change the hospital's governance by legislative fiat. 
 The task force stuck to its guns, insisting the issue was not race but economics. ''We stirred the pot, no question about it,'' Mr. Russell said. ''I hope the old Atlanta way will lead to some degree of progress and we can get Grady on the right footing.'' 
 Finally, in November, the Grady board essentially voted itself out of business, hoping the new nonprofit corporation will begin to overcome the hospital's political troubles. It agreed to do so, however, only with strings attached, demanding that the state and counties pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to Grady. The conditions surprised and angered many of those who had been most supportive of the deal. Dozens of details have yet to be settled, and it is not yet clear how things will be resolved.
 The financial pressure is not likely to subside soon. Grady's share of federal assistance to charity hospitals has shrunk sharply as the state, which distributes the money, has extended it to more hospitals that serve far fewer indigent patients. At the same time, the Bush administration has enacted a new rule that, unless stopped by Congress, will reduce payments to public hospitals by billions of dollars. 
 ''While so many people are helping,'' said Otis L. Story, who was hired in April to be the hospital's fourth chief executive officer in seven years, ''there appear to be opposite pressures pulling us into further financial distress.'' 
 The Last Open Door
 Hillary Estrella Reyes is one of the newest Grady babies.
 Just three days after she was born in late October, she slept in the lee of her mother's hospital bed. Tucked into a bassinet with a knit cap and blanket, she was an oblivious example of the explosion in Hispanic growth in Georgia and at Grady. A third of the hospital's newborns are now children of Hispanic parents. 
 Grady's crisis has not touched Hillary's parents, Patricia and Daniel Reyes, who seemed calm as the nurses wheeled the baby away for a checkup. They paid for prenatal care in $100 installments, and Medicaid will cover the cost of the delivery, because the baby is a citizen.
 But her parents are in the country illegally. Without Grady, families like theirs would face an uncertain future in their new city. Where would they go in case of a serious ailment? And what of Hillary, who was born with an unusually rapid heartbeat? If Grady were to close, her options for care might be severely limited.
 Grady's disappearance is a prospect Mr. Reyes, a janitor, and his wife -- like many of the hundreds of thousands Grady serves -- are unable to visualize. Asked about it, Mr. Reyes could do nothing but shrug. 
 ''I haven't got sick yet,'' he said. ''Thank God.''

HEADLINE: Lax Catheter Policies Seen at Many Hospitals

BYLINE: By ERIC NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
One of the best ways to get an infection in the hospital is to have a urinary catheter installed (don't everyone rush out at once). Almost half of all infections acquired at hospitals are in the urinary tract, and most are linked to catheters. 
 Yet despite the well-established danger -- and even though hospitals across the country are being increasingly pressed to bring down their overall infection rates -- a new study finds that they are doing very little to reduce the risks from catheters.
 The report, which is to appear in the Jan. 15 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, says that even the most basic steps to make catheters safer -- like keeping track of which patients have them -- are often not taken. The study was led by Dr. Sanjay Saint of the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System and the University of Michigan.
 The researchers surveyed hundreds of hospitals across the country about their catheter policies and found that more than half did not have a system for monitoring which patients had catheters, and even more did not keep track of how long they were in for.
 There was also insufficient use of catheters that are less likely to cause infection and of portable bladder-scanning devices that let doctors know if a patient really needs a catheter.
 Most hospitals did not even have a system to remind their staff that a patient has a catheter in, the study found.
 ''Despite reasonable evidence supporting the use of urinary catheter reminders,'' the researchers wrote, ''fewer than 1 in 10 hospitals in this country used this simple and economically attractive method for preventing unnecessary catheterization.''

HEADLINE: Setting May Be More Significant Than the Actual Game

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
 After Ohio State was routed by Florida in last year's national championship game, the consistent critique was that the Buckeyes were too slow and the Gators were too fast. 
 Ohio State was shellacked again Monday night in the Bowl Championship Series title game, this time by a Louisiana State team that made the Buckeyes look as if they were standing still, 38-24. 
 Too fast, too quick. 
 I'm sure cries of ''unfair'' will emerge from Los Angeles and Athens, Ga., from fans who feel that U.S.C. and Georgia should have been in New Orleans. 
 That may be, but for the first time in B.C.S. history, the overriding theme of championship week was not about the failure of the system: which team was denied, which team didn't belong.
 The system is so flawed that further debate seems futile.
 The theme has been curiosity; concern over the healing process of New Orleans, a great city that was turned inside out by Hurricane Katrina.
 New Orleans still shows the effects -- almost two and a half years later -- of one of the worst disasters in United States history, which, by some estimates, claimed 1,400 lives. 
 It has been common to see the normal convergence of Ohio State and L.S.U. fans in the French Quarter, but many fans have ventured to places like the Ninth Ward, Gentilly and New Orleans East to see the effects of Katrina. 
 Jim Tressel, the Ohio State coach, acknowledged the special nature of the title game when he set foot inside the Superdome for the first time.
 He had watched championship games played here and had seen how it was transformed into a refugee center after Katrina struck. 
 Now he would be playing for a national championship inside the dome. ''A lot of things pass through your mind,'' Tressel said. ''What has really been neat about coming here, not just to the dome, but here to New Orleans, it's just a special group of people that have been through a lot that this is such an exciting week for them that you can feel just how special and what a privilege it is to be here.''
 Earlier this week, L.S.U. Coach Les Miles told reporters how he had told his team in no uncertain terms that they represented the aspirations of a state.
 ''This football team is very much in the debt of the city the way we were supported,'' Miles said. ''Our team knows very much firsthand what difficulty this city is going through.''
 New Orleans has played host to three bowl games within a month -- the New Orleans Bowl, the Sugar Bowl and Monday night's B.C.S. title game -- which will pump an estimated $500 million into the economy. 
 On Sunday, I went with a group of 15 journalists for a two-hour drive through four New Orleans communities for a snapshot of rebuilding efforts. Some neighborhoods were untouched. Some were still in ruins. 
 In Lakeview, our guide, James O'Byrne, the Living section editor of The Times-Picayune, passed out copies of a photo showing a man in a canoe paddling up to house that was all but submerged.
 We walked across the street and inside his neighbor's gutted home. The house stood under eight feet of water for nearly three weeks after Katrina. O'Byrne said that many of his neighbors had sold their homes to developers and broke a little less than even.
 We passed through historic Gentilly. O'Byrne explained that people had fewer options; property was not as valuable to developers, and many residents lacked the money to repair or rebuild. 
 We ended our excursion in the Lower Ninth Ward, where Brad Pitt has pledged $5 million to a rebuilding project. The area was heavily flooded, and afterward most of the area was leveled. Some residents have been living in trailers.
 Although our trip barely scratched the surface, it offered a sobering reminder of how economics and politics, age and race affect one's options in the face of a disaster: who could afford to escape, who could afford to return, who could afford to rebuild. Who was stuck.
 Everyone was touched. 
 Ohio State defensive tackle Nader Abdallah is from New Orleans. His family owned a store in the Third Ward, across from the Magnolia Projects. 
 Abdallah's family left New Orleans the day before Katrina hit; the business and the family's home were destroyed. His parents moved back to the Middle East; two brothers and a sister relocated to Houston. 
 Before arriving in New Orleans, Abdallah told reporters: ''This is going to be the greatest experience in my life, being able to go home, playing against my former teammates and my friends. Going back to my home to play my home team, it doesn't get any better than that. 
 ''There are some sad places now. There are parts of town that looked like they were destroyed yesterday, not two years ago. There are certain places that will never get back to normal.'' 
 The enduring beauty, indeed the mystery, of New Orleans is that there is no ''normal.''
 Monday's B.C.S. title game was a fitting symbol for New Orleans. Ohio State came back from a humiliating loss to Florida in last year's title game; L.S.U., which few expected to reach this summit, rebuilt itself into a champion.

HEADLINE: Pennington Is Expected To Stay and Compete

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., 

 BODY:
When General Manager Mike Tannenbaum met with Chad Pennington to discuss the Jets' most pressing issue of the off-season, their conversation centered, oddly enough, on bull riding at Madison Square Garden. 
 Pennington was on his way to the Garden to watch the bulls last weekend, decked out in a flannel shirt. Tannenbaum described the conversation as brief, but it gave a compelling glimpse of the Jets' plans at quarterback. 
 ''He's under contract,'' Tannenbaum said. ''I expect him back. I expect him to compete with Kellen.'' 
 That would be Kellen Clemens, who replaced Pennington in the starting lineup midway through the season. Clemens posted a lower completion percentage (52 percent to 68.8 percent) and lower passer rating (60.9 to 86.1) than Pennington, and threw fewer touchdown passes (5 to 10) and more interceptions (10 to 9). But the Jets (4-12) won three games with Clemens as the starter and only one with Pennington. 
 Tannenbaum's end-of-the-season news conference Monday focused on the quarterbacks. Each is under contract, but if Clemens is indeed the starter next season, then Pennington costs $7.8 million against the salary cap, a huge sum for a backup. 
 Tannenbaum said economics would not drive the decision on Pennington's return, with the Jets about $27 million under the salary cap. But Tannenbaum also left open the possibility of a trade, joking that the team would trade Bruce Speight, senior director for media relations, for a second-round pick if one became available. 
 At the end of the season, Pennington made it clear he wanted to be a starter in the N.F.L., with the Jets or elsewhere. His best-case scenario, other than a trade, would be the open competition during training camp that Tannenbaum described Monday. 
 ''I'm a strong enough person to put personal feelings aside for the betterment of the team,'' Pennington said. ''I don't have any ill feelings toward anyone in this organization.'' 
 Asked if the Jets risked creating an awkward situation with their quarterbacks, Tannenbaum pointed to Jacksonville, where the Jaguars released the starter Byron Leftwich shortly before the season. David Garrard led them to the playoffs. 
 As for Clemens, Tannenbaum said, ''There are going to be some ups and downs, but there are some reasons to be encouraged.'' He pointed to Clemens's proficiency in leading two-minute drives and his performance in a win against the Dolphins. 
 Other than at quarterback, the Jets' most pressing question entering this off-season appears to be at coordinator. In fact, they could lose all three of their coordinators. 
 Despite leading the N.F.L.'s 26th-ranked offense, the coordinator Brian Schottenheimer was interviewed for the Baltimore Ravens' head-coaching job Monday. Although Schottenheimer is one of several candidates and not considered the favorite, Tannenbaum confirmed the Jets gave the Ravens permission to speak to him. 
 The defensive coordinator Bob Sutton improved his unit for the second straight season after the Jets' bye week. Of course, the defense also struggled before the bye in both seasons, leading to speculation that Sutton would be fired. Tannenbaum did not give him a vote of confidence. 
 The Jets also need to hire a special-teams coordinator. Mike Westhoff announced after the final regular-season game that he would not coach next season. Westhoff will have surgery on his left leg Feb. 7. He did not rule out returning after next season. 
 Tannenbaum watched the N.F.L. playoffs last weekend, and what stuck out most was the depth of the teams competing.
 ''It's an infomercial for how to build a successful N.F.L. team,'' he said. ''There were so many undrafted free agents that played meaningful snaps in those games.'' 
 Tannenbaum said the Jets would listen to trade offers for Jonathan Vilma, who had knee surgery and was placed on injured reserve. He noted, though, the depth the Jets would have if they kept Vilma and fellow inside linebackers David Harris and Eric Barton. 
 He also talked up the Jets' ability to improve their depth during the season. Tannenbaum pointed to safety Abram Elam and guard Will Montgomery as two players the Jets picked up early in the season who ended up playing ''meaningful snaps.'' 
 Tannenbaum saved his highest praise for receiver Laveranues Coles. When Coles last spoke to reporters, he said his agents had been told by the Jets that they were concerned about his age (30) and production last season, when he missed four games and parts of two others because of injuries. 
 ''I've seen Laveranues evolve into an incredible person, almost a Curtis Martin-type persona within the building,'' Tannenbaum said. ''I hope Laveranues is here for a long time.'' 
 The Jets pick sixth in the draft and are expected to be active in free agency. But first, they will look to extend the contracts of young players like tight end Chris Baker and safety Kerry Rhodes.

HEADLINE: In Professor's Model, Diversity = Productivity

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
In the long-running debate on affirmative action, Scott E. Page, a professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan, is a fresh voice.
 His recently published book, ''The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools and Societies'' (Princeton University Press), uses mathematical modeling and case studies to show how variety in staffing produces organizational strength. 
 Rather than ponder moral questions like, ''Why can't we all get along?'' Dr. Page asks practical ones like, ''How can we all be more productive together?'' The answer, he suggests, is in messy, creative organizations and environments with individuals from vastly different backgrounds and life experiences. 
 ''New York City is the perfect example of diversity functioning well,'' he said in an interview. ''It's an exciting place that produces lots of innovation and creativity. It's not a coincidence that New York has so much energy and also so much diversity.''
 An edited version of the interview and a subsequent phone conversation follow: 
 Q. In your book you posit that organizations made up of different types of people are more productive than homogenous ones. Why do you say that?
 A. Because diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it. 
 People from different backgrounds have varying ways of looking at problems, what I call ''tools.'' The sum of these tools is far more powerful in organizations with diversity than in ones where everyone has gone to the same schools, been trained in the same mold and thinks in almost identical ways.
 The problems we face in the world are very complicated. Any one of us can get stuck. If we're in an organization where everyone thinks in the same way, everyone will get stuck in the same place. 
 But if we have people with diverse tools, they'll get stuck in different places. One person can do their best, and then someone else can come in and improve on it. There's a lot of empirical data to show that diverse cities are more productive, diverse boards of directors make better decisions, the most innovative companies are diverse. 
 Breakthroughs in science increasingly come from teams of bright, diverse people. That's why interdisciplinary work is the biggest trend in scientific research.
 Q. The term ''diversity'' has become a code word for inclusion of racial, ethnic and sexual minorities. Is that what you're talking about? 
 A. I mean differences in how people think. Two people can look quite different and think similarly. Having said that, there's certainly a lot of evidence that people's identity groups -- ethnic, racial, sexual, age -- matter when it comes to diversity in thinking.
 Here's the bottom line: I myself am an affirmative action child. I got into the University of Michigan in the 1980s on a program. I'm from a rural part of Michigan. No calculus in high school. So I was given bonus points toward undergraduate admissions. 
 If the policy had been to consider mainly grades and SATs and not to make room for some geographic diversity, maybe I wouldn't have gotten in.
 Q. Give us an example of where diversity has improved an organization or profession?
 A. I've seen it in my own field, economics. Before women got really involved in the 1970s, a lot of the actual labor of women wasn't included in calculations of the gross domestic product. It was as if you had Ma Ingalls sitting around the Little House on the Prairie, eating bonbons, and only Pa Ingalls's labor was counted in. 
 After you got women into the profession, they started saying: ''What if Ma Ingalls opened up a business and charged for the cleaning, pie making, tending of the animals. Wouldn't there be a lot of G.D.P. in there?'' 
 When you only had men thinking about the economy, they were ignoring the productivity of half the population. By including the perspectives of females, the estimates got more accurate. This was important for looking at the American past and for understanding contemporary societies like those in Africa, where women are usually the farmers.
 Q. In your book, you advocate affirmative action, an unpopular social policy these days. What's your argument?
 A. That it's a flat-out good because, as I said earlier, it makes everything we do more powerful. 
 For a while, I chaired admissions in the graduate political science department at the University of Michigan. We didn't just look at high test scores. We looked at things like whether an applicant had worked with Teach for America. We wanted to bring in people who had experiences and modes of thinking that would improve everyone else. 
 At a university, people learn from each other as well as their professors. Another suburban kid who was raised to score high on tests doesn't add all that much to the mix. 
 Q. What's your critique of standardized testing?
 A. After a certain threshold, it doesn't give you enough information. Anyone who scores above 600 on a Graduate Record Exam will probably do well in graduate school. But we were looking for future social science researchers. The ability to do innovative research requires creativity and originality, something the G.R.E. won't predict. 
 Q. How do you know you're right about diversity?
 A. One of the things social scientists do is create math models to prove our theories. With Lu Hong -- she's an economist at Chicago's Loyola University -- I constructed a formal model that showed mathematically that diversity can trump ability, and also when it does. 
 Our models were similar to what people are doing to predict the financial markets and voting patterns, and our paper was published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
 What the model showed was that diverse groups of problem solvers outperformed the groups of the best individuals at solving problems. The reason: the diverse groups got stuck less often than the smart individuals, who tended to think similarly.
 The other thing we did was to show in mathematical terms how when making predictions, a group's errors depend in equal parts on the ability of its members to predict and their diversity. This second theorem can be expressed as an equation: collective accuracy = average accuracy + diversity.

HEADLINE: Iranian Boats Confront U.S. In Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and BRIAN KNOWLTON; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Five armed Iranian speedboats approached three United States Navy warships in international waters in the strategic Strait of Hormuz on Sunday, then maneuvered aggressively as radio threats were issued that the American ships would be blown up, military officials said Monday.
 The confrontation, which ended after just under 30 minutes without damage, shots fired or any injuries, took place during daylight on Sunday as the three American ships were entering the Persian Gulf. 
 On Monday, the senior Navy officer in the region, Vice Adm. Kevin J. Cosgriff, criticized the Iranian actions as ''unnecessarily provocative.'' Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Iranians had acted in a ''reckless and dangerous'' manner.
 Iranian officials played down the significance of the encounter. ''This is an ordinary occurrence, which happens every now and then for both sides,'' said Muhammad Ali Hosseini, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, as quoted by the state-run news agency IRNA. 
 But several Pentagon officials said the commander of a Navy destroyer involved in the episode had been on the verge of issuing an order to fire on one of the small, high-speed boats sailing near the American naval convoy. 
 The commander of the Hopper, a guided-missile destroyer, was ''very close to giving the order to fire,'' said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''We were perilously close to an incident where we would have taken out at least one of the Iranian small boats.''
 The Hopper had trained an M240 machine gun -- which fires upward of 10 armor-piercing slugs per second -- on one of the Iranian boats that had pulled to within 200 yards of the American vessel, well within the gun's range, Pentagon officials said. But before the order to fire was issued, the Iranian boat suddenly steered away from the Hopper.
 The United States has conducted major war games to prepare for just the kind of event that unfolded over the weekend, because Navy officers have expressed concerns that the weaker Iranian fleet might choose to confront American warships by ''swarming'' with larger numbers of smaller craft.
 Admiral Cosgriff, commander of the Fifth Fleet, said the episode was ''more serious than we have seen,'' in particular because it occurred in an important maritime choke point vital to the global economy.
 ''I am concerned with what I consider unnecessary and irresponsible maneuvering and behavior like this on the part of those patrol boats in, again, international waters in an area that's traversed by numerous ships of all nations peacefully day in and day out,'' he said during a video news conference from his headquarters in Bahrain.
 In addition to the Hopper, the American ships involved in the episode were the cruiser Port Royal and the Ingraham, a frigate.
 Commanders and crews sailing in the region are especially mindful of the damage small craft can inflict on American warships. In October 2000, 17 American sailors died when a small boat was detonated next to the destroyer Cole while it was docked for refueling in Yemen.
 This is a time of considerable tensions between the countries, as President Bush is to visit the region for a weeklong tour aimed both at encouraging Middle East talks and at conveying a message that Iran continues to pose a serious threat.
 Defense Department and military officials said that as the Iranian boats neared the American vessels, a radio threat was issued that the American ships would explode. The verbal warnings broadcast over the internationally recognized bridge-to-bridge radio channel said, ''I am coming at you, and you will explode in a few minutes,'' an American official said.
 Two of the Iranian boats also dropped boxes in the path of the final American ship in the maritime convoy. The boxes could have been mines or simply dummy boxes meant to test -- and learn from -- the reaction, officials said.
 Defense Department officials said the five speedboats belonged to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Traditionally, the Revolutionary Guards maritime forces have operated in a far more hostile manner than the regular Iranian Navy. In addition, the United States Government describes the Revolutionary Guards as being involved with unconventional weapons and its most elite organization, the Quds Force, as a supporter of terrorism.
 In Tehran on Monday, the news agency FARS, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, wrote in an analysis that the accusations were baseless and aimed at depicting Iran as a threat ahead of Mr. Bush's trip to the region.
 The White House warned Iran against any further confrontations. ''We urge the Iranians to refrain from such provocative actions that could lead to a dangerous incident in the future,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman.
 Admiral Cosgriff said that, in the past, relations with the regular Iranian Navy had been courteous and professional, and that many interactions at sea with the Revolutionary Guards vessels have been normal.
 But the allied navies operating in the region have been especially watchful since last March, when sailors believed to be from the Revolutionary Guards captured 15 British sailors in waters the British insisted were international, and held them for nearly two weeks.
 The Pentagon said last year that there were signs that Iran had turned command of its naval missions in the Persian Gulf over to the Revolutionary Guards Corps' maritime forces, stripping Iran's regular navy of that responsibility.

HEADLINE: Is Prefab Fab? MoMA Plans a Show

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
To many people the term ''prefab housing'' calls to mind trailer parks. Yet lately prefabricated houses -- built off site and then delivered largely complete -- have become fashionable at architecture schools and among an upscale segment of the housing market. They pose a considerable design challenge.
 Seizing the moment the Museum of Modern Art has commissioned five architects to erect their own prefab dwellings in a vacant lot on West 53rd Street, adjacent to the museum. Whittled down from a pool of about 400, the five architects are participating in ''Home Delivery: Fabricating the Modern Dwelling,'' an exhibition opening in July.
 The five, to be announced today by the museum, are KieranTimberlake Associates of Philadelphia; Lawrence Sass of Cambridge, Mass.; Douglas Gauthier and Jeremy Edmiston of Manhattan; Oskar Leo Kaufmann and Albert Ruf of Austria; and Richard Horden of Horden Cherry Lee in London. 
 Each firm has a track record with prefabricated housing, but they all approach the form differently. The proposals were evaluated by a jury of MoMA curators and staff members and architectural professionals. The Manhattan architecture firm of Cooper Robertson & Partners will act as the consulting architect in assembling the houses, some created expressly for this exhibition and others designed earlier.
 ''I wanted a mix of existing buildings and prototypes,'' said Barry Bergdoll, the chief curator of architecture and design at the museum, who is organizing the exhibition with Peter Christensen, a curatorial assistant. Mr. Bergdoll said he didn't want to perpetuate what he called a prevailing myth that prefab housing can't work in practice. Several architects have had considerable success, including Wes Jones, who in 1994 made homes from shipping containers, and Namba Kazuhiko, who in 2004 created his Muji Infill House. 
 Mr. Bergdoll wants to counter other misconceptions about prefab housing, like the notion that the reason to build them is to save money. While they can be economical, he said, they also have potential environmental benefits. The goal for Mr. Gauthier and Mr. Edmiston, for example, is to cut the most complex prefab pieces with the least waste.
 Mr. Horden's Micro Compact House -- Mr. Bergdoll described it as ''a giant livable Sony radio cube'' -- is topped with photovoltaic panels and has wind turbines in its walls, allowing the house to generate its own electricity. An aluminum-clad perfect cube, with about 76 square feet of living space, the tiny dwelling is intended for use as athletic or student housing, or as a miniature vacation house. Mr. Bergdoll met with Mr. Horden in one of his cubes, a space so compact that the architect managed to make espresso on the kitchen counter without leaving his seat at the dining table.
 The house is commercially available -- it recently went on the market in Europe -- and can be delivered by helicopter or crane.
 A five-story house designed by the firm led by Stephen Kieran and James Timberlake is made of recyclable materials and equipped with photovoltaic cells that allow it to function off the electricity grid. With steel frames that snap together and glass windows that slide into place, the house requires no welding. 
 Mr. Sass, an architecture professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has designed prefab housing for New Orleans. He proposes shipping a laser-cutting system with the pieces, which can be assembled with a rubber mallet, so homeowners can erect their own houses. ''The house could be a fascinating combination of high-tech design and low-tech assembly,'' Mr. Bergdoll said.
 In the System 3 house by Mr. Kaufmann and Mr. Ruf, the units -- each fits inside a shipping container -- can be stacked together like blocks. The house can be expanded vertically or horizontally and comes with a choice of panels and window systems with which to wrap the building. By the time it's all assembled, about 36 hours later, Mr. Bergdoll said, ''it doesn't look anything like what arrived on the truck.'' 
 The museum gave each team $175,000, though the architects could exceed that budget at their own expense. The Rockefeller Foundation, for example, helped pay for Mr. Sass's project and is also a sponsor of the overall exhibition, along with the Lily Auchincloss Foundation. 
 MoMA has a tradition of exhibiting houses outdoors, most famously in its sculpture garden. The House in the Museum Garden by Marcel Breuer in 1948 was followed by Gregory Ain's Exhibition House in 1950 and the Japanese Exhibition House in 1955. But while the earlier house exhibitions tried to define taste for a growing middle class, the prefab houses will address a broader socio-economic spread. 
 Intrinsic to the idea of prefab housing is serial production, an arguably radical notion at a time when one-of-a-kind homes are so valued. But computerized customization also makes it possible to produce nonidentical objects, Mr. Bergdoll said, adding that the exhibition may explore ''the idea that mass production is reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit.''
 Although the show does not officially open until July 20, today's announcement marks its beginning, Mr. Bergdoll said. In February the foundations will be laid in the vacant lot. The houses will start arriving in late May or early June, a spectacle that Mr. Bergdoll suggested could rival the installation of Richard Serra's immense sculptures last year. 
 ''We really want the spectacle of, 'There's no house there,' and three days later, 'There's a house that you could move furniture into,''' he said.
 Starting in mid-March the architects will contribute weekly blog postings to record the process of fabricating, delivering and assembling the houses on moma.org. The show's two main themes are off-site assembly and delivery, so this stage is integral to the exhibition. 
 ''Once the house is here, it becomes a static event,'' Mr. Bergdoll said. ''What we're really celebrating is how it came into being.''
 Visitors will be able to enter all of the houses, except Mr. Horden's, which is too small to accommodate many people. 
 The exhibition's indoor portion will have documents, other full-scale parts of houses, and films that explore the roots of prefabrication in the work of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Jean Prouve, Richard Rogers, Kisho Kurokawa and Konrad Wachsmann. The exhibition will also highlight projects by corporations like Lustron and Sears Roebuck, and the German Kupferhaus of the 1930s. 
 In part because of the disparaging associations with the term prefab, Mr. Bergdoll left it out of the title of his exhibition. ''I'm making a case for the exploration of architectural ideas,'' he said. ''I don't think architecture should be marginalized in a way that it just becomes a luxury product.''

HEADLINE: Baltimore Is Suing Bank Over Foreclosure Crisis

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Baltimore's mayor and City Council are suing Wells Fargo Bank, contending that its lending practices discriminated against black borrowers and led to a wave of foreclosures that has reduced city tax revenues and increased its costs. 
 The recent surge in homeowner defaults nationwide, generated by lax lending practices during the real estate boom, has officials bracing for a range of problems that often accompany foreclosures. Some municipalities, including Cleveland and Buffalo, are trying to make lenders responsible for abandoned properties to ward off crimes like arson, drug use and prostitution. 
 But the civil suit that officials in Baltimore are filing in United States District Court may presage another type of litigation against lenders by municipalities facing shortfalls in their budgets. 
 In the suit, Mayor Sheila Dixon joined with the City Council to ask that the court bar Wells Fargo from charging higher fees to black borrowers. Many of these borrowers paid more under the bank's subprime lending program, designed for less creditworthy consumers, and are more likely to default on their loans.
 In 2006, Wells Fargo made high-cost loans, with an interest rate at least three percentage points above a federal benchmark, to 65 percent of its black customers in Baltimore and to only 15 percent of its white customers in the area, according to the lawsuit. Similarly, refinancings to black borrowers were more likely to be higher cost than to white ones and to carry prepayment penalties.
 The complaint requests unspecified damages to cover the diminished property tax revenues and higher costs that the city said it had incurred. Additional costs include those for fire and police protection in hard-hit neighborhoods and expenditures to buy and rehabilitate vacant properties.
 Kevin Waetke, a Wells Fargo spokesman, rejected the contention that race was a factor in the bank's pricing of mortgage loans. ''We do not tolerate illegal discrimination against or unfair treatment of any consumer,'' Mr. Waetke said. ''Our loan pricing is based on credit risk. We are committed to serving all customers fairly -- our continued growth depends on it.'' 
 But Suzanne Sangree, chief solicitor for the Baltimore City Law Department, said: ''This wave of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods really threatens to undermine the tremendous progress the city has made in developing distressed neighborhoods and moving the city ahead economically. Wells Fargo could do a lot, as well as other banks that have engaged in similar practices, to help to curb the flood of foreclosures that the city is experiencing now.''
 Among the practices cited by the city, Wells Fargo allowed mortgage brokers to charge higher commissions when they put borrowers in loans with higher interest rates than the customers qualified for based on their credit profiles. The bank also failed to underwrite mortgage loans to traditional criteria, the suit said, setting up the borrowers for default. Such practices were common at many lenders during the boom. 
 Now, Baltimore is a city in a foreclosure crisis, according to the complaint. Citing figures from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, the suit said foreclosure-related events in the city, including notices of default, foreclosure sales and lenders' purchases of foreclosed properties, rose more than five times between the first and second quarters of 2007. 
 Wells Fargo has been the largest or second-largest provider of mortgage loans to Baltimore borrowers since 2004, according to the lawsuit. From 2004 through 2006, Wells Fargo made at least 1,285 mortgage loans a year to area residents with a total value of more than $600 million. Wells Fargo now has the largest number of foreclosures in Baltimore of any lender, the suit stated. 
 Half of the Wells Fargo foreclosures in 2006 occurred in census tracts with populations that were more than 80 percent black, the suit said. Meanwhile, only 16 percent of the foreclosures were found in tracts with populations that are 20 percent or less black. Figures for 2007 were similar, the city said. 
 John P. Relman, a lawyer at Relman & Dane in Washington, represents the City of Baltimore in its case against Wells Fargo. ''Foreclosures have a more profound effect in minority communities because they are closest to the line of distressed neighborhoods in many cities,'' Mr. Relman said. ''That causes big problems for the cities, not just the lost income from taxes but also the long-term social costs. Programs are going to be needed to stabilize the communities to be rebuilt.''
 The Baltimore complaint cited a 2005 study showing that foreclosures required more municipal services and higher costs. The study, commissioned by the Homeownership Preservation Foundation of Minneapolis, identified 26 different costs incurred by government agencies responding to foreclosures in Chicago and in Cook County, Ill., in 2003 and 2004. The analysis concluded that total costs reached $34,199 for each foreclosure.

HEADLINE: Ancient Yucatan Soils Point to Maya Market, and Market Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Scientists using improved methods of analyzing the chemistry of ancient soils have detected where a large marketplace stood 1,500 years ago in a Maya city on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. 
 The findings, archaeologists say, are some of the first strong evidence that the ancient Maya civilization, at least in places and at certain times, had a market economy similar in some respects to societies today. The conventional view has been that food and other goods in Maya cities were distributed through taxation and tributes controlled by the ruling class.
 Bruce H. Dahlin, an archaeologist at Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, W. Va., said in a telephone interview that the new research ''introduces some hard-core empirical evidence for a market economy,'' adding that the soil studies provide ''the first way of confirming that an area that looks like a marketplace is a marketplace.''
 Dr. Dahlin was the lead author of a report on the discovery in the current issue of the journal Latin American Antiquity. Richard E. Terry, who conducted the tests, is a soil biochemist at Brigham Young University and an expert in the analysis of soils at archaeological sites.
 Archaeologists suspected that a wide clearing at the center of the ruins of Chunchucmil might have been a market, not a ritual plaza. Rock alignments peeking above the surface seemed to outline the positions of stalls and regular pathways; the rock patterns for stalls were too small to be house foundations.
 Other research in recent years indicated that the city appeared to have been an important trade center in northwestern Yucatan, connected by a canal to the Gulf of Mexico, 15 miles away. It was doubtful, experts say, that the nearby agriculture could have supported the estimated population of up to 45,000 at the city's peak around A.D. 500. Archaeologists surmised that the city traded in goods and services for food at an outdoor market.
 Dr. Terry's team took several hundred samples of soil from the clearing and adjacent areas. Food and other organic matter might decay, but they leave chemical traces that survive in the soil. All food materials contain phosphorus, a particularly durable marker of food from long ago.
 The researchers applied a dilute acid to the samples and filtered the resulting solution. Exposed to a light from a portable laboratory, the phosphorus in the soil emitted a blue glow; the bluer it was, the greater the amount of the residual chemical. Most samples from the site showed phosphorus concentrations 40 times higher than in surrounding soils, which Dr. Terry said was consistent with results from modern open-air markets in the region.
 Stephen D. Houston, a Maya scholar at Brown University who was not associated with the project, said the research was ''intriguing work by specialists with a long and distinguished track record in the soil chemistry of Maya ruins.''
 Noting that he had been a skeptic of an ancient Maya market economy, Dr. Houston wrote in an e-mail message, ''I'm definitely coming around to a belief in these market facilities,'' citing suggestive discoveries at other ruins in Mexico and Guatemala.
 But Dr. Houston questioned how widespread the market economy was in time and geography. He contended that in most cases, Maya rulers had controlled food distribution through a tax and tribute economy.

HEADLINE: No Strangers to the Cold, Voters Now Feel the Heat

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Amanda Cox contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: HILLSBOROUGH, N.H. 

 BODY:
People here treasure their rugged surroundings and relative isolation in the hills of southwestern New Hampshire. They welcome winter, and consider their distance from urban sprawl a clear advantage.
 But for many, the benefits of living in rural New Hampshire have also become burdens. Gasoline and home heating oil are no longer comfortably affordable, especially for the roughly 60 percent of residents who commute more than 25 miles to work. 
 Of about two dozen people interviewed here in late December and early January, nearly all said energy policy was a top concern as they looked to the presidential primary on Tuesday. Some said they had bought wood-pellet stoves to supplement oil heat; others said they had looked into installing solar panels or even living off the grid, with no reliance on public utilities. 
 ''Oil affects everything,'' said Paris Wells, who owns the Central Square Ice Cream Shoppe on Main Street. ''We need someone in office who's going to look seriously at alternative power of some form.'' 
 Mr. Wells said he was spending more than $1,000 a month on heating oil in winter, which, judging from the estimates others gave, is within the norm. Because of its old housing stock, New Hampshire is more dependent on oil heat than any state except Maine and Vermont, according to the Energy Information Administration, with 58 percent of homes using it. The average national cost of home heating oil was $3.34 a gallon last month, up from $2.44 a year earlier.
 But despite what many here consider a rising crisis regarding dependence on foreign oil, most said the presidential candidates had disappointingly vague approaches to energy policy or, worse, little interest in the subject. 
 Some, like Mr. Wells, spoke admiringly of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat and former energy secretary, who they said seemed more passionate than most candidates about reducing oil prices and consumption.
 Mr. Richardson is a long shot -- he won only 2 percent of the vote in Iowa's caucuses last week -- but some of the other candidates have focused more on gas and heating oil prices in the last few days.
 In the Republican debate on Saturday, most candidates said they wanted to wean the nation from dependence on foreign oil and to expand domestic energy sources, like nuclear power. In the Democratic debate that followed, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said energy costs for families in New Hampshire had tripled during President Bush's tenure and called for more heating assistance for poor families.
 Still, voters here said that they doubted the winners would make energy policy a priority if elected, and that polarizing subjects like the war in Iraq and illegal immigration had largely eclipsed the kitchen-table economic issues that affected daily living here. 
 ''I remember when the center of a presidential campaign was a promise to take care of people in our country,'' said Norma Hubbard, who runs the local food pantry and feeds about 100 families a week. ''That is not there for most of the candidates now.''
 Christopher Duncklee, a longtime resident who raises sheep and grows vegetables on a small farm, said he liked Mr. Richardson for his energy proposals but could not support him after his poor showing in Iowa. Mr. Duncklee normally votes Republican, he said, but is considering Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, a Democrat, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican. 
 Mr. Duncklee predicted that the Iowa results -- especially the victory of former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a favorite of evangelical Christians, on the Republican side -- would not sway many New Hampshire voters.
 ''People here do not think religion belongs in politics,'' he said.
 Almost everyone interviewed said they were not only undecided as the primary drew near, but also considering candidates from both parties. Surprisingly few said they liked Mrs. Clinton or former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who were long perceived as front-runners in their respective parties here but face steeper challenges after losing in Iowa. Forty-two percent of the state's registered voters are independents, and they are famous for waiting until the last minute to choose a candidate. 
 Like other small New Hampshire towns once dominated by families who lived there for generations, Hillsborough, with about 5,700 residents, has seen an influx of people from Massachusetts and other points south. Drawn by lower taxes and housing costs, they came willing to commute to cities with plentiful jobs. But high gas prices are making the tradeoff less worthwhile. 
 ''People buy houses out here and commute a long way,'' said Carl Goodman, who owns a small electrical contracting company in Hillsborough, ''but then they find the cost of the commute and everything else is too much.''
 Mr. Goodman, an independent, said he would vote for former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a Democrat who placed second in Iowa, after Mr. Obama. 
 ''I just think Obama is a little wet behind the ears in the political system,'' he said, ''and Hillary has as many enemies as supporters. I think Edwards is the most electable nationwide.'' 
 Among cities and towns with more than 5,000 people, Hillsborough had New Hampshire's highest per-capita rate of foreclosure auction notices last year, according to the Warren Group, a real estate research company in Boston. While the state's overall foreclosure rate trailed the national rate in recent years, it rose sharply in 2007, almost catching up. In November, the number of foreclosures statewide was up 68 percent from a year earlier.
 Sara Randall, a bartender at Tooky Mills Pub, said pocketbook issues loomed largest for her, especially the cost of health care. A diabetic who spends about $400 a month on health insurance, she is torn between Mrs. Clinton and Representative Ron Paul of Texas, a libertarian-leaning Republican.
 ''They both have a lot to say about health care,'' Ms. Randall said, ''so they are who I'm focusing on.'' 
 Glenn Mathison, an apprentice electrician who said he had been out of work for two years, said that he liked Mr. McCain's position on the Iraq war but that no candidate stood out in terms of improving the economy. 
 For people like Mr. Mathison who want to work in Hillsborough and the immediate surroundings, options are few. A century ago, Contoocook Mills, which made hosiery, provided steady work. Now the biggest employer is Osram Sylvania, a lighting manufacturer that employs about 700. 
 Some residents, like Pete Colbath, drift from job to job. He worked in a real estate office, a video store and a fireworks store before opening a drive-through coffee shop, Java Pete's, in Hillsborough last year. 
 ''Business is not growing fast,'' said Mr. Colbath, who added that he would probably support Mr. Huckabee in the primary. ''The price of fuel and heating oil, that's making decisions for a lot of people.'' 
 With unleaded gasoline averaging $3.05 a gallon in New Hampshire -- 2 cents lower than the national average but up from $2.41 a year ago -- several people here said bringing more shops and other businesses to town was crucial. A Wal-Mart Supercenter was to open in Hillsborough, but the company changed its mind in the fall. 
 ''The people who have to drive to Concord or Keene to buy shoes for their kids are really disappointed,'' said Kim Wells, who owns a gift shop here with her husband. 
 Mrs. Wells, the mother of Paris Wells, said she was an independent who liked Mr. Richardson, Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain. Her son praised Mr. McCain for realizing ''we need to do something'' to curb oil consumption, but he said he was not counting on the next president to make radical changes in energy policy. 
 Instead, Mr. Wells said he intended to cut his own energy costs.
 ''It's going to get tougher and tougher,'' he said. ''I'm buying stuff now so when I retire, I can live totally off the grid.'' 
 Mrs. Hubbard, who said she would vote for Mr. Edwards, Mr. Obama or Mr. McCain because they seemed compassionate, wondered aloud why the candidates were not talking more about the need to conserve. 
 ''We need leadership -- someone to say, 'This is what we need to be doing, so let's all pull together,''' she said. ''I'm just not seeing it.''

HEADLINE: Bush, in a Shift, Admits Economy Faces Challenges

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President Bush, in a marked shift from his usual upbeat economic assessments, conceded here on Monday that the nation faces ''economic challenges'' due to rising oil prices, the home mortgage crisis and a weakening job market.
 ''We cannot take growth for granted,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech to a group of business leaders in which he acknowledged that ''recent economic indicators have become increasingly mixed.'' 
 But even after a government report on Friday that showed unemployment jumped to 5 percent last month from 4.7 percent in November, Mr. Bush stopped short of warning that the nation may be about to enter a recession.
 Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail echoed the president's sobering view. With a number of analysts now predicting that an economic downturn could be imminent, both Mr. Bush and Congressional Democratic leaders say they are considering whether a rescue package is necessary to counter the threat of a recession, in which economic activity declines and joblessness increases over an extended period of time. 
 But the two sides would undoubtedly take vastly different approaches, setting up a clash that could dominate the 2008 election campaign and the remainder of the Bush presidency.
 If the past is any guide, Mr. Bush is likely to favor broad-based tax cuts of the sort he pushed through early in his presidency. Democrats are discussing more targeted relief -- tax cuts, spending programs or a combination of the two -- to help lower- and middle-income Americans who would be hurt the most if the economy falters. 
 ''This is going to be a battle over doing more of what George Bush has done for the past six years, or doing more for the middle class,'' Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a telephone interview after spending the day in Chicago with Mr. Bush. ''That's where the fissure is going to be.''
 The clash comes as the latest negative signs on the economy, coupled with uncertainty in the housing and credit markets, have forced Mr. Bush to abandon his usual sunny rhetoric and paint a darker picture of the economy's condition.
 After months of insisting that the economy's fundamentals are strong -- a theme he reiterated on Monday -- Mr. Bush did not mince words. He acknowledged that ''many Americans are anxious about the economy,'' and he noted that ''jobs are growing at a slower pace.'' He said core inflation was low -- ''except when you're going to the gas pump, it doesn't seem that low.''
 Still, the White House is not convinced it must act. The deliberations are tightly held, and aides to Mr. Bush say he will not make a decision about whether to offer a stimulus package, or what it should contain, until later this month, in time for his State of the Union address scheduled for Jan. 28. Appearing in New York on Monday, Mr. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., echoed that approach, and cautioned against any rush to action.
 ''Working through the current situation and getting the policy right,'' Mr. Paulson said, ''is more important than getting the policy announced quickly.''
 On Capitol Hill, Democrats were positioning themselves to get ahead of any proposal the White House might present. Aides to Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said that she had yet to conclude decisively that a stimulus package was needed, but that she had met with a group of economic advisers last month who urged her to take swift action aimed at stabilizing the jittery economy and lifting consumer confidence.
 The group included Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton; Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and former ambassador to France; and Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the global investment firm. 
 An aide to Ms. Pelosi said the three were ''unanimous in saying that we should move out ahead.'' In an interview over the weekend, Mr. Summers said he believed that there was now a greater than 50 percent chance of a recession this year.
 ''My view is that now is the time to be thinking about policies that would provide recession insurance,'' Mr. Summers said, ''and if we wait until it's entirely clear that there is a recession, it will be too late.'' 
 But Democratic leaders said there was already a general consensus within the party that any stimulus package would be temporary and targeted to the middle class and the poor. Among the proposals under consideration are a $500 across-the-board rebate, possibly to be returned to taxpayers in their paychecks through the payroll tax system, as well as a plan to restore the $1,000 per child tax credit to many low-income families that currently do not qualify for it.
 Polls show Americans are now more concerned with the economy than the war in Iraq, a trend that is reflected in the presidential campaigns. In New Hampshire on Monday, as the candidates furiously courted voters on the eve of that state's crucial primary vote, pocketbook issues like the price of home heating oil and health care took center stage.
 ''The economy's beginning to have some problems, which I'm worried about,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York told a group of voters on Monday morning in Portsmouth, N.H. ''We've got this energy crisis, with oil now at $100 a barrel,'' she said, citing consequences ''for our economy, for our security, for the problem of global warming.'' 
 On the Republican side, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, sounded similar themes, recalling his humble roots as he tried to persuade voters that he understood their ''struggle.'' Gas prices, home heating costs and health care bills keep going up, Mr. Huckabee said, ''but your paycheck doesn't go up to cover it.''
 As for the Bush administration, Mr. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, tried to offer assurances that the White House is not standing still. He said the administration may seek to expand a program begun last year to help homeowners who cannot afford to repay subprime mortgages once they are adjusted upward. 
 Mr. Bush had expected to spend his final year in office focused on foreign affairs -- he leaves Tuesday for the Middle East -- and a few domestic issues, like reauthorizing his signature education bill, No Child Left Behind. 
 But the president has had trouble getting credit for the economy even when times were good, and he can ill afford to leave office on an economic sour note. Mr. Bush is well aware that if he does not appear to share the public's concern, he -- and, more important for the 2008 elections, his party -- could easily look out of touch.
 ''I think Bush is looking not to give the Democratic candidate any more ammunition than necessary,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a Republican economist who has been highly critical of the administration. ''If we are in the middle of a recession in November, obviously the Republican Party is going to be blamed for that.'' 
 Still, Mr. Bush must be careful not to depress the economy with pessimistic talk, and so his speech in Chicago on Monday offered a delicate balancing act. ''People said, 'Are you optimistic?' I said, 'Absolutely, absolutely optimistic,''' Mr. Bush said. ''Do I recognize the reality of the situation? You bet I do.''

HEADLINE: An Art Donor Opts to Hold On to His Collection

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Eli Broad, the billionaire financier and philanthropist whose private collection of some 2,000 works of Modern and contemporary art is one of the most sought-after by museums nationwide, has decided to retain permanent control of his works in an independent foundation that makes loans to museums rather than give any of the art away.
 The decision is a striking reversal by Mr. Broad, who as recently as a year ago said that he planned to give most of his holdings to one or several museums. 
 Long assumed to be at the top of the list of potential recipients was the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which next month is to open the $56 million Broad Contemporary Art Museum, a building designed by Renzo Piano and financed by Mr. Broad, as the centerpiece of its redesigned campus on Wilshire Boulevard. 
 Coming on the eve of the opening, the decision is a potential embarrassment for the Los Angeles museum. It was widely criticized in 2001 for mounting a major exhibition of works from Mr. Broad's collection without having secured a promised gift of the works, an act that is prohibited at many prominent art institutions because it can increase the market value of the collection.
 The decision also has far-reaching implications for the way museums interact with big donors. In recent years a dizzying rise in art prices and an abiding institutional thirst for acquisitions have given well-heeled donors more influence over what a museum buys and puts on its walls.
 Mr. Broad has long been a dominant force on the Los Angeles art scene, helping to found museums and serving on their boards, overseeing fund-raising for the construction of the landmark Disney Hall, which was designed by Frank Gehry, and spurring a drive to revitalize downtown. 
 Mr. Broad has been especially visible at the county museum, serving as a vice chairman of its board, leading fund-raising campaigns and strongly influencing the comings and goings of the museum's directors, including the hiring in 2006 of the current one, Michael Govan.
 In an interview in his foundation's office here, Mr. Broad (whose name rhymes with road) said he did not view his decision as a vote of no confidence in the museum. Rather, he said, it represents no less than a new paradigm for the way museums in general collect art and interact with one another. 
 ''I think it's a new model that makes sense for other collections,'' he said. ''If it was up to me, I believe that museums ought to own works jointly.'' Mr. Broad encouraged that practice last year with his purchase of a work by the artist Chris Burden, which he then gave jointly to the county museum and another Los Angeles institution, the Museum of Contemporary Art, where he was a founding trustee.
 His decision not to donate his holdings evolved over the last year, Mr. Broad said, as his collection grew, and it became clear that no museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art included, would commit to placing a large percentage of the works on permanent exhibit.
 The collection has roughly doubled in size in the last five years and includes personal holdings and those of the Broad Art Foundation. Among the best-known works are some by contemporary artists including Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Ed Ruscha and John Baldessari, as well as earlier art-world titans like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg.
 ''We don't want it to end up in storage, in either our basement or somebody else's basement,'' Mr. Broad said. ''So I, as the collector, am saying, 'If you're not willing to commit to show it, why don't we just make it available to you when you want it, as opposed to giving it to you, and then our being unhappy that it's only up 10 percent or 20 percent of the time or not being shown at all?'''
 Michael Govan, the director of Lacma, did not return phone calls seeking comment on Monday afternoon. In a telephone interview late Monday night, he said that he viewed Mr. Broad's decision as a positive development because it meant that none of the art works would be sold, an act that would limit access to them by Lacma and other museums.
 Asked if he viewed Mr. Broad's decision as demonstrating a lack of confidence in him or in the museum, Mr. Govan said: ''Quite the reverse. Since day one he's privately and publicly given me a lot of support.'' He noted that even though Mr. Broad does not plan to give his works to the museum, he did not profit from Lacma's 2001 exhibit of works from the Broad collection.
 ''And from the public perspective, I don't think most people care when they walk in the door whether the museum owns the works or not, as long as they don't lose them'' to private sales, Mr. Govan said. ''He's got 2,000 works, so there is plenty to go around.'' 
 Mr. Broad took pains to make clear that the county museum would be ''the favored institution'' when it came to loans from the Broad Art Foundation. ''If it weren't going to be favored, I wouldn't have given it $50 million to build the building,'' he said. 
 He also gave $10 million for the acquisition of works, which Mr. Broad said had already been spent on two pieces: a Richard Serra sculpture, ''Band,'' and a maplike tapestry by the artist Alighiero Boetti.
 This is not the first time that the county museum has missed out on the gift of a major collection from a prominent Los Angeles patron. Both Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, and Norton Simon, the canned-food magnate, decided to build their own museums in Los Angeles after toying with the idea of donating their works to the county museum. 
 In 2001 the museum lost out on the collection of Nathan Smooke, a former museum trustee and industrial real-estate developer whose heirs sold much of his collection rather than donating it. 
 Last month the museum said it had received a gift of 130 works by major Modern artists, including Picasso, Giacometti and Brancusi, from the collectors Janice and Henri Lazarof.
 In reaching his decision Mr. Broad, who made his fortune as the co-founder of Kaufman & Broad, a builder of houses, and SunAmerica, a retirement-investment firm, said he envisioned a new economic model for museums that have struggled to keep pace in recent years with huge increases in auction prices for Modern and contemporary art.
 ''What they're doing doesn't make economic sense or any other sense, especially with the price of work today,'' Mr. Broad said. ''The purpose of the foundation is to continue to build the collection, to be responsible for the conservation of it, the storage of it, and most importantly to give it the biggest possible audience we can.''
 Of course Mr. Broad also enjoys tax advantages by keeping much of his artworks in a tax-exempt foundation that lends the work out to museums. 
 Joanne Heyler, the curator of the Broad Art Foundation, said that Mr. Broad's collections included roughly 400 works in his personal holdings and more than 1,500 works in the foundation. The foundation alone has added more than 600 works in the last two years, she said, and last year it lent more than 900 individual works to museums around the world.
 Finding adequate space to exhibit contemporary art is a particular problem, given that individual works are often enormous. The Broad Contemporary Art Museum at the county museum will contain 58,000 square feet of gallery space, nearly twice the total area of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. 
 But roughly a third of that new space -- the entire first floor -- will be taken up by just two mammoth sculptures by Richard Serra: ''Band'' and ''Sequence,'' owned by Donald Fisher, the founder of Gap Inc., whois planning his own museum in San Francisco. 
 The initial exhibition at the Broad museum will include work from other collectors as well. Among them will be some works by Jasper Johns owned by Michael Crichton, the author and a member of the county museum's board; works by Robert Rauschenberg from the collection of Ileana Sonnabend, the late New York gallery owner; and other contemporary works owned by Jane and Marc Nathanson.

HEADLINE: Yale Plans to Increase Spending From Its Endowment, With Financial Aid to Benefit

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Facing pressure from Congress and some donors to use more of its multibillion-dollar investment gains, Yale University announced Monday that it would increase the amount of money it spent from its endowment next year by nearly 40 percent. 
 The additional money will be used for financial aid and new scientific and medical research. 
 Yale's announcement was the latest sign that the nation's wealthiest universities are trying to fend off action by members of Congress who question why universities raise tuition faster than the rate of inflation while the value of their endowments soar.
 Some lawmakers have been threatening to require universities to spend a minimum of 5 percent of their endowments each year, the same as most private foundations. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, has suggested that colleges and universities, which are tax exempt, should spend more of their endowments. 
 Yale's announcement came a month after Harvard University said it would increase its financial aid to students. At nearly $35 billion, Harvard's endowment is by far the largest among American universities, with Yale next at $22.5 billion. Both have seen robust returns.
 Harvard officials said they would spend an additional $22 million annually, beginning next year, to expand financial aid to low- and middle-income students, as well as to students from families earning as much as $180,000 a year. 
 Yale will spend an additional $307 million next year in income from its endowment, which represents a 12 percent increase on the university's current $2.5 billion budget. Besides increasing financial aid, the money is likely to finance a proposed expansion in the size of Yale's undergraduate student body.
 ''This is a very big boost to our spending,'' Richard C. Levin, the university's president, said in an interview. Dr. Levin added, ''We want to do things that are significant with it.''
 Mr. Grassley called Yale's announcement ''a great day for parents and students.'' In a statement, he said he thought it significant that the nation's two wealthiest universities were making the cost of college more affordable for students.
 ''They set an example for all well-funded schools to do the same,'' Mr. Grassley said. 
 Still, Mr. Grassley said he hoped Congress would continue to consider imposing mandatory requirements on how much universities must spend from endowments.
 ''This isn't just an issue of college access,'' he said. ''It's also an issue of tax fairness. Universities hold at least $340 billion in endowments. The donations to those endowments and the endowments themselves are all tax-exempt. American taxpayers are subsidizing that tax-exemption, and they deserve public benefit in return.''
 Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, did not reply to telephone messages seeking comment.
 Dr. Levin said universities should be allowed to determine how much of their long-term assets it would be prudent to spend. ''You wouldn't want to mandate a spending rate,'' he said.
 Yale will spend every year at least 4.5 percent of its endowment and at most 6 percent, Dr. Levin said. That would put it in the range of the 5 percent that foundations are required to spend. 
 Yale is spending about 3.8 percent of the endowment this year, a relatively low proportion among elite universities. Harvard is spending about 4.3 percent of its endowment this year and plans to spend 5 percent next year, university officials said.
 Dr. Levin acknowledged that the Congressional pressure, along with concerns by some Yale donors about the university's relatively low level of spending, had figured in the decision. He said another factor was the rapid growth in the value of Yale's endowment, which increased by 28 percent last year. 
 ''The folks in Washington are saying you're hoarding money,'' Dr. Levin said. ''And we felt uneasy about it ourselves.''
 Dr. Levin declined to spell out details of Yale's plans on financial aid, saying they would be made public later this month. But he indicated that the aid would be comparable to Harvard's effort to channel money well into the ranks of the upper middle class and that it would be not be limited to undergraduates. 
 ''When all is said and done,'' Dr. Levin said, ''people are not going to be choosing between Yale and Harvard based on cost.''
 Yale charges $45,000 for tuition, room and board, though many students get financial aid. 
 Yale will use the additional money for biomedical and scientific research, and will also make more courses available online without charge. 
 Yale is also considering whether to expand undergraduate enrollment to about 6,000 students from the current 5,300. The proposal will go to the university's governing body in February.

HEADLINE: The Debate Over How and How Long

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If President Bush becomes convinced the economy is indeed headed toward a recession, he is likely to respond much as he did on entering office in 2001 with the economy on the verge of a downturn: lower tax rates for people at all income levels and provide tax breaks for businesses.
 But this time around, Democratic leaders in Congress are planning to push back with a very different strategy. While many Democrats can be expected to favor at least some tax cuts, they will seek temporary measures that are aimed at low- and middle-income Americans. 
 In an election year, the big fight between Republicans and Democrats is not expected to turn on whether the government should stimulate the economy. It is not even likely to be over the relative merits of tax cuts versus bigger spending. 
 The real battle will probably be over short-term goals versus long-term measures. 
 As Mr. Bush suggested in his speech on Monday, his top economic priority remains extending the tax cuts he began in 2001 and 2003 well beyond 2010, when they are scheduled to expire.
 ''In a time of economic uncertainty, we don't need to be taking money out of your pocket,'' Mr. Bush told business leaders at the Union League Club of Chicago. ''The smartest thing we can do is to keep taxes low.''
 By contrast, Democrats have a fundamentally different approach. Though economists who support the Democrats are divided about whether the economy even needs a boost, they almost universally are talking about temporary moves to support the people most likely to be hurt by a downturn. Those could include an increase in unemployment benefits, food stamps or job-training assistance; a temporary cut in the payroll tax for Social Security; and a tax rebate for middle- and lower-income workers. 
 Democrats themselves are divided into separate camps. Some, including former top officials from the Clinton administration like Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, continue to place a top priority on fiscal discipline and shrinking the federal budget deficit.
 But another camp argues that the Clinton wing is too fixated on budget-balancing. By contrast, this group supports a big expansion of public infrastructure spending on highways, bridges, airports and other capital projects.
 Democrats also differ widely on the amount of money that Washington should throw at the problem. Mr. Summers, in a recent speech to the Brookings Institution, proposed measures that might cost $75 billion over the next six months or so. Others argue that a stimulus package should cost at least $250 billion if it is to have any real impact.
 Mr. Bush said his administration is looking at options to help the economy through a downturn, but he has also said he will not decide on any proposals until his State of the Union speech at the end of this month.
 On Monday, Mr. Bush devoted much of his speech to warning that Congress should make his tax cuts permanent. But that change would do little to forestall a recession, because the tax cuts do not need to be extended for another two years.
 Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and an adviser to many Republicans, has warned that the risks of an actual recession are now greater than 50-50. Mr. Feldstein recently suggested that policy makers devise a ''contingent'' stimulus package that would be set in motion if the nation's employment declines for three months in a row.
 Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, argued that Congress should offer additional tax breaks for business investment and perhaps even lower the corporate tax rate.
 During the last downturn, Mr. Bush supported ''bonus depreciation'' that let corporations deduct the cost of new equipment more rapidly, as well as a temporary measure that let small businesses immediately write off up to $125,000 in equipment spending.
 ''They're reliable, they're tried and true,'' Mr. Hassett said, referring to tax cuts for business investment.
 But Democratic lawmakers, who have majorities in both the House and Senate, are almost certain to insist on measures aimed at middle-income and poor families.
 ''It's very important that a significant share of any tax reduction go to middle- and lower-income people,'' said Douglas W. Elmendorf, an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton administration. ''They are living closer to the edge than most people. But also, tax cuts to them would have the most macroeconomic punch. You want to direct the tax cuts to people who are spending everything that's coming in.''
 Mr. Elmendorf, who will join Mr. Rubin at a Brookings conference on Thursday about stimulating the economy, said he was not yet persuaded that any special measures were necessary. But if they are, he said, they should be ''timely and targeted and temporary.''
 Several temporary measures could meet those criteria, and Democratic lawmakers are already starting to discuss them, according to Congressional staff members. 
 Almost any stimulus package is likely to include an extension of unemployment benefits, which normally end after a person has been jobless for 26 weeks. Similarly, lawmakers are likely to propose an increase in the food stamp program. 
 Democrats have long wanted to expand the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which offers help to workers in factories that close down because of foreign competition. Others have suggested a new program of ''wage insurance,'' under which the government would temporarily compensate workers who are forced to take lower-paying jobs at different companies. 
 Democrats and Republicans are both likely to be drawn to tax rebates. Mr. Bush's tax-cut package of 2001 included a one-time rebate to taxpayers that supporters said stimulated consumer spending at a time when unemployment was rising.
 But many economists criticize one-time tax rebates, because people who are not in dire financial straits will typically save a portion of their tax rebate. Those with higher incomes tend to save more, so rebates to higher-
 income households have less immediate impact on economic activity.
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, estimated in 2002 that the measures aimed at lower-income households had the most ''bang for the buck'' in terms of stimulating demand.
 Mr. Zandi estimated higher unemployment benefits had the biggest impact, generating $1.73 in demand for every dollar spent by the government. By contrast, he estimated, reducing marginal tax rates for all income levels generated only 67 cents of extra demand for every dollar in lower taxes.
 In the last recession, Mr. Bush made it clear he was far less interested in temporary stimulus than in advancing his long-term agenda of extending lower tax rates indefinitely. R. Glenn Hubbard, then one of Mr. Bush's top economic advisers, went so far as to avoid the word ''stimulus'' because it sounded too much like trying to fine-tune the economy.
 Democrats now have a similar battle in their own camp between temporary and long-term measures. 
 A growing camp of Democrats, frustrated by the Clinton-Rubin focus on fiscal discipline, are pushing for a big, broad increase in spending on highways, bridges, mass transit and other infrastructure.
 ''It would mean much more of the stimulus actually goes to creating jobs,'' said Sherle R. Schwenninger, head of the economic growth program at the New America Foundation, a policy research group dominated by Democrats.
 Bernard L. Schwartz, a wealthy industrialist who has contributed heavily to the New America Foundation, has championed the idea as a way both to stimulate the economy and increase its long-term efficiency.
 With a possible recession looming, Democratic leaders in Congress are beginning to talk about a mix of targeted tax cuts and new spending projects. But Congressional Democrats are constrained by their insistence on paying for new spending and new tax cuts with savings in other areas. Though lawmakers can waive the ''pay as you go'' restrictions to deal with an economic emergency, fiscal conservatives will be reluctant to do so. 
 In the end, even if Congress does manage to pass a spending package, Democrats may still find themselves in a stalemate with President Bush, who has already vetoed numerous bills that exceeded his spending limits.

HEADLINE: A President's Defender Keeps His Distance

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
A rift is emerging between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggesting that the president no longer enjoys the ayatollah's full backing, as he did in the years after his election in 2005. 
 In the past, when Mr. Ahmadinejad was attacked by his political opponents, criticisms were usually silenced by Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final word on state matters and regularly endorsed the president in public speeches. But that public support has been conspicuously absent in recent months. 
 There are numerous possible reasons for Mr. Ahmadinejad's loss of support, but analysts here all point to one overriding factor: the United States National Intelligence Estimate last month, which said Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 in response to international pressure. The intelligence estimate sharply reduced the threat of a military strike against Iran, allowing the Iranian authorities to focus on domestic issues, with important parliamentary elections looming in March.
 ''Now that Iran is not under the threat of a military attack, all contradictions within the establishment are surfacing,'' said Saeed Leylaz, an economic and political analyst. ''The biggest mistake that Americans have constantly made toward Iran was adopting radical approaches which provided the ground for radicals in the country to take control.'' 
 Iran had been under increasing international pressure for its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program, which can be pursued for either peaceful or military purposes. In separate speeches last year, American and French officials did not rule out a military attack on Iran if it continued its defiance. Those threats have stopped since the intelligence estimate was released.
 While the pressure was on, Iranian leaders were reluctant to let any internal disagreements show. Senior officials, including Ayatollah Khamenei, constantly called for unity and warned that the enemy, a term commonly used to refer to the Untied States, could take advantage of such differences.
 The Iranian presidency is a largely ceremonial post. But Mr. Ahmadinejad had used the office as a bully pulpit, espousing an economic populism that built a strong following among the country's middle and lower classes and made him a political force to be reckoned with. That popularity won him the strong backing of the supreme leader.
 But the relationship began to sour, even before the intelligence estimate was released. A person close to Ayatollah Khamenei, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said the ayatollah was especially disappointed with Mr. Ahmadinejad's economic performance, which has led to steep inflation in the cost of basic necessities, from food to rents to property values.
 ''Mr. Khamenei supported Mr. Ahmadinejad because he believed in his slogans of helping the poor,'' said the person. ''But his economic performance has been disastrous. Their honeymoon is certainly over.'' 
 Economists have long criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad's economic policies, warning that his reliance on oil revenues to finance loans to the poor and to buy cheap imports would lead to inflation and cripple local industries. Inflation has increased to 19 percent currently from 12 percent in October 2006, according to figures released by the Iranian Central Bank.
 Ayatollah Khamenei said Thursday in a speech in the central city of Yazd that ''the government has certain unique characteristics, but like any other government there are mistakes and shortcomings.'' He added that continuous criticism can undermine the government, but he refrained from praising it as he has in the past. 
 There have been several other signs lately that Mr. Ahmadinejad is falling from favor. 
 Recently, the supreme leader appointed a hard-line military leader, Mohammad Zolghadr, as deputy head of the armed forces for Basij, a volunteer militia force. Mr. Ahmadinejad had dismissed Mr. Zolghadr last month as deputy interior minister for security affairs. Mr. Ahmadinejad appeared angered last week by interference from Iran's former chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, who visited Egypt in his capacity as the leader's representative at the Supreme National Security Council. Mr. Ahmadinejad said Wednesday that his government had a Foreign Ministry that determined the country's foreign policy, and a ministry spokesman said Mr. Larijani's trip was personal.
 Mr. Larijani's trip was important because Tehran cut ties with Egypt, a predominantly Sunni country, when Cairo signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1979 and provided asylum for the deposed shah of Iran. Mr. Larijani, who is a close aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, brushed off the remarks from the Foreign Ministry and announced that his talks with the Egyptian authorities had gone well.
 In the face of rising criticism, Mr. Ahmadinejad has for the first time admitted that Iran was suffering from rising prices. Previously, he had called inflation a fiction invented by his political enemies. But he blamed the problem on former governments, Parliament and what he called a 36 percent increase in the price of goods in international markets.
 Mohammad Reza Katouzian, a conservative and onetime supporter of Mr. Ahmadinejad, said recently that the president ''should offer solutions instead of explaining past mistakes,'' the semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported. 
 Hassan Rassouli, head of Baran, a nongovernmental organization created by the previous, reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, after he left office, said Mr. Ahmadinejad tried only to justify inflation, not do anything about it. ''Either the president has no idea how inflation has affected people's lives or he prefers to talk unprofessionally without referring to figures,'' he said, according to the Mehr News Agency. 
 Relations between the United States and Iran will always be difficult -- as the encounter between Iranian speed boats and three United States Navy warships in the Strait of Hormuz on Monday made clear -- but perhaps not impossible, many here are saying. 
 Liberal commentators, here and abroad, have long argued that hard-line policies in the West only strengthen hard-line politicians in Iran, and conversely that lowering the threat level enhances the position of moderates. With conservative politicians who supported Mr. Ahmadinejad in 2005 increasingly turning into his fiercest critics, and with Ayatollah Khamenei saying recently that Iran's lack of contacts with the United States ''does not mean that we will not have relations indefinitely,'' the pundits would seem, for now, to be on the right track.

To the Editor:
 Reading William Kristol's Jan. 7 column, ''President Mike Huckabee?,'' one would come away thinking that President Bush was an outstanding president and that America is enthusiastic to continue his course, with Mr. Huckabee at the helm. In reality, Bush policies and the conservative agenda -- from abortion, Iraq and judicial appointments -- are widely opposed. Most voters want the next president to undo Mr. Bush's legacy, not extend it. 
 Mr. Huckabee may be Mr. Kristol's ''likable regular guy,'' but America has matured. Eight years ago, we elected a president on likeability, and we got one who misguided the nation into war and debt. President Bush's opposition to the ''nanny state'' gave New Orleans an abysmal response to Katrina. 
 America learned the hard way from Mr. Bush. America now wants a progressive president who will face the serious challenges to our nation instead of being ideologically fixated on religion, guns and gays. 
 Joel S. Peskoff Baldwin, N.Y., Jan. 7, 2008
 To the Editor:
 William Kristol may not be ready to sign up for Mike Huckabee, but he certainly savors the ''electorally advantageous'' appeal of Mr. Huckabee's ''socially conservative case.'' 
 The burden of the Republican candidate in 2008 will be to convince the average American, who is struggling with high energy prices, stagnant wages and declining health care benefits, that returning tax rates on upper-income people to pre-Bush tax cut levels is an issue that concerns the middle-class wage earner. 
 Diverting voters from the human and financial consequences of the Iraq war, the faltering economy and health care by raising fears of same-sex marriage, gun control and abortion has worked for Republicans in the past. So it is clear why a Huckabee candidacy would appeal to Mr. Kristol. 
 Mr. Kristol is right, however, to remind Democrats not to underestimate Mr. Huckabee. After all, the last Southern governor to run for president was also a ''nice guy'' whom the average American identified with, and this has produced the most disastrous presidency in the history of our nation.
 Jay N. Feldman Port Washington, N.Y., Jan. 7, 2008

 So William Kristol is afraid of a ''nanny state'' if we elect Barack Obama? I'll take a ''nanny state'' over the $1 trillion debacle in Iraq, billions wasted in New Orleans and a crumbling infrastructure.
 Jim Piga St. Paul, Jan. 7, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 I am a bit confused by Gail Collins. In two columns (''The Slice of the Sliver Speaks,'' Jan. 3, and ''What Would Hillary Rodham Do?'' Jan. 5), she has debunked the Iowa caucuses as being something more in line with Stone Age rather than jet-age politics. 
 There is no question that the Iowa outcome might be altered radically after New Hampshire and all the primaries to follow. But a political discussion with one's neighbors is not a bad idea. Indeed, it takes the electoral process out of the purview of the media and into the public domain, where it belongs. 
 I want to hear real issues being discussed: the economy, the war, health care, the environment, education. This country is in a mess, but if we elect someone without a real conversation about the issues, the mess will never be resolved. 
 I want to see change, but I use that word cautiously. It is has become the catch phrase of an election process, bandied about in the news as if it meant something. It's just a word. I want to hear the content that fills it with meaning. 
 I want to hear the process that will ensure that it's action. Any real debate among these amazing candidates is a good one.

 Re ''Voting for a Smile,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 6):
 There is a Tourette's syndrome-like aura about the Democratic campaign, the verbal tic being the word ''change.'' Even though I am an old man now and set in my ways, I am ready to welcome change, but it must be more than a political mantra only. 
 As a word standing naked, it is flimsy and mighty thin gruel on which to base a presidential vote. Flesh it out please, and do so with specifics.
 As an old-timer, I have been through many of these quadrennial exercises in presidential selection, and I know very well how easily tarnished the best intentions are in the confrontation with Beltway reality. Tell me exactly how you intend to effect change, and I will judge whether you are on to something or just spinning the same old, same old.

 Re ''Daring to Believe, Blacks Savor Obama Victory'' (front page, Jan. 5):
 Blacks are not the only ones who savored Barack Obama's victory over the latent bigotry that pundits thought would defeat him in Iowa. 
 In 1961 -- the very year that Senator Obama was born -- I was one of a handful of white college students who traveled to Baltimore as ''freedom riders'' to integrate lunch counters and other facilities that were segregated there and throughout the South. 
 Afterward we joined up at a local black church, where we linked arms and sang ''We Shall Overcome'' -- a song that I was hearing for the first time and that moved me deeply. Little did I dream that in my lifetime I might conceivably see a black president of the United States! 
 In these terrible times for our country, it gives me hope once again that we can indeed overcome.
 Suzanne Cohn Simon Holmes, N.Y., Jan. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 There is no rush to judgment in New Hampshire's presidential primary (''Let It Start Now,'' editorial, Jan. 4). We take the primary seriously. My two voting-age children, torn between several candidates, made a point of seeing them in person in the last two days. Where else can you do that but in a small state? 
 You seem to think that because our demographics do not match the country's, we are somehow different from people elsewhere. We are not. We care about the same things that you care about in New York: the war in Iraq, available health care, clean air and water, good jobs and justice.
 What makes these early small-state elections so valuable is, we hold the candidates' feet to the fire by asking them eyeball to eyeball why they think a certain way. The candidates must answer back. It makes the candidates more honest. They cannot rely on paid advertising to twist the truth. The voters make better decisions. That's got to be good for voters everywhere. 
 Margaret Landsman Concord, N.H., Jan. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 We are also to blame for the unfair influence that Iowa and New Hampshire have on the presidential primaries. We do not have to submit to the preferences of the people in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 As states hold their primaries over the next several months, I urge voters to make their vote count by not letting the results of Iowa and New Hampshire interfere with their judgment. We are all capable of making sound decisions and do not need the people in Iowa and New Hampshire to make them for us. 
 Let us strive for this individuality even if we cannot change (for now) this absurd undemocratic system of primary elections.

 BODY:
BUSH SEES ECONOMIC TEST President Bush, in a shift from his usual economic assessments, told a group of business leaders in Chicago that the nation faced economic challenges because of rising oil prices, the home mortgage crisis and a weakening job market. ''We cannot take growth for granted,'' Mr. Bush acknowledged that many Americans shared his concern about the economy. 
 TAX CUTS, BUT FOR WHOM? Should President Bush become convinced the economy is headed into recession, he is likely to fight it with tax breaks for businesses and people at all income levels and for businesses. But Democratic leaders may have different tax breaks in mind. [C1.] 
 BEAR CHIEF EXPECTED TO QUIT James E. Cayne, the chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, will step down as chief executive after the sharpest losses in its history, according to people who have been briefed on the situation -- news that comes as federal prosecutors are investigating the firm. [C1.]
 CORPORATE COUNSELOR Martin Lipton, a co-founder of corporate America's favorite law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has the ear of the most powerful corporations in the nation and is the man to call for chief executives under siege by stockholders. DealBook: Andrew Ross Sorkin [C1.]
 GOLDEN GLOBES SHOW REVISED Because of the writers' strike, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association say the Golden Globes awards dinner will be replaced by a series of quasi-news programs framing a press conference on Sunday night to announce the actual winners. [C1.]
 CHEAP TRANSPORTATIONTata Motors of India plans to introduce a ''people's car'' on Thursday, with a hollow steering-wheel shaft, a tiny trunk and a rear-mounted engine. It will sell for the equivalent of about $2,500. [C1.]
 FABRICATED LOAN RECORDSCountrywide Financial Corporation, the giant mortgage lender at the center of the subprime crisis, fabricated documents related to the bankruptcy case of a Pennsylvania homeowner, court records show. [C3.] 
 The mayor and the city council of Baltimore are suing Wells Fargo Bank, claiming that its subprime lending practices discriminated against local African-American borrowers and are causing a rise in foreclosures. [A12.]
 STEWART AND COLBERT RETURN The late-night stars of the Comedy Central cable network, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert, returned to their shows, with Mr. Stewart poking fun at both sides in the writers' strike. [C2.] 
 HEALTH SPENDING SOARED National health spending skyrocketed above $2 trillion for the first time in 2006 and nearly doubled in the last decade, amounting to an average of $7,000 a person, the government has reported. [A20.]
 ALL MOVIES ALL THE TIME Comcast, the nation's largest cable television company, will outline on Tuesday an ambitious plan that is aimed at making a nearly limitless supply of movies and television shows available on television on demand and through the Internet. [C4.]
 GENZYME BUYS RIGHTS TO DRUG Genzyme will pay at least $325 million to win the rights to a potentially powerful cholesterol-lowering drug called mipomerson that is being developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals. [C3.]
 EXECUTIVE SHIFT AT STARBUCKS Howard D. Schultz, below, the chairman and founder of Starbucks who engineered its meteoric rise will take over immediately as chief executive, succeeding James L. Donald, who will leave the company. Mr. Schultz said the company expanded too quickly and ''lost the focus on what we once had, and that is the customer.'' [C4.]
 NEW CHIEF FOR MOZILLAMozilla, the developer of the open-source browser Firefox, plans to announce that John Lilly, the company's chief operating officer, will succeed Mitchell Baker as chief executive as the company seeks to expand its influence. [C4.]
 RECYCLING CELLPHONES The Environmental Protection Agency is partnering with retailers, manufacturers and service providers to begin a campaign to get consumers to recycle their used cellphones. [C7.]
 HOLOCAUST INSURANCE SUIT A federal judge permitted a dispute over unpaid life insurance claims on victims of the Holocaust to move a step closer to a settlement that would provide perhaps an additional $15 million to Holocaust victims and their families. But some oppose the deal. [C10.] 
 A NEW XEROX LOGO Xerox, which is no longer the company that makes stand-alone copiers, it is changing its logo. Advertising. [C11.]

HEADLINE: Starbucks Replaces Chief With Chairman

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
With the stock plummeting and competitors on the attack, Starbucks Coffee said Monday that it was bringing back its top barista to help turn the company around.
 The chairman, Howard D. Schultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 when it had just four stores and engineered the company's rise, will immediately assume the additional role of chief executive. He takes over for James L. Donald, a grocery executive who joined Starbucks in 2002, who will leave the company.
 Mr. Schultz said he would bring a ''laser-like focus'' in making sure that the ''Starbucks experience'' is significantly different from rivals like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts Coffee, which have lured away customers. 
 While higher commodity costs and a slowing economy have hurt Starbucks in the United States, Mr. Schultz said the bigger problem was the company itself, by expanding too quickly and losing its coffee-shop cache. In short, he said, the company had gone from being ''quintessentially entrepreneurial'' to becoming ''soft.''
 ''Successful fast-growing businesses can sometimes find that their success had unintended consequences,'' Mr. Schultz said in a conference call. ''We lost the focus on what we once had, and that is the customer.''
 But Mr. Schultz reiterated that there was ''no short-term fix, no silver bullet.''
 The announcement comes as shares of the company have fallen from $36.29 in January 2007 to $18.38 Monday, after more than a decade of nearly continual growth. Shares rose nearly 9 percent in after-hours trading.
 Starbucks has more than 15,000 stores in 43 countries and $9.4 billion in annual sales. It still plans to expand to 40,000 stores worldwide, though growth in the United States will be slowed.
 Mr. Schultz sounded both angry and exasperated Monday. For instance, he complained that the company had only produced variations of new products in recent years, rather than blockbuster new products, a problem he vowed to remedy. But he acknowledged that he played a role in the company's current woes.
 The problems that Mr. Schultz laid out reflect many of the concerns that he outlined in a Feb. 14, 2007 memorandum to Mr. Donald that was leaked to the media. Titled ''The Commoditization of the Starbucks Experience,'' Mr. Schultz said that rapid growth had ''led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience.''
 For instance, by moving toward flavor-lock bags for coffee, ''we achieved fresh roasted coffee but at what cost? The loss of aroma -- perhaps the most powerful nonverbal signal we had in our stores; the loss of our people scooping up fresh coffee from the bins and grinding it fresh in front of the customer, and once again stripping the store of tradition and our heritage?''
 Mr. Schultz said he would slow the growth of Starbucks in the United States and would close some underperforming restaurants, though he declined to provide more specifics.
 Some of the money slated for expansion in the United States would be shifted overseas, where store openings will be accelerated. Mr. Schultz said the company was not given enough credit by Wall Street for its success overseas, where it operates 5,000 restaurants and where the excitement reminded him of the early days in the United States.
 He said some of the practices that have succeeded in Britain and Canada would be brought back to the United States, though he would not elaborate.
 Though he acknowledged increased competition, he emphasized that the problem was with Starbucks itself. Everything else, he said, was ''just noise.'' ''Starbucks is not a broken company,'' he said. ''Just as we created this problem, we will fix it.''

HEADLINE: Health Spending Exceeded Record $2 Trillion in 2006

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
National health spending soared above $2 trillion for the first time in 2006 and has nearly doubled in the last decade, amounting to an average of $7,000 a person, the government reported on Monday.
 With the advent of a prescription drug benefit in 2006, Medicare spending grew at its fastest pace since 1981, the report said.
Private health insurance spending grew at the slowest rate since 1997, and spending on Medicaid, which covers low-income people, declined for the first time since creation of the program in 1965. 
 Over all, the report said, health spending increased 6.7 percent in 2006, slightly faster than in 2005, and now accounts for 16 percent of the total output of good and services, a slightly larger share than in 2005.
 Introducing the Medicare drug benefit for older Americans and people with disabilities caused changes that rippled through the entire health care sector.
 Health spending by businesses grew 5.7 percent in 2006, to $496.8 billion, the slowest rate of increase since 1997. 
 Aaron C. Catlin, an economist at the Health and Human Services Department, said the ''deceleration in employer payments for private health insurance'' resulted, in part, from the fact that Medicare now subsidized drug costs for many retirees. 
 Employers lobbied for such subsidies when Congress created the benefit.
 Retail spending on prescription drugs shot up 8.5 percent in 2006, to $216.7 billion, in part because more prescriptions were filled by Medicare beneficiaries, especially those lacking drug coverage in the past.
 The increase was much greater than the 5.8 percent increase in 2005, but well below the average increase of 13.4 percent a year from 1995 to 2004.
 Other factors that drove up drug spending included the use of existing drugs for new purposes and the increased use of high-cost biotechnology products, the report said. 
 National health spending first exceeded $1 trillion in 1995. Since then, even when adjusted for inflation, health spending has grown at a rapid clip, increasing 64 percent in 11 years. 
 The data, published in the journal Health Affairs, showed that spending on hospitals, doctors and nursing homes grew more slowly in 2006 than in 2005. But administrative costs increased more than twice as fast. 
 One reason is that private insurance companies have a larger role in Medicare, and they typically have higher administrative costs than the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, federal health economists said.
 Medicare spending increased 18.7 percent in 2006, to $401.3 billion, while spending on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by the federal government and the states, declined 1 percent, to $310.6 billion.
 The new drug benefit contributed to an overall increase in drug spending and a profound shift in who pays. Public programs accounted for 34 percent of retail drug spending in 2006, up from 28 percent in 2005. 
 Medicare's share of drug spending surged, to 18 percent in 2006, from 2 percent in the previous year, while Medicaid's share fell to 9 percent, from 19 percent.
 Mr. Catlin, the economist, said most of the decline in Medicaid spending had occurred because drug costs for six million people shifted to Medicare from Medicaid. 
 The decline also reflects the fact that some states restricted eligibility for Medicaid and froze or reduced payments to health care providers. Enrollment in Medicaid grew two-tenths of 1 percent in 2006, the smallest increase since 1998, the report said.
 Private insurers, which manage the drug benefit for Medicare, negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical companies. The discounts were generally smaller than those provided under Medicaid, the report said. 
 The growth of drug spending in 2006 would have been even higher but for the increased use of generic drugs and the emergence of drug-discount programs at big retailers like Wal-Mart, the report said. 
 In 2006, the figures show 63 percent of prescriptions were filled with generics, an increase from 56 percent in 2005. 
 Analyzing trends over the last two decades, federal researchers found that government programs were paying a larger share of health costs, while households were paying a smaller share and private businesses were paying about the same proportion, 25 percent.
 Despite the attention paid to pharmaceuticals, retail drug spending accounts for just over 10 percent of all health spending. 
 Spending for doctors' services grew 5.9 percent in 2006, to $447.6 billion. This was the slowest rate of growth since 1999 and reflected constraints imposed by Medicare and private insurers. 
 Spending on nursing homes also grew at the slowest pace since 1999, rising 3.5 percent, to $124.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Are We in Danger of Consuming Ourselves Away?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''What's Your Consumption Factor?'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 2), Jared Diamond states that ''per capita consumption rates in China are still about 11 times below ours.'' I would add that while China's per capita carbon emissions are approaching 20 percent of ours, that pollution is mostly for industrial production that supports consumption in the United States and Europe. 
 Mr. Diamond argues that consumption is not necessarily linked to the quality of lifestyle. Europe has a superior lifestyle in areas ranging from life expectancy and infant mortality to leisure time and support for the arts, while it consumes about half as much oil per capita as we do in the United States. 
 But Mr. Diamond does not address the issue of military power (euphemistically called ''security''), which accounts for a significant percentage of our consumption of energy and metals. 
 Interestingly, our gigantic military expenditures and our corresponding colossal consumption of natural resources and energy may in fact be linked to our decreased security. Reducing consumption needs to become a national priority. 
 Lefteris Pavlides Bristol, R.I., Jan. 2, 2008
 The writer is the director of the Wind Power Rhode Island Project.
 To the Editor:
 Jared Diamond makes the crucially important case that if we are to have hope for a sustainable future, people in the developed world must decrease their consumption of natural resources. 
 An equally important point should also be made: that our consumption (or effective use) of human creativity needs to increase. 
 We have a vast need for effective use of human creativity in designing and building the nonpolluting energy system that will replace the current one based on fossil fuels. 
 There is a pressing need for dramatic improvements in health care, education, transportation and housing. Meeting that need with huge investments of creativity, rather than with natural resources, is the key to building a future that combines sustainability with a vibrant economy. 
 Christopher Field Stanford, Calif., Jan. 2, 2008
 The writer is the director of the department of global ecology, Carnegie Institution for Science.
 To the Editor: 
 The total impact of human activities on our planet is the product of (1) the number of people, (2) the consumption per person and (3) the environmental burden per unit of consumption. 
 Clearly, all three factors must be addressed (in some debatable proportion) to achieve a sustainable planet. 
 The environmental impact per unit of consumption can be modified in salutary ways by seriously adopting such ready-to-use measures as more energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy sources and more rational energy use patterns (for example, mass transit and hybrid vehicles, not Hummers and S.U.V.'s). 
 Unfortunately, recent trends indicate that fast-growing economies like China's -- with the opportunity to get it right the first time -- may be developing in the worst possible way. 
 Paul Weinberger Farmington Conn., Jan. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Jared Diamond states that ''there will be more terrorist attacks against us and Europe, and perhaps against Japan and Australia'' as long as those in countries with lower rates of consumption ''believe their chances of catching up to be hopeless.''
 That hardly accounts for 15 of the 19 hijackers who attacked on 9/11 who were citizens of Saudi Arabia, one of the world's richest countries, as well as terrorists from wealthy backgrounds in Germany, Britain, Japan and the United States who marched with terrorism for reasons other than their countries' consumption levels.

HEADLINE: American Motherhood and the Question of Home Birth

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''The Business of Being Born'' is a passionate ground-level examination of home childbirth, anchored in a scene in which its executive producer, Ricki Lake, the actress and former talk-show host, gives birth to her second child in a bathtub. That graphic scene, and several other unblinking sequences of home birth attended by a midwife, are intended to erase any stigma from the situation. Practiced widely in Europe and Japan, home birth has largely disappeared in the United States, the documentary states, because of an image as a primitive, unsanitary ritual. 
 The statistics cited in the film suggest that the revolution in childbirth from home to hospital was spurred by technology, which increasingly turned it into a surgical procedure involving multiple, often unnecessary interventions. In 1900 95 percent of births in the United States took place at home. By 1938 the number had shrunk to half. Today the number is less than 1 percent. 
 As the film enumerates disadvantages of hospital births, conspiracy theorists might detect a plot by the medical establishment to take control of a process for both economic and psychological reasons. But the medical establishment would argue that a hospital is the safest place to give birth because if something goes wrong, speed is essential. ''The Business of Being Born'' is not overtly political. Its feminism is palpable but unspoken. 
 Here are some of the disadvantages laid out in the film: Obstetricians have surgical training, but the film contends that many have never seen a fully natural birth and are therefore unprepared to supervise one. Because hospitals are businesses that thrive on a high turnover, drugs to induce and speed labor (and that often make it more intense and painful) serve the system by filling and emptying beds at a faster rate. 
 There are horror stories here of widely accepted medical practices that were subsequently shown to be dangerous to a newborn. The administration of the drug scopolamine in the '40s, '50s and '60s was supposed to stop pain but, the documentary says, eliminated the memory of pain, often leaving the mother suffering post-traumatic stress. The taking of X-rays of the pelvis was common until the discovery that some babies developed cancer as a result. The use of the infamous drug thalidomide for morning sickness was found to cause birth defects. In the 1990s the drug Cytotec to stimulate contractions was found to cause ruptured uteruses. 
 The movie sharply criticizes the ''lithotomy'' position, in which the mother, lying on her back, is encouraged to ''push.'' Because it makes the pelvis smaller, that position increases the likelihood of having to deliver a baby with forceps or a vacuum extractor. Squatting is much less stressful for the mother, but more so for the doctor, who must catch the baby. The natural births in the film, including Ms. Lake's, are carried out in a squatting position in warm water with a midwife and loved ones at hand. 
 The one exception in the movie is the breach-birth hospital delivery of Abby Epstein, the film's director and one of its producers. (Her husband, Paulo Netto, is one of its producers as well as its cinematographer.) The movie's recognition that natural childbirth in the home isn't the answer for everyone keeps ''The Business of Being Born'' from turning into a one-note polemic. 
 Increasingly, the use of a Caesarean section, once the last resort in the event of an emergency, has become commonplace because it is so efficient. But as one expert after another points out, a C-section is major surgery. Although a woman's first C-section poses few risks, the dangers of serious complications increase with each repetition. It is also very expensive. 
 The cost of our blind trust in hospital technology, the film implies, is reflected in the United States infant-mortality rate, the second-highest in industrialized countries. What accounts for that fact? ''The Business of Being Born'' suggests that a cultural aversion to natural home childbirth is a contributing factor. 
 THE BUSINESS OF BEING BORN
 Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Abby Epstein; director of photography, Paulo Netto; edited by Madeleine Gavin; produced by Ms. Epstein, Amy Slotnick and Mr. Netto; released by Red Envelope Entertainment and International Film Circuit. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Young and Broke in the City, but Staying Afloat

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER

 BODY:
As hosts of a small gathering the other night to watch a college football game, Brian Markey and his roommate, Owen Cahillane, hustled to get their place ready, which took a startling amount of time, considering that it has only 250 square feet of space. They live on a houseboat in the Bronx, on a finger of water that is formally known as Westchester Creek. It is close to the elbow of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Cross Bronx Expressway, in a pocket of the city that is in no immediate danger of becoming the new Williamsburg.
 Mr. Markey, 25, found the houseboat, the Pee Jay, after seeing an ad for a rental that was only a seven-minute canoe ride to the Whitestone Multiplex. 
 On Monday evening, to get a signal for their television, he and Mr. Cahillane, 28, turned to the neighboring houseboat, which is vacant because of an unfortunate tilting episode but still has a handsome, and functioning, satellite dish. They ran a cable from the dish through a window into their living room. By pulling as far and as hard as possible, the cable just reached the television set. 
 ''It's like when they bring the chains out to measure a first down,'' Mr. Markey said triumphantly.
 The cable cut the room in half, but the guests, arriving with beer and a pot of red beans and rice, simply ducked beneath it. They were friends who had gone to college in New Orleans, and most of them had moved to the city in the past six months. Like their hosts, they, too, are chronically broke and accustomed to physical discomfort. These are New Yorkers in the larval stage.
 ''The novelty of a party on a houseboat gets people here,'' said Mr. Markey, who works as a gardener in a Bronx park. ''If we advertised it as a party in a small room a few blocks off the 6 train, I doubt we'd get many.''
 Perched on the edge of a sagging sofa, next to a pine twig that had been stuck in a beer bottle -- a Christmas tree, houseboat-size -- Dominique Ellis, 23, who works in marketing, confessed that she had wanted to compare the houseboat with the basement in Astoria, Queens, that she shares with three unemployed actors.
 ''I had no idea,'' Ms. Ellis said, ''that accommodations such as these were just 28 subway stops away.''
 After spending a few nights on the boat, Lizzie Ford-Madrid, 24, noticed a mini-rain forest effect. The faintly dank odor becomes less noticeable the more you breathe it. The $800 rent includes propane heat, but it is tricky to adjust. The result, Mr. Cahillane said, is that the top half of the body can be quite warm while everything below the waist is freezing. 
 ''There are some problems with the moisture,'' said Mr. Cahillane, who returned last month from a yearlong fellowship with Catholic Relief Services in Latin America and is looking for work. ''I dropped the soap in the shower and literally could not see it in the steam to pick it up.'' 
 Ms. Ford-Madrid, who works as a production assistant at Nickelodeon, has sleeping rights to a sofa in an apartment in Borough Park, Brooklyn. ''My roommate is a third-year resident at Maimonides, so it's cheap hospital housing,'' she said. ''He's friends with a friend of mine in New Orleans, and he said, 'Oh yeah, you can stay on my couch.' ''
 She came north during the summer with Samantha McKinney, 24, who now works at an art gallery in Chelsea and lives above a wheelchair store in Williamsburg. ''My roommate has a wheelchair she spray-painted gold that she uses at her desk,'' Ms. McKinney noted.
 In separate police blotter moments, Ms. Ford-Madrid and Ms. Ellis each had a purse stolen in bars. ''Some woman came into the bar like a housewife of Orange County -- only a 50-year-old hussy,'' Ms. Ford-Madrid said, as if such a profile were inherently bad. ''She went on a shopping spree at Brooklyn gas stations.''
 Things felt secure on the houseboat. Occasionally, someone going for a beer would knock the cable out of the television set, temporarily interrupting Louisiana State's blowout of No. 1-ranked Ohio State in the Bowl Championship Series title game. Everyone at the party was connected somehow through Loyola University New Orleans. Mr. Markey graduated from there in 2005; Mr. Cahillane grew up with him in Springfield, Mass.
 At night, one roommate gets the arthritic sofa, the other, a foam chair that unfolds to bed length. They are not sure how long their residency on Westchester Creek will last, for all its charms. ''At low tide, the bluefish will chase the little shiners, and they'll jump in the air, and the seagulls are waiting to get them,'' Mr. Markey said. ''The food chain.''
 Ms. Ford-Madrid took her spot on the New York food chain in a moment of pure impulse. ''Samantha and I worked at the same restaurant, and I turned to her one night and said, 'Samantha, let's move to New York,''' she said. ''That was it. Just came here on a nickel and a wish.''

HEADLINE: Realtors' Index Shows Dip For Existing-Home Sales

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Pending home sales dipped in November, a trade group for real estate agents said on Tuesday, but the association expects sales to pick up in the second half of 2008. 
 In the latest indication that the housing market's struggles are not over, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes fell 2.6 percent to a reading of 87.6 from an upwardly revised 89.9 in October.
 Analysts warned of continued problems in the housing market.
 ''The best thing you can say about pending home sales is that they aren't getting much worse,'' Michael D. Larson, a real estate analyst at Weiss Research in Jupiter, Fla., said in a statement. But with the labor market weakening, ''you have the recipe for ongoing trouble in housing.'' 
 In a speech on Tuesday, the chief executive of the mortgage finance company Fannie Mae, Daniel H. Mudd, said home prices would ''perhaps begin to gain modestly'' in 2010.
 The Realtors index, which was down 19.2 percent from a year ago, hit a record low of 85.5 in August at the peak of the worldwide credit squeeze.
 Typically there is a one- to two-month lag between the time that a buyer signs a home sales contract and the closing of the deal. So the November reading should reflect sales that were completed last month and into this month.
 An index reading of 100 is equal to the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started.
 Final results for existing-home sales in 2007 -- to be released this month -- are expected to be down 12.7 percent from 6.48 million in 2006, the Realtors group said.
 The trade group also projected existing-home sales would increase 0.9 percent this year to 5.7 million, up from a projected 5.65 million last year. The 2008 forecast was unchanged from last month. The group also forecast 5.91 million home sales in 2009.
 ''The exact timing and the strength of a home sales recovery are a bit uncertain,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, said in a statement. ''A meaningful recovery in existing-home sales could occur as early as this spring, or it may be further delayed toward late 2008.''
 In other economic news, the Federal Reserve reported a rebound in consumer borrowing during November as credit card debt posted its biggest gain in six months.
 The Fed said Tuesday that consumer credit shot up at an annual rate of 7.4 percent after a gain of 1 percent in October.
 The category that includes credit card debt was up at an annual rate of 11.3 percent, reflecting shoppers' use of the cards to finance purchases now that home equity lines of credit are harder to get.
 The category that includes auto loans rose in November, but at a more moderate rate of 5.1 percent after having fallen 3.5 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Was Divided Over Outlook For Economy

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Reflecting a highly uncertain and divided outlook on monetary policy, regional Federal Reserve banks supported three options for the discount rate last month, according to minutes of the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released Tuesday. 
 With suggestions ranging from no change to an aggressive half-point cut, the committee ended up splitting the difference. The committee, the Fed's most important policy-making panel, voted last month to lower the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from it by a quarter-point, to 4.75 percent.
 The Fed also lowered its primary policy instrument, the federal funds rate at which banks lend to each other, by a quarter-point, to 4.25 percent.
 The central bank has cut the discount rate by one and a half percentage points since August to bolster liquidity in credit markets. It has also lowered the fed funds rate by a total of one percentage point since September. The Fed is expected to cut both rates even further amid signs that the housing and credit crunch is starting to grip the broader economy.
 Directors at seven regional Fed banks -- Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., and St. Louis -- requested a quarter-point discount rate cut. Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco preferred a half-point reduction; Dallas and Kansas City, Mo., wanted the Fed to keep the discount rate at 5 percent.
 Banks backing a quarter-point point cut ''agreed that the downside risks to economic growth had increased and that conditions in financial markets had recently deteriorated,'' according to the minutes, which covered meetings on Dec. 10 and 11. Those favoring a half-point cut ''expressed similar concerns'' but thought financial conditions and the economic outlook required a more decisive move.
 Directors at the Kansas City and Dallas Fed banks, in contrast, thought the data was ''within their expectations'' and that the situation in credit markets was a ''necessary adjustment,'' the minutes said. The directors also said that continued inflation risks offset the risks to the economy.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Learn How to Be Businesslike

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
When Gabriel R. Munson graduated from law school in 2003, his goal was to have his own practice someday, modeling himself after Atticus Finch, the small-town lawyer in Harper Lee's classic ''To Kill a Mockingbird.'' 
 ''He's pretty much the idea of what a great lawyer should be, and a good human being,'' Mr. Munson said. ''Courage, compassion, rationality -- he's what kind of inspires me and makes me strive to be a better lawyer.'' 
 But when Mr. Munson set out on his own last spring, after leaving his first job with the Legal Aid Society, he quickly realized that whatever he knew about law would not help him much in private practice, which is essentially running a small business.
 ''It's a totally different mind-set,'' said Mr. Munson, 42. ''You're thinking, how do I generate a salary? Should I hire an employee? How do I go about doing that?''
 Mr. Munson is getting answers to those questions through a so-called incubator program established by his alma mater, the City University of New York School of Law, for its graduates. 
 The program aims to help and encourage new lawyers to go into private practice on their own in communities where there are few lawyers, and where people cannot afford to pay hundreds of dollars per hour for legal service. For 18 months, it offers training by experienced practitioners in all matters of building a law practice: drumming up business, keeping accurate books, and hiring and firing. 
 ''We're helping lawyers, and we're providing them with support and professional development skills, but it's all done with the goal of having them set up practices where access to justice is extremely limited,'' said Fred Rooney, director of external relations at CUNY School of Law and one of the creators of the incubator. ''That's most of the city.''
 The effort is financed by CUNY and with money from the state. Participants pay a low monthly rent for office space and supplies on Fifth Avenue, at 27th Street, in the office of Laura Gentile, a CUNY law graduate who has a small firm. She is also one of the teachers in the program.
 ''I will teach them everything from how to analyze and select a malpractice policy, to how to manage their money so they never fall off the edge of doom,'' Ms. Gentile said. She also tries to teach about coping with uncertainty, which she said was a critical real-world skill. 
 ''Sometimes you realize that in two months you're not going to have the rent,'' Ms. Gentile said. ''It can be really scary, but the solution does come.''
 Six lawyers are in the program now, with space for two more. Mr. Rooney said he plans to expand the initiative to 12 lawyers next year.
 Fatai O. Lawal, a Nigerian lawyer who has passed the New York bar and who worked at CUNY's law school as a security guard after coming to the United States, is one of this year's participants. Mr. Lawal said he already had several clients with immigration matters, so far mostly citizenship applications. 
 ''Before I heard about this incubator program, I was working from home,'' said Mr. Lawal, who is building his practice while also working for the city's Correction Department as a legal coordinator with inmates at Rikers Island. ''This is a great opportunity to get an office in Manhattan, for a cheaper price.''
 Mr. Lawal said he tried to keep his fees low, adding that he charged one financially strapped family $250 for helping with an application to move additional family members to the United States. Another lawyer had wanted $1,000, he said.
 The CUNY program raises a question that law schools are increasingly grappling with: Why are their students, after three years of intellectually demanding training, not ready to practice as soon as they pass a bar exam?
 ''Law schools have an aspiration to be a part of an academic research community,'' not trade schools focused on teaching practical skills, said Deborah L. Rhode, a law professor and the director of the Center on Ethics at Stanford, who has written about access to legal representation in the United States. 
 Even though students may participate in clinical programs in which they represent real clients, Professor Rhode said, ''We don't teach practice management skills, we don't teach human resources, we don't teach lots of what students need to run an effective practice.''
 Mr. Rooney said he wanted to start the program in part because of his own painful learning experience in 1987, when he first hung out his shingle because the pay in his public-sector job was too low to support his young family. 
 Without mentors or teachers, Mr. Rooney recalled that he had to learn how to find clients and how to make and handle money. ''With a lot of hard work and sacrifice and sweat equity and you name it, we created an economically viable practice,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Be Heard Above the Din, and Be Trusted

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
IN bank advertising, what matters is getting noticed at a time when the airwaves are cluttered, customers are nervous and marketing budgets are being slashed. JPMorgan Chase has that in mind with a sleek new brand campaign aimed at unifying its consumer advertising, streamlining its message and stretching the dollars it spends. 
 ''Chase What Matters,'' the tagline and theme of the campaign, will be introduced on Sunday with a series of print ads in major newspapers, followed by four television commercials that will be broadcast in rotation on Monday morning's network news programs. Chase executives say that they will spend more than $70 million in the next two and half months. 
 The campaign, created by Mcgarrybowen in New York, is the first overhaul of Chase's brand advertising since its 2004 merger with Bank One. The ads, in black and white with the Chase name highlighted in blue, strive for a contemporary feel and will be used throughout the bank's wide range of consumer businesses, including credit cards, student loans and retail banking. They also promote the concrete, immediate benefits that bank products and services can provide, like fraud and overdraft alerts. 
 ''A lot of advertising is more aspirational,'' said Charles W. Scharf, the head of JPMorgan's retail division, who helped lead the rebranding effort. ''What we do for customers is what we should be talking about.'' 
 Standing out from the pack is hard to do in banking; other than the interest rate, there is little difference between mortgages and home equity loans. Consumers are increasingly anxious about their finances and skeptical of the customer-service sales pitch. And banks, some marketers say, are suffering a crisis of trust on top of the recent credit crisis and housing market slowdown. 
 ''The promise of the bank experience is much like the promise of the airline experience,'' said Hayes Roth, the chief marketing officer at Landor Associates, a brand strategy firm. ''There is a lot of lovely talk -- we're here for you -- but I don't think anyone believes it.''
 Chase is also entering a crowded field. The nation's three biggest banks each spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on advertising. Over the last year, all three have shaken up their strategies and introduced new branding campaigns. And some other big players are expected to announce new campaigns soon.
 In February, Bank of America rechristened itself the ''Bank of Opportunity'' in a campaign aimed at appealing to its broad range of customers, from immigrants and first-time home buyers to the wealthy clients of its private bank. 
 Under a new marketing chief, it opened its work to multiple firms after five years of having a single advertising holding company in charge of its marketing communications. BBDO Worldwide in New York, the Omnicom Group firm that created the Bank of Opportunity campaign, remains its lead creative agency. 
 In April, Citigroup announced a new slogan and branding campaign that replaced its iconic umbrella with a stylized red arc and made a more emotional appeal to customers and employees. The slogan -- ''Let's Get It Done!'' -- also serves as a rallying cry for the beleaguered company. 
 That campaign, the first to unify the brand advertising across the bank's disparate operations, was led by the Seattle office of Publicis, which took over management of bank's consumer advertising from Fallon in Minneapolis. Both are units of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe.
 Chase's new brand campaign is the first time the company will apply the same strategy to all of its consumer businesses. But unlike its main rivals, it is keeping its lead agency for the last four years, Mcgarrybowen. The agency also does the brand advertising for the company's institutional businesses, which operate under the JPMorgan name. 
 Chase executives are forgoing the brand anthem spots typically used to introduce campaigns, focusing on their products and capabilities instead. But the new ads are intended to create a consistent image. 
 ''Energy is a thread that you will see throughout the work. It's upbeat, it's contemporary, it's modern,'' said Bill Borrelle, the Mcgarrybowen executive in charge of the Chase account. When ''Chase'' is used as a verb, he noted, it ''has a lot of energy and pursuit behind it.'' One television spot, in which an ordinary man makes a James Bond-like entrance, highlights Chase's fraud alert service. Other newspaper, magazine and TV ads use rock climbers, diners and a shopper in motion to promote its mobile banking, its ubiquitous cash machines and its customer rewards. 
 Chase spots also appear on billboards, bus kiosks and taxis and in movie theaters. The Think Tank, or T3, a boutique agency in New York, is assisting Mcgarrybowen and Chase executives with the online campaign. 
 What unites the campaign is the black-and-white photography, the deep blue Chase name and octagonal logo, and the ''Matters'' tagline. 
 Of course, what matters to many Chase customers is better customer service. Bank executives vow to improve that service, but maintain that making it a pillar of their advertising would not work. 
 ''Service is something that needs to be proved,'' Mr. Scharf said. ''It's demonstrated in the branch every day. It's pass-fail.''

HEADLINE: California Pension Fund Expected to Take Big Stake in Silver Lake, at $275 Million

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Silver Lake, the largest technology-focused private equity firm, has reached a deal to sell a 9.9 percent stake to the California Public Employees' Retirement System for about $275 million, according to people briefed on the deal. 
 The transaction, which values Silver Lake at about $2.75 billion, is expected to be announced Wednesday, said these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. Over the years, Silver Lake has made investments in businesses including Ameritrade, Avaya, Business Objects, Flextronics, Instinet, MCI, Nasdaq, Seagate Technology and SunGard.
 The deal comes amid a credit crunch is preventing buyout firms from making acquisitions. As questions about the economy persist, investors have become nervous about the health of many private equity investments because of the debt that they have to service. Flextronics, one of Silver Lake's investments, is among the companies that investors are concerned about. 
 Shares of buyout firms that have gone public, like the Blackstone Group, have been battered badly. On Tuesday, Blackstone's shares fell to their all-time low, down 7.3 percent, to $18. 
 Even so other private equity firms have been seeking to go public or sell stakes to outside investors. Within the past year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts filed for an initial public offering, Apollo Management sold a 9 percent stake to Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and the Carlyle Group sold a 7.5 percent stake to Abu Dhabi as well.
 The investment by CalPERS in Silver Lake is clearly a vote of confidence in the firm, which is increasing its presence internationally, at a time of uncertainty. CalPERS, which has been an investor in Silver Lake's funds since 1999, has taken stakes in rival funds, among them Apollo and Carlyle.
 CalPERS invests in these firms directly, not just in their funds as a limited partner, giving it access to the 20 percent of the profits and 2 percent of the fees that the firms collect from investors in their funds. 
 The CalPERS investment also gives the pension fund access to co-invest with Silver Lake in certain investments. As part of the deal, CalPERS has committed to make additional investments in Silver Lake's funds and will have a seat on the firm's management advisory board. 
 At about $2.75 billion, Silver Lake's valuation appears rich compared with some of its competitors, though it is hard to make a direct comparison because it is private and does not disclose its financial details. 
 While Blackstone is valued at $19.5 billion in the stock market, that firm manages almost $90 billion, while Silver Lake manages just $16 billion. Based on assets under management, Silver Lake would be valued at about 5.8 times its assets, while Blackstone is valued at 4.6 times. 
 However, Silver Lake's assets have not been fully calculated. The firm is raising two new funds, Silver Lake Sumeru, the firm's middle-market investing strategy, and Silver Lake Financial, the firm's credit investment group, according to people briefed on them.

HEADLINE: Loss Mounts for KB Home, and Builder Warns of More Distress Ahead

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
KB Home, the large home builder, said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter loss swelled as the housing slowdown led to fewer sales and lower revenue. As a result, the company booked charges related to a write-down of unsold inventory and a tax allowance. 
 Its shares tumbled $1.70, to close at $16.78.
 The chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, warned in a statement that 2008 would be ''another tough year for the home building industry.''
 The sector has been struggling through a slowdown and a tight credit market prompted by last summer's jump in defaults and foreclosures on subprime home loans made to people with credit problems.
 That has left many would-be buyers reluctant to enter the market until signs of improvement emerge. Many other buyers, meanwhile, have been unable to get financing because lenders stung by rising loans gone bad have tightened qualification criteria.
 Mr. Mezger said in a conference call with analysts that there were no indications that housing markets were stabilizing and noted that consumer confidence needed to be restored before things could improve.
 To deal with the slowdown, he said, KB Home has cut costs, focused on building more affordable homes aimed at first-time buyers and sold off nonperforming assets.
 For the quarter that ended Nov. 30, the company had a loss of $772.7 million, or $9.99 a share, compared with a loss of $49.6 million, or 64 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
 The builder, based in Los Angeles, took a pretax charge of $403.4 million to write down unsold inventory and book losses from joint ventures. The company also booked a $514.2 million tax valuation allowance that it can use to offset future profits.
 Excluding the tax allowance, its loss was $399 million compared with $171.1 million last year.
 Revenue fell 31 percent to $2.07 billion from $3.01 billion in the quarter a year ago, but exceeded Wall Street estimates for $1.77 billion.
 KB Home said the revenue decline largely reflected a 22 percent drop in new-home deliveries, which fell to 8,132 compared with 10,386 in the quarter of 2006. The average selling price of the company's homes also fell, down 12 percent to $247,800 from $280,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006.

HEADLINE: Corzine Proposes a Steep Rise in Tolls to Help Cut Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and KEN BELSON; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine proposed the biggest financial maneuver in New Jersey's history on Tuesday, arguing that drastically increasing highway tolls over the next 15 years could generate as much as $38 billion to help the state pay off half its debt and finance transportation improvements.
 Drivers would face a 50 percent increase in tolls on the state's three toll roads -- the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway -- every four years, beginning in 2010. The tolls would rise further with inflation. In addition, a portion of a fourth highway -- Route 440 leading from the intersection of the Turnpike and the Parkway in Woodbridge to the Outerbridge Crossing -- would become a toll road.
 ''It's not something I want to do,'' Mr. Corzine said in his State of the State address before the new Legislature, whose members were sworn in earlier on Tuesday. ''It's something we have to do. This proposal is a solution -- a solution to restore the state's financial integrity, health and capacity.'' 
 To carry out his proposal, Mr. Corzine, who made his fortune cobbling together complex financial deals on Wall Street, would need the blessing of the markets to embrace a bond issue that would dwarf the largest bond deal ever undertaken by the state, an $8.6 billion issue in 2003 for school construction.
 While a number of states, including Pennsylvania and California, are struggling to come up with the money to repair their roads and bridges, fiscal experts say Mr. Corzine's plan to repair its transportation infrastructure and halve its $32 billion in debt is the most unusual and complicated among states that have considered leveraging their toll roads to generate more money, fiscal experts say.
 But unlike Indiana or Chicago, which have leased some roads to private companies, New Jersey would continue to own its toll roads. To minimize political interference, Mr. Corzine said the state would establish two nonprofit corporations, one to operate and maintain the roads, and the other to provide oversight.
 Anticipation over the plan has been building since Mr. Corzine first suggested the need to draw money from New Jersey's assets in his State of the State message a year ago. But Mr. Corzine has been delayed in rolling out his plan, first by a serious car accident in April, then by his own propensity to take his time making decisions. 
 With polls consistently showing that most New Jerseyans opposed the idea of refinancing the toll roads, Mr. Corzine has encountered stiff resistance from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
 But now Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who was elected in 2005 after campaigning largely on his financial acumen, has vowed to stake his political future on his plan. To sell it, he plans to hold public meetings in all 21 counties, with the first to take place on Saturday in Livingston, an affluent and educated suburb that Democrats say might be more receptive to Mr. Corzine's ideas. 
 And with the state grappling with debt that has climbed from $13 billion to $32 billion in less than a decade and with the highest property taxes in the country, Mr. Corzine said that New Jersey could wait no longer. 
 ''The public must be put back in charge of the state's credit card,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, the ability to borrow is a privilege that's been abused to the point that the public has pretty much told us they no longer trust our judgment.''
 To win this battle, he plans to spend part of his vast wealth on public service announcements for television and radio promoting his plan. And he challenged legislators -- a third of whom were sworn in Tuesday -- to adopt his proposal before the July 1 budget deadline.
 If the state fails to enact his plan, Mr. Corzine warned, the alternatives include raising the gas tax by at least 12 cents a gallon, the income tax by 20 percent or the sales tax by 30 percent.
 ''Do the numbers,'' he implored. ''I have.''
 As he put it, ''Pigs will fly over the State House before there is a realistic level of new taxes or spending cuts that can fix this mess.''
 Under the plan, a public benefit corporation, which would operate and maintain the roads, would be created to issue up to $38 billion in bonds to generate a quick cash infusion. The bonds, which would be issued in stages within a year of legislative approval, would be backed by the toll revenues.
 In addition, a public interest corporation would be created to monitor and approve the directors of the other corporation. 
 In an effort to assuage fears that politicians and lobbyists may view his plan as creating a giant piggy bank, Mr. Corzine said that all the proceeds would be used for two purposes only: reducing the state's debt, which could save as much as $960 million a year in annual debt payments, and replenishing the Transportation Trust Fund for capital and repair projects, which is scheduled to be depleted by 2011.
 For the average driver on the Turnpike, the governor said, the proposal would mean that the typical one-way trip -- spanning three exits -- would go from $1.20 to $2.05 in five years, and to $5.85 in 10 years.
 To make his case, Mr. Corzine pointed out that the state's toll roads were among the least costly in the nation. Tolls have increased on the New Jersey Turnpike only five times in its half-century history; the last increase, of 17 percent, was in 2003. The Garden State Parkway, the nation's busiest toll road, has had one increase in its half-century history, in 1989.
 To demonstrate that he was serious about fiscal restraint, the governor also pledged to freeze state spending in next year's budget at the current level, and to push for a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval for most future borrowing.
 Mr. Corzine will need approval from the Senate and the Assembly, both controlled by Democrats. On Tuesday, the top two legislators -- Senate President Richard J. Codey and Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. -- embraced the governor's proposals.
 ''I think it was a tremendous home run for him today,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''If we can minimize the politics and maximize the degree to which this is a policy discussion, the governor is going to be successful.''
 For their part, Republicans said that while they were pleased by Mr. Corzine's pledge to freeze spending, they viewed the proposed toll increases as taxes on drivers.
 Senator Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Red Bank, said the governor's plan amounted to ''decrying the credit card mentality but yet then proposing to take out a Visa platinum card to pay for the fiscal woes of the state.'' 
 ''No one should be fooled,'' she added. ''You're borrowing to pay for borrowed money. It'd be like taking out a home equity loan to pay for your mortgage. It's the wrong way.''

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Acts on California's Big Deficits

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Facing chronic budget problems as well as a short-term deficit bigger than many states' annual revenues, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday proposed amending the California Constitution to give governors new budgetary powers, including the ability to cut spending in the middle of a fiscal year. 
 The proposal, introduced in Mr. Schwarzenegger's State of the State address to lawmakers in Sacramento, comes as officials estimate a $14 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months. 
 ''For several years, we kept the budget wolf from the door,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''But the wolf is back.''
 Two-thirds approval of each house of the Legislature would be required simply to put the amendment before voters, and so the proposal would do nothing to ease the current shortfall.
 To deal with that, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a second-term Republican, is set to declare a fiscal state of emergency on Thursday to bring the Democratic-controlled Legislature into special session starting immediately. Waiting for the lawmakers will be an austere budget for the new fiscal year, starting in July, that the governor said would include no new taxes.
 States across the country are confronted with significant budget problems, as questions about the economy, and the housing crisis in particular, continue to throw a shadow upon statehouses. Other big states like Florida, New York and New Jersey face sizable deficits, according to budget experts, in part because of a housing-related decline in property and sales tax revenue.
 And things could get worse. 
 ''We are right on the precipice,'' said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''If we have more bad economic times, state revenue is just going to crash.''
 Nowhere are the deficit projections bigger than in California, where Mr. Schwarzenegger acknowledged Tuesday that he had brought some of his problems on himself by backing ballot measures that safeguarded spending on transportation and local government, as well as curbing a lucrative car tax.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger likened the effects of California's spending habits to ''sugar highs.''
 ''Then the sugar is gone, and we come down off our high,'' he said. ''We spend it all one year and can't sustain it the next. We need to budget more evenly.''
 To that end, the governor's proposed constitutional amendment would cap, at levels geared to long-term prior revenue, the amount of money available for spending. Whatever was left over would be put into a ''rainy day account'' to offset deficits during lean years.
 The amendment would also require automatic midyear cuts of 2 percent to 5 percent in programs designated by the Legislature if state tax revenue started to fall short of projections. But even deeper cuts could be imposed by the governor in periods of severe fiscal crisis or if the Legislature could not agree on its own reductions. The Senate president pro tem, Don Perata, Democrat of Oakland, was quick to condemn that provision, calling it ''political expediency at its best and political leadership at its worst.'' 
 But the amendment's promise of a de facto spending cap seemed to offer a measure of detente between Mr. Schwarzenegger and fellow Republicans in the Legislature, who have been alienated by his close working relationship with many Democrats. 
 ''I think the governor is philosophically opposed to taxes, as we are,'' said Michael N. Villines, the Republican leader of the State Assembly. ''We have a spending problem in this state, not a revenue problem.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger echoed that sentiment, promising to deliver on Thursday a ''difficult'' budget, totaling roughly $141 billion, with no new taxes and only small increases in spending.
 ''We now have no way out,'' the governor said, ''except to face our budget demons.''

HEADLINE: Amazon Consolidates in Growing Area of Seattle

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
Amazon.com, the world's largest online retailer, will soon finally have one place to call home.
 The company is moving all of its administrative employees, who are now scattered in offices around Seattle, to a single location in the city. It will be the first time all of these employees are together since the founding of Amazon more than a decade ago.
 The company is more than doubling its office space. It is also betting that its profits will remain high. If Amazon exercises all of its options, it may spend as much as $1.5 billion under a 16-year agreement to lease 11 buildings in South Lake Union, a lakefront neighborhood a little more than a mile north of downtown.
 Construction begins this month, and Amazon's 4,000 employees are expected to start moving in a little over two years to a campus that will eventually occupy six blocks. ''The beauty of South Lake Union is that it gives us space for now and room to grow,'' said Patty Smith, an Amazon spokeswoman. 
 Amazon joins a long list of companies gambling on South Lake Union, a neighborhood largely controlled by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft.
 In only five years, Mr. Allen, who owns 60 acres in the area through his company Vulcan Real Estate, has been quickly transforming the neighborhood from an industrial hub into a high-tech playground with soaring condominium towers, eclectic restaurants and sleek office buildings. Vulcan is the lead developer of the Amazon project.
 Mr. Allen became a property owner in South Lake Union when there was a proposal in the mid-1990s to create a large city park in an area that was a hodgepodge of car dealerships, warehouses, shipyards and stores. Mr. Allen lent $20 million to park supporters, who then bought 10 acres of land. When voters rejected the proposal, he got the land.
 He then started snapping up more land and eventually amassed 60 acres for more than $250 million. His vision is to put up 10 million square feet of office, medical and residential space. In less than four years, a quarter of it has already been built, and Vulcan estimates it has $1.8 billion invested in South Lake Union.
 The tenants read like a who's who of Seattle. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; REI, the retailer of outdoor gear; ZymoGenetics, a biotech company; and Tommy Bahama, a clothing company, all call the area home. And in the last year, Microsoft signed a lease for 126,000 square feet of space; the Group Health Cooperative, a nonprofit health care system, moved its headquarters there; and the University of Washington's School of Medicine is expanding its biomedical research campus. 
 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is putting up a 12-acre campus nearby and Seattle Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center is assembling a 1.5-million-square-foot research campus.
 The moves have helped shave vacancy rates and prop up rents in South Lake Union. Since 2005, the average vacancy rate there has shrunk by half, to 6.2 percent last year, which is lower than downtown, according to Colliers International, a commercial real estate brokerage firm. Annual rents in the submarket hit an average of $27.97 a square foot in 2007, compared with $23.16 in 2005, an increase of 20 percent in two years. 
 Across the city, it is much the same story. Seattle has largely managed to avoid the economic slowdown hitting other parts of the country because the city's corporate giants -- Microsoft, Starbucks and Amazon -- are still hiring. Boeing is selling a record number of commercial jets, trade with Asia remains strong and start-ups fueled by venture capital are opening.
 With little new space coming onto the market -- most new projects will not open until 2009 -- vacancies are expected to shrink further and rents to rise. With such a rosy outlook, Grubb & Ellis, the commercial real estate brokerage firm, has named Seattle as one of the top five markets in the country for investors to buy office space.
 ''No matter where you build a building downtown or in South Lake Union, they get backfilled pretty quickly with quality tenants,'' said Oscar Oliveira, senior vice president at Colliers International in nearby Bellevue, Wash. The city's low vacancy rate has persuaded several investors to put up buildings without any signed tenants. BioMed Realty Trust, a San Diego-based real estate investment trust that specializes in developing facilities for life science companies, broke ground on a $45 million 93,000-square-foot office-laboratory last year. It is the company's first speculative building, and it is being built in Seattle because of falling vacancy rates and strong job growth, said Kent Griffin, Bio Med's chief financial officer.
 The Blume Company of Seattle, a real estate development firm, is so bullish on South Lake Union that it has invested nearly $100 million there in the last year. The developer has a new five-story life science and laboratory building under construction and is expected to announce plans this week to build an additional 575,000 square feet of office, biotech and retail space.
 ''The sooner we have it done, the better,'' said Bruce Blume, who owns about seven acres in South Lake Union.
 Not all Seattle residents are pleased with South Lake Union's transformation, however. The Seattle City Council, after a battle, lifted height restrictions on one and a half blocks so that Amazon could build three 12-story buildings. In return, the company will pay $6.3 million to build affordable housing in the area.
 Some complain the city is spending far too much on the area, estimating it will cost up to $1 billion for water and sewer lines, street improvements and a new electricity substation. Affordable housing is being driven out of the area, they say, and traffic on already crowded local streets and freeway ramps is likely to become worse. Mercer Street, a four-lane street that runs one way to Interstate 5, cuts off the neighborhood from the lake and is one of the worst traffic problems in the city.
 ''As long as conditions are what they are, which is dismal, it won't be the community it's envisioned to be,'' said Peter Steinbrueck, a City Council member who fought Amazon's height limits before leaving office in December.
 Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, who came to power in 2002 in the midst of a recession and promoted the redevelopment of South Lake Union as a jobs engine, bats away the complaints. To him, the city's spending is producing great results. Already, he says, South Lake Union has created 7,000 jobs; 2.4 million square feet of office, laboratory, retail and hotel space; and 1,850 rentals and condos over the last four years.

HEADLINE: Humbler Spitzer Likely to Focus on Economic Growth and Higher Education

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM. 
Trymaine Lee contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer is expected to strike a more conciliatory note with the Legislature in his annual address to lawmakers on Wednesday -- the first political step of the embattled governor's second year in office. 
 But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle remain wary and in many cases openly critical of the governor, and some fellow Democrats are troubled by reports he may propose imposing a ceiling on property-tax increases.
 For his part, the governor said on Tuesday that his speech would ''lay out an agenda for next year that will focus first and foremost on economic growth.'' 
 ''Jobs, jobs, jobs is what we are focusing on, and that is what we are going to have a conversation about, I and the Legislature, as we try to craft together an agenda for the next couple months and years,'' he added. 
 Central to his plan to reinvigorate the state's economy will be an investment in its flagging public higher education system. The governor is expected to propose creating a $4 billion central endowment for the State University of New York and the City University of New York, as well as adding 2,000 professors to the system. He is also expected to propose selling a stake in the state's lottery system to finance the endowment, people who have seen drafts of his speech said. 
 The governor is also expected to propose a $1 billion upstate economic development fund.
 As for the property-tax burden that weighs heavily on upstate New York and Long Island, he is likely to propose a commission to study a possible ceiling on school property-tax increases, an idea he has previously opposed. 
 But perhaps as much as anything else, the often combative governor will try to strike a new tone entering his second year in office. And in a year where the state faces a budget gap of more than $4 billion, he might not be able to afford much else. 
 ''He's complimentary, singularly, at different points, of every government official -- the attorney general, the comptroller, the majority leader, the speaker,'' said a person who recently saw a draft of the speech. ''At one point everyone is praised, tied to a particular issue. It promotes a spirit of coalition government.''
 That would be welcome news to lawmakers, who said on Tuesday that they were looking for that change in tone as much as any specific policy objective. 
 The governor is still facing three separate investigations related to efforts by his administration to discredit the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the governor's top political rival. The Republican-led Senate is conducting its own investigation and battling the administration in court over subpoenas it has issued seeking an array of documents. Mr. Bruno, whose wife of 57 years died Monday evening, will not attend the speech. 
 The governor also is politically more vulnerable than a year ago. After winning a landslide victory in 2006, his poll numbers have been sinking precipitously. 
 ''When you're looking at a governor who has very diminished political capital, you are going to look at his speech much more skeptically than you would have last year,'' said Senator George H. Winner Jr., an Elmira Republican who is leading the Senate's investigation of the Spitzer administration. 
 ''Adding 2,000 new Democrat professors to SUNY won't be particularly helpful in Elmira,'' he added. ''While it might have been nice in the days we had lots of money, that's not really at the top of my agenda.''
 Many Democrats want to start fresh. Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, a Queens Democrat, said: ''I'm still excited. He's a Democrat, I'm a Democrat. He's young, he's got a lot of energy. It's all fine.''
 Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, said he was ''looking for an embrace.''
 ''I'm looking for a recognition that we're all in this together,'' he said.
 ''Forget personal or political issues,'' he added. ''I have a governor now who agrees with me on how to make this state right, and I don't want to waste that opportunity.''
 Democrats are split on the idea of imposing a ceiling on school property-tax increases, a proposal that would draw opposition from powerful teachers' unions.
 While Mr. Gianaris is open to the idea, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, was troubled. 
 ''You can see the direction things are heading,'' he said. ''This administration does not seem to be willing to ask the wealthiest New Yorkers and big business to share in the burden.''
 Senate Republicans were more open to the idea. 
 ''As an upstater, you can't just talk about the upstate economy without doing something about the tax system,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican.
 More broadly, Mr. Libous said he was ''looking to see if the governor is willing to change his management style in dealing with the Legislature.''
 ''Last year's style,'' he added, ''was not effective.''

HEADLINE: Kenya Crisis Worsens as Opposition Cools to Talks

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
The political mood darkened again in Kenya on Tuesday, with opposition leaders cooling to the idea of negotiations with the government after the president unilaterally made major cabinet appointments, a move that set off riots across the country almost immediately.
 Bonfires burned in Kisumu on Lake Victoria, ethnic clashes erupted in the slums around Nairobi, the capital, and protesters began to mass in the port city of Mombasa. 
 The political crisis here, which has claimed at least 486 lives and probably many more, seems to be raising wider concerns, with President Bush issuing a statement urging ''both sides to engage in peaceful dialogue'' and Senator Barack Obama speaking to opposition leaders by telephone. 
 Mr. Obama, Democrat from Illinois who is running for president, has close ties to Kenya. His father was Kenyan and a member of the same ethnic group as Kenya's top opposition leader, Raila Odinga. Mr. Obama took a short break from campaigning on Monday and asked Mr. Odinga to meet directly with Kenya's president without preconditions, a spokesman for Mr. Obama said.
 John A. Kufuor, the president of Ghana and chairman of the African Union, arrived in Nairobi on Tuesday to help facilitate a truce, but it seemed that his trip, which had been proposed as mediation between the government and the opposition, had already begun to resemble an official state visit to help the Kenyan government solve this crisis. Opposition leaders say the question should be who is the rightful leader. Opposition leaders, with Western election observers, have said that evidence is widespread that the president's party rigged the vote tallying process to stay in power. 
 Those accusations ignited a burst of violence across Kenya last week, with mobs stoning supporters of the president, burning down houses and clashing with the police. A Kenyan government committee said 486 people had been killed, but it counted only bodies taken to public hospitals. The fighting has been fueled by longstanding resentment toward the president's ethnic group, the Kikuyus, whom other groups accuse of occupying their land and monopolizing power. 
 Unbowed, Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president, announced Tuesday, just moments before Mr. Kufuor strolled down a red carpet at Nairobi's international airport, that he had chosen half of his new cabinet. 
 He entrusted the most important ministries, like internal security, finance, energy and justice, to political allies. He appointed Kalonzo Musyoka, who came in a distant third in last month's election, as vice president. Not a single member of the Orange Democratic Party, Mr. Odinga's opposition party, which won the most seats in Parliament, was appointed.
 Opposition leaders called that ''a slap in the face.''
 ''You don't pre-empt negotiations by giving away all the important posts,'' said Salim Lone, a spokesman for Mr. Odinga. ''This shows that the government is not seriously committed to dialogue.''
 Mr. Kibaki, in his brief televised address, said, ''In naming the cabinet, I have considered the importance of keeping the country united, peaceful and prosperous and a strong broad-based leadership.''
 On Monday, things had begun to look much better, and hope was growing that the political impasse was ending. The president invited opposition leaders to talks scheduled for Friday, and the opposition leaders indicated that they were willing to go if the talks were part of a peace process brokered by the African Union. Mr. Odinga called off huge protest rallies that many Kenyans had feared would deteriorate into bloodshed.
 But the tone changed Tuesday, with Mr. Odinga calling the talks ''a sideshow'' and saying Mr. Kibaki was not Kenya's legitimate president.
 ''Let Mr. Kibaki know we don't recognize him,'' Mr. Odinga said at a news conference. ''We want to meet him. But we don't recognize him.''
 Mr. Kibaki also announced that Parliament would resume operations on Tuesday. Opposition leaders say that they will occupy the seats reserved for the government because they contend they are the lawful government.
 Jendayi E. Frazer, the United States assistant secretary of state for African affairs, who is here trying to help end the standoff, said Tuesday that she was increasingly concerned, especially about the ethnic fighting that had driven more than 200,000 people from their homes.
 ''There is a certain poison in the air,'' she said, in an interview broadcast on a Kenyan television network.
 If the political impasse is not resolved, Ms. Frazer said, ''Kenya will have a long future of instability.''
 Kenya's economy, the biggest in East Africa, is already hurting. The unrest, which has included gangs blocking roads with downed trees and mobs looting tea plantations, has impeded trade across the region. 
 On Tuesday, Amos Kimunya, Kenya's finance minister who was reappointed to his post, said that the election turmoil had cost the country $1 billion.

HEADLINE: A New Agency for Roads, or Version 2 of the Turnpike Authority?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
For all the complex leaps of financial logic needed to grasp Gov. Jon S. Corzine's plan to leverage New Jersey's toll roads, several crucial components remain unchanged.
 For one thing, a public corporation would continue to manage the state's toll roads and issue bonds paid for with the tolls collected on those roads.
 The new entity -- known as a public benefit corporation -- would have a broader mandate than the current New Jersey Turnpike Authority because it would also absorb the agency that runs the Atlantic City Expressway and would add a slice of highway, Route 440, that connects New Jersey to Staten Island. 
 But at its heart, Mr. Corzine's proposed public benefit corporation could turn out to be an elaborate version of what already exists, leading some experts to question why the governor does not simply rewrite and expand the powers of the Turnpike Authority.
 ''Unless he's pulling a rabbit out of the hat with some wrinkle with this public benefit corporation, at the end of the day, you end up at exactly the same place,'' said John H. Foote, a former investment banker who now studies transportation policy as a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. ''I don't know why he's two-stepping this thing.''
 Other experts, however, said that that overhauling the Turnpike Authority, which was created in 1949, would be too complicated and time-consuming. It would be easier to start a new organization with no entrenched political ties, they said. In planning issues, it could also dovetail with other state transportation agencies instead of acting autonomously, as it has sometimes done in the past.
 ''It lets them start tabula rasa with this new organization,'' said Scott Le Vine, researcher at the Centre for Transport Studies at Imperial College London.
 This governor, as well as those who come after him, would have less authority over the new corporation than the current Turnpike Authority, and far less ability to tamper with the toll increases, according to one State Transportation Department official, who was not authorized to speak for the governor's plan.
 ''The magnitude of the money at issue and the fact that this proposal is for 75 years, the governor could veto a portion of the plan at any time,'' the official said. ''There's too much potential for political interference in the current Turnpike Authority.''
 But unlike the Turnpike Authority, which has been issuing bonds for decades, the new corporation will have no track record with investors. As a result, the corporation may have to pay higher interest rates to offset the perception of a higher risk, in effect turning out to be more expensive.
 The corporation will also have objectives far beyond the Turnpike Authority's, using some of the money from the sale of the bonds to erase other debts, including those from the state pension system and the Garden State Preservation Trust. Mr. Corzine may face resistance not just from drivers who will face escalating tolls, but also from fiscal watchdogs wary of cure-all solutions.
 ''There are various levels to this: There's pension debt, there's debt of the transportation trust fund, and debt of the Turnpike Authority,'' said Martin E. Robins, a senior fellow at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. ''It radiates like a stone thrown in a pool. It goes from easy sell, to harder sell, to much harder sell.''
 On balance, Mr. Robins and other transportation experts say the governor's plan is well intentioned, particularly since New Jersey's transportation needs are so great, and the state's highway tolls and gas tax are far below levels in many other states.
 But many experts want to see which transportation projects are financed first. For instance, Kate Slevin, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a commuter advocacy group, said she opposed the governor's plan to widen the turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Instead of adding lanes for more vehicles, she said, the state should look at ways to lure commuters onto trains and buses.
 ''They deserve credit for thinking outside the box,'' Ms. Slevin said. ''But if they're going to put money into unsustainable projects, we're going to have a hard time supporting it.''
 Still, before the governor can start selling a list of transportation projects, he will need to explain to the public why New Jersey needs yet another state entity.
 ''We have a public benefit corporation, and it's called the New Jersey Turnpike Authority,'' said Peter Humphreys, who runs Save Our Assets NJ, a group organized to oppose Mr. Corzine's plan. ''We haven't worked out the advantages of one over the other.''

HEADLINE: McCain And Bush's Heirs

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
John McCain has never pretended that economics was his big issue, and he has never seemed too tied to any one view. Elected to Congress in 1982 as a war hero, he focused on military issues early in his career, all the while providing a reliable vote for tax cuts. 
 But as his party moved to the right in the 1990s, he started drifting to the left. By 2001, he was criticizing the Bush administration's tax cut as a fiscally irresponsible gift to the affluent ''at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief.'' As the conservatives at the Club for Growth have gleefully pointed out, he started sounding a lot like Ted Kennedy.
 Then, with the 2008 Republican primaries drawing nearer, Mr. McCain tacked back. He now favors extending many tax cuts he once opposed, arguing repeal would amount to a tax increase. On the campaign trail, he sometimes sounds no different from Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney. 
 But Mr. McCain is still different from them. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney are the rightful heirs to President Bush's economic policy. They favor the extension of all his tax cuts, and they oppose government action to fight climate change, among other things. They're the candidates for voters who think the Bush boom has gotten a bad rap.
 The other top candidate, Mike Huckabee, offers an even bolder tax-cutting plan than Mr. Bush did in 2000. Mr. Huckabee may speak in the populist tones favored by Democrats, but his policies are arguably the least populist of any candidate.
 Whatever its other pluses and minuses, his national sales tax, known as the Fair Tax, would undeniably increase the share of taxes paid by the middle class while cutting the share paid by the wealthy. If voters can just forget what he is saying, Mr. Huckabee is the candidate for those who think the country needs to stop soaking the rich.
 Mr. McCain is neither a Fair Tax Republican nor a Bush Republican. He is more of an Alan Greenspan Republican. And despite the somewhat tortured history of Mr. McCain's views, he has managed to sketch out an economic platform for 2008 that represents the very beginnings of a Republican response to middle-class anxiety. Together, he and his rivals present Republican primary voters with a real choice.
 The first big contrast between the Greenspan and Bush outlooks has to do with how the government should use financial incentives. The idea that people respond to incentives is a tenet of Republican economics: tax rates should stay low to encourage people to work and businesses to expand. 
 Mr. McCain and his rivals agree on this point. But he, like Mr. Greenspan, thinks that the government sometimes has to alter the incentives that a free market creates, to avoid a bad outcome like global warming. When forced to choose between the power of incentives and the magic of the market, Mr. McCain is willing to go with incentives.
 On energy policy, this means that he favors a cap-and-trade program that would set a national ceiling on how much carbon could be emitted, and effectively raise the cost of energy use. (Mr. Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who has never had to run for office, prefers the more direct solution of a carbon tax.) Once oil, coal and electricity became even more expensive, businesses and consumers would have a big incentive to use less of them. The United States then wouldn't have to rely on so much foreign oil, and global warming might stop accelerating.
 History, Mr. McCain has said, ''will not treat this administration kindly on climate change.''
 Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney, like all politicians, call for more investment in alternative energy. Yet that's about as far as they go. They talk in vague terms about using the market to solve the country's energy problem, but they don't want to make energy use more expensive -- and thus let the market solve the problem. So it's hard not to conclude that climate-change skeptics should vote for them while climate-change believers should vote for Mr. McCain.
 There is a similar pattern with health care. All the candidates talk about opening up the market for health insurance to make it function more like the market for new cars or televisions. But Mr. McCain goes further. 
 He also suggests changing the incentives around medical care. He wants Medicare to pay doctors and hospitals less for procedures that don't improve health -- like unnecessary surgery -- and more for effective low-technology care.
 ''We have to have outcome-based results for health care,'' he said during a debate on Sunday night. ''And that way, we'll have a healthier nation, and we will have less health care costs.''
 Beyond incentives, the second big difference between the Greenspan and Bush philosophies has to do with taxes. Mr. Bush and his 2008 heirs know what they like: lower and lower taxes. Mr. Greenspan and Mr. McCain are a bit less clear on this point.
 Mr. Greenspan provided crucial political cover to the 2003 tax cut, only to turn around and criticize it in his recent memoir. Mr. McCain went the other way, first criticizing that tax cut as fiscally irresponsible and later claiming on several occasions that tax cuts reduced deficits. ''Tax cuts increase revenues,'' he told Charlie Rose in November. 
 I asked Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is Mr. McCain's top economic adviser, about these comments, and he said that Mr. McCain had misspoken. Mr. Holtz-Eakin then called Mr. McCain on the campaign trail and later gave me this statement from him: ''Tax cuts don't pay for themselves, but pro-growth tax cuts -- especially along with spending restraint -- spur the economy, which raises incomes, and offsets the revenue loss.''
 So Mr. McCain is much closer to his 1980s self on taxes than his 1990s self. But he still isn't where Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney are. They would both eliminate the estate tax. Mr. McCain would reduce the tax rate and also exempt all estates worth less than $10 million, up from the currently legislated ceiling of $1 million. 
 When you put it all together, you're left with a picture of Mr. McCain as someone who cares somewhat more about the deficit than his rivals and is more willing to intervene in the economy. He has called, for example, for subsidizing the incomes of laid-off older workers, to encourage them to accept a lower-paying job instead of remaining unemployed. Expect to hear him talk more about bread-and-butter issues as the campaign moves to Michigan this morning.
 That said, the differences among the Republicans are still minor compared with differences between the two parties. And both sides can make a case that their approach will turn out to be the more effective one. As recent polls have shown, Americans are quite anxious about the future and pessimistic about the economy's direction, but still fairly satisfied with their own financial situation. 
 The anxiety suggests people may be ready for a sharp break from Mr. Bush's economic policies. The satisfaction suggests they may want more modest changes.

HEADLINE: McCain's Victory Muddles G.O.P. Field as It Looks to Michigan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Michael Cooper and David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Manchester, N.H., and Marc Santora from Nashua, N.H.

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
After Senator John McCain's victory here on Tuesday, the Republican field is more scrambled than ever, with the battleground now shifting to a series of states where each of the leading candidates believes he holds certain advantages.
 The next showdown will be on Jan. 15 in Michigan, a vast state struggling with a recession and the loss of manufacturing jobs. It is where Mitt Romney was born and reared, and many still fondly remember his late father, George, a three-term governor. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, will fly there on Wednesday afternoon, with his aides saying the state has become his fire wall. 
 But his campaign has clearly been crippled by a second loss, this time in a state where he even has a vacation home. 
 Mr. McCain, who will also go to Michigan on Wednesday, is looking to finish off Mr. Romney there. In 2000, Mr. McCain defeated George W. Bush in Michigan, largely on the strength of support from independents and Democrats who switched over to vote for him.
 Already, the McCain campaign has seen a tremendous uptick in its fund-raising, going from $20,000 a day on the Internet to well over $100,000, and raising a million dollars this month alone. 
 A wild card is Mike Huckabee, who has surged to the lead in some national polls. He hopes to be competitive in Michigan but is looking more toward the Jan. 19 primary in South Carolina, a state with many evangelical Christians who are drawn to this former Baptist pastor. 
 Waiting in the wings is a weakened Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is now focused almost exclusively on a victory in Florida's primary on Jan. 29 to slingshot him to the nationwide contests on Feb. 5.
 ''It's a war of attrition,'' said Dan Bartlett, a former top adviser to President Bush. 
 Former Senator Rick Santorum said the results were the latest indication that Republicans were in for an epic battle among a field of imperfect candidates for the party's conservative base.
 ''It comes back to, O.K., Romney can't win, Huckabee can't win, McCain can't win, Giuliani can't win -- the dynamic is you have a bunch of candidates who can't win,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''I don't see how we don't come down to a convention that is going to decide this thing.''
 Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, will be going to South Carolina overnight. Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain planned to fly there on Wednesday, after their stops in Michigan. 
 All the Republican candidates will gather on Thursday in South Carolina on for a debate in Myrtle Beach. 
 Mr. McCain, of Arizona, held the advantage early on in South Carolina, building a strong ground organization, only to have to lay off many staff members in the summer. But many stayed on as volunteers.
 Mr. Romney has been broadcasting television advertisements in the state consistently in the last few months and has the most impressive field operation there, but many evangelicals continue to regard his Mormon faith with suspicion.
 Mr. Huckabee has a clear lead in recent polls of South Carolina Republicans.
 Former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee and Mr. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, made pushes in the state, only to falter in recent months. 
 In Michigan, polls show the battle will be among Mr. Huckabee, Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Giuliani. ''They all have followings through the state,'' said Steve Mitchell, a Republican pollster.
 Nevertheless, the conventional wisdom is that the state is Mr. Romney's to lose. Mr. Romney has the biggest paid organization there with 11 people and began broadcasting television commercials in the state in mid-December. He started a direct-mail program about six weeks ago. 
 Because of its size, Michigan is not a state conducive to retail politics, and campaigns are largely waged over the airwaves.
 Mr. Romney's advisers see that as a potential advantage. ''It is the first real test of who can run a full-spectrum campaign,'' said Katie Packer, a consultant in Michigan for Mr. Romney. 
 But Mr. McCain's advisers believe independents who helped him in 2000 could help push him over the top again, especially because the Democratic primary is essentially uncontested. 
 ''I think you will see that drive even more independents our way,'' said Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's campaign manager. 
 As for Mr. Huckabee, his advisers say he has not written off Michigan and believe that his evangelical credentials will appeal to the large swath of Dutch Reformed evangelical churchgoers in western Michigan, while his populist rhetoric about his empathy with working people will strike a chord with the state's blue-collar voters.
 Ed Rollins, the national chairman of Mr. Huckabee's campaign, said it planned to begin running television commercials in Michigan on Wednesday. Mr. Huckabee will arrive in South Carolina on Wednesday but campaign in Michigan on Friday, Mr. Rollins said.
 Mr. Romney's tattered road map to the nomination is dependent on winning Michigan and performing above expectations in South Carolina, setting up the real battle among the major Republican contenders in Florida.
 Mr. Romney's campaign members, along with others, believe there is an opening now in Florida, because of Mr. Giuliani's disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 While his rivals clash elsewhere, however, Mr. Giuliani is pouring resources and time into Florida. 
 Mr. Giuliani planned to go there on Wednesday afternoon. Although he will appear for the debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the campaign was planning to return to Florida over the weekend for a bus tour.

HEADLINE: 3 Groups Lend Names to Suit Asking Release of Database

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Three groups, including The New York Times, have filed papers in support of a lawsuit seeking to have the police make public a database of officers' recordings on more than 850,000 stops of civilians between January 2006 and September of last year. 
 The New York Civil Liberties Union filed the suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in November arguing that the Police Department's computerized data on stop-and-frisk activities should be turned over for analysis so the role of race in street encounters can be better understood.
 In addition to The Times, the New York City Bar Association and an unofficial collection of 21 scholars from around the country have joined in the effort to wrest the database from the Bloomberg administration to shine more light on what is being called one of the most elemental issues in law enforcement.
 Requests for the raw data have been denied, and Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly of the Police Department has said that his officers are not practicing racial profiling in street stops. Requests from the City Council for the database have not been granted. 
 Jesse I. Levine, a senior counsel in the general litigation division of the city's Law Department, said the papers from the three groups were being examined. As for the overarching suit, he said, ''We will have a response to that defending the commissioner's position.'' 
 The city must answer the suit by Tuesday, said Christopher T. Dunn, associate legal director of the civil liberties group, who said the judge must still decide whether the groups can join the case.
 The civil liberties group filed its suit a week before the Rand Corporation released a report in November on its independent assessment of the stops. The three groups sought to join the suit after the report's release. The department -- through the Police Foundation -- commissioned the nonprofit Rand Corporation for the study early last year after its release of statistics showing a large increase in the number of street stops led some critics to suggest that minorities were unfairly singled out, a claim the police deny.
 The department's database -- with details on the time and location of stops, the reasons for them and the race of those stopped -- was given to the Rand analysts. At one point, the Rand study states, ''Over all, after adjusting for stop circumstances, we generally found small racial differences in the rates of frisk, search, use of force, and arrest.''
 The department's refusal to make the database public, however, ''is out of step with the practices of major police departments elsewhere in the country,'' according to the brief written by Andrew G. Celli Jr., a lawyer for the group of 21, which includes criminologists, economists, sociologists and other academics.

HEADLINE: Advocate for Taxpayers Calls for Paid Apologies

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Taxpayers who endure excessive expense or drain on their time when the Internal Revenue Service mishandles a case should receive ''apology payments'' of up to $1,000 each, the national taxpayer advocate told Congress on Wednesday.
 The advocate, a position Congress created in 1998, also said a new taxpayer bill of rights should be enacted, one that includes a list of responsibilities requiring taxpayers to conduct themselves honestly and to cooperate with auditors and tax collectors. 
 Nina E. Olson, the taxpayer advocate, in her annual report on the most serious problems faced by taxpayers, also said that the I.R.S. could use technology to apply the tax system to the underground or cash economy, where small entrepreneurs work for unreported pay. She said that by tracking credit card spending, state sales tax reports and other records, the I.R.S. could identify who collects this cash. 
 Ms. Olson estimated that the government could collect $100 billion more each year from those who evade taxes by dealing in unreported cash. That would be enough for honest taxpayers to receive a 10 percent cut in their income tax bills.
 Ms. Olson also criticized Congress for making changes in the tax laws in November and December. She said such last-minute changes caused a million taxpayers to forgo deductions they were entitled to last year.
 Within a long list of problems, shortcomings and backsliding by the I.R.S., the proposal that Congress authorize apology payments is the most unusual.
 The proposed apology payments of $100 to $1,000, adjusted for inflation, would go to taxpayers who endure ''excessive expense or undue burden'' on their time. Britain and Australia already make such payments. The money would not be subject to tax. 
 ''A fair and just tax system should acknowledge I.R.S. mistakes and delays in'' resolving issues, Ms. Olson said. She proposed that her office be allowed to authorize such payments up to a total of $1 million a year. The proposed budget implies that the advocate's office believes 1,000 to 10,000 taxpayers per year should receive apology payments.
 Ms. Olson also told Congress that the use of private debt collectors is costing more than the money brought in. Private debt collection ''is failing in most respects,'' she said. 
 The I.R.S. had expected private companies to collect $88 million but has now lowered that to as little as $23 million. The collectors are paid almost a fourth of the money they bring in. When the costs of government oversight are added in, Ms. Olson said, the program may even lose money.
 If Congress authorized more money for I.R.S. staff and equipment, the agency said it could bring in $20 for each dollar it receives, five times the Bush administration's official estimate of private debt collector efficiency.
 Congressional Republicans oppose hiring more I.R.S. workers, and the administration favors private collection even though it acknowledged in testimony to Congress that it was far less efficient than having the I.R.S. handle all collections.
 But the proposal most likely to draw opposition is one that would require partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations -- all of which pass tax obligations on to their owners -- to report more about their income.
 Such reporting already applies to wage earners, 99 percent of whose income is reported to the I.R.S., compared with as little as 70 percent for entrepreneurs and partners, I.R.S. reports to Congress show.
 Ms. Olson said that ''a significant number'' of S corporations were only distributing dividends, avoiding payroll taxes on compensation. 
 Previous proposals to add any independent reporting requirements on small businesses have faced opposition from members of Congress who say it stifles entrepreneurship. 
 Con artists and tax protesters have used the lack of reporting for pass-through businesses like S corporations to cheat the government out of vast sums and, in some cases, cheat their clients out of their life savings, records in federal trials in Washington State and Colorado show. 
 Charles O. Rossotti, the I.R.S. commissioner from 1997 to 2002, told Congress that rigorous third-party reporting rules for wage earners, but not small businesses, made the system unfair to wage earners.
 Ms. Olson also said that the I.R.S. had become much too aggressive in charging fees for services. One manager of a nonprofit organization who asked how to list some unusual income on its tax return was told that an answer would cost $2,700.
 Ms. Olson added that despite promises and the creation of a high-level committee, the I.R.S. had failed to enact policies that would bring more nonfilers into the system. Some of these nonfilers have wages withheld from their pay, but do not file, which means the I.R.S. must spend money preparing substitute tax returns for them.
 In a similar vein, she said that 80 percent of penalties imposed on tax preparers were not being collected.

HEADLINE: MBIA Takes Steps to Keep Triple-A Rating

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MBIA Inc., the bond insurer, reduced its dividend by 62 percent on Wednesday and said it would sell $1 billion of debt to preserve capital and the triple-A ratings it needs to operate in a mortgage market under siege. 
 MBIA said it was cutting its quarterly dividend to 13 cents a share from 34 cents, saving $80 million a year.
 The company also said it would report $737 million in losses in the fourth quarter, largely for securities made up of high-quality residential home equity loans.
 It also revealed it was cooperating with informal inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State insurance department into its December disclosures related to mortgage and other debt exposure, and a $500 million infusion from the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.
 Shares of MBIA declined 58 cents, to $13.40. 
 ''People were spooked,'' said Rob Haines, an analyst at Credit-Sights. ''The talks may have sparked concern the Warburg deal might not go through, or that there are regulatory concerns that investors aren't aware of. With bond insurers, investors will latch onto negative news because it is such an out-of-favor industry.''
 The bond insurers are facing a new rival, Warren E, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has begun offering its own bond insurance.
 The chief financial officer of MBIA, C. Edward Chaplin, said in a statement the lowered dividend ''significantly enhances our financial flexibility.''
 The debt sale, meanwhile, won approval from Fitch Ratings, which said it would end its threat to take away MBIA's triple-A financial strength rating if the sale went through.
 ''It's good news for MBIA,'' said Jim Ryan, an equity analyst for Morningstar. ''Most of the stock's recent decline stemmed from fear it wouldn't be able to raise enough capital to keep the triple-A rating. That issue now seems to be put to bed.''
 Warburg Pincus agreed last month to invest $500 million in MBIA stock, receive warrants to buy additional shares, and backstop a $500 million rights offering.

HEADLINE: Digital Tools Help Users Save Energy, Study Finds

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Giving people the means to closely monitor and adjust their electricity use lowers their monthly bills and could significantly reduce the need to build new power plants, according to a yearlong government study.
 The results of the research project by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory of the Energy Department, released Wednesday, suggest that if households have digital tools to set temperature and price preferences, the peak loads on utility grids could be trimmed by up to 15 percent a year.
 Over a 20-year period, this could save $70 billion on spending for power plants and infrastructure, and avoid the need to build the equivalent of 30 large coal-fired plants, say scientists at the federal laboratory. 
 The demonstration project was as much a test of consumer behavior as it was of new technology. Scientists wanted to find out if the ability to monitor consumption constantly would cause people to save energy -- just as studies have shown that people walk more if they wear pedometers to count their steps. 
 In the Olympic Peninsula, west of Seattle, 112 homes were equipped with digital thermostats, and computer controllers were attached to water heaters and clothes dryers. These controls were connected to the Internet. 
 The homeowners could go to a Web site to set their ideal home temperature and how many degrees they were willing to have that temperature move above or below the target. They also indicated their level of tolerance for fluctuating electricity prices. In effect, the homeowners were asked to decide the trade-off they wanted to make between cost savings and comfort. 
 The households, it turned out, soon became active participants in managing the load on the utility grid and their own bills.
 ''I was astounded at times at the response we got from customers,'' said Robert Pratt, a staff scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the program director for the demonstration project. ''It shows that if you give people simple tools and an incentive, they will do this.''
 ''And each household,'' Mr. Pratt added, ''doesn't have to do a lot, but if something like this can be scaled up, the savings in investments you don't have to make will be huge, and consumers and the environment will benefit.''
 After some testing with households, the scientists decided not to put a lot of numbers and constant pricing information in front of consumers. On the Web site, the consumers were presented with graphic icons to set and adjust.
 ''We gave them a knob,'' Mr. Pratt said. ''If you don't like it, change the knob.''
 Behind the fairly simple consumer settings was a sophisticated live marketplace, whose software and analytics were designed by I.B.M. Research. Every five minutes, the households and local utilities were buying and selling electricity, with prices constantly fluctuating by tiny amounts as supply and demand on the grid changed.
 ''Your thermostat and your water heater are day-trading for you,'' said Ron Ambrosio, a senior researcher at the Watson Research Center of I.B.M.
 The households in the demonstration project on average saved 10 percent on their monthly utility bills. Jerry Brous, a retiree who owns a three-bedroom house in Sequim, Wash., did a bit better, saving about 15 percent, which added up to $135 over a year.
 Mr. Brous, 67, said that at first he was a real price hawk, allowing the household temperature to go 10 degrees above or below the target as the outside temperature changed. In the winter, he and his wife, Pat, decided the house was too cold at times, so they changed the range to five degrees.
 The monetary savings were nice, but Mr. Brous said his main motivation for joining the project was to participate in research that might accelerate the spread of energy efficiency programs.
 Shortly after the demonstration project ended last March, the digital thermostat and other equipment supplied by Invensys Controls were removed from Mr. Brous's home. ''I miss it a lot,'' he said. ''It was cool.''
 The research project was done with an eye toward guiding policy on energy-saving programs. Efficiency programs promise to curb the nation's fuel bill and reduce damage to the environment, if consumers can be persuaded to use energy more intelligently. Still, a big question among economists and energy experts is how to tailor incentives to prompt changes in energy consumption.
 The market signals from household utility bills are not clear to people, some experts say. Conservation steps, they note, may bring savings of only a few percentage points, and even those may be obscured by seasonal swings in electricity use and pricing. Thus, they say, the only way to make real progress in household energy efficiency is with sizable subsidies and mandated product standards.
 The federal laboratory's project was instead a test of market incentives and up-to-the-minute information. But how quickly the kind of technology used in the project might be deployed across the country is uncertain. Many utilities are experimenting with this so-called smart-grid technology, but most are using it to upgrade their own networks, not to let households manage consumption.
 One big hurdle is that in most states, utilities are still granted rates of return that depend mainly on the power plants and equipment they own and operate instead of how much energy they save.
 ''What they did in Washington is a great proof of concept, but you're not likely to see this kind of technology widely used anytime soon,'' said Rick Nicholson, an energy technology analyst at IDC, a research firm.

HEADLINE: Finding Real Estate Niches That Keep Housing's Slump at Bay

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
THE housing slump has exacted its toll on everyone from banks and Wall Street firms to builders and mortgage brokers. But there are the exceptions, the entrepreneurs who either have long experience in real estate or have carved out a special niche. So far, they have been able to ride out the worst. 
 HouseRaising of Charlotte, N.C., a custom builder that caters to the rich, is one of them. It makes sales on the Internet and often closes deals with prospective customers in a single day of ''one-stop shopping'' at one of its two design centers, where everything from doors to, literally, the kitchen sink is picked out.
 Since mid-2006, when it began using a patented computerized system for overseeing every aspect of the building process, HouseRaising has completed 12 houses and has 30 more in the works, as well as a $16.3 million project to develop a residential community in Lake Norman, N.C., 20 miles north of Charlotte. 
 The company promises to complete all jobs on time, with no cost overruns. Last year, it doubled its work force to 35. ''We are going to be successful no matter what the economy does, because of who we serve,'' said Greg Wessling, HouseRaising's chief executive.
 Duffy Real Estate, a midsize firm with three locations in the upscale Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia, has also managed to keep the downturn in the real estate market at bay. In fact, it grew in the last year. 
 ''Every time you go on the Internet, you read about the 10 worst cities for foreclosures, the subprime crisis, things that have no effect whatsoever on us,'' said the firm's founder, John Duffy Sr. ''The real estate market is regionalized. I went into business in 1978, and prices in this area have never gone down.'' Neither, he says, have his annual sales figures. 
 Mr. Duffy, 60 years old, said he increased his office staff last year to 9 from 8 and the number of his agents to 46 from 42. ''We had a very good year,'' he said. In fact, he said, he views the market downturn as a godsend because it is shaking out the ''deadwood'' of amateurs in the business and allowing him to grow.
 Then there is Ellie Mae, a provider of Internet services to the mortgage industry in Pleasanton, Calif. Sig Anderman, co-founder of Ellie Mae, said revenue increased last year to $38 million, from $35 million in 2006, and profits were robust.
 Mr. Anderman acknowledged that he had been making plans a year ago to increase his staff to 250 from 200 to accommodate what he expected to be a banner year for his company, which gives brokers quick online access to all the credit reports, title reports, appraisals and other documents that go into a closing. Instead, as the air seeped out of the housing bubble, he cut back to 164 employees. But even as his customer base stagnated, he refined his products, nudged up his prices and slashed costs.
 ''I'm amazed we're doing as well as we are,'' Mr. Anderman said. ''We have a lot of irons in the fire. I think in the kind of turmoil we're experiencing, there is always opportunity.'' 
 Real estate experts generally expect the market to get worse before it gets better. But, said Joel Burslem, founder of the Future of Real Estate Marketing blog and a marketer for Inman News, ''any crisis holds opportunities for entrepreneurs.''
 The most obvious winners, he said, are experienced real estate professionals like Mr. Duffy, who can outmaneuver their upstart competitors. Investors, he said, are already exploiting depressed prices in some parts of the country and will continue to find bargains.
 Moreover, Mr. Burslem said, with sales stagnating as buyer resistance grows, providers of video, syndication and other promotional services to the real estate industry will be in higher demand.
 Mr. Duffy said the secret to his success was providing first-rate service and refusing to water down his core business with secondary money-making products like mortgage brokering and title searches. ''I tell my agents to assume that every customer is their mother or father,'' he said. ''And I want every customer to know they can call me anytime if there's any problem.''
 As a result, he says, he has been able to keep his staff intact while larger firms nearby are laying off employees-- in one case, the entire secretarial staff.
 Also benefiting from the troubles in the housing market are remodelers, who for the last several years have devoted their skills to buying cheap houses, fixing them up and flipping them, Mr. Duffy said. The remodelers are now returning to their old line of work, displacing the less-skilled carpenters and painters who had filled the void.
 Other winners, Mr. Duffy said, are small moving and storage companies that are getting business from cost-conscious consumers.
 Mr. Wessling, 56, came to HouseRaising as a consultant after 33 years as a senior executive at the Lowe's Companies, the home improvement chain. His assignment was to carry out the patented system that HouseRaising's founder, Bob McLemore, a home builder, had developed over seven years.
 But on Thanksgiving Day 2006, Mr. McLemore died unexpectedly of a heart attack, and Mr. Wessling was asked to take over.
 Because HouseRaising deals only with wealthy customers who own their own lots, one of his first initiatives was to create a subsidiary, HouseRaising Realty, to help those who do not have a place to build.
 In May 2007, the company opened an office in New Orleans, at Carollton and Canal Streets in a historic area, and built a design center nearby to match the existing one in Charlotte.
 ''We have replicas of everything we put into the house,'' he said. ''Every imaginable style of kitchen counter, molding, carpeting, roofing, stucco, handrail, window, stairs, you name it, are represented there. That really makes it a one-stop shop. All you have to do is spend one day with us. Nobody else does that.''
 ''We could work regionally throughout the country,'' Mr. Wessling said. ''But there is so much opportunity in the Carolinas and the Gulf.''
 Mr. Anderman, 66, also sees a bright future for his company, though he does not expect the return of the triple-digit growth rates that Ellie Mae experienced in its early years at the turn of the century.
 About 185,000 employees at 13,000 mortgage firms and banks use its software, roughly the same number as a year ago, he said, though the business-to-business real estate transactions on its site have declined slightly, to 35,000 a day from 38,000.
 But last year, Ellie Mae reaped lavish returns on a product called Encompass Anywhere, a Web-based version of its software that is attractive to bigger brokerage firms because it is accessible from any computer and the firms do not have to maintain it. Though the cost is $60 a month per ''seat'' instead of $60 a year for use of the software not maintained by Ellie Mae, Encompass Anywhere has doubled the number of users to 16,000 since April 2005.
 Perhaps the most aggressive move Mr. Anderman has taken to protect his bottom line is keeping a tight lid on expenses, including shifting 25 technology jobs to China, where quality-control workers monitor the company's network at one-fifth the salary Americans command. That move alone saves $2 million a year, he said.
 Mr. Anderman said he expected business to pick up late next year. ''Mortgage brokers who are still around then will survive,'' he said. ''The buzzwords right now are 'more scrutiny' and 'more efficiency.' That is music to our ears because that is what we provide.''

HEADLINE: New Penalties Set as Bush Calls Iran a Threat to Peace

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush charged Wednesday that Iran remained ''a threat to world peace'' as the Treasury Department imposed strict economic penalties on a top Iranian military commander, a Syrian-based television station and three militants in the region accused of helping the insurgency in Iraq.
 Speaking in Israel at the beginning of his visit to the Middle East, Mr. Bush took a hard line on Iran over its nuclear program and said that ''all options are on the table'' to guard against more military provocations like the Iranian threats to American ships in the Persian Gulf on Sunday. 
 ''We have made it clear publicly, and they know our position,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There will be serious consequences if they attack our ships, pure and simple. And my advice to them is, Don't do it.''
 The Treasury actions against entities and individuals associated with Iran and accused of helping the Iraqi insurgency were taken under the authority of an executive order from Mr. Bush last summer freezing assets and prohibiting financial transactions with groups based in Iran and Syria aiding the insurgency. Administration officials said the actions had been in the works for months and were not related to the naval confrontation.
 Administration officials say some of the attacks on American troops in Iraq that had previously been attributed to Iran -- like the roadside bombs that have become a major cause of American casualties -- have declined recently.
 But the administration has stopped short of concluding that Iran is trying to reduce anti-American attacks, and American officials say the decline may be attributable to better cooperation by Iraqi citizens and better intelligence in stopping the proliferation of roadside bombs.
 ''Has Iran made a conscious decision to scale down support of these attacks?'' an administration official said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing intelligence. ''Nobody is really sure. It's possible they really have, and it's possible they haven't. We are still capturing people in Iraq who have had training as recently as a month or two ago in Iran. The jury is still out.''
 The latest administration action occurred at a time of difficult negotiations to get a United Nations Security Council resolution to tighten economic sanctions on Iran unless it stops enriching uranium, which the West contends is part of a plan to make nuclear weapons. Chinese and Russian opposition to tough sanctions increased last year after a National Intelligence Estimate asserted that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program.
 Although the Security Council has imposed two rounds of economic penalties on Iran, the United States has continued on a path of unilateral sanctions. They are largely symbolic, some officials acknowledge, because they prohibit Americans from doing business with these individuals or groups when virtually no Americans do such business.
 In the action on Wednesday, the Treasury Department named Ahmed Foruzandeh, who was listed with seven aliases and identified as commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps -- the Quds Force's Ramazan Corps. It also named Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, identified as a leader of a network of Shiite extremists sponsored by Iran that aids groups attacking Americans in Iraq, and Ismail Hafiz al Lambi, identified as a leader of attacks on Americans in Iraq.
 The department also named a Syria-based television station, Al Zawra, and its owner, Mishan Rakin Thamin al-Jaburi. It said the station broadcast coded messages to insurgents in Iraq and ''graphic videos of attacks against U.S. forces.'' 
 The Quds Force has been identified by the United States as a special unit of the Revolutionary Guard that operates in Iraq.
 ''Iran and Syria are fueling violence and destruction in Iraq,'' said Stuart Levey, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. ''Iran trains, funds and provides weapons to violent Shia extremist groups, while Syria provides safe haven to Sunni insurgents and financiers.''

HEADLINE: A Year In, Spitzer Sets New Tone, For Unity

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The man who swept into the Statehouse a year ago, determined to overhaul Albany, instead tried to embrace it on Wednesday, as Gov. Eliot Spitzer called lawmakers his friends, asked for prayers for the family of his political nemesis, and shelved, for the time being, talk of dramatic reform. 
 In his second State of the State address, the governor acknowledged that his blunt style had sometimes made cooperation difficult, and told lawmakers, ''I will meet you with an open hand, an open door and an open mind.'' 
 ''We can work together for the common good, despite our political or personal differences, and we must,'' he said, adding, ''We in this chamber are all New Yorkers.''
 The change in tone was striking. In his inaugural address a year ago, the governor said the state had been asleep for the last decade ''like Rip Van Winkle'' even as the three men who had run the state during those years -- former Gov. George E. Pataki; the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno; and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver -- shared the stage with him. 
 Last February, he said of the Legislature's top Democrat, ''Nobody should be under the illusion it will be easy for me to work with Shelly Silver.'' And his administration faces three separate investigations into its efforts to discredit Mr. Bruno, the state's top Republican. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Spitzer referred to ''my friend Shelly Silver'' and sprinkled thanks throughout to Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno and a number of rank and file lawmakers in both parties -- olive branches that at times drew jovial derision and even air kisses from fellow lawmakers sitting near those singled out.
 But the change was generally well received as overdue. 
 United States Senator Charles E. Schumer said afterward, ''You cannot stand up on Mount Olympus and throw down thunderbolts and expect to get things done.''
 ''Reaching out and making it clear to the Legislature that they are equal partners, making it clear that he is working with everybody, is exactly the prescription that was needed,'' he added. 
 The speech, which lasted an hour and nine minutes, focused on policy instead of process reform, embracing the idea of imposing a ceiling on property taxes -- an idea Mr. Spitzer previously rejected -- and of creating a $4 billion endowment for the state's public higher education system. 
 He also proposed using tens of millions of dollars in state money to pay for a planned expansion of health insurance for children that had been rejected by the Bush administration. 
 He also proposed spending $400 million on middle-income housing and setting aside $1 billion for an upstate economic development fund. He introduced more modest measures, too, like a ''Peace Corps for doctors'' to increase care in poor areas, and reassigning 200 state troopers to combat upstate crime. 
 Notably, the speech did not dwell on the budget deficit of more than $4 billion that the state faces this year, an issue that will be dealt with when the governor presents his second executive budget later this month. 
 In some cases, controversy was only hinted at, as in a remark that the administration would seek to change the way hospitals are reimbursed for medical care to refocus the industry on prevention, a move that could set off another reimbursement battle with labor unions and hospitals.
 In other cases, controversial measures were tabled for another day. The governor did propose adding 2,000 professors to the State and City Universities of New York, which had been recommended by a special commission on higher education that he had convened.
 But an administration official said the governor would reject the commission's recommendation to increase tuition this year and would also not move forward with a proposal to allow different campuses to charge different rates in hopes of bolstering research campuses. 
 The progressive reformer in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt, as the governor presented himself a year ago, was absent. In his inaugural address last January, the governor spoke of making ethics reform one of his top two priorities. But there was scant mention of the subject in his current speech and no reference to the stalled campaign finance reform plan he made a priority for much of last year. 
 Instead, the governor's speech began with a moment of silence to commemorate Mr. Bruno's wife, Barbara, who died on Monday. In addition, he proposed renaming the Triborough Bridge after Robert F. Kennedy; four of the senator's family members were in attendance. 
 On property taxes, the governor turned to a former political rival, the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, to lead a commission to explore how to impose a ceiling on soaring property taxes, which have weighed heavily on upstate and Long Island. The cap would most likely exclude New York City, where city income tax revenues finance much of the school costs. 
 The work of the commission could lead to disputes. The governor said it would have special powers to issue subpoenas as it explores the causes of soaring school tax increases. The administration has been frustrated that property tax bills have escalated despite $1.3 billion worth of new rebate checks the state sent to homeowners last year. 
 ''We need stronger medicine,'' he said, adding, ''It's a losing game for the taxpayer if the state gives you a rebate check on Monday and then on Tuesday your local government taxes it away.''
 Many of his proposals will require legislative approval. Republicans were skeptical about some of the initiatives, including a plan to study selling or leasing a stake in the state's lottery system to finance the proposed higher education endowment.
 ''The issue that everybody in the Legislature is asking, and quite honestly the public should ask, is, how are you going to pay for everything?'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican and the deputy majority leader of the Senate. ''This securitization of the lottery is the mother lode of all one-shots.'' 
 But the governor's director of operations, Paul Francis, a former corporate financial officer, said the proposal was not the kind of asset sale Albany had used in the past to finance operating expenses, but would be used to create a permanent endowment and would let the state still control the lottery system. 
 Mr. Skelos also voiced skepticism about the governor's latest attempt to show a softer side. 
 ''He tried to be a little more conciliatory, but he's the one who said it's not in his DNA to change, so it remains to be seen,'' he said. 
 Others were more encouraged. 
 ''He was reaching out his hand, but over all, people want to see what the next step will be,'' said Assemblyman Darryl C. Towns, a Brooklyn Democrat.
 ''Last year, it was a lot of talk about reform, and he had a mandate,'' he added. ''Now, having served for a year, he's ready to accept that we all have a mandate, a shared mandate, and in order to get to some conclusions we have to work together.''

HEADLINE: Gov. Spitzer Tries Nice

 BODY:
After six rocky months feuding with Republicans, Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York on Wednesday laid out ambitious goals for his second year in office -- all in a new and welcome diplomatic style. The centerpiece is a plan to upgrade the state's uneven public university system with a $4 billion state endowment and a $3 billion ''innovation'' fund to encourage academic work that also helps the economy statewide. A public university system truly worthy of New York is certainly long overdue. 
 Governor Spitzer argues, correctly, that stronger universities would create jobs and vital economic communities. If he has his way, New York would someday have flagship schools to rival such big names as Berkeley or Rutgers. In particular, Mr. Spitzer wants to add 2,000 full-time faculty, including at least 250 new, eminent, big-name scholars. Veterans of the higher education battles in New York say that not since Nelson Rockefeller has a governor made so much of higher education and its important connection to a better economy.
 With the current economy weakening, however, the governor will have to figure out how to pay for all his new priorities, as state revenues slide. In his annual State of the State speech, he suggested somehow leasing the state lottery in order to improve the university system. The idea of encouraging gambling to support learning has always worried us, and there are also concerns about how much of that pot actually makes it to the classroom. The governor's budget address is in a few weeks, and we hope to hear more then about how he will finance this new plan. 
 Mr. Spitzer's speech touched on other priorities worth exploring such as expanding health care for the state's 400,000 children and a $400 million housing fund to help police and teachers. And he has asked Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi to wrestle with the issue of controlling property taxes while still funding public schools. 
 Mr. Spitzer, who seemed unbeatable when he came into office, lost plenty of friends and influence in the last year. One reason is that he has tried to reform Albany's culture of corruption. But he made those challenges even harder with his peremptory style and other missteps. State investigators are determining whether his administration acted illegally by trying to accumulate and then publicize information damaging to the governor's chief Republican rival, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno. 
 This is also an election year, and Mr. Spitzer has made no secret of his ambition to end the Republicans' -- and Mr. Bruno's -- longtime control of the Senate. With that political landscape, Mr. Bruno, and the senators who follow his dictates, are unlikely to eagerly embrace anything with the governor's name on it. 
 Whether for tactical reasons, or because he really wants to try a different approach, Mr. Spitzer was full of praise Wednesday for his political ''partners'' of both parties. And he acknowledged his own abrasiveness, saying that ''sometimes my talk is a little too plain, too direct.'' 
 Unfortunately, he barely mentioned the need to reform campaign financing, an ongoing scandal in Albany. Missing altogether was a push for judicial reform or a commission to map election districts fairly. Mr. Spitzer's new style is a better one, but even a more diplomatic governor should not back away from the fights that really matter.

HEADLINE: Air Travelers' Woes Likely to Worsen This Year

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
The miserably full flights of 2007 might seem like a good reason for airlines to roll out a few more planes and ease the crowding.
 But passengers should expect just the opposite: some big airlines are planning to reduce domestic capacity in 2008 with the hope of driving fares higher to offset rising fuel costs. Barring a recession that reduces demand for air travel, travelers can expect flying to be more crowded and more expensive than it was in 2007. 
 Because full flights cause airlines all sorts of operational problems, travelers should also brace for continuing problems with delays and misplaced bags. That means the chance of being bumped from an oversold flight could be greater, and finding a seat on a later flight will take longer. 
 ''It's not a good thing,'' Paul S. Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said about the prospect of the airlines reducing capacity. ''You're going to degrade the reliability of the system.''
 In 2007, travelers saw the fullest jets ever and the highest percentage of late arrivals -- 23.5 percent through the end of November -- in the 13 years the Transportation Department has collected such data.
 The expected shrinking of domestic capacity this year comes after two years of industry profits. That is far different from the abrupt shrinkage after Sept. 11, 2001, when demand for air travel declined sharply and airlines had no choice but to reduce fleets.
 The current trend of reducing capacity is aimed at pushing fares up. Among the top seven carriers, all but Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines reduced domestic capacity during 2007. Some carriers expanded aggressively in international markets where there is less low-fare competition.
 Now, United Airlines expects to reduce its domestic flights this year by 3 percent to 4 percent, while Delta Air Lines plans to cut domestic flights 4 percent to 5 percent. 
 Northwest Airlines and American Airlines are planning 2008 flights roughly equal to those of last year. 
 But Jamie Baker, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a recent report that those two carriers were well positioned to idle planes if high fuel prices made some flights unprofitable. That is because they both have a lot of planes that are paid for, meaning the aircraft do not need to be flying to retire debt. 
 Mr. Baker expects the hub-and-spoke airlines to shrink collectively by 2.5 percent this year. Even with growth at Southwest, Continental, JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways, the industry would grow over all by less than 1 percent under Mr. Baker's outlook, and it would shrink domestically.
 Airlines are eager to raise fares because of higher fuel costs. Each $10 increase in a barrel of oil requires the airlines to raise round-trip fares an average of $18, Mr. Baker estimated. About a year ago, oil was as low as $52 a barrel; on Wednesday, it traded at almost $96. 
 Airlines have been busy raising fares since Jan. 1 and are expected to continue doing so. But it will not be clear until the first quarter is over how successful that effort has been, since the mix of seats sold -- how many for $100, how many for $400 -- is more important than the price of any one fare.
 Last year, airlines raised fares repeatedly, but got little for the effort as smart-shopping leisure travelers and large businesses that negotiate fare discounts kept average fares paid to airlines from rising much. Southwest's average one-way fare through the first nine months of 2007 rose just 1 percent, to $105.57. Delta's yield -- a measure of fares -- rose just 3.7 percent during that same period.
 ''I think they're going to just keep raising prices,'' said Roger E. King, an analyst at CreditSights. ''They're going to have to keep at it.''
 Mr. King doubted that flights could get much fuller. At roughly 80 percent full for 2007, that means that on most flights on popular routes at convenient times every seat was sold.
 Shrinkage among traditional hub-and-spoke carriers could be good for consumers over the longer term as discount airlines and others offering new service rush in to fill the void. For example, Virgin America started flying last year from San Francisco and Skybus Airlines, operating from Columbus, Ohio, brought ultracheap fares to the United States by offering at least 10 seats on each flight for $10 one way.
 But in markets dominated by traditional airlines, fewer flights will just mean higher prices and more crowding and all the other service problems that go with packed planes.

HEADLINE: Nevada Savors Its Place As Maker of Momentum

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Scores of college students fanned out in neighborhoods across this city Wednesday, phone banks buzzed with newly minted volunteers and endorsements were proffered as the Democratic presidential candidates ratcheted up the volume in this once-quiet caucus state.
 Next in line on the Democratic calendar, Nevada was vaulted overnight into the position of breaking a tie, at least for now, after the victory of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. The campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Barack Obama, who won the Iowa caucuses last week, seemed poised for a sanguinary struggle in the Jan. 19 caucuses, and Mr. Obama was scheduled to arrive here on Friday.
 The Clinton and Obama camps rushed in volunteers and staff members from Iowa, furiously opened new field offices and saturated the airwaves with radio advertisements in Spanish and television spots promoting their health care plans. 
 For Mrs. Clinton, efforts on her behalf in Nevada intensified last week after her third-place finish in Iowa. Campaign staff members here impressed upon volunteers that they were direly needed. With her victory in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton, who long ago collected the institutional support of her party here -- and until recently enjoyed a double-digit lead in the polls -- is now seeking to build on her newfound momentum. 
 ''We always knew Nevada would be important as the first Western state,'' said Hilarie Grey, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton here. ''We can be the state that swings the momentum in an entirely different way.''
 Mr. Obama won an endorsement Wednesday morning from the highly influential Culinary Workers Union local at a raucous news conference here in Las Vegas, where more than 100 members began chanting and yelling at what quickly became an Obama rally. 
 After praising the other Democrats for fighting for ''the Las Vegas dream,'' D. Taylor, the secretary and treasurer of the union and its public face, gave the nod to Mr. Obama. 
 Mr. Taylor celebrated something that Nevada residents have enjoyed for months, candidates who actually show up in the state. ''It's been exciting,'' he said. ''For the first time I know of in Nevada, dishwashers, cooks, housekeepers, cocktail servers, bartenders from all different walks of life'' had access to candidates. 
 The union, which has about 60,000 members, is extremely influential in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and hopes to play a major role in the race, where Mrs. Clinton has had the edge for months. Alluding to Nevada's racial diversity in relation to Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Taylor said, ''We're not just white bread here; we got pumpernickel, we've got whole wheat and we've got rye.'' 
 Mr. Obama is counting on a highly organized cadre of enthusiastic supporters -- he has nearly double the number of field offices of any other candidate -- to edge him toward another victory.
 In North Las Vegas on Wednesday, an Obama field office was buzzing with activities and people came in from the streets looking for yard signs and T-shirts. (''Tell Mama Vote Obama'' remained on the wall, and there was not a sign for the taking.) 
 ''Senator Obama has invested heavily into this state,'' said Shannon Gilson, a spokeswoman for his campaign here. ''We aren't taking anything for granted.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton's campaign, perhaps trying to distract from the powerful union endorsement, made much hay Wednesday morning of its endorsement by Representative Shelley Berkley, whose Congressional district encompasses Las Vegas.
 Mr. Obama, of Illinois, and Mrs. Clinton, of New York, have ventured into parts of Nevada that have traditionally shunned Democrats, like Elko in the north. Statewide, Mr. Obama has 11 offices total, and Mrs. Clinton has 6, including two she opened since the New Year here. 
 The efforts are boisterous extensions of what the Clinton and Obama campaigns have been quietly building as the rest of the nation kept its eyes on Iowa and New Hampshire.
 Nevada, chosen by the Democratic Party to hold an early contest long before numerous other states decided to move their primaries to Feb. 5, has been largely overshadowed by Iowa, New Hampshire and, to a lesser degree, South Carolina. 
 (Republicans also have caucuses here on Jan. 19, but they are nonbinding and have been largely ignored by all but Mitt Romney and Representative Ron Paul.) 
 In Nevada candidates will find a booming state with a population far more concerned with infrastructure and traffic than farm subsidies and family values, and one bedeviled by some of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation. 
 Health care, the theme of advertising by both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, is the issue of the day here, along with the Iraq war. John Edwards, who pulled workers out of the state early in the campaign, has had a harder time getting traction.
 ''There are no real social services here,'' said David Damore, a political scientist at the University of Nevada. ''So to come here and tell people they need to care about the poor is not a winning strategy.''
 Volunteers have been clocking phone banks for multiple shifts a day, canvassing neighborhoods not only to ferret out potential voters, but also to educate people on how a caucus works. While only about 9,000 people participated in the 2004 caucuses, the state's Democratic Party is bracing for far higher numbers. 
 The Democrats are heavily concentrated in Clark County, with much of the rest of the state a Republican stronghold. But in recent months, Democratic voter registration has passed that of Republicans, and Nevada is a genuine swing state. 
 ''The political dynamic is closer to New Hampshire than Iowa,'' Dr. Damore said. ''It is a place that is in transition from Old West, libertarian, small-state mind-set to 'Hey, we are a major player,' with gaming and politics. The Democrats have made the interior West the place to win, and this is a winnable state.''
 Volunteers appear tireless. On Tuesday, Olivia Brice, a Clinton volunteer, stared intently at Eric Smith as if Ms. Brice could hypnotize him into ceasing his tirade against her candidate.
 ''I have nothing against her except for her last name,'' said Mr. Smith, an unemployed casino worker, as he lectured Ms. Brice, one of scores of college students and other campaign volunteers who have poured into Nevada in recent weeks, giving up holidays to campaign. 
 A woman, a potential Clinton supporter who crouched nervously behind her half-opened front door, said, ''I just hear everybody going with Barack.'' 
 Ms. Brice replied: ''That's not true, Vivian. The only thing that matters is what is happening here in Nevada.''

HEADLINE: Niceness Campaign in Albany Gets Nowhere as G.O.P. Pouts

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Trymaine Lee contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Few second dates have been so awkward.
 Like an eager and earnest suitor, Gov. Eliot Spitzer spent much of his second State of the State address wooing and praising lawmakers, with particular emphasis on Senate Republicans, his most bitter adversaries in Albany. Like haughty coquettes, the Republicans spurned him.
 They smirked. They rolled their eyes. They grunted dismissively. And though Mr. Spitzer's speech on Wednesday sprouted more olive branches than a Tuscan hillside, Republican senators and Assembly members mostly sat on their hands. 
 Not even the governor's conspicuous and deliberate praise of individual Republican lawmakers could ease the chill in the air. When Mr. Spitzer singled out Senator George D. Maziarz, an upstate Republican, for his efforts on a landmark worker's compensation overhaul last year, Mr. Maziarz's fellow Republicans cheered ironically, and lightly needled him.
 ''There goes your re-election!'' one yelled out. (Mr. Spitzer tried to lighten the mood. ''Sorry, George,'' he said, to laughter.)
 Though Democrats in the Legislature have also had strained relations with Mr. Spitzer, some were disheartened by the Republicans' frostiness.
 ''My first State of the State, and this is what I got treated to,'' said Senator Craig M. Johnson, a Long Island Democrat elected last February in a special election. ''I remember Bill Clinton's State of the Union in the middle of impeachment, and even then, whenever there was a remark about a genuine bipartisan accomplishment, they would at least clap for that.''
 In all, Mr. Spitzer's speech drew applause some 100 times. But almost all of those were ovations led by, and dominated by, Democrats.
 In interviews before the address, Republicans said there had been no plan, unofficial or official, to snub Mr. Spitzer.
 ''The ones we philosophically like, we'll clap for,'' one Republican senator, Martin J. Golden, said Wednesday morning. ''The ones we philosophically oppose, we won't clap for.''
 But it did not quite turn out that way. Proposals that seemed deliberately aimed at Republican ears drew little response. Among the Republican senators, eyebrows remained cocked in skepticism and lips curled into smirks.
 Protecting children from sexual predators? Eh. Manpower from the state police to aid local enforcement? Big deal. New flagship schools for biotech research in Republican-dominated Long Island and western New York? Yawn.
 Even Mr. Spitzer's most deliberate and tantalizing offer -- a possible cap on local property taxes -- earned only a faint ripple of applause from the Republicans. Assembly Republicans barely stirred, though they had urged Mr. Spitzer in recent days to make such a proposal, with some draping baseball hats emblazoned with the words ''Tax Cap'' over their nameplates during the address. One Republican senator shook his head slightly, as if in disbelief. Another rolled his eyes.
 Only when Mr. Spitzer proposed a huge $1 billion ''revitalization fund'' to aid the upstate economy did the Legislature's Republicans show evident appreciation. 
 David A. Paterson, Mr. Spitzer's lieutenant governor, acknowledged the hostility but said he thought it could eventually be overcome. 
 ''I think a couple of people are upset about a few things, but as the session goes on, if we keep working and reaching out the way the governor did today, it will end with the same thunderous applause that greeted the last State of the State,'' Mr. Paterson said.
 Still, there were lingering signs of resentment even among Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats in the Legislature. The biggest cheer of the day, it turned out, did not go to Mr. Spitzer, the state Democrats' titular leader. Instead, it went to Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, whom Assembly Democrats installed last winter over Mr. Spitzer's objection.
 In a news conference following the address, however, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, heaped praise on Mr. Spitzer, even signaling openness to the property tax cap, a measure of which he has been skeptical in the past. The governor, Mr. Silver said, had been ''nonpartisan in terms of mentioning'' members of the Legislature in the speech. 
 Reminded that Mr. Spitzer had done much the same in his State of the State speech last year, Mr. Silver gave a little smile.
 ''I think follow-through is important,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Fierce Corzine Opponent Turns Ally

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J. 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine on Wednesday turned to the Republican he defeated in a bitter race for the United States Senate in 2000 to help with what may be his toughest campaign yet: persuading taxpayers and legislators to accept costly increases on New Jersey's toll roads to pay off billions in debt and maintain its bridges and highways.
 Bob Franks, who during eight years in Congress was a member of the Budget and Transportation Committees, said at a news conference that he had agreed to become the chairman of a campaign to promote Mr. Corzine's plan. 
 Mr. Franks said that he had been talking to Mr. Corzine for a year about his plan, and explained the unusual alliance this way: ''The current occupant of the governorship is a liberal Democrat, so how could I, as a fiscally conservative Republican, find common ground with him? The reason is simple: Jon Corzine has broken with the tradition of Trenton, and declared that we must transform the way that we handle the state's finances.''
 Under Mr. Corzine's proposal, highway tolls would increase by a maximum of 50 percent four times in 12 years -- in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 -- and be adjusted for inflation. 
 A nonprofit corporation set up by the state to replace the New Jersey Turnpike Authority would issue bonds secured by future toll revenues that would generate up to $38 billion. Those billions, in turn, would slice the state's debt of $32 billion in half and pump money into the Transportation Trust Fund, which is nearly depleted, for road and bridge repairs and other projects.
 Mr. Franks, who was a member of the General Assembly for 13 years before going to Washington, said that he applauded Mr. Corzine's goals of erasing a huge chunk of the state's debt and bolstering the infrastructure. He also commended Mr. Corzine on his plan to freeze spending in next year's budget, clamp down on the growth of spending in coming years and seek a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval for future borrowing.
 After hearing Mr. Franks say that he wanted to ''depoliticize'' the debate over his plan, Mr. Corzine said: ''It really, I think, speaks to the absolute importance of making sure, on a nonpartisan basis, that the State of New Jersey come to grips with a need to put our fiscal house in order, both in the short run and the long run, and that it's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue.''
 Receiving such support from Mr. Franks represented a major political coup for Mr. Corzine, who faces stiff resistance from Republicans and a number of Democrats in the State Legislature.
 Moreover, the announcement -- coming one day after Mr. Corzine unveiled his plan during the State of the State address before a joint session of the Legislature -- helped kick off a campaign that will include visits from Mr. Corzine to newspaper editorial boards, a series of television and radio interviews and town hall meetings in the state's 21 counties.
 Mr. Franks's visible role also put Republicans in an awkward position, since several of them have already criticized the governor's plan, likening the bond issue to borrowing from one credit card to pay for another.
 But Mr. Franks, who is now the president of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, which represents pharmaceutical companies, said that he had faith in the governor's plan, in large part because of Mr. Corzine's experience in the world of finance as a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.
 ''I think it's expected when a leader of one party puts forward a sweeping proposal for change, that you can anticipate that the other political party, whoever that may be at any given time, will have reservations,'' he said. ''But I would remind all New Jerseyans that mere opposition is not a meaningful public policy.''
 Tom Wilson, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said that he, too, agreed with the governor's pledge to freeze spending and give voters more say on bond issues. But he said: ''It's going to take an awful lot more than putting one or two Republican names to it to give this credibility. Bob Franks is good, but convincing people this is the right thing will be harder than convincing an Eskimo he needs a lawn mower.''
 Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks, who as members of the same church in Summit have known each other for years, waged a tough campaign in 2000. Mr. Franks pounded Mr. Corzine relentlessly for spending more than $60 million to finance his campaign, and Mr. Corzine described Mr. Franks as an ideological clone of the conservative former House speaker, Newt Gingrich.
 Indeed, Mr. Franks -- his tongue firmly in cheek -- opened the news conference by saying that Mr. Corzine had finally released his tax returns. At another point he referred to Mr. Corzine, an unabashed liberal on social issues, the way he had during the campaign as a way to belittle Mr. Corzine's beliefs in universal access to health care, higher education and preschool.
 ''No, Mr. Universal is not going to pay me for this job,'' Mr. Franks said, eliciting an audible ''Oh!'' from Mr. Corzine.

HEADLINE: Military Leaders Seek 3,000 More Troops for Afghanistan

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senior military officers will soon propose deploying about 3,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan, where the NATO-led security and stabilization effort is short of combat forces and trainers, Pentagon officials said Wednesday. 
 The proposal has not yet been presented to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, whose very public efforts in recent weeks to get NATO nations to increase troop commitments in Afghanistan have yet to succeed.
 If approved, most of the 3,200 troops, all marines, would be sent to southern Afghanistan, where NATO forces have faced a growing Taliban resurgence.
 Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, requested the additional forces, and the idea has been endorsed by Adm. William J. Fallon, commander of American forces in the Middle East, and by Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon officials said.
 The proposal for more troops was first reported Wednesday by ABC News on its Web site.
 The security assistance mission has about 40,000 troops, of which 14,000 are American. An additional 7,500 combat soldiers and security trainers, as well as some helicopters, must be added to meet force levels that NATO nations have agreed are needed. Separately, the United States has 12,000 other troops in Afghanistan conducting counterterrorism missions. ''This proposal is pre-emptive,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. ''It does not reflect a deterioration in the security situation.'' 
 Commanders in Iraq, he said, requested the additional marines to ensure that NATO and Afghan troops would be ready for any attacks from the Taliban -- anticipated after the spring thaw.
 The new Marine Corps mission in Afghanistan would be in addition to the service's duties in Iraq, and not a replacement of that combat role, he said.
 The Bush administration is deeply concerned about Afghanistan, and last month began top-to-bottom reviews of the mission, from security and counterterrorism to political consolidation and economic development. 
 Commanders in Afghanistan would like even more troops, but that is unlikely because the American military is so strained by current deployments there and in Iraq, officials said. So Mr. Gates will continue pressing NATO nations.

HEADLINE: DuPont Raises Its Estimate For Earnings in '07 and '08

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: DOVER, Del. 

 BODY:
Citing strong fourth-quarter results and prospects for growth in emerging markets, the chemical maker DuPont raised its earning estimate for 2007 on Wednesday as well as its profit forecast for 2008. 
 The company, which makes products ranging from automotive coatings to genetically modified seeds, said it expected 2007 earnings to be at the upper end of its previously announced range of $3.15 to $3.20 a share, excluding one-time items.
 DuPont also increased its 2008 earnings outlook to a range of $3.35 to $3.55 a share, up from $3.31 to $3.52 a share.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast 2007 earnings of $3.19 a share and profit of $3.42 a share in 2008. Dupont will report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 results on Jan. 22.
 Shares jumped $2.03, to $44.78. 
 The chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Holliday Jr., said that 2007 earnings growth would be 11 percent or better, despite higher prices for raw materials and the sluggish housing and automotive markets. DuPont also makes flooring.
 ''We expect that continued growth worldwide from our agriculture and nutrition business segment and growth from all of our segments in emerging markets will more than compensate for a slower U.S. economy,'' Mr. Holliday said.
 Carl J. Lukach, vice president for investor relations at DuPont, said the agriculture and nutrition business had been particularly strong in Brazil and that growth in emerging markets like China, India and Eastern Europe had averaged about 15 percent.
 Mr. Lukach said DuPont had kept a close eye on sales recently amid speculation that the American economy was headed for a recession.

HEADLINE: On To Michigan, G.O.P. Rivals Turn To the Economy

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Marc Santora reported from Pontiac, and Adam Nagourney from Manchester, N.H., and Boston. David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Washington, Michael Luo from Grand Rapids, Mich., and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney sped to Michigan on Wednesday and turned their focus to the slowing economy as they headed toward the next showdown in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
 Mr. Romney dropped his television advertising in two other important battlegrounds, South Carolina and Florida, to focus his spending on Michigan in hopes of averting another major defeat. Mr. McCain, whose campaign until now has operated by necessity as a wide open but low-cost insurgency, adopted a carefully choreographed series of rallies as it scrambled to gather the money and the organization it needs to take advantage of his victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday. 
 On the Democratic side, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign aides gathered to plot how best to take advantage of her victory in New Hampshire as she and Senator Barack Obama prepared for a protracted nationwide battle for the nomination.
 After two fourth-place finishes, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is dropping out of the Democratic contest, according to people knowledgeable about his decision. John Edwards remains in the race, but his distant third-place finish in New Hampshire moved the Democrats toward a two-person race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. 
 After appearing on the morning television news programs, Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail as she and her aides debated how to allocate her time and money through Feb. 5, when 22 states will vote. Mr. Obama made a foray to the New York area, appearing at a rally in New Jersey, which like New York and Connecticut will hold its primary on Feb. 5, before coming to Manhattan for a fund-raiser.
 At midnight on Tuesday, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, convened a conference call of senior staff members across the country, refocusing them on the contest ahead in an effort to move beyond the defeat in New Hampshire. ''We're certainly going to throw all of our energy into Nevada, South Carolina and Feb. 5 states,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday.
 The immediate focus of both the Clinton and Obama campaigns was the Nevada caucuses on Jan. 19, which was shaping up as the head-to-head test of the strength of both these candidates. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton dispatched their field staffs there from Iowa last week, and Mrs. Clinton plans to visit Nevada on Thursday. Mr. Obama on Wednesday won the endorsement of the culinary workers' union in Nevada, but Democrats there said that Mrs. Clinton had a strong organization and that the contest was extremely close.
 In both parties the candidates were recalibrating their strategies after the results in New Hampshire, which revived Mrs. Clinton's fortunes after her defeat by Mr. Obama in Iowa and gave Mr. McCain his first victory and a chance to deal Mr. Romney a potentially debilitating blow in Michigan. Mr. McCain arrived in Michigan ahead of Mr. Romney, appearing at two rallies before heading to South Carolina in the afternoon in preparation for the debate there on Thursday. 
 Both candidates emphasized job loss and the broader anxieties that have taken root as the economy has slowed.
 ''Some of the jobs that have left the state of Michigan are not coming back,'' Mr. McCain warned. ''They are not, and I am sorry to tell you that. But I believe we can develop a plan to take care of these workers who have lost their jobs.''
 Mr. Romney told an audience of more than 200 at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids that Michigan's economic woes were personal to him and said the state's prospects were tied up with the nation's.
 He talked at length about his roots in the state, where he was born and reared, drawing applause when he recalled his father, George, who was governor of Michigan. He went on to recall campaigning as a teenager for his father, whose slogan was about getting Michigan ''on the move again.''
 ''We're going to make sure this state gets on the move again,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I care about Michigan. For me, it's personal. It's personal for me because it's where I was born and raised.''
 Earlier in the day, after hearing from a voter who recalled his father, Mr. Romney choked up momentarily, according to a pool reporter who was present. ''He was a great man, and I miss him dearly,'' Mr. Romney said.
 The results in New Hampshire left Mr. Romney's campaign in dire straits after losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, despite pouring millions into the contests and blanketing the states with advertisements for months. 
 Mr. Romney held a national fund-raising call day on Wednesday in Boston, an event his aides said had been planned for some time. His campaign said it raised $1.5 million that it can use during the primaries and an additional $3.5 million it could use if Mr. Romney wins the nomination and runs in the general election. 
 But the decision to focus its advertisements on Michigan suggested that the Romney campaign is making tough decisions about where to spend its money, despite Mr. Romney's ability to reach into his own pockets.
 ''This race is about Michigan right now,'' said Kevin Madden, a Romney spokesman. 
 Adding yet another wrinkle is the potential impact of Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, in the race in Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday. Emphasizing economic themes, Mr. Huckabee began running an advertisement here on Wednesday obliquely taking on Mr. Romney, saying voters wanted a president who reminds them ''of the guy they work with, not the guy that laid them off'' and highlighting the nation's job losses and rising fuel prices.
 Mr. Huckabee's advisers said several factors were working in their favor in Michigan. They said the size of the state put a premium on news media coverage, which Mr. Huckabee has displayed a knack for attracting. There is a substantial evangelical population in western Michigan, giving him an audience for his conservative views on social issues. And his message of economic populism could resonate among blue-collar workers.
 Still, Mr. Huckabee is likely to limit the time and money he spends in Michigan because he does not want to detract from South Carolina, where he has been setting up his first real campaign organization and where he is banking on doing well among the state's many evangelical voters.
 Mr. McCain's strategy in Michigan rests in part on reaching out to centrist Republicans and independents. Because the Democratic candidates are not actively campaigning in Michigan -- the party has put sanctions on the state for holding its primary earlier than the party wanted -- independent voters could move toward the Republican contest, potentially helping Mr. McCain. He won Michigan in his losing battle against George W. Bush for the Republican nomination in 2000.
 Among the Democrats, aides to both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama said Mrs. Clinton's victory on Tuesday stopped any movement by donors and party leaders to coalesce around a front-runner. 
 Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it had collected $700,000 overnight, in addition to $20 million it already had on hand. Mr. McAuliffe also said he had no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would be able to keep pace with Mr. Obama in the expensive month ahead, a contention that was not disputed by Mr. Obama's aides.
 The result on Tuesday left both sides studying the map ahead. Both campaigns have abandoned their previous assumptions that the nominationwould effectively be settled on Feb. 5 -- and instead settled in for what could be a long fight until one or the other wins the most delegates.
 ''For the first time since 1988, this is a delegate race,'' said Howard Wolfson, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ''This is about more than any one state.''
 Mr. Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said: ''I don't think anyone can tell you with any degree of certainty how long this will go. This is going to be a furious battle between two candidates.''
 Although the campaigns appear evenly matched in Nevada, the next state where Democrats will compete actively, Mr. Obama appears to have a stronger organization and base of support in South Carolina, which follows. 
 As of now, Mrs. Clinton's advisers said they were looking to California, New Jersey, New York, Arkansas and Georgia as their first targets among the states that come later, but they made clear that their target list could expand. They said Mrs. Clinton would make in effort to win delegates in certain Congressional districts in Mr. Obama's home state, Illinois, which is how delegates are allocated there. Mr. Obama is making a similar effort in New York.
 While Mr. Obama's strategists said it was too early to pinpoint their top state targets, California, New Jersey, Georgia and Missouri lead the list, suggesting some shared targets with Mrs. Clinton. The mayor of Atlanta, Shirley Franklin, announced her endorsement of Mr. Obama on Wednesday and the campaign is wooing Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who aides say expects to announce her support soon.
 For his first campaign appearance in the next stage of the race, Mr. Obama chose a rally on Wednesday in New Jersey, one of the places he is eyeing in the trove of nearly two-dozen states holding primaries or caucuses in the next four weeks. Mrs. Clinton's campaign had surrogates stage rallies on her behalf in about a dozen states that vote on Feb. 5.
 Even as Mr. Obama spent nearly all of his time in Iowa in the last two months, his campaign was building an operation in states that hold contests on Feb. 5. An aggressive absentee ballot program is under way in California, anchored by the man who ran Bill Clinton's 1992 New Hampshire race. (One-third of Democrats vote absentee.)

HEADLINE: Not Just the Fed

 BODY:
The American economy is weakening fast, and some prominent economists are saying a recession is already here. The Federal Reserve, with its prodigious lending capacity and power to cut interest rates, could yet save the day. But with prices, and fears of inflation, also rising, the Fed has less room to maneuver. 
 That is why it is imperative that President Bush and Congressional leaders begin a serious discussion about how to help revive the economy, if need be, with a short-term stimulus package. 
 President Bush has suggested that permanent tax cuts (his longtime goal and a favorite of nearly all the Republican presidential candidates) are his fix of choice. But those tax cuts would take effect in 2011, doing nothing for today's economic woes. 
 Democrats are broaching more sensible measures, like bolstered spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps and direct aid to states. They should consider adding the idea of a targeted tax rebate. A one-shot rebate would be another way to stimulate the economy -- and could draw the tax-phobic White House into a constructive discussion.
 If ever there was a time not to let ideology drive economic policy, it is now. More than a million people stand to lose their homes over the next two years. Some 10 million families stand to lose all of their home equity. Inflation is wiping out wage gains, while pushing up prices for food and gasoline. Job growth has stalled and unemployment is rising. 
 If conditions deteriorate even further, the White House and Congress would need to act quickly. That means they need to start talking now, before things turn grave, about how they would supplement the Fed's efforts with specific temporary boosts. 
 In the meantime, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has tough calls to make. Wall Street is insisting that lower rates are necessary, despite inflationary pressures, because recession is a more urgent threat than rising prices. There's truth to that. Yet even if the Fed slashed rates, there's no guarantee of a big rebound. Lower interest rates could cause the dollar to weaken further. A weaker dollar correlates to higher oil prices, which in turn, would blunt the ability of lower rates to stimulate a lagging economy. 
 There's a lot riding on Mr. Bernanke's judgment. But the White House and Congress also must start preparing to step in if Mr. Bernanke and the Fed can't turn the economy around. One issue they must agree on: any fiscal stimulus legislation should be targeted and temporary.
 Economic history is clear that stimulus measures that are effective in the short run tend to backfire if they go on too long. They become unaffordable, and that is bad for growth. The economy's challenges are formidable enough, without creating any more problems.

HEADLINE: Getting It Wrong

BYLINE: By ANDREW KOHUT. 
Andrew Kohut is the president of the Pew Research Center.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE failure of the New Hampshire pre-election surveys to mirror the outcome of the Democratic race is one of the most significant miscues in modern polling history. All the published polls, including those that surveyed through Monday, had Senator Barack Obama comfortably ahead with an average margin of more than 8 percent. These same polls showed no signs that Senator Hillary Clinton might close that gap, let alone win.
 While it will take time for those who conducted the New Hampshire tracking polls to undertake rigorous analyses of their surveys, a number of things are immediately apparent. 
 First, the problem was not a general failure of polling methodology. These same pollsters did a superb job on the Republican side. Senator John McCain won by 5.5 percent. The last wave of polls found a margin of 5.3 percent. So whatever the problem was, it was specific to Mrs. Clinton versus Mr. Obama. 
 Second, the inaccuracies don't seem related to the subtleties of polling methods. The pollsters who overestimated Mr. Obama's margin ranged from CBS and Gallup (who have the most rigorous voter screens and sampling designs, and have sterling records in presidential elections) to local and computerized polling operations, whose methods are a good deal less refined. Everyone got it wrong. 
 Third, the mistakes were not the result of a last-minute trend going Mrs. Clinton's way. Yes, according to exit polls the 17 percent of voters who said they made their decision on Election Day chose Mrs. Clinton a little more than those who decided in the past two or three weeks. But the margin was very small -- 39 percent of the late deciders went for Mrs. Clinton and 36 percent went for Mr. Obama. This gap is obviously too narrow to explain the wide lead for Mr. Obama that kept showing up in pre-election polls.
 Fourth, some have argued that the unusually high turnout may have caused a problem for the pollsters. It's possible, but unlikely. While participation was higher than in past New Hampshire primaries, the demographic and political profile of the vote remains largely unchanged. In particular, the mix of Democrats to independents -- 54 percent to 44 percent respectively -- is close to what it was in 2000, the most recent New Hampshire primary without an incumbent in the race.
 To my mind all these factors deserve further study. But another possible explanation cannot be ignored -- the longstanding pattern of pre-election polls overstating support for black candidates among white voters, particularly white voters who are poor.
 In exploring this factor, it is useful to look closely at the nature of the constituencies for the two candidates in New Hampshire, which were divided along socio-economic lines. 
 Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Obama by 12 points (47 percent to 35 percent) among those with family incomes below $50,000. By contrast, Mr. Obama beat Mrs. Clinton by five points (40 percent to 35 percent) among those earning more than $50,000. 
 There was an education gap, too. College graduates voted for Mr. Obama 39 percent to 34 percent; Mrs. Clinton won among those who had never attended college, 43 percent to 35 percent.
 Of course these are not the only patterns in Mrs. Clinton's support in New Hampshire. Women rallied to her (something they did not do in Iowa), while men leaned to Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton also got stronger support from older voters, while Mr. Obama pulled in more support among younger voters. But gender and age patterns tend not to be as confounding to pollsters as race, which to my mind was a key reason the polls got New Hampshire so wrong.
 Poorer, less well-educated white people refuse surveys more often than affluent, better-educated whites. Polls generally adjust their samples for this tendency. But here's the problem: these whites who do not respond to surveys tend to have more unfavorable views of blacks than respondents who do the interviews.
 I've experienced this myself. In 1989, as a Gallup pollster, I overestimated the support for David Dinkins in his first race for New York City mayor against Rudolph Giuliani; Mr. Dinkins was elected, but with a two percentage point margin of victory, not the 15 I had predicted. I concluded, eventually, that I got it wrong not so much because respondents were lying to our interviewers but because poorer, less well-educated voters were less likely to agree to answer our questions. That was a decisive factor in my miscall.
 Certainly, we live in a different world today. The Pew Research Center has conducted analyses of elections between candidates of different races in 2006 and found that polls now do a much better job estimating the support for black candidates than they did in the past. However, the difficulties in interviewing the poor and the less well-educated persist. 
 Why didn't this problem come up in Iowa? My guess is that Mr. Obama may have posed less of a threat to white voters in Iowa because he wasn't yet the front-runner. Caucuses are also plainly different from primaries.
 In New Hampshire, the ballots are still warm, so it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause for the primary poll flop. But given the dearth of obvious explanations, serious consideration has to be given to the difficulties that race and class present to survey methodology.

HEADLINE: Denmark: Profit Falls at Stereo Maker

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Bang & Olufsen, the Danish maker of stereos and television sets, posted a 37 percent decline in first-half pretax profit and lowered its full-year outlook, setting off a 28.5 percent decline in its share price. Bang & Olufsen's pretax profit for the six months ended Nov. 30 was 150 million Danish kroner ($29.6 million), down from 238 million kroner in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent, to 2.2 billion kroner, in line with the expectations of analysts. Sales were 8 percent higher in North America, but they were flat in Germany and declined 6 percent in Britain. The company said that a recent disappointing trend in retail sales had led it to cut its full-year pretax profit outlook to 360 million to 400 million kroner, compared with a previous forecast of 540 million to 570 million kroner. ''It is clear that some markets have come under pressure in relation to consumer investments,'' the chief executive, Torben B. Sorensen, above, said in a statement. ''We must be realistic and say that the economy in certain places looks like it will weaken, especially in parts of Europe and the United States.''

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students complete an anonymous poll about cheating. They will then use The New York Times to identify news stories about cheating and write reflection papers that address the impact of those issues in their own lives.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will:
 1. Anonymously share opinions about cheating.
 2. Learn about one writer's perspective on cheating in school by reading and discussing the article "And Out of the Corner of My Eye."
 3. Investigate cases of cheating reported in the news.
 4. Write reflection papers that address the issue of cheating as an ethical question. 
Resources / Materials:
-Pens/pencils
 -Classroom board
 -Handouts prepared as directed in the Warm-Up (one per student)
 -Copies of The Times (enough to distribute sections of the newspaper to the class)
 -Computers with Internet access
 -Copies of the article "And Out of the Corner of My Eye," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080110thursday.html (one per student) 
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do Now: Before class, prepare a poll for students students to complete anonymously. Note that each question requires a yes-or-no response. You may add "Yes or No" after each question for students to circle or instruct students to write their response in the blanks.
 -Have you ever been tempted to cheat on a test, homework or other school assignment?
 -Would you cheat if you knew you wouldn't get caught?
 -Is it acceptable to cheat on something small like a pop quiz or a group assignment?
 -Do you think it is more acceptable to cheat on a test in a topic you don't care about?
 -Would you report someone for cheating?
 -Which of the following is cheating (Check all that apply):
 a) A friend lets you copy their homework because you left yours at home.
 b) A friend in the class before yours tells you what's going to be on the test.
 c) You hand in a paper you wrote for a different class.
 d) A friend gives you a copy of last year's final exam answers, which turns out to be the same exam.
 e) You have an open-book test and use a friend's notes.
 f) You find a paper on a similar topic online and use a few sentences verbatim.
 -Have you ever cheated on something personal (like a diet, exercise regimen, crossword puzzle or your budget)?
 -Did you win?
 Remind students that responses are anonymous and there will be no personal follow-up. Distribute the polls as students enter the class and give them five minutes to respond and return them. Tally the results on the board. Are there varying opinions about what constitutes cheating? Engage students in a general discussion about the issue of cheating. What factors might determine whether an activity is considered cheating? Might a person who cheats once, even if on a small matter like a pop quiz, be likely to cheat again or in a bigger way? Why might someone risk getting caught if they were faced with a severe penalty for cheating? Can they point to examples of cheating in the public sphere in which cheaters caused insult or injury to others? Prompt them to consider some examples in the news like accusations of referees fixing games, corporate executives embezzling funds or prosecuting attorneys falsifying evidence in a trial. How might these examples compare with examples of cheating in school?
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "And Out of the Corner of My Eye" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080110thursday.html), and focus on the following questions:
 a. What lesson did the author hope to impart to her son?
 b. What lessons did she learn from her own example?
 c. Why was there poetic justice in her case?
 d. What tools and strategies have been put into place to deter cheating in schools?
 e. How are students punished after they have been caught cheating?
 f. Do you think that the punishments are just? Explain your answer.
 g. Why might some examples of cheating seem unclear to students? Cite one example of an unclear rule.
 h. How successful do you think the author's story was in possibly deterring her son from cheating?
 i. Do you think that all cheating should be punishable? Why or why not?
 3. Explain to students that they will look for contemporary examples of cheating reported in The Times to examine the impact of cheating on the general public. Begin by having the class brainstorm stories that they may have heard in the news. Prompt them to consider some high-profile cases like the accusations of illegal drug use in Major League Baseball, the case of the North Carolina district attorney allegedly falsifying evidence during the Duke lacrosse team trial, questions raised about voter fraud in Kenya, the decision by late-night TV talk show hosts to return to work during the writer's strike, corruption charges facing the former Newark mayor, Sharpe James, the alleged embezzlement case over Brooke Astor's will or the illegal excavation trial for Getty curator Marion True. Note that students may only know one or two examples to start. Prompt them to consider the types of cheating they may find, perhaps in the areas of sports, business or politics, where such incidents may be more likely to occur.
 Arrange the class into small groups of two or three students and distribute sections of the newspaper to each group. Prompt students to use their sections of The Times and NYTimes.com (advising them to search only in the sections online that relate to the sections they received) to identify one news story about cheating. For their online investigations, prompt them to consider keywords they might use to search for articles on cheating, like corruption, fraud, plagiarism, falsify or cover-up.
 After they find their articles, prompt them to work together to discuss the main themes, focusing on the following questions (distributed as a handout to help guide their discussions):
 -Who are the principal figures in this case of cheating?
 -Why might the accused have been tempted to cheat?
 -Who are the principal accusers?
 -What was the actual activity that was considered cheating? Was there any specific rule that was breached and if so what was it?
 -Who were the victims of the person's actions? What other parties might have been affected? Are the consequences ongoing?
 -How might the cheater's action impact others or the normal rules of play?
 -How has the system responded to accusations of widespread cheating and how might that impact the future?
 -How is the person expected to be punished for their actions, if at all?
 -How do you think the person should be punished, if at all?
 Toward the end of class have groups present summaries of their findings.
 4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students write a one to two page reflection paper that addresses the issues raised in their classwork and responds to the following questions written in their journals before the end of class: "How might the ethical decisions you make early in life (during your school years) impact the decisions you might be asked to make as an adult? Compare the actions and fate of someone whose story you read about in The Times with your own life. What different decisions might you have made to avoid the same or a similar fate? What pressures do you think this person might have faced and how might you have responded to them differently?"
 Have students submit their finished work in the next class. 
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Do you think you might respect someone less (or more) if you found out that they had cheated on something minor, like a quiz, or something major, like taxes? Explain your answer.
 -How might you respond to learning that your teacher, doctor, dentist, bus driver or other professional cheated on an important test that determined their ability to do that job? 
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the poll, thoughtful participation in the group work and completion of their reflection papers.
Vocabulary:
Litmus, forte, floe, perusing, deter, anecdote, erudite, breaches, quixotic, transgression, unbidden, cautionary
Extension Activities:
1. Investigate the code of ethics for your school and another school in a neighboring district. Compare your findings. How effective do you think each is in ensuring appropriate conduct and deterring cheating? What might you change to make it more effective, if anything? Write an editorial on the issue of school conduct for your school newspaper based on your information.
 2. Choose a thought-provoking quotation from the featured article to consider more closely. Write a one-page reaction paper that responds to the ideas expressed in that statement.
 3. Debate whether public figures (like athletes, business leaders and government officials) have a responsibility to act as moral role models for the public, especially young people. What impact might incidents of their cheating have on the public?
 4. Collect examples of musicians borrowing the work of other artists by sampling or covering another's work. Write an article that explores the similarities and differences between this and plagiarized writing. How do musicians attribute or acknowledge the other artist's work? Why are attributions (and compensation) important in both music and writing?
 5. Prepare a political cartoon that lampoons an individual, organization or corporation accused of cheating. 
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Journalism - Identify one story in a major newspaper featuring an individual accused of cheating and track the story from when it first broke in the news to its resolution (or the present). Prepare an anatomy of the story that identifies the key features of the reporting, including who, what, when, where, how and why, as those details emerged. What role did the newspaper play in investigating the case separate from any legal proceedings? What role might it have played in swaying public opinion? To what degree did reports offer objective or biased reflections on the events as they unfolded? Present a poster presentation based on your findings.
 Media Studies - Watch and analyze the tone and content of a film that features an accusation of cheating in school, like "School Ties" (1992) or "Stand and Deliver" (1988).
 Health - Research ways in which athletes often push the limits of their bodies in the quest to be healthy and successful, like excessive training, steroid use and unhealthy diet.
 Technology - Design a high- or low-tech solution intended to deter cheating or to alert others when cheating occurs. Consider the strategies students use to cheat on schoolwork and exams. How might your solution combat those strategies? Present solutions as part of an idea lab in the school.

HEADLINE: Death Across the Border Awaits Horses Spared It in the U.S.

BYLINE: By CATRIN EINHORN

DATELINE: SHIPSHEWANA, Ind. 

 BODY:
At the weekly horse auction here, No. 274, a handsome chestnut-colored draft horse, looked at the surrounding men while being led into a small ring. Two of the men looked back, calculating how much meat the animal's carcass would yield, and started bidding accordingly. 
 There is no pretense about what happens to the horses sold in this area of the auction, known as the kill pen. Just a few months ago, many of them would have met their end at a slaughterhouse in neighboring Illinois. Now almost all will be shipped to Canada and killed there. 
 Amid pressure from animal rights groups, horse slaughter virtually ended in the United States last year, as courts upheld state laws banning it in Texas and Illinois, home to the nation's last three horse slaughterhouses.
 But there have been unintended consequences, including more grueling travel for tens of thousands of horses now being sent to slaughter in Canada and Mexico, where, animal advocates say, they sometimes face more gruesome deaths.
 Horses that wind up as No. 274 did last month here in Shipshewana, near the Michigan state line, may once have carried children on their backs, pulled wagons on a farm, even been to the races. Now they are lame, aged, fractious or unwanted for any of various other reasons. Some are young, never broken in to begin with.
 The slaughterhouse closings themselves may have added to the population of the unwanted. In some parts of the country, auctioneers say, the closings have contributed to a drop in the price of horses at the low end of the market, and the added distance in the shipping of horses bound for slaughter, combined with higher fuel costs, means that some small or thin horses are no longer worth the fuel it takes to transport them.
 Add to that a rise in hay and grain prices, as well as a general economic slowdown.
 ''First time in my life I've seen livestock that has no value,'' said Devin Mullet, owner of Kalona Sales Barn in southeastern Iowa.
 After his monthly auction in October, Mr. Mullet said, he shot 28 horses that had failed to fetch any bids. Since then, he has monitored horses coming in for sale, turning away those he thinks are worthless -- often yearlings and the aged, which tend to yield less meat. (Horse meat for human consumption is shipped to countries including Belgium, France, Italy and Japan.)
 But opponents of horse slaughter say its domestic demise is a victory, if an incomplete one, in their fight to protect animals they see as devoted companions.
 ''It's a step closer to the long-term goal of banning slaughter in North America,'' said Wayne Pacelle, chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States. ''There are fewer horses slaughtered.''
 Indeed, even with the busy export to Canada and Mexico, the Agriculture Department estimates that 105,000 American horses were slaughtered in the three countries in 2007, down from some 138,000 the year before.
 For many horses, though, export means hundreds more miles of strenuous transit in large trailers. ''It's difficult for them to keep their balance, they're often crowded, they have no access to food or water while en route,'' said Timothy Cordes, a senior veterinarian with the Agriculture Department.
 Of particular concern to advocates is the treatment of the horses once they reach Mexico, to which exports have more than tripled. American protections simply do not apply there, Dr. Cordes said.
 The American slaughterhouses killed horses quickly by driving steel pins into their brains, a method the American Veterinary Medical Association considers humane. Workers in some Mexican plants, by contrast, disable them by stabbing them with knives to sever their spinal cords, said Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University.
 ''My worst nightmare has happened,'' Dr. Grandin said. ''This is an example of well-intentioned but very bad unintended consequences.''
 An official with the Mexican agriculture department said the technique described by Dr. Grandin was illegal in Mexico.
 Animal rights groups are pushing for federal legislation that would forbid the sale and transport of horses for human consumption, thereby banning the export market. Bills await action in both houses of Congress.
 In the meantime, the debate over horse slaughter continues to divide the equine community, pitting organizations against one another. Many thoroughbred associations support both the domestic slaughter ban and the proposed legislation; the American Quarter Horse Association is against them. The issue is so controversial that the American Horse Council, a national lobbying group for the horse industry, declares itself neutral. 
 Supporters of the ban say the solution to unwanted horses is to euthanize them -- by chemical injection, for example, as with a cat or a dog. ''Give the horse some dignity,'' said Barbara Geittmann, executive director of the Hooved Animal Humane Society. ''It gave you all the ribbons and all the wins.''
 But euthanasia and carcass disposal cost upward of $140, according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners, a veterinary group, and there can be environmental issues related to burial. 
 At the Shipshewana auction, Keith D. Lambright, an owner and auctioneer, said the price of meaty slaughter horses had dropped to an average of about $230, from roughly $330 a year ago. No. 274 sold for $150, and some in the kill pen brought as little as $30, perhaps to be used as zoo meat.
 A fuzzy foal and an emaciated old-timer fetched nothing at all. A woman felt sorry for them and, despite high feed prices, paid $40 for the pair and took them home as pets.

HEADLINE: American Express Warns About Earnings

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
American Express forecast first-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates on Thursday and adopted a ''cautious view'' for 2008 because of a slowing economy. 
 The company will take a $275 million fourth-quarter charge as more cardholders fail to repay their debts, the company, based in New York, said in a statement. Its stock fell 7 percent in extended trading.
 Credit card companies have been increasing their estimates of bad loans as a weakening economy makes it harder for consumers to pay their debts. 
 American Express said its first-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations would be less than the 90 cents a share in the period in 2007, missing the 93-cent average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 Another credit card company, The Capital One Financial Corporation, said that its 2007 earnings would fall short of its previous expectations because of increased loan delinquencies and additional legal reserves. 
 The company said in a statement that it expected a t fourth-quarter profit of 60 cents a share and full-year earnings of about $3.97 a share, below its forecast of ''about $5 per share.''
 The company said it was taking a $1.9 billion provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter, including about $1.3 billion in charge-offs.

 'SCREEN TEST' For six years in the 1990s Rob Roth, a downtown video director and designer, promoted a ''cyber-fetish-nightlife spectacle'' called Click + Drag at the Chelsea club Mother. The party was famous for its over-the-top costumed crowd and raunchy attitude. When the club closed, Mr. Roth didn't pack up his latex and strobe lights. He simply went legit. 
 One result is ''Screen Test,'' a rock opera starring Theo Kogan, formerly of the all-female punk group Lunachicks. Ms. Kogan, above, and her new band, the Skyscrapers, composed the music for the show, which blends theater, performance art, dance and video installation as a meditation on artifice, old-school Hollywood glamour and new-school politics. ''It's a statement about facade, about what's real,'' Mr. Roth said. ''A lot of the dialogue is about submerging yourself in a fantasy world. Especially in a political climate like today, I just feel like we have to create our own fantasy world; it's a survival mechanism to guard against the ugliness that's outside.'' The hourlong show had its premiere last year as part of Performance Space 122's multimedia Coil Festival, and is featured this year as well.
 For its second run this weekend Mr. Roth has made some changes, including amping up a section in which video is projected on a Butoh dancer, like a moving screen. Ms. Kogan's body too is used as a canvas; at one point a videotaped monologue she gives is beamed onto her, so she is conversing with (and on) herself. ''It's sort of video as a puppet,'' Mr. Roth said. ''I like the hallucination it creates. It's like an acid trip.'' Naturally, Mr. Roth, who has worked with downtown artists like Debbie Harry and Justin Bond, credits his nightlife past with inspiration: ''I felt like it was graduate school for me,'' he said. Who needs an M.F.A.?

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Pursuing a Partnership in the Chinese Market

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Amid signs that China may be opening its securities market to more foreign investment banks, Credit Suisse announced Thursday that it was seeking to form a joint venture with a Chinese brokerage firm, Founder Securities. 
 Teaming up with Founder Securities in China would give Credit Suisse a platform for engaging in securities underwriting and other financial services, including wealth management, in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
 The deal requires regulatory approval, and China has approved only a few joint ventures involving foreign banks operating in its domestic banking and financial services market. But in recent months, there have been indications that Beijing may be opening its financial services sector to more foreign banks, something both Wall Street and American officials have aggressively pushed.
 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley already have joint ventures here, and UBS recently formed a joint venture in Beijing called UBS Securities, after taking a 20 percent stake in Beijing Securities and then reorganizing the firm. 
 In 2004, Goldman Sachs formed a joint venture with the Chinese investment banker and deal maker Fang Fenglei, called Goldman Sachs Gaohua Securities. Goldman is now helping Mr. Fang form a $2 billion private equity fund, according to people close to the bank. Goldman is expected to invest about $300 million in the fund.
 Morgan Stanley is making moves, too. The bank is considering selling its 34 percent stake in the China International Capital Corporation in order to form another joint venture that would give Morgan Stanley more control over operating in China, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
 While China International has been successful in underwriting deals, Morgan Stanley has virtually no management control over the firm, which is headed by Levin Zhu, the son of the former prime minister Zhu Rongji.
 Wall Street and global financial services companies are eager for a presence here because China's economy is booming and its stock market, after years of bearishness, is now the world's fastest-growing. Last year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange soared over 95 percent; the year before it was up about 130 percent. Chinese companies that listed shares in the United States, Hong Kong and Shanghai were some of the world's hottest stock offerings.
 Wall Street banks still largely operate out of Hong Kong, and many companies seek to go public there, hoping to tap international investors. But others, including many state-owned Chinese companies, prefer to be listed in Shanghai, whose booming exchange has even richer valuations than Hong Kong's.
 Credit Suisse has taken some of China's hottest companies public over the last few years, including Baidu, China Construction Bank and Suntech.
 Founder Securities is a division of the Founder Group, which was founded by Beijing University and is involved in businesses ranging from personal computers and software to pharmaceuticals and the steel industry.

HEADLINE: Middle- Class Capitalists

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1974, a group of economists and journalists got together in a bar and launched supply-side economics. It was a superb political and economic package. It addressed a big problem: stagflation. It had a clear policy focus: marginal tax rates. It celebrated a certain sort of personality: the risk-taking entrepreneur. It made it clear that the new, growth-oriented Republican Party would be different from the old, green-eyeshade one.
 Supply-side economics had a good run, but continual tax cuts can no longer be the centerpiece of Republican economic policy. The demographics have changed. The U.S. is an aging society. We have made expensive promises to our seniors. We can't keep those promises at the current tax levels, let alone at reduced ones. As David Frum writes in ''Comeback,'' his indispensable new book: ''In the face of such a huge fiscal gap, the days of broad, across-the-board, middle-class tax cutting are over.'' 
 The political situation has changed, too. Republicans used to appeal to the investor class with economic policies and the working class with values, crime and welfare policies. But that formula has broken down. The workers are walking away from the G.O.P., and the only way to win them back is by listening to their economic concerns. 
 As a result, smart Republicans are groping for a new economic model, and as they do, Republican economic policies are shifting. The entrepreneur is no longer king. The wage-earner is king. As the presidential campaign rolls into Michigan, it's clear that Republicans are adjusting their priorities to win back the anxious middle class. 
 The Republicans who are reaching toward this new model still sound very different from Democrats. They never describe American workers as victims. They never describe globalization as a remorselessly punishing process. They argue that individuals can still control their own destinies, provided they work hard and get educated. They believe it would be a catastrophe if the U.S. abandoned free trade or adopted a European-style safety net and suffered European tax rates. 
 But they envision a different role for government than the 1980s Republicans. ''Americans aren't afraid of competing in a global economy,'' says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, John McCain's economic adviser, ''They're afraid they're doing it by themselves. They want a government that is on their side.'' In this new model, government is sort of like Vince Lombardi, setting a context that allows individuals and families to compete. 
 There are four main spheres of policy innovation. First, a human capital agenda. The U.S. needs a more skilled work force, but for the first time in our history it is getting a generation no better educated than its parents.
 To remedy this, Ramesh Ponnuru of The National Review proposes an increased child tax credit to reduce the stress on young families, the seedbed of human capital. Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina proposes tuition tax credits for families earning less than $75,000. The G.O.P. presidential candidates vow to spend more on scientific research and to take on special interests like the teachers' unions. If schools can't fire bad teachers and reward good ones, then nothing else we do to improve education will do any good. 
 Second, Republicans have embraced health care reform. While Democrats emphasize the uninsured, Republicans emphasize cost control. They understand that it's not a question of protecting health markets from government takeover. Government already controls and distorts health care. It's a question of straightening out the system so that it is clear who is paying and for what. 
 Mitt Romney supports private insurance enforced by a universal mandate. McCain talks about paying for outcomes rather than tests to cut down on unnecessary procedures. Mike Huckabee promotes an activist agenda to reduce obesity and prevent chronic illness. 
 Third, Republicans are putting together pieces of what you might call a resiliency agenda to help families withstand setbacks. McCain would subsidize the wages of workers who were laid off and forced to take lower-paying jobs. President Bush has proposed $3,500 personal re-employment accounts. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama supports $1,000 at-birth savings accounts, so that every American has assets to fall back on. Romney has a plan to aggressively increase savings, and Fred Thompson proposes a federal 401(k).
 Finally, Republicans are shifting their emphasis from tax cutting to fiscal rectitude. McCain, Huckabee and Thompson emphasize spending control and dealing with the monumental problem of entitlements. Middle-class workers don't worry so much about investment incentives. They worry that their government is fiscally decadent and fundamentally irresponsible. 
 This spring Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam will publish ''Grand New Party,'' a book about efforts to win back the so-called Sam's Club Republicans. The book will be groundbreaking, but the campaign can't wait. Republican candidates are shifting focus right now.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Rise, Suggesting Output May Fall

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers rose more than forecast in November and sales increased, reflecting rising prices for oil and farm products, the government reported on Thursday. 
 The 0.6 percent gain in stockpiles followed no change in October, the Commerce Department said. Sales rose 2.2 percent, the most since September 2005.
 Rising inventories of products like automobiles and furniture suggest wholesalers may reduce orders, which could further depress factory production.
 ''It's likely we're going to see inventories be a drag on overall growth,'' said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse Holdings. ''Wholesalers are keeping supply and demand pretty much close to the vest.''
 Economists expected wholesale inventories to rise 0.4 percent, according to the median of 38 forecasts by Bloomberg News. Estimates ranged from a 0.1 percent decline to an increase of 0.6 percent.
 The increase in sales brought the stockpiles on hand down to a 1.07-month supply, the lowest on record.
 A separate report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell by 15,000 in the holiday-shortened week that ended Jan. 5, a time when the government typically has trouble adjusting for seasonal variations, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims decreased by 15,000, to 322,000, a two-month low.
 Wholesalers account for about a quarter of all business stockpiles. The increase in stockpiles was led by a 2.6 percent jump in petroleum products and a 2.3 percent increase in automobiles. Sales of oil products surged 8.9 percent, the most in more than two years. Purchases of autos dropped 0.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Hot Prospect for Oil's Big League

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
While some of the world's largest oil producers, including Mexico and Iran, are struggling to remain exporters, Brazil is moving in the opposite direction. A huge underwater oil field discovered late last year has the potential to transform South America's largest country into a sizable exporter and win it a seat at the table of the world's oil cartel.
 The new oil, along with refining projects under way by Petrobras, the national oil company, could eventually make Brazil a larger exporter of gasoline as well, adding to supplies in the United States and other countries where it is all but impossible to build new refineries.
 The subsalt basin that contains Tupi, the new deepwater field estimated to hold the equivalent of five billion to eight billion barrels of light crude oil, is creating a buzz among the world's largest oil companies. They have struggled lately to find global-scale projects worth investing in, even with oil touching $100 a barrel. Tupi is the world's biggest oil find since a 12-billion-barrel field discovered in 2000 in Kazakhstan. 
 Talk by the Brazilian government of tightening investment terms for the new offshore exploration frontier, however, could quickly curb international enthusiasm. Brazil is even drawing comparisons with Bolivia and Venezuela, two South American countries that have nationalized parts of their energy industries in recent years. 
 Still, Brazil has remained far more open to foreign investment than those neighbors, and it has encouraged international oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron to pour billions of dollars into offshore exploration, though so far without much success.
 Even if Petrobras asks for help from other major oil companies, developing Tupi will require solving thorny technical challenges and executing a project on a scale it has never tried before. The first commercial quantities of oil are not expected for some seven years.
 Jose Sergio Gabrielli, the chief executive of Petrobras, said he was optimistic that the company could develop the oil with little outside help. 
 ''We think we can develop the oil faster than we thought at the beginning,'' Mr. Gabrielli said in an interview here last week. ''We don't think we have any insurmountable challenge on the technology side.''
 Just a decade ago the notion that Brazil would become self-sufficient in energy, let alone emerge as an exporter, seemed far-fetched -- even in the sunny beach city of Rio, where Petrobras is based. Petrobras was formed five decades ago largely as a trading company to import oil to support Brazil's growing economy, which is now the world's 10th largest and supports more than 185 million people. 
 Yet two years ago, even without Tupi, Brazil reached its long-sought goal of energy self-sufficiency, in part by expanding its domestic fossil fuel resources but also by developing an extensive ethanol industry using sugar cane. Today Petrobras has a standing goal of raising its Brazilian crude oil output by at least 100,000 barrels a day every year.
 With Tupi, Brazil's 12.2 billion barrels of proven reserves would increase to some 17.2 billion, putting Brazil ahead of Canada's 17.1 billion and Mexico's 12.9 billion. It would fall between China and Nigeria on a world scale, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Venezuela, by contrast, has some 80 billion barrels of proven reserves.
 Rapid economic growth and declining oil production in oil-rich nations like Indonesia, Mexico and Iran are crimping how much they can sell abroad, straining the global oil market. In some cases, the governments of these countries subsidize gasoline heavily at home, which tends to encourage wasteful habits.
 But Brazil, with an economy growing at a healthy clip, sells fuels to its citizens essentially at market rates. And the huge three-decade-old effort to turn sugar cane into ethanol has made Brazil the largest consumer of plant-based biofuels in the world. The government requires that gasoline contain a minimum of 25 percent ethanol and that every service station have at least one pump that delivers pure ethanol. 
 The growing ethanol program is putting Brazil in a better position to take advantage of Tupi's oil riches, Mr. Gabrielli said. Petrobras expects ethanol use to rise as more flex-fuel vehicles hit the roads. ''We are going to have more gasoline for export than we have today,'' he said, ''because part of the gasoline is going to be displaced by ethanol.''
 Petrobras currently sells some 90 percent of its refined products in the Brazilian market. To ensure a future as an exporter, Petrobras is building two new refineries scheduled to begin operations in 2010 and 2014, which will increase the country's refining capacity by nearly 40 percent. The company is also investing in units that will expand its production of heavy crude oil into diesel, and is pouring $8.6 billion into reducing sulfur at its 11 refineries. 
 But its biggest challenge will be developing Tupi into a major production field. The field lies some 4.5 miles below the ocean's surface. To reach it, Petrobras will have to go through 7,000 feet of water and then drill up to 17,000 feet of sand, rock and a massive salt layer that extends across hundreds of miles. Drilling around or through the salt poses a more significant challenge than drilling through salt layers in the Gulf of Mexico, which are more dispersed, analysts say.
 Some analysts forecast that Tupi could cost more than $20 billion to develop, an estimate Mr. Gabrielli would not confirm. Drilling rigs are in short supply around the world, with rates running almost $600,000 a day for the largest ships. 
 The first big task, Mr. Gabrielli said, is to find an outlet for the huge amounts of natural gas that are also in the Tupi field, which is nearly 200 miles offshore. Given the challenges of building a gas pipeline from such a remote location, Petrobras is considering building floating liquefied natural gas plants or a floating gas-fired turbine to generate electricity. 
 To get the oil to shore, the company's engineers will need to find innovative ways to keep pipes warm and to develop stronger casings for wells to resist the effects of salt corrosion. 
 The new oil frontier that Petrobras and its partners -- including BG of Britain -- have discovered in the Santos Basin where Tupi lies may lead the company to scale back its spending in Africa and the Gulf of Mexico in favor of pouring more money into developing Brazil's reserves. ''The company will be overstretched and will have to revisit its strategy,'' said Roger Diwan, a partner at PFC Energy in Washington.
 The Tupi discovery has changed the psyche seemingly overnight in Brazil. Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, chided President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, calling him an ''oil magnate.'' Mr. da Silva himself declared the find as proof that ''God is Brazilian'' and vowed that Brazil would seek to join the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a few years.
 Petrobras's success was hardly an accident. In 1997 the Brazilian government opened up Petrobras's exploration and production division to outside companies and invited in private investors. More important, the company developed expertise in deepwater drilling that has put it on par with Shell and Exxon Mobil.
 ''They were not as insular as many of the state-owned oil companies were,'' said Donald Hertzmark, an international energy consultant in Washington. ''They are widely considered world class in deepwater drilling and have pursued myriad joint ventures throughout the world.''
 The rise of Petrobras contrasts starkly with the decline of the other large oil company in South America, Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company of Venezuela known as Pdvsa. While Petrobras has achieved record production, Pdvsa's output has fallen since Mr. Chavez was elected in 1998.
 Mr. Chavez has all but re-nationalized parts of the Venezuelan industry by imposing much-stricter terms on foreign oil companies. 
 Mr. Gabrielli says that Petrobras will avoid following the path blazed by Venezuela and Bolivia. He said that he was in favor of imposing tougher terms for the subsalt basin where Tupi is located, which the Brazilian Congress is now considering.
 But he says that Petrobras has already borne considerable exploration risk, making it a far smaller gamble for outside companies to explore further in the offshore area. And he adds that most major oil producing countries, not just those proclaiming their socialist ambitions, impose stiff terms on foreign oil companies, especially in times of high oil prices.
 ''After the discovery we had,'' he said of the potential profits to be earned by the oil majors, ''this is like buying a winning lottery ticket.''

HEADLINE: Shu Uemura, 79, Makeup Artist

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Shu Uemura, the Japanese makeup artist who won acclaim in Hollywood and then built an international cosmetics brand under his name, died on Dec. 29 in Tokyo. He was 79. 
 The cause was pneumonia, according to a statement released Tuesday by his company, also called Shu Uemura.
 Mr. Uemura first gained acclaim transforming the actress Shirley MacLaine into a Japanese beauty in the 1962 Hollywood film ''My Geisha.'' Then working in Hollywood as a beautician, he was called in after the staff makeup artist fell ill. 
 In 1960, Mr. Uemura developed his first cosmetics product, a cleansing oil that remains popular today. He later opened a school to train makeup artists in Tokyo.
 In 1983, amid Japan's economic boom and just as Tokyo was establishing itself as a fashion trendsetter, Uemura started a cosmetics boutique that drew crowds with its gallerylike interior.
 Mr. Uemura gradually expanded his brand to include handmade makeup brushes, perfumes and voluptuous fake eyelashes. The company's eyelash curlers were mentioned in the 2006 movie ''The Devil Wears Prada'' starring Meryl Streep.
 The company, which has stores in New York, Paris, London and Hong Kong, was acquired by the French cosmetics maker L'Oreal in 2004. Mr. Uemura is survived by his wife and a son.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Subpoenas Intel Over Antitrust Accusations

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The New York State attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, issued a wide-ranging subpoena to the Intel Corporation on Thursday as part of an investigation into whether the company violated federal or state antitrust laws in the way that it priced and sold microprocessors. 
 The investigation follows a preliminary look at Intel over several months by Mr. Cuomo's office and is the latest legal challenge the company faces at home and abroad. 
 Mr. Cuomo's investigation is the first government challenge to Intel's sales practices in the United States, and comes less than three months after the head of the Federal Trade Commission rejected requests from lawmakers and some commission members to open a formal investigation. 
 The inquiry will focus on a family of chips known as the x86 that is the industry standard for most desktop computers, laptops and servers. Intel has about 90 percent of the x86 market, estimated at $30 billion a year in sales worldwide. 
 The company's chief rival for sales of the chips, Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif., has long contended that Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has engaged in monopolistic practices, and A.M.D. has waged what is in essence a global antitrust campaign against it.
 The New York subpoenas will seek internal memorandums, billing documents and correspondence between Intel and its customers to determine whether the company engaged in anticompetitive practices -- like penalizing customers, primarily computer manufacturers -- for buying processors from competitors or improperly paying customers to use Intel chips exclusively. 
 ''Protecting fair and open competition in the microprocessor market is critical to New York, the United States and the world,'' Mr. Cuomo said Thursday in a statement. ''Monopolistic practices are a serious concern, particularly for New Yorkers who are navigating an information-intensive economy.''
 Advanced Micro has filed civil lawsuits or complaints against Intel in Europe, Japan and South Korea. In 2005, it filed a civil suit against Intel in United States District Court in Delaware, a case that has already produced hundreds of millions of pages of documents, a spokesman for Intel, Chuck Mulloy, said. All told, the legal battle between A.M.D. and Intel is one of the largest antitrust matters pending before American and foreign regulators. 
 Mr. Mulloy said the company would comply with Mr. Cuomo's subpoena but denied any wrongdoing. 
 ''We believe our business practices are lawful,'' he said. ''We also believe that the microprocessor market is a competitive market, and is behaving just as one would expect a competitive market to behave.''
 Mr. Mulloy said that chip prices were declining across the industry and that new companies were entering the market -- evidence, he said, that the market was competitive. He acknowledged that Intel used discount sales, but described the practice as legal and ''a regular part of the business.''
 Among the officials who have pushed, so far unsuccessfully, for federal action are Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats. Advanced Micro has promised to open a $3 billion plant in upstate New York that will employ 1,200 people. 
 Mr. Schumer issued a statement Thursday that endorsed Mr. Cuomo's investigation, adding that ''antitrust investigations into Intel are springing up everywhere except Washington.''
 In a statement, Thomas M. McCoy, executive vice president for legal affairs and chief administrative officer at Advanced Micro Devices, said that Mr. Cuomo's announcement was ''good news for computer buyers in New York and throughout the United States.''
 In other cases, A.M.D. has accused Intel of discounting its chips so substantially that the selling price is in effect below the cost of production, a practice that in some cases involving other companies has been found to violate antitrust laws.
 In 2005, Japanese regulators ruled that Intel had violated that country's antitrust laws. Last summer, the European Commission charged Intel with engaging in anticompetitive conduct. Officials in South Korea issued similar charges this fall.
 Federal officials in this country have been less aggressive. The F.T.C. has spent months in discussions with Intel officials, but the commission's chairwoman, Deborah Platt Majoras, recently rejected a request from some other commissioners to start a formal investigation. 
 Albert A. Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a Washington-based group that advocates more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws, said the F.T.C.'s inaction made Mr. Cuomo's investigation the more welcome.
 ''We think it awkward, with so much at stake and the two companies involved being American, that the U.S. government has not taken a more active role,'' Mr. Foer said in a statement. 
 He added, ''We applaud New York and any states that might join with Attorney General Cuomo for stepping up to the plate for American consumers.''

HEADLINE: NYSE Urges China to Be Flexible on Where Companies Raise Capital

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER. 
Donald Greenlees contributed reporting from Hong Kong and David Barboza from Shanghai.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
NYSE Euronext, the merged trans-Atlantic stock exchange, is lobbying the Chinese government to raise standards of corporate governance and loosen rules on where companies can raise capital as part of an effort to win business from rival markets in cities like London and Hong Kong.
 ''One of our messages in China is, 'Don't make it so hard for the companies to choose,'<0>'' Duncan L. Niederauer, the new chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said in an interview here. 
 ''Right now, a lot of the Chinese companies have a choice to either list locally or internationally,'' Mr. Niederauer said, ''and I think our general view is that it might make a lot of sense for these companies to be able to list in both places.''
 With an economic boom in developing countries, established stock exchanges are increasingly dependent on attracting business from companies based far from their home countries. The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext, which combined to form the world's largest stock market group, are in a fierce rivalry with markets like the London Stock Exchange to earn fees from listing companies based in fast-developing economies like Brazil, China and Russia.
 Another competitor for listings from Chinese companies is the Hong Kong stock exchange, which has cultural similarities, a large pool of capital, and enthusiastic and knowledgeable investors. 
 Many mainland companies -- including PetroChina, the largest by market capitalization -- have already made initial public offerings in Hong Kong.
 One difficulty for foreign exchanges is that the Chinese policy has been in flux, sometimes allowing overseas listings and then restricting them, said Christine Loh, chief executive of a public policy research group, Civic Exchange, and a director of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
 ''Everyone is looking at China and saying, 'Hey, there are all these huge listings we want,'<0>'' Ms. Loh said. ''But unlike in other countries, the Chinese government makes a blanket decision about whether you can even list outside of China or not, and they make that decision based on their domestic situation.''
 Ms. Loh said that lobbying by foreign stock exchanges was unlikely to have a direct effect in persuading the Chinese to loosen restrictions in the short term.
 Another difficulty for foreign exchanges seeking to break into the Chinese market for listings is that Chinese companies have been able to raise large amounts of capital on their home exchanges, like Shanghai, without the risk of falling afoul of foreign securities regulations and the publicity that could negatively affect China's image.
 Even so, Ms. Loh said the situation was bound to change, particularly as Chinese companies with global ambitions want to list in regions like Europe and the United States where they aim to expand their businesses.
 Mr. Niederauer was unable to say how long it might take to persuade the Beijing government to change its policy on dual listings. 
 Even so, executives from NYSE Euronext are working to show Chinese companies the advantages of listing in New York, saying that such a listing would help improve their valuations -- helpful when they want to merge or make acquisitions -- or increase their stature by giving them an edge over similar companies from developing economies.
 NYSE Euronext opened an office in Beijing last month as part of a campaign to introduce better standards of corporate governance so that Chinese companies are better prepared to list in the United States.
 In comments about the tight credit market, Mr. Niederauer, a former Goldman Sachs banker, said he expected that there would be more bad news. 
 In the short term, volatility on stock markets as a result of the credit troubles has benefited exchanges like NYSE Euronext, which earn more fees on large trading volume. But Mr. Niederauer said that prolonged turbulence could hurt his business.
 ''I don't think it's all positive,'' he said. A deeper market downturn in the United States and a reluctance by companies to make initial stock offerings ''obviously has some cyclical implications for the business,'' he said. ''So we're not immune to those events.''

HEADLINE: Poor December at Retailers; Most Report Drops in Sales

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Peter S. Goodman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The weakest holiday shopping season in five years ended dismally for most retailers, whose sales tumbled despite deep discounts and extended store hours, stoking fears that the economy is tipping into a recession. 
 Sales fell across the board, knocking down once seemingly invincible chains like Target (down 5 percent compared with last year); Abercrombie & Fitch (2 percent); Nordstrom (4 percent); and Kohl's (11.4 percent). 
 ''It shows that the U.S. economy absolutely tanked in December,'' said Ellen Zentner, United States macroeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''Consumer spending drives the economy. What we're left with is no evidence of any kind of consumer momentum going into 2008.'' 
 But one major chain was spared: Wal-Mart, whose relentless price slashing appeared to resonate with penny-pinching shoppers. Its sales rose 2.7 percent. 
 Wal-Mart's lopsided victory -- and the strength of off-price chains like TJ Maxx and Ross Dress for Less -- suggested that jittery consumers, trying to cut back on spending, favored bargain chains over full-price stores during the 2007 holiday season. 
 That is a reversal from years of trading up, when consumers flush with cash reached for more expensive products at higher-end stores. 
 ''Trading down became contagious,'' said John D. Morris, senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities. Even Saks Fifth Avenue observed the trend, saying its well-heeled consumers were holding out for discounts. 
 Over all, sales growth in December was the weakest in seven years, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group that averages sales from 45 big chains. It found that same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year -- rose a meager 0.9 percent, aided by Wal-Mart, which lifted the entire retail index because of its size.
 Averaging sales in November and December, it said, the 2007 holiday season produced the slowest growth rate since 2002. 
 Same-store sales are a crucial yardstick in retailing, because they exclude business at new and closed stores, which tend to distort a chain's performance.
 In the aftermath of the dreary results, a raft of chains, like J. C. Penney, Kohl's and American Eagle Outfitters, cut earnings forecasts for the final three months of the year. 
 Shares of Wal-Mart rose on its news, gaining $1.50, or 3.2 percent, to close at $48.40. The market reaction was mixed for other retailers, as some had already warned of lackluster holiday results. Shares of Gap fell more than 7 percent, while American Eagle's shares gained just as much. With higher energy costs and sagging home values pinching consumer spending, retail analysts had predicted a rocky December. Adding to the stores' troubles, this year's earlier Thanksgiving shifted an extra week of shopping into November, making December look weaker for many stores compared with the previous year.
 But even with those factors, the size of the sales declines at many chains surprised analysts. Same-store sales fell 8 percent at Limited Brands; 7.5 percent at J. C. Penney; and 6 percent at Gap.
 ''Consumers clearly tightened purse strings this holiday season,'' said Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, a research firm.
 Clothing sales were especially hard hit in December. MasterCard Advisors, a division of the credit card company, estimated that women's apparel, by far the biggest category, fell by 3.8 percent from last year, dragging down business at department store and specialty apparel chains at malls. 
 By contrast, sales of electronics rose 2.2 percent, suggesting that products like digital picture frames and satellite navigation systems emerged as the must-have gifts for the holidays. That was reflected in a strong performance from Best Buy, which said sales rose 6.7 percent in the third quarter.
 Because of the calendar shift, stores encouraged investors to look at the average sales for November and December combined. But even by that analysis, the holiday season was weak for most chains. Macy's, for example, said sales fell 7.9 percent in December and 1.1 percent for November and December combined.
 ''After a strong November, we had hoped that a more positive sales trend would continue through December,'' said the chief executive of Macy's, Terry J. Lundgren. But a tough economy, ''led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday,'' he said.
 The most closely watched drama was Wal-Mart vs. Target. For much of the last five years, Target had trounced Wal-Mart, in percentage terms, in holiday sales performance. But not this time. 
 Target said that even with the calendar shift factored in, sales rose just 0.6 percent, an unusually low number for it, especially compared with Wal-Mart's 2.7 percent increase, a figure that includes sales at Sam's Club. Target's chief executive, Robert Ulrich, said earnings for the last three months of the year would probably fall from last year's level. 
 Wal-Mart was not the only success story, though. Costco, the wholesale club chain, said sales rose 7 percent, with higher gasoline prices bolstering its results. Costco, like many club stores, sells gas to members. Excluding gas, its sales rose 4 percent. Analysts said the chain benefited from shoppers buying in bulk to save money.
 Specialty clothing stores struggled all month. Sales fell 9.4 percent at Ann Taylor; 6.2 percent at Hot Topic; and 2 percent at American Eagle Outfitters.
 Abercrombie & Fitch was dragged down by the performance of its Ruehl chain, intended for 20-something clothing shoppers. Sales fell 22 percent in December, compared with a decline of 1 percent for the company's brand, geared toward teenagers.

HEADLINE: The Comeback Continent

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Today I'd like to talk about a much-derided contender making a surprising comeback, a comeback that calls into question much of the conventional wisdom of American politics. No, I'm not talking about a politician. I'm talking about an economy -- specifically, the European economy, which many Americans assume is tired and spent but has lately been showing surprising vitality.
 Why should Americans care about Europe's economy? Well, for one thing, it's big. The G.D.P. of the European Union is roughly comparable to that of the United States; the euro is almost as important a global currency as the dollar; and the governance of the world financial system is, for practical purposes, equally shared by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. 
 But there's another thing: it's important to get the facts about Europe's economy right because the alleged woes of that economy play an important role in American political discourse, usually as an excuse for the insecurities and injustices of our own society.
 For example, does Hillary Clinton have a plan to cover the millions of Americans who lack health insurance? ''She takes her inspiration from European bureaucracies,'' sneers Mitt Romney. 
 Or are top U.S. executives grossly overpaid? According to a Times report, Michael Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard's Graduate School of Business whose theories helped pave the way for gigantic paychecks, considers executive excess ''an acceptable price to pay for an American economy that he believes has outstripped Japan and Europe in growth and prosperity.''
 In fact, however, tales of a moribund Europe are greatly exaggerated.
 It's true that Europe has had a lot of economic troubles over the past generation. In the mid-1970s the Continent entered a prolonged era of sluggish job creation, which contrasted with vigorous employment growth in the United States. 
 And in the 1990s, Europe lagged behind America in the adoption of new technology. For example, in 1997 fewer than 15 percent of French homes contained personal computers and fewer than 1 percent were connected to the Internet.
 But that was then.
 Since 2000, employment has actually grown a bit faster in Europe than in the United States -- and since Europe has a lower rate of population growth, this has translated into a substantial rise in the percentage of working-age Europeans with jobs, even as America's employment-population ratio has declined. 
 In particular, in the prime working years, from 25 to 54, the big gap between European and U.S. employment rates that existed a decade ago has been largely eliminated. If you think Europe is a place where lots of able-bodied adults just sit at home collecting welfare checks, think again.
 Meanwhile, Europe's Internet lag is a thing of the past. The dial-up Internet of the 1990s was dominated by the United States. But as dial-up has given way to broadband, Europe has more than kept up. The number of broadband connections per 100 people in the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before it was enlarged in 2004, is slightly higher than in the U.S. -- and Europe's connections are both substantially faster and substantially cheaper than ours.
 I don't want to exaggerate the good news. Europe continues to have many economic problems. But who doesn't? The fact is that Europe's economy looks a lot better now -- both in absolute terms and compared with our economy -- than it did a decade ago.
 What's behind Europe's comeback? It's a complicated story, probably involving a combination of deregulation (which has expanded job opportunities) and smart regulation. One of the keys to Europe's broadband success is that unlike U.S. regulators, many European governments have promoted competition, preventing phone and cable companies from monopolizing broadband access.
 What European countries definitely haven't done is dismantle their strong social safety nets. Universal health care is a given. So are a variety of programs that support families in trouble, helping protect Europeans from the extreme poverty all too common in this country. All of this costs money -- even though European countries spend far less on health care than we do -- and European taxes are very high by U.S. standards.
 In short, Europe continues to be a big-government sort of place. And that's why it's important to get the real story of the European economy out there.
 According to the anti-government ideology that dominates much U.S. political discussion, low taxes and a weak social safety net are essential to prosperity. Try to make the lives of Americans even slightly more secure, we're told, and the economy will shrivel up -- the same way it supposedly has in Europe. 
 But the next time a politician tries to scare you with the European bogeyman, bear this in mind: Europe's economy is actually doing O.K. these days, despite a level of taxing and spending beyond the wildest ambitions of American progressives.
