HARTFORD: A LAB FOR COMBATING GANGS
Like any city where gangs have run rampant, Hartford has taken a beating in the last few years. In response, Connecticut's capital has become a virtual laboratory for methods of quelling gang violence. Its efforts include a joint Federal, state and local task force, a beefed-up gang prosecution unit and many police officers working lots of overtime. It is emphasizing after-school and recreational programs and has an institute to mediate gang disputes. In one experiment, a member of the city's largest gang, Los Solidos, makes $25,000 a year as youth coordinator for the Hartford Housing Authority. His job is to steer street toughs to after-school programs and away from drugs and the gang life. Page 1.
 

DRAFT PROPOSAL TO CUT MEDICAID COSTS
A month before New York's new Republican administration must propose its first budget, Governor-elect George E. Pataki's chief adviser on health care has drafted a proposal to cut more than $1 billion from Medicaid, the costly and politically sensitive health program for the poor, disabled and elderly. The proposed cuts, sought by Lieut. Governor-elect Elizabeth P. McCaughey, are large but not so different from those explored by Governor Cuomo. Page 1.

BURN VICTIMS FACE A STRUGGLE
 Twelve people who were riders on a subway train in lower Manhattan last Wednesday when a firebomb turned their car into a furnace are patients in the burn center at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Each faces a long, painful struggle, and doctors caution that a few may not survive the fight. One of those most seriously injured is Edward J. Leary, 49, the man who is accused of carrying the bomb. He drifts in and out of consciousness, his senses dulled by pain and morphine. Mr. Leary and two others, Renfield Edey, 60, and Brenda Dowdell, 40, remained in critical condition yesterday. Page 43.
 
ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER COMMITS SUICIDE
 A police officer on a meal break in a Times Square restaurant became suddenly distraught early Christmas morning, drew his .38-caliber service revolver and killed himself with a single shot to the head, the police said. The suicide was the 12th this year by a city police officer, the highest number in recent history. A police spokesman said the officer had recently been through a divorce and was having emotional problems. Page 43.
 
WHAT JUST WENT UP MAY SOON COME DOWN
 While New Yorkers weren't looking last week, workers completed the four-year, $70 million renovation of part of the West Side Highway and gave motorists a newly smooth ride between 57th and 72d Streets. Now the city can get ready for the next phase of renovation: tearing down the renovated road and building a new one. The refurbished road will indeed come down if Donald Trump and partners go ahead with their planned housing development on the Hudson River. Metro Matters, Page 43.
 
FOR SOME, A SEASON FOR SHOPLIFTING
 Christmas was much like any other day in the arraignment section of Criminal Court in Manhattan, with a few exceptions. There were, however, more cases than usual for a holiday, and many more people were charged with shoplifting. There were about 20 arraignments that dealt with someone's stealing something from a store, from pants to a videotape. "I don't know whether this is a result of the economy or the season," Acting Supreme Court Justice Paul P. E. Bookson said, "but there was a high preponderance of shoplifting." Page 42.

A CITY COUNCIL UNDER SCRUTINY
 Recent crackdowns on building code violations, property tax delinquents and drug-infested taverns in Asbury Park, N.J., have offered glimmerings of hope that the gloom hanging over the scruffy city of 16,273 will eventually lift. But the City Council that presided over those changes is up for review, accused of being insensitive to minorities and unrepresentative of them. Voters will decide at a special referendum on Jan. 10 whether to change the present form of government. If the change is approved, a special election will be held in the spring for the entire government. Page 44.

HEADLINE: Gov. Weicker Packs His Bags, With No Room for Nostalgia

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Winter sun streams through the windows onto the half-empty boxes of awards and mementos that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has begun packing. His heavy wooden desk sits ready to be cleared and carted off, along with his bound Watergate Committee volumes and lamps made from 105-millimeter shell casings -- all possessions with which he surrounded himself in office.
Most people would be forgiven a little sticky sentimentality just now. But Mr. Weicker has never been most people, and in these closing days of his administration, he shows no signs of looking back with even the remotest trace of gauzy haze. Even posing the question of whether, at 63, he feels nostalgic about his three decades in public life is to invite a typical Weicker jeremiad. Not only does he feel no nostalgia himself, he thinks no one else should, either. It's a societal flaw. 
 "I hate nostalgia with a passion," he said. "This country is surfeited with it right now. That's one of our problems."
"We just sit there and wallow in the good old days, which, quite frankly, weren't necessarily so good for too many people," he added.
Mr. Weicker has made a career of saying just what is on his mind and disregarding convention as a sort of counterpoint soloist in a world of ensemble players. Now at what may be his exit from the public stage, he seems utterly unbowed in that role, still blowing his own horn in a way that has infuriated and captivated a generation of Connecticut voters.
For example, here is Mr. Weicker on his accomplishments as a Senator and as a Governor: "Most of the disabilities laws that are on the books of the United States today were written by Lowell Weicker as the lead horse and certainly with the help of many others. And the recovery of Connecticut, that was Lowell Weicker -- so you can achieve in both areas."
Speaking of the future, Mr. Weicker said in an interview: "I intend to go ahead and make life as tough as I can for the ideas I know are fraudulent. I don't intend to in any way remain silent -- no way."
Mr. Weicker, who chose not to run for a second term, spent 18 years in the United States Senate as a Republican who liked to fight with Republicans (especially those in the Nixon Administration during the Watergate era) and four tumultuous years as Connecticut's first independent third-party Governor in a century, battling both parties for his own agenda.
That agenda included a drastic overhaul of the state revenue system, the imposition of an income tax in 1991 and the introduction last year of a plan to encourage racial and economic integration of public schools. He is also credited with having more or less single-handedly foiled a legislative plan to legalize casino gambling in Bridgeport.
And although the independent A Connecticut Party that he founded in 1990 has not taken off, Democrats and Republicans say that by hastening the erosion of the two-party system and proving that an independent administration can work, Mr. Weicker has also left a permanent mark.
And he apparently has enough bile left for several careers to come. Without actually saying that he will run for President as a third-party independent in 1996, or that he even wants to, he has kept the door wide open for a draft.
Mr. Weicker has been equally vague about which political allies or organizations might be involved in such a bid, but he misses no opportunity to identify its niche -- centrist, filling the void he believes has been left in politics by the Republican Party's surge to the right.
Meanwhile, his popularity in Connecticut is near its four-year high and his reputation for having advanced his agenda in the legislature without the benefit of a single member of his own party has already taken on a patina of legend, even among his enemies.
"You've got to grant the Governor this -- he is probably the most able politician seen in Hartford in decades," said State Representative Carl J. Schiessl, a Democrat who opposed Mr. Weicker on most major issues. "I haven't been able to pin a label on it besides calling it Weicker's Way."
But now Mr. Weicker's private life will get first claim, and there is a note of ambivalence as he speaks about what he really wants from the future. He takes over as chairman of a Maryland-based health care company on Jan. 5, the day after the inauguration of his successor, John G. Rowland. He plans to teach, and to promote his autobiography, which is to be published next year.
He also wants to spend more time with his six grandchildren and in his beloved St. Croix, V.I., indulging his passion for scuba diving.
He went through two marriages in his younger days, and by his own admission was more or less an absentee father for the first three of his seven sons while he pursued his career. He intends to make up for some of that now, he says.
"I'm 63 years old, which is an honorable age and a grandparently age," Mr. Weicker said. "And I don't see myself spending as much time as grandparents do with their grandkids. This is a very real thing for me because I love them, I like being with young people. I've given up on my own damn generation. As far as I'm concerned, we're all too grumpy -- we're all hanging on to things long past where we ought to be hanging on to them."
This is how Mr. Weicker expresses himself: saying what he cares about is almost invariably followed by the quick knife thrust at what he condemns. Even now, in his last days in office, the world is a place of dark and light where everything that deserves praise is linked with something that merits a withering attack.
Leaning back in his chair, Mr. Weicker reminisced, for example, about diving off the coast of Cuba with Fidel Castro in the early 1980's. (Mr. Castro is a hold-your-breath diver, Mr. Weicker said, with huge lung capacity despite the cigars.) But the vivid picture was quickly followed by sharp jab at United States policy toward Cuba.
In talking about his faith in the future of democracy and the younger generation, he expressed a belief in the American spirit of renewal and common sense that became, as he continued, an attack on the Republican Party, which Mr. Weicker believes has moved so far to the right it has insured its own self-destruction. To fulfill their promise to cut taxes, he said, the Republicans will have to cut spending on middle-class programs like Social Security or see the Federal deficit grow sharply. And each course will rebound against them.
"I compliment my friends in the Republican Party, the far right, for what they achieved," he said, referring to the G.O.P. majorities in Congress. But speaking of the Republicans' agenda, he added, "I don't think it makes any sense, and because it doesn't make any sense it's only a matter of time before it's bounced out."
As for his own Washington plans, Mr. Weicker sidesteps every question about whether he will actively initiate a try for the Presidency.
"I don't want to foreclose anything when it comes down to that," he said. "But have I all of sudden had pangs of regret and want to get back in? No. I'm racing toward my new life."

HEADLINE: China-GATT Trade Rift Spurs Debate

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 23

 BODY:
In the wake of the collapse of China's bid to join the World Trade Organization, some economists are wondering whether China's top Communist Party leaders gave their trade negotiators the kind of authority and latitude necessary to make tough compromises.
Those compromises might have had an important effect on some of China's most powerful ministries, state-owned enterprises and military industries. 
 "The issue is whether President Jiang Zemin was involved," said a Western economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Basically, a negotiation like that requires that kind of political clout, someone who will say this is in the best interest of the country in the long run even though there are going to be winners and losers."
After eight months of negotiations with China, the governing body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which will soon be reborn as the World Trade Organization, decided early last week that negotiations for China's acceptance as a member nation could not be concluded this year.
The governing body made an offer to resume the talks in February, but China has not yet responded. GATT delegates estimated it could take another six months to negotiate China's application.
Some Western diplomats here said they saw a strong resemblance between China's approach to GATT and the country's successful strategy last spring to persuade President Clinton to put trade relations with China ahead of American concerns about human rights.
In both cases, China put minimal concessions on the table, then dug in its heels, demanding that the international community recognize its strategic and economic importance in the world as the most important criterion for acceding to its demands.
In the case of GATT, Chinese officials may have believed incorrectly that European Union leaders, and perhaps even American officials, would make a purely political decision to let China enter the new trade organization despite a highly discriminatory tariff and trade structure.
A World Bank study on trade reform earlier this year said that "China's tariffs remain higher, more numerous and more dispersed than those of most other large developing countries."
One international banker here noted that the Communist Party laid out a strong agenda for economic reforms in November 1993 -- including trade reform and the convertibility of China's currency. But Chinese negotiators might have been instructed to first measure the resolve of their negotiating partners in GATT before top Chinese leaders gave approval for major new concessions.
Western experts say a substantial reassessment of China's negotiating position by its top leaders will be needed before Beijing's negotiating team can return to Geneva with concessions.
And such a reassessment is likely to take months because of the approaching Chinese New Year and, more importantly, because of the crisis with the health of Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, whose condition has deteriorated through the fall.
With an undercurrent of official rancor, Beijing reiterated this week that China remained committed to economic reform and trade liberalization, its inability to join the trade group notwithstanding.
"China has already made the maximum concessions that a developing country can bear at its current state of development," a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Jian, said on Thursday. China's failure to enter the trading organization, he said, "was due to the fact that certain signatory parties insisted on the excessive demands."
He added that it was "most unwise to exclude" China, which has a population of 1.2 billion and the world's 11th-largest trade volume. "The global trade system cannot be complete and its smooth operation is bound to be affected, which will do no good to all," he said.
But Mr. Chen's warning may conceal the fact that China was only prepared to make a minimal set of concessions during this round of negotiations, Western economists said.
"It is very difficult to accede to international trading rules when your existing policies are in conflict with those rules," said a Western economist who served as a negotiator during the GATT talks. "It means you have to change your policies," he added.
Mr. Chen said: "China will continue to adhere to its principle of reform and opening to the outside world. However, China will proceed with its reform and opening up according to its own schedule."
Indeed, in the last year, China's powerful State Planning Commission has appeared to be adding -- not subtracting -- protectionist measures with its "pillar industries" plan to develop state-owned conglomerates under preferential policies that would protect them from both foreign ownership and foreign competition.
Pillar industries will include the automobile industry, petrochemicals, telecommunications and transportation.
Asked whether China would resume negotiations in February, which is in the midst of China's month-long spring festival holiday, Mr. Chen said, "That's quite a specific matter which needs to be decided upon."

HEADLINE: U.S. Losses In Mexico Assessed

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The steep decline in the value of the Mexican peso has resulted in a potential loss of roughly $8 to $10 billion for American investors in Mexican stocks and bonds, according to estimates by Wall Street investment experts.
American owners of Mexican stocks took the biggest hit, suffering not only from the peso's devaluation but also from falling stock prices. Their holdings were worth roughly $20 billion on Dec. 1 and $13.5 billion on Friday, the experts estimated. In addition, the $12 billion to $15 billion in peso notes and bonds held by Americans shed $3 billion or so as a result of last week's devaluation. 
 "These losses are spread out over a lot of people and institutions in the United States," said Lawrence Brainard, head of research for Chase Securities Emerging Markets Group, a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank. "And now these investors are trying to figure out whether to stay in Mexico or sell their securities, take their losses and leave."
Mr. Brainard, Nariman Behravesh, international economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, and Brian Barish, head of emerging market research at Lazard Freres, said Americans represent $45 billion to $50 billion of the $73 billion in foreign investment in Mexico. Roughly $15 billion is in direct investment in factories, machinery and buildings -- investments that are largely immune to devaluation, particularly if their goal is to make goods for export from Mexico. The remaining $30 billion to $35 billion is in stocks, Government bonds and other forms of interest-bearing peso securities.
The $8 billion to $10 billion in losses, if they are realized, are a significant sum, and Mexico's economic future might hinge on whether American investors will decamp, at least for a while, as they did after financial crises, in the 1970's and 1980's. Already, Mexican Government officials and some American bankers and financiers are arguing that nothing has really changed; that the Mexican peso, having lost nearly 27 percent of its worth in American dollars in a single week, is now at its proper level, and Americans can once again invest safely and profitably in Mexico.
That was the message from Mexico's Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, when he met with American executives at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York on Friday. He said that Mexico would hold to policies that restrict domestic credit, balance the budget and maintain the peso's value, now that the pressure on the peso had been relieved. While some Americans at the meeting raised doubts about the future, others backed Mr. Serra's effort to get investment back on track.
"If the Mexican Government implements the program as outlined by Minister Serra, this should give additional opportunities for accelerated Mexican export growth and therefore make Mexico attractive for investment," said William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, a major holder of Mexican debt.
Mutual funds and pension funds, the biggest holders of Mexican debt, apparently suffered the biggest losses from last week's fall in the peso, and some brokerage houses that trade in Mexican securities also may have lost money. No one has announced actual losses from the sale of securities as prices dropped last week, but there were broad indications of paper losses.
Fidelity Investments, the big Boston-based mutual fund company and one of the biggest investors in Mexican stocks and bonds, said that eight of its funds had held about $800 million in Mexican securities on Dec. 19, the day before the Mexican Government announced a 14 percent devaluation in the peso, beginning a process that accelerated when the Government decided to float the peso, which finished the week down nearly 27 percent.
For Fidelity, that would be roughly a $215 million loss just from devaluation if all of the securities were held. A Fidelity spokeswoman did not say what might have been sold in the heavy trading last week.
Clients of Bear, Stearns & Company held more than $1 billion in Mexican securities, according to Alan Greenberg, chairman of the Wall Street house. That would mean a paper loss of about $265 million or more as a result of the fall in the peso, if the securities were held all last week.
Bear, Stearns is one of the most active American investment houses in the Mexican market, trading not only for clients but investing tens of millions of dollars of its own money. Mr. Greenberg and Warren Spector, the firm's executive vice president, declined to say if Bear, Stearns itself had lost money as a result of the falling peso, but in a telephone interview on Friday they suggested that the firm had not.
"We are very pleased with our performance," Mr. Spector said, "and we are not reducing our commitment to Latin America."
Mr. Spector and Mr. Greenberg in effect lined up with Mr. Rhodes in arguing that Mexico remains a good investment, because its economy is slowly gaining in efficiency and industrial production. "People will get their confidence back and once again they'll be buying Mexican securities," Mr. Greenberg said.
The Mexicans certainly hope so. American investors have provided the dollars to pay for much of their estimated $29 billion deficit in trade and other transactions this year. American investors are also big purchasers of the bonds floated for spending on roads, harbors, airports, power stations and the like.
But others on Wall Street are less sanguine than Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Rhodes. "The Mexican Government still needs to spell out a coherent set of economic policies given that the peso has been devalued," Mr. Brainard said.
Taking a similar view, Moody's Investors Service reaffirmed on Friday its ratings of Mexican securities as less than investment grade.
"Our ratings reflected and still reflect a structural dilemma in Mexico," said David Levey, managing director for sovereign risk at Moody's. "The dilemma was the overvalued peso which drew money and imports into Mexico and brought about the huge deficit in international transactions. Correcting this current account deficit is likely to require a recession or a number of years of slower growth than many people would like."

HEADLINE: Some Roses Brighten UpCourt Date For a Wife

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
Christmas was much like any other day in the arraignment section of Criminal Court in Manhattan. Except for the man with the roses and the large number of shoplifting cases.
Usually, there is little variety in the transgressions that come before the bench -- from disorderly conduct to murder -- or in the proceedings. But this year appeared to be a little different. First, there was the husband who brought two dozen roses for his wife, who was being arraigned on a charge of misdemeanor drug possession. 
 "I was told she would definitely be here today," said Joe Rabbitt, a forklift operator who had been waiting for his 23-year-old wife, Jennifer, to appear for arraignment since she was arrested on Friday evening on her way to his parents' house. "I wanted to cheer her up and show that I love her," he said.
Mrs. Rabbitt, who said she had not known there were two grams of cocaine in the glove compartment of her car, was released on her own recognizance for a hearing in January. In the hallway afterward, she practically leaped into her husband's arms.
"I must say," said Acting Justice Paul E. Bookson of State Supreme Court, "this is the first time I ever saw someone come into court with flowers."
The day at the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street was also different because there were more cases than is usual on a holiday and many more people were charged with shoplifting offenses.
Last Christmas, during the day court session, there were 56 arraignments, said Steven Kufs, deputy chief clerk of arraignments. There were more than 70 yesterday between 10 A.M. and a little after 5 P.M. Of those, about 20 dealt with someone stealing something, from pants to a videotape.
"I don't know whether this is a result of the economy or the season," Justice Bookson said, "but there was a high preponderance of shoplifting."
Justice Bookson, a jurist for 18 years, said people tend to think of life in court on a holiday as one in which the unusual occurs. But, he said, "It's rare that you get a story from a defendant who says, 'I jumped the turnstile, your honor, because I was late and so I could get to midnight Mass.' "
Alan Flexer, one of three Legal Aid lawyers who represented defendants during the day session, said of Christmas, "It's just another day in the system, because there's nothing that happened today that didn't happen yesterday or the day before."
Mr. Flexer, a spirited man with red hair and a red mustache who has been with Legal Aid since 1987, said that occasionally a case is directly related to the holiday. He recalled a fight between parents some years ago over a place in line to see Santa Claus.
Like Justice Bookson and other officers of the court, Mr. Flexer thought yesterday was "unusually busy" for Christmas. The eight rows for the public were packed at times with people waiting to see relatives or friends who had been in detention for as long as two days while the cases worked their way from a precinct through central booking to the complaint room and into the clerk's office and the court.
A Russian man and woman waited for their son, who had been arrested for allegedly shoplifting a videotape. Sometimes, women with infants left the room when the children o cried.
A defendant who had a record for shoplifting was charged with petty larceny for allegedly taking six pairs of pants from Macy's.
"Six pairs of pants, six months," said the judge. But the defense decided not to plead, and the man was remanded with a high bail.
The Russian man and woman who had been sitting in the arraignment part for two days finally caught sight of their son, a teen-ager with a long pony tail. The father, who wore a yarmulke, stood so that his son could see him.
The youth had taken the videotape because, according to his statement read by Assistant District Attorney Aytan Bellin, "I thought it was for free."
The defense said the boy had no arrest record and the parents were in court.
"Do you speak English?" Justice Bookson asked.
"Yes," the boy replied.
He adjourned the case in contemplation of dismissal, meaning that if the defendant stayed clear of the law for the next six months, charges would be dropped.
"America is a wonderful country," the judge told him, "but you can't take things for nothing. Remember that from now on."
Justice Bookson said that people expect judges to take a holiday into consideration and to be more compassionate, but, he said, "I don't make a deliberation based on the day."

HEADLINE: Japan Posts 1994 Gains For Electronics Output

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Japan's electronics industry, creeping back from a long slump, has registered an increase in production for 1994 for the first time in three years, according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
The gain resulted from a slight improvement in demand for electronics products in Japan, but came mainly from strong shipments to the United States and Asia of microprocessors and flat-panel displays to be installed in personal computers and other products. 
 Production of consumer electronics equipment in Japan, though, fell nearly 9.7 percent in 1994 as Japanese companies shifted their manufacturing of television sets, videocassette recorders and stereo systems to countries with lower wages, in part to escape the effects of the strong Japanese yen.
In the fiscal year that ended in March, 48 percent of consumer VCR's and 72 percent of color televisions made by Japanese companies were made outside Japan, the trade group said.
The figures, compiled in the association's annual production summary and forecast for the new year and released last week, highlight changes that have been occurring in Japan's electronics industry.
While "made in Japan" was once almost synonymous with audio and video products, such products now account for only 13 percent of Japan's total electronics production, down from nearly 19 percent in 1988. Instead, Japan is becoming a maker of industrial equipment and of sophisticated components that are assembled into final products elsewhere.
Japan's overall electronics industry, which once seemed unstoppable, has been hurt by the three-year slump in Japan's economy, by the rising yen, which makes Japanese exports less competitive, and by a lack of big new hit products to follow the VCR and compact disk. In areas like computers and telecommunications, Japan's international competitiveness is impeded by a weakness in software development.
Total production of electronics products in Japan dropped about 17 percent from its peak in 1991 to its 1993 level of 20.83 trillion yen, or about $208 billion at today's exchange rates.
For 1994, production is estimated to have climbed 2.0 percent, to 21.25 trillion yen, or about $212 billion, the association said. It forecast that an improved economy in Japan will lead to a further growth of 2.2 percent in 1995.
Price cuts and deregulation helped spur demand for some products. Production of computers and related equipment grew for the first time in three years, rising 5.5 percent, to 5.05 trillion yen, or about $50 billion. Demand for personal computers spurted this year because formerly sky-high prices were lowered in a price war started by the entry into the market here of American manufacturers like Compaq and Dell.
Production of communications equipment is also estimated to have grown slightly in 1994, largely because of a strong gain in production of cellular telephones after mobile phone service was partly deregulated in Japan and prices dropped.
Production of components and devices is estimated to have risen 6.4 percent in 1994, to 8.46 trillion yen, or $84 billion, and is forecast to grow 4.5 percent in 1995. Spurred by strong demand for PC's in the United States, Japan's production of liquid crystal displays shot up 38.5 percent while output of integrated circuits climbed 13.5 percent. But production of less sophisticated components shrank as manufacturing shifted offshore.
In its predictions for next year the industry association sees a continuation of this year's trends. Consumer electronics production is forecast to shrink another 5.3 percent. Production of industrial equipment is forecast to increase 2.4 percent because of growth in computers and mobile communications. And component and device production is expected to grow 4.5 percent.

New Political Landscape May Alter Highway Plan

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WHILE New Yorkers weren't looking last week, workers completed the four-year, $70 million renovation of part of the West Side Highway and gave motorists a newly smooth ride between 57th and 72d Streets. Now the city can get ready for the next phase of renovation: tearing down the renovated road and building a new one.
Talk about planned obsolescence! But the refurbished road will indeed come down if Donald Trump and partners go ahead as planned with the Riverside South housing development on the Hudson River. 
 Right now, the site between 59th and 72d Streets is 74.6 acres of weeds, rubbish, a temporary garden and plenty of promise. Between the property and the river stands an elevated piece of the West Side Highway -- the piece just renovated.
In the late 1980's, some civic groups came up with the ambitious idea of dropping that highway segment down to ground level, curving it toward the east and building a waterfront park above so that people could stroll to the river without crossing a highway. Highways separate New Yorkers from their waterfront throughout the city; here was a chance to break that pattern.
At the time, nobody in the city and state governments paid much attention, and soon the highway fell into such dangerous disrepair that it had to be strengthened before it collapsed. There was no time to redesign it. If there had been a realistic opportunity to move the highway down and away from the river, it was lost.
MEANWHILE, a coalition of the civic groups resisting Mr. Trump's plans to build what he originally called Television City in 1985 negotiated a peace treaty appealing to both sides. Mr. Trump reduced the size of his project significantly, and included a generous waterfront park.
But there remained the problem of the elevated highway. The park could easily go under the present highway, but that is not what anyone involved wants. Mr. Trump and associates seek unobstructed views from their apartment towers. And civic groups resent obstruction of the waterfront.
"I think we would get a terrible park and a terrible bunch of apartments if the highway isn't moved," said Richard A. Kahan, board chairman of the Riverside South Planning Corporation. "The project would be in serious jeopardy. You're talking about marketing apartments overlooking a park and a river, versus marketing apartments overlooking an elevated highway."
What to do? The eclectic supporters of Riverside South came up with a novel approach: in effect, they turned back the clock and proceeded as if the renovation hadn't happened.
At their urging, the State Urban Development Corporation has hired consultants to work on an environmental impact statement on the new development -- a prerequisite to building the project and a new road. A few years ago, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan had money designated in the Federal highway bill to pay for that study and design -- about $22 million for a demonstration project, of which approximately $7 million has been allocated for the environmental study.
The idea is to persuade Federal, state and city officials to replace the elevated road with a new road costing at least $100 million, 80 percent in Federal funds, 20 percent from the state.
BUT it isn't quite that simple. Officials in Washington -- a new, Republican Washington -- will have to be convinced that the project rates Federal dollars.
Will Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, supportive so far, want to send highway money -- often considered political pork -- to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's New York City? After all, it was Mr. D'Amato who regaled the Senate with his anti-pork rendition of "Old MacDonald." And other parts of New York will be competing for any Federal highway money allocated to the state. Will Buffalo or Peekskill support giving West Siders a nice park and apartment dwellers a great view? Will George E. Pataki?
The just-concluded renovation should keep the highway strong and safe for at least 25 years. It is hard to imagine elected officials agreeing to tear it down so soon after its completion. Then again, nobody can say when construction of Riverside South, on the drawing boards in one or another configuration since the 70's, will be built.
"The real question is how many years it is when the project really gets going and whether the highway has really amortized its cost by then," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a supporter of the Riverside South compact. "Whether it will make sense, given the funds available and the priorities, to build a park that is out from under the highway is something another generation of people will decide."
Another generation? Ms. Messinger, who recognizes looming political trouble when she sees it, is either yielding to realism or hedging. Or maybe she is hoping.

Complaint, Injunction And Then Play Ball?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The quickest way to get the real major league baseball players back on the field may be through a double play -- complaint and injunction.
If the National Labor Relations Board issues a complaint against the club owners, then seeks and is granted an injunction in Federal court, players most likely would end their strike and return to work. 
 Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, declined to comment yesterday on the question of whether he would recommend that the players return under those circumstances. "I won't comment on what I would do until we get there," he said.
But if he is consistent with his testimony last September before a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, Fehr would recommend an end to the strike if a judge granted an injunction. Based on their comments in the past, other union officials would apparently favor that recommendation as well.
There also is the possibility that given the sudden interest in the lingering dispute among its members, Congress conceivably could move faster than anyone would have anticipated before the owners implemented their salary cap.
If both the Senate and the House put legislation on a fast track and its supporters managed to reduce what always has been substantial opposition to such action, passage of a bill limiting baseball's exemption from antitrust laws could send the players back to work.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, stunned baseball people last Friday with his announcement that he would use his seniority to introduce legislation on Jan. 4, the first day of the new term of Congress, to repeal the exemption.
In the last term of Congress, bills were introduced in both the Senate and the House, but one bill didn't get out of committee and another ran out of time.
Fehr and Orel Hershiser, the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher, testified before the House subcommittee on economic and commercial law on Sept. 21 on the merits of the latter bill, sponsored by Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, and Jim Bunning, the former pitcher and a Kentucky Republican.
The bill proposed to subject baseball to the antitrust laws in labor matters if the owners unilaterally imposed new terms and conditions. As originally written, it also would have granted the players an automatic stay of the new economic system if they challenged it in court.
Both Fehr and Hershiser, a member of the union's negotiating subcommittee, told the Congressmen they would support an end to the strike if the bill were passed. But before the subcommittee sent it to the House Judiciary Committee, the bill was amended to remove the automatic-stay provision. That tempered Fehr's view. He said the bill "could still be a positive step," but that he didn't know if he could make the same recommendation.
Nevertheless, an injunction granted by a Federal judge would serve the same purpose as the original automatic-stay provision. It would block the salary cap and restore the old system while the merits of the N.L.R.B. complaint were argued before an administrative law judge.
The players then could end their strike and return to work while awaiting the outcome of the hearing and subsequent appeals.
The first step would be for Daniel Silverman, regional director of the New York office, to issue a complaint. If an investigation of the unfair labor-practice charge the union plans to file tomorrow or Wednesday results in a complaint, Silverman could issue it by the middle of February.
If he also recommended that the board seek an injunction and the general counsel and the board agreed, a judge could hear the case early in March. The owners, of course, would throw everything they have into convincing the judge that the players would not suffer irreparable harm if an injunction were not granted.
"It would be very hard to get an injunction," a union lawyer acknowledged, preferring not to underestimate the task.
But if the judge granted an injunction, the players could end the strike and be back on the field before the end of spring training and be ready to begin next season on time, April 3.
They also could do that if Congress worked quickly and enacted the Moynihan legislation. Based on the current climate, either one of those avenues would figure to result in baseball as it has been played before negotiation would.
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, and members of the owners' negotiating committee, have stressed that no matter what the N.L.R.B., the court or Congress does, the two sides must forge a new collective bargaining agreement through negotiation.

HEADLINE: New Parks Mix Public and Private, Uneasily

SERIES: Who Owns the West? -- Fourth article of a periodic series.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif.

 BODY:
In November, soon after Congress created the largest single expanse of parkland and protected wilderness in the 48 states, a curious Canadian couple pulled into the Mojave Desert outpost of Cima, population 15.
What the visitors saw, about 120 miles south of here in one of the driest places on earth, was a cluster of sun-baked cows, a handwritten sign criticizing the Federal Government and another one advertising beer and soda. Behind a fence, a few abandoned cars were perched on blocks. 
 "They wanted to know where was the land that had just been added to the national park system," recalled Irene Ausmus, the Cima postmistress. "I told them they were in it. Boy, were they surprised."
As one of its last acts, on Oct. 8, the 103d Congress ended a decade of wrangling over nine million acres of Southern California desert and created two new national parks, a large preserve and a huge patchwork of wilderness.
More than 90 mountain ranges, some reaching 11,000 feet above the desert floor; 2,000 kinds of plants and animals unique to a world where rain is a phantom; sand dunes as high as 700 feet, and a host of archeological treasures were given protected status under the new law.
Death Valley, upgraded from a monument, is now the largest national park in the contiguous United States -- nearly a million acres bigger than Yellowstone National Park.
But these parks and wilderness areas will not be strictly nature sanctuaries. In a flurry of amendments intended to accommodate proponents of property rights, Congress essentially wrote a dozen cattle ranchers, several miners, a large corporate property owner and assorted dry-country loners into the new park system -- freezing a snapshot of desert commerce into the ageless tableau of dunes, cinder cones and Joshua tree forests.
But never, perhaps, has such an eclectic mix of people, business and landowners been written into a park as was done in the California desert.
Hunting, prohibited in virtually every other national park except under special circumstances, will be allowed in the Mojave National Preserve. Grazing of domestic cattle, which now goes on in a limited fashion in only one small park in Nevada, will be permitted throughout much of the protected desert land. A couple of working mines will continue operations.
As a result, the newest additions to the national park system contain not only some of the oldest trees in the world, the hottest place on the planet and California's only known dinosaur tracks, but also feature a desert cowboy named Clay Overson and a Death Valley prospector who goes by the name of Sparrow.
The question, as the Mojave Desert prepares for a surge of visitors, is whether all these users can get along, or whether they will undermine the special features of land that is supposed to be set aside for the ages.
When the Desert Protection Act was signed by President Clinton on Oct. 31, it enshrined two sometimes conflicting tenets of American thought: the national park idea, created with Yellowstone in 1872 and since copied around the world, and a reverence for private property.
National parks try to preserve something unique and wondrous. America has no shortage of cows, so, park supporters argue, why let them wander through some of the most fragile land in the country? Ranchers and other desert property users argued that much of the desert parkland is no different than any other shank of the Mojave. But having lost that argument, they now fear that the National Park Service will be a heavy-handed regulator.
In the past, national parks have been drawn around everything from army bases to gold mines, usually with the provision that "inappropriate" activities will be phased out. An Indian war once passed through Yellowstone, astonishing tourists.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is the chief architect of the new law, said the ranchers were part of "our Western heritage," and she agreed to a provision that allowed grazing inside the new parks for perpetuity.
Under the new law, almost 90 percent of Death Valley is classified as wilderness, which prohibits development and road-building. At the same time, several hundred people -- including about 30 members of the Timbisha Shoshone tribe, whose ancestors have been here for hundreds of years -- will live year round in an oasis surrounding a golf course inside the new park. It is an island of private land once advertised as an area said to have "all the advantages of hell without any of the inconveniences."
Entering the park from the east, a visitor may be overwhelmed by the vistas, the clarity of the air, the sense of solitude and all the sunset-colored rings of exposed geology. But only a few miles from that entrance is a working borax mine and a nearly abandoned workers' village protected by four vocal, large-toothed dogs.
Originally, the Billie Mine and the near-ghost-town of Ryan were supposed to be part of the park, but they were later drawn out of it, a distinction that will be difficult to discern for anyone setting out to explore the park.
Most people who study the desert are happy simply to have the broad new Federal protection for the area.
"The Mojave is not quite ready for the critical list," said Dr. Charles Douglas, a professor of biology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, "but it's been approaching it."
Dr. Douglas said new communities sprouting in the desert had drained water from springs that a variety of animals, including bighorn sheep, depended on. And off-road vehicles have ripped up the habitat of desert tortoises, a threatened species.
With passage of the desert act, the Government has a chance to avoid some mistakes of the past that have led to traffic jams and excessive commercial development at other national parks, some park advocates say.
"This may well be the last major park area created in the nation," said Norbert Riedy, an official with the Wilderness Society who has been working on the California desert issue since 1986. "I look at this as an opportunity to build a park for the 21st century. But we also should look down the road, 200 to 500 years from now, when these public lands will be the backyard of millions of people."
By this view, the desert wilderness will be best appreciated as a refuge for urban-harried humanity. As Edward Abbey wrote in "Desert Solitaire," his tribute to arid America, "Out there is a different world, older and greater and deeper by far than ours, a world which surrounds and sustains the little world of man."
Mr. Abbey wrote his book in 1968, when the predominant view of the desert was still that of a wasteland, a place to dump nuclear garbage and use as a target range for new weapons. Now, more than 22 million people, mostly in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, live within a half-day's drive of one of the new desert parks. And the fastest-growing city in the United States is a Mojave Desert mecca, Las Vegas, just two hours from most of the new parkland.
Joshua Tree, which has been upgraded to a national park from a national monument, with its exotic yuccas and slabs of perfect climbing rocks, has seen attendance double over the last decade, to more than 1.4 million people a year. More than one million people visited Death Valley last year, a record. But for all the Mojave's newfound popularity, for its cattle and mines, it remains a place where people find solitude.
"You will be able to go there and experience what it was like in the Garden of Eden," said Peter Burk, a Barstow, Calif., librarian who first came up with the idea of a park in the eastern Mojave 15 years ago.
At the same time, some of the desert dwellers encircled by the new parks are restless. They want to continue doing what they have always done, riding off-road, shooting guns and exploring new mining claims, unimpeded by new regulations that come with national park status. Some of these activities will be allowed, but under significant restrictions.
"If you live around here and use the desert, you don't want to have a park ranger holding your hand, or be unable to camp anywhere but an asphalt parking lot," said Mike Smith, who lives in Twentynine Palms, just outside Joshua Tree.
Earlier this month, a leader of a group opposed to Federal protection of more land told about 100 people who live near the Mojave preserve to fight the National Park Service every step of the way as the land was put under new guidelines.
The cattlemen, miners and hunters who operate within the new additions to the park system "are the last vestiges of our pioneering spirit in this country," said Chuck Cushman, director of the American Land Rights Association, which represents property owners surrounded by Federal land.
Connie Connely is one of those people whose new landlord will be the park service. She lives next to the railroad track with her mother and eight dogs. Her father was a prospector who built his house on land leased from the Government, inside what is now the Mojave preserve.
The land is 1.4 million acres of rust-colored mountain ranges, odd-shaped lava formations and wind-sculptured dunes wedged between the two new national parks. It also contains high-voltage transmission lines, dune-buggy roads and natural-gas lines.
"I guess I'm just a hermit type," Ms. Connely said, adding that she lives in the desert because of the peace.
But since the area became part of the park, she sees a lot more people, particularly on weekends.
"Ran into a bunch of people here the other day looking for turtles," Ms. Connely said, holding a conversation while trying to quiet her dogs. "They said they came out here to see their new park. Their new park! I said it's my park, too. I'm part of it."
Actually, the east Mojave was supposed to be a national park, like Joshua Tree and Death Valley, under the terms of earlier legislation passed by Congress. It was changed to a preserve to allow hunting, after heavy lobbying by the National Rifle Association. In an average year, hunters there kill about 25 deer and 5 sheep.
But in trying to accommodate a handful of hunters, Congress may have hurt the potential for big tourist dollars.
"There are more deer killed on the George Washington Parkway every year than will be shot in the Mojave," said Martin Hayden, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, referring to the roadway in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. "People don't know what a preserve is, and by downgrading it, you cost the economy around there a lot of money."
Still, Mr. Hayden and other environmentalists are ecstatic about the desert act. "This is a gift to our grandchildren," he said.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Health Adviser Pushing $1 Billion Reduction in Medicaid

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 24

 BODY:
A month before New York State's new Republican administration must propose its first budget, Governor-elect George E. Pataki's chief adviser on health care is proposing to cut more than $1 billion in state spending from Medicaid, the costly and politically sensitive health program for the poor, disabled and elderly.
While Mr. Pataki complained often during the campaign that the program was too generous, the cuts sought by the aide, Lieut. Governor-elect Elizabeth P. McCaughey, are large but not radically different in scope from those explored by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
 They include a spending reduction of up to 30 percent in nonmedical services for the homebound, like cooking, cleaning and shopping. Ms. McCaughey would also rely for major savings on an approach Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature adopted in 1991: assigning poor people to some form of managed care, which has cut costs by about 9 percent among those already enrolled.
The proposal would preserve most so-called optional services, like eyeglasses and podiatry, and would keep those who receive home relief in the program.
Mr. Pataki has not acted on any of the proposals, which are being evaluated by the transition advisers who are drafting his budget, and he is reportedly still considering more drastic cuts. Ms. McCaughey concedes that the plan does not represent a new philosophy on Medicaid spending, but rather a systematic search for cuts large and small. She said many of the suggestions came from officials appointed by Mr. Cuomo in the State Department of Social Services and many were proposed but not put in place in the past.
Medicaid has been the most pressing cost on local governments, rising well above the rate of inflation and forcing local taxes to rise. In New York City, which is facing a $2 billion budget deficit next year, aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have circulated a proposal to cut welfare and Medicaid by $1.2 billion, or about 25 percent. In recent years, Mr. Cuomo has achieved Medicaid cuts nearly as large as he, too, struggled to close budget gaps.
Ms. McCaughey said her plan would save between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in state funds from projected Medicaid spending of $22 billion next year, translating into reduction for local governments of between 10 and 25 percent. This does not amount to an actual cut in the program, which costs over $19 billion this year, but a reduction in its expected growth.
Ms. McCaughey discussed her proposal late Friday afternoon, and many officials could not be reached for comment over the Christmas weekend. James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund of New York and a former Democratic Assemblyman who specialized in Medicaid, said that on the whole, Ms. McCaughey's proposals were in the "mainstream" and that many were "probably ultimately achievable," though not without what may be a major fight in the Legislature.
"In some respects, people I've heard are giving her credit for doing this with a scalpel and not an ax," he said "but it's a big scalpel."
There will be plenty for the Legislature, interest groups and advocates on all sides to haggle over in her proposals, as Mr. Pataki pursues his pledge to cut taxes as well as his obligation to fill a projected budget gap as high as $5 billion next year. Like many Republicans, Ms. McCaughey did not propose a reduction in state payments to hospitals and nursing homes -- an initiative supported by many Democrats in the Assembly. A similar plan was announced last month in New Jersey, where officials said they planned to cut such payments by 20 percent starting in March.
The proposed cuts in nonmedical services, also known as personal care, have been opposed by unions representing home attendants as well as by advocates for the elderly, who receive most of these services.
Moreover, many advocates for the poor have argued that managed care -- which often means enrolling Medicaid patients in health maintenance organizations -- translates into less-attentive care for poor people.
For her part, Ms. McCaughey, who has been working on the proposals since the election, said that while she expects negotiation, her proposals are sound. "I'd like to stress this is a work in progress," she said in a telephone interview.
"We've examined the system with a microscope, looking for ways we can reduce spending without actually reducing the health care. Very few of the proposed changes would involve reducing care," she said.
The proposals were the product of a task force Ms. McCaughey headed, which was composed largely of government officials and hospital executives. Advocates for Medicaid patients complained that their interests were not fully represented.
Richard M. Cook, Mr. Cuomo's deputy director for health, cautioned that his administration's efforts at broad cuts had met with yearly frustration, and he questioned whether Ms. McCaughey's proposals would save as much as she estimates, especially in managed care. "In the past, it has been exceedingly difficult to build a political and programmatic consensus for a billion dollars in savings in one year," he said.
Local governments complain that Medicaid spending, which has risen in double digits in recent years, has forced local taxes to rise; and while local officials, including many Republican county executives and the Republican Mayor of New York City, Mr. Giuliani, have pressed for a state takeover of local costs, Mr. Pataki has argued that the state's finances are too dire for such a transfer. The program is paid for by Federal, state and local money.
One of the biggest proposed cuts is $345 million in the state's share of the $2.25 billion budget for personal care. Ms. McCaughey said that the cuts could be made by dropping from the program people whose need for such care is minimal, like those who only need help shopping. Those who need help with an array of services would not have their care reduced, she said.
She added that an acceleration of the state's managed care program -- which would mandate poor people to enroll, unlike the current voluntary program -- would save $200 million next year and would require Federal permission.
The only optional benefit that Ms. McCaughey has proposed eliminating -- after a campaign in which Mr. Pataki mistakenly said that Medicaid was so extravagant that it paid for hair transplants -- is non-emergency dental care for adults. That would save $29.1 million in state funds, she said.
Other proposals include: cutting down on transportation costs; allowing doctors to write prescriptions for 90 days rather than 30; reducing the amount of family assets an individual can keep when a spouse enters a nursing home, and fingerprint imaging to cut down on fraud.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Some Republicans See Prospect of Sluggish Economy by 1996 as a Threat

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
For years the conventional wisdom has held that a sluggish economy hurts the party of whoever resides in the White House. But with Republicans planning to use their new control of Congress to dominate economic policy-making over the next two years, the conventional wisdom may well prove wrong.
Or at least that's what more and more Republicans are beginning to worry about. 
 Officials of the Federal Reserve Board have been unusually frank in saying that the six increases in the interest rate this year will probably succeed in slowing the economy over the next two years. While the timing and extent of any slowdown cannot be pinpointed, most economists think its full brunt will be felt by early 1996, just as the Presidential primary season gets under way.
The extent of any slowdown in 1996 is crucial, Democrats and Republicans say. If economic growth drops from the 4 percent pace this year to 2.6 percent in 1996 -- the current White House forecast -- then the creation of new jobs may slow somewhat.
Even a small slowdown could turn the economy into a much greater political issue than it was in this year's Congressional elections, said Fred P. Steeper, a prominent Republican pollster, adding, "When I was polling for President Bush, it seemed like he had trouble if growth was under 3 percent."
The White House prediction of 2.6 percent growth in 1996 is only slightly higher than the current consensus of blue-chip private economists. But more and more economists have begun adding a caveat to their forecasts, saying the economy may fare a lot worse than their forecasts. Medium-term interest rates in financial markets have risen to a level suggesting that loans will become so expensive that the economy could stall within a year.
It is this possibility that has Republicans worried. Some are beginning to plan responses. Representative James H. Saxton, a New Jersey Republican who will become vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress next year, said that if a recession did come, "our message will be that high interest rates and high taxes that were caused by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Government brought on this recession."
Some Republicans are even calling for the party to sound the alarm now.
"The thing most likely to avoid misunderstanding with the American public is for the Republicans to begin talking early and often about the 1996 recession, to make clear it's the result of policy decisions made before the 1994 election," said John D. Mueller, who was the economic counsel to the House Republican Conference from 1981 to 1988 and who remains active in Republican circles as an economic forecaster.
A popular political rule of thumb these days is that an ailing economy hurts incumbents much more than a healthy economy helps them. This year's strong economy did not seem to help Democrats much, but President George Bush suffered in 1992 from the economy's lingering weakness after the 1990 recession.
So far, detailed discussion of the possible threat to Republicans has been largely limited to strategists like William Kristol, who was former Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff. But Mr. Kristol said that at a recent closed-door seminar in Baltimore for new members of Congress, "there was a lot of interest from the freshmen Republican Congressmen about this issue."
Republican leaders have mostly kept quiet about the economy, but a few hints of nervousness are apparent. For example, a Federal Reserve official who insisted on anonymity said that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the incoming majority leader, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the next Speaker of the House, have asked for a meeting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The two Congressional leaders did not indicate why they wanted a meeting, and the meeting has not yet been held, the board official said.
When asked at a news conference on Dec. 9 about rising interest rates, Mr. Gingrich replied, "I am concerned, and I think that there's a real problem." But he backpedaled moments later, saying he respected the Federal Reserve's independence and would not discuss its policy decisions.
The worst-case scenario for Republicans is that voters give President Clinton the credit for the last two years of economic growth and then blame Republicans and their legislation for any economic slowdown in the next two years.
"There's no doubt that incumbents have a problem," said Patrick J. Buchanan, the columnist who challenged Mr. Bush for the Presidential nomination in 1992. "That the Republicans now have power -- real power -- they are in danger of being indicted as participants in bringing down the recovery."
On Dec. 16 Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, began laying the political groundwork for an effort to blame the Clinton Administration.
"The fact of the matter is, Bill Clinton inherited a very strong economy, much stronger than the public knew in 1992," Mr. Barbour told reporters, "and the economic growth that we've had in 1993 and 1994 has been in spite of his economic policies, not because of them.
"If in fact the negative potential of those economic policies bites, because the growth that was taking place in '92 runs out of steam, the economy could turn down. But the policies that we advocate will be policies that are pro-growth, pro-jobs and beneficial to our competitiveness."
Yet most economists, including Republicans, believe that neither the Clinton Administration nor the Bush Administration has changed the course of the economy dramatically, nor will a Republican-controlled Congress do so. The real power in economic policy-making lies at the Federal Reserve and its control over interest rates.
Mr. Mueller said that if the economy was now heading down, Republican tax cuts and deregulatory initiatives in Congress could not stop it. Even if the most optimistic predictions come true for the economic effects of lower taxes on investment profits and other Republican initiatives, he said, they would not be enough to stop the economy's boom-bust cycle.
Some Democrats in Congress think that the White House will be blamed for any harm to the economy as a result of higher interest rates almost regardless of what happens in Congress, and despite the fact that the Federal Reserve is responsible for raising the rates.
Rising interest rates "are going to be disastrous to the economy, and that's going to be disastrous to the Democrats," said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, an upstate New York Democrat on the House Banking Committee who follows monetary policy.
And some Republicans are already planning how to make sure this happens, so as to avoid blame themselves.
"We want to have fights with Clinton," Mr. Kristol said, "so that we can remind voters in '96 that there were certain things we wanted to do and Clinton prevented them."

HEADLINE: Concerned About Pollution From Proposed Mine, Wisconsin Tribe Takes On a Giant

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CRANDON, Wis.

 BODY:
At its most basic level, a fight over a proposal by the Exxon Corporation to build an immense copper and zinc mine near the Sokaogon Chippewa reservation here seems like a mismatch between the world's largest energy corporation and Wisconsin's smallest Indian tribe.
But Exxon's plan to put a mine on 865 acres of Wisconsin's North Woods, a region of dense forests and clear rivers, has turned into one of the country's fiercest grass-roots environmental face-offs. Not only does the tribe view it as a life-and-death struggle but it also has enough money and outside support to make a fight of it. 
 On Exxon's side are Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, other top state politicians and the state's business leaders. They contend that the mine would help the area's economy but not pollute its streams and lakes.
On the other side are the Chippewas, who say that the mine would ruin a way of life dependent on clean water to provide fish and wild rice. Joining them are some small-business owners who argue that a project of the magnitude planned by Exxon -- with giant pulverizing mills and shafts as deep as 2,800 feet -- could wreck a healthy rural economy based on forestry, recreation and light manufacturing. The unemployment rate in the area is about 5 percent, a quarter of what it was six years ago. Several business owners said they had worked hard to establish an economy based on steady use of natural resources and were fearful of the boom-and-bust pattern of the mining industry.
"Right now, a lot of us are looking at what it means to be a small town," said Dorothy Kegley, the former Mayor of Crandon, population 2,000. "You can sell it out pretty cheap." She is running for her old seat in the April election on a platform of opposing the mine.
The fight here is one of several that Indian tribes are waging against huge natural-resource projects. Though some tribal leaders have sought projects that many Indians as well as environmentalists oppose, other reservations have become active centers of environmentalism in the 1990's.
The Cherokees helped force the closing of a nuclear processing plant in Oklahoma, for example. The Navajos have fought timber cutting in Arizona, and the Sioux kept new garbage dumps from their reservation in South Dakota.
"These fights have developed outside the framework of the mainstream environmental movement," said Al Gedicks, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse.
It will be several years before a winner and loser can be declared in the Wisconsin battle. But the Sokaogon (pronounced so-COG-in) tribe, using Federal and private grants and revenue from its two casinos, has filed lawsuits and hired experts to evaluate the proposed mine, which would be in what is now a dense forest just east of and upstream from the tribe's Mole Lake Reservation. The Sokaogon Chippewas have also built alliances with other tribes, sought help from environmentalists and joined forces with many white residents here who are concerned about pollution.
Among the most important allies the Chippewas have recruited are anglers' groups concerned that mining wastes would ruin fishing in the nearby Wolf River. Only a few years ago, fishermen and Indians were at war in northern Wisconsin over the tribe's practice of spearfishing walleyed pike during spawning season.
Exxon's opponents point to other regions of the country, from the West to Appalachia, where mining wastes have heavily damaged thousands of miles of streams and rivers and required million-dollar cleanups financed by taxpayers.
Exxon discovered the zinc and copper deposit here in 1975. In 1986, it temporarily abandoned its plan to open the mine, citing low mineral prices, but neither the company nor the tribe expected the withdrawal to be final. In September 1993 Exxon announced that it had joined with Rio Algom Ltd., a Canadian mining company, to form the Crandon Mining Company to pursue the project. In February, the two companies notified the state Department of Natural Resources that they intended to acquire the more than 40 permits needed to begin construction.
"We expect to continue to try to do everything we can to address the concerns of everybody," said Jerome D. Goodrich Jr., one of Exxon's top mine supervisors and the president of Crandon Mining. "We expect to be here a long time. You don't win in the long term by bulldozing people."
The company has spent millions of dollars on studies to prove to the state and the tribe that the mine would not leak.
The principal product of the mine would be zinc, a metal used to prevent corrosion in cars, bridges and buildings. Copper, lead and small amounts of gold and silver would also be mined. Mr. Goodrich said about 800 people would be employed building the mine, with 400 to 500 people then needed to operate it. Wages would average $30,000 to $40,000 a year.
Mayor Vern Kincaid of Crandon said: "If the mine is done in a way that makes it environmentally safe, then I'd say the majority of people here want it. It will be a good thing for our young people, who can stay around here to get a job instead of having to leave."
Chippewa leaders said they did not believe that Exxon or its partner could operate a mine that would not pollute, and they have rejected appeals to meet with Exxon. The tribe contends that Exxon and other mining companies are considering at least 10 other mineral deposits for development in northern Wisconsin, a number the industry does not dispute. Halting the Crandon project, they argue, could prevent the development of other big mines.
"Talking with them is participating in our own destruction," said Fred Ackley, a Sokaogon tribal judge. "Our goal is to stop this project."
George E. Meyer, the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said in an interview that his agency would set strict environmental standards. "If they can't meet those standards, then they won't be issued the permits," Mr. Meyer said.
Mr. Goodrich acknowledged that keeping wastes out of the water would not be easy. The mine would produce ores and wastes laced with sulfides. Such wastes, when mixed with air and water, produce low concentrations of sulfuric acid, known as acid mine drainage.
Mr. Goodrich said that his company had designed a 365-acre storage complex to prevent acidic substances from forming and that water draining from the waste piles would be treated to remove pollutants.
But Frances Van Zile, the tribe's chief records clerk, said the tribe had found no evidence that a metallic sulfide mine like the one proposed here had ever prevented acid mine drainage. Ms. Van Zile said she feared that wastes would seep into a creek that feeds Rice Lake on the reservation, harming the wild rice that is crucial to the tribe's culture and economy.
"If it wasn't for pure water," she said, "we wouldn't be here.
"When you were born, you were born in pure water in your mother's womb. What's the first thing you did today? You turned on the water. And that's what they are going to pollute. They are going to destroy our way of life."

HEADLINE: Hundreds of Jobs Likely to Go In Cuts by Bankrupt County

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Hundreds of people are likely to lose their jobs in coming months as health clinics, programs for children and other services are cut to help offset the losses that led Orange County to declare bankruptcy, officials said on Saturday.
The county, in suburban Los Angeles, hopes to save $120 million over the next 18 months, including $40 million in the next six months and $80 million in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, said Tom Uram, a member of the team that is reshaping the county's budget. 
 To realize the savings, health clinics and some health-care programs for children will have to be eliminated, said Mr. Uram, who is also director of the Health Care Agency, which runs the county's clinics and health programs.
"We'll have to close clinics and reduce overall services, reduce or eliminate child physicals," Mr. Uram said in an interview. "We just don't have the resources to do all this anymore. These are mammoth-type cuts."
The members of the council charged with making budget recommendations -- Mr. Uram, Sheriff Brad Gates and District Attorney Michael Capizzi -- have refused to speculate on the number of jobs that will be cut. But the Orange County Employees Association estimates that spending cuts will result in 700 to 1,000 layoffs, said John Sawyer, general manager of the association.
Supervisor Roger Stanton and an incoming county Supervisor, Marian Bergeson, have already told some employees that their jobs will be eliminated.
News of the impending layoffs has enraged residents, and two county supervisors received telephoned bomb threats on Friday.
"They're shocked and angry," Mr. Sawyer said.
The cost-cutting measures are just the first small steps on the path to bail out the county, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 6 after disclosing large losses from high-risk investments.
The scandal forced the resignation of the county's Treasurer, Robert L. Citron, provoked calls for the recall of county supervisors and led to investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies.
"What will happen in the future we're not even sure," Mr. Uram said. Referring to the county's 18-month cost-cutting plan, he added: "It's Draconian. But I suspect this is just the start."
Orange County had borrowed heavily to invest in complex interest-sensitive securities known as derivatives. The investment pool was meant to capitalize on falling interest rates. When rates rose, losses mounted.
Officials said the county's share of the investment pool's $2 billion loss might reach $700 million, far more than the $120 million in savings outlined by Mr. Uram.

Dispute With Ex-Treasurer
 SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 25 (AP) -- Orange County officials are threatening not to pay the legal costs for Mr. Citron, the former Treasurer.
Mr. Citron's lawyer, David Wiechert, said today that the county's top lawyer, Terry Andrus, had called him on Friday to report that a letter had been drafted informing Mr. Citron of the decision not to pay legal expenses. Mr. Wiechert said Mr. Andrus had described the decision as "political." He added that it seemed to be an effort to shield other officials from sharing blame for the county's bankruptcy.
Mr. Wiechert contended that the only basis for refusing to pay costs in civil suits and investigations like those Mr. Citron faces would be fraudulent, malicious or corrupt conduct and that he was not guilty of any of those.
Mr. Wiechert said he had persuaded Mr. Andrus not to send the letter, agreeing that a legal deadline for such a notice could be extended until Jan. 5.
Mr. Andrus was not available for comment because of the holiday.

HEADLINE: What Is a Nation?

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 23

 BODY:
The war in the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya is crystalizing two issues that have been debated only sporadically here despite the rise of ethnic separatism around the world: How inviolate is national sovereignty? And what should the limits of self-determination be?
Those questions have been raised at the United Nations since mid-1992, when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali published "Agenda for Peace," a report written for the Security Council at a time when hopes were still high and horizons still seemed broadened because of the cold war's end. 
 In those days, Mr. Boutros-Ghali wrote "that an opportunity has been regained to achieve the great objectives of the Charter." He included not only peacekeeping but peacemaking, or interposing force between warring parties whether or not they agreed. He also emphasized the promotion of human rights and higher living standards.
A few years later, nearly 150 wars or skirmishes are in progress in which thousands of people are dying -- more civilians than soldiers by most reckonings -- and hundreds of thousands are becoming refugees.
With more than 100 of those battles taking place within countries rather than between them, the United Nations must find a way to intervene to save both lives and states, diplomats say. But to do so, the organization will have to use new tools and concepts. There have been some significant moves in that direction.
The General Assembly approved a sweeping resolution today calling on the Secretary General to take steps to promote democratization and strengthen the election process worldwide. It also asked the newly appointed High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso of Ecuador, to support education on human rights.
Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate, welcomed the Assembly vote as a means to expand the scope of the United Nations in promoting political rights, one way to dampen the discontent that often leads to rebellion. But these are long-term goals.
For the moment, the major nations represented here, and the United Nations as an organization, remain committed to guarding national integrity above the rights of peoples. The case of the former Yugoslavia -- in particular Bosnia and Herzegovina -- is both an exception to that concept and, to many, an instance of the terrible price paid when recognition is quickly extended to entities that might not be viable as countries.
"If you look at the Security Council resolutions in the last two or three years, you will find that in almost every crisis we insist -- sometimes apparently out of the blue -- on preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state," said Emilio J. Cardenas, the chief delegate from Argentina, which holds one of the 10 rotating seats on the 15-member Council.
"We went as far recently in making that point about Iraq, where we believe that you should protect the Shias and Kurds without breaking the national identity -- providing that the country respects diversity," he said.
Mr. Cardenas and others say there is a perceptible shift away from almost automatically embracing self-determination for minorities. Instead the Council is looking toward minority problems and secessionist movements as political, economic and human rights issues in which the United Nations may have some standing. That trend was reflected in the General Assembly vote on democratization and human-rights education.
"We talk less and less about self-determination, because of the fear of secession," Mr. Cardenas said in an interview. "We talk more and more about the need to protect minorities inside the state."
Secretary General Boutros-Ghali made that point in his "Agenda for Peace." Commenting on the role of nations in taking "an integrated approach to human security," he reiterated the support of the United Nations for national sovereignty. But he added:
"The time of absolute and exclusive sovereignty, however, has passed; its theory was never matched by reality. It is the task of leaders of states today to understand this and to find a balance between the need of good internal governance and the requirements of an ever more interdependent world."
The debate over national sovereignty and self-determination after the cold war is rich in paradox. In the case of Chechnya, for instance, the Moscow that has been so outspoken in defending the rights of Russians in newly independent states has not shown much sympathy for the Muslim Chechens within its own borders. Nor has it accepted the right of Muslim nations to offer assistance to them.
Russia has also been firm in fending off calls for international mediation in Chechnya.
"Lately the Russians have been very active in saying that political and diplomatic means are better than military means for solving conflict," said Danilo Turk, Slovenia's delegate. "I am surprised that they are not repeating that wisdom now. It is difficult to see how a problem like this can be solved militarily."
But as Russian bombs and artillery barrages landed this week on Chechnya, the United Nations was on the sidelines, grappling with what may be its central problem: the larger or more influential the country directly involved in a conflict, the less likely that there will be a role for this or any other international organization.
The feeling of irrelevance here was underscored on Wednesday, when reporters meeting with the Russian delegate, Sergei V. Lavrov, wanted to know if Moscow might seek the intervention of the United Nations.
"Why?" he replied.
Around the world, some of the very nations that gained independence in the flush of self-determination that followed World War II and reached its height in the 1960's are now on the other side of the argument.
India, which set a standard for nonviolent opposition to colonial rule, now administers Kashmir with martial law and three quarters of a million troops. Indonesia, with its history of struggle against the Dutch and, briefly, the Japanese, now denies the East Timorese the right to talk about independence. China, fearful of losing Tibet, joins those two countries in international forums in condemning human rights campaigns, with support from Iran and other nations with authoritarian governments.
If the United Nations General Assembly or Security Council, both subject to paralysis when powerful individual governments resist action, cannot do much unless it is invited into a country in turmoil, other parts of the United Nations system can play a role.
In recent years, the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, under Sadako Ogata, has been more aggressive about moving into areas when people are displaced and about publicizing issues of human rights. Strong international human rights organizations try to keep abuses in public view, and they are gaining more standing in the United Nations system.
At the same time, experts are reviewing a passage in the United Nations Charter that nations have routinely cited to avoid interference. The relevant language, in Article 2 (7), says, "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."
Jose E. Alvarez, an associate professor of law at the University of Michigan, said at a seminar convened two years ago by the Academic Council of the United Nations System, based at the Watson Institute at Brown University, that interpretation of this 1945 language has in fact been considerably muddied over the years.
Professor Alvarez argues that the General Assembly has passed so many covenants and authorized so many new procedures -- election-monitoring, for instance -- that it has reduced areas of national life that can be considered to be completely outside international law.
But Mr. Turk of Slovenia, the chairman of a working committee on rights in the General Assembly, said the words "essentially within domestic jurisdiction" were chosen carefully and are elastic.
"The framework of domestic jurisdiction has narrowed," he said. "Things that were considered domestic 30 to 40 years ago are now international jurisdiction, and we could act on them." He said that if the United Nations were not "unduly legalistic," it would recognize that it already had the power to play a role in protecting human rights within the broadened definition of international jurisdiction.
He said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had already gone very far, at least on paper, in rejecting the argument of domestic jurisdiction.
"If people are being killed, one should have the right to be asking human rights questions," he said, adding that this included the case of Chechnya.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Christmas Wishes Didn't Come True This Year

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The predictions of a strong holiday shopping season were apparently wishful thinking for many retailers, particularly in apparel.
While the numbers will not begin to come out until tomorrow, the early indications are that the season's sales, while above last year's, have not been what retailers hoped for or stocked for. "It's not been a happy season," said Edward Johnson, the retailing analyst who compiles the Johnson Redbook Service, which tracks sales. 
 One sign of the problems was that many people held off on their shopping until just before Christmas, forcing retailers to slash prices in an effort to lure customers. Shoppers can expect an even greater number of markdowns in the coming weeks as stores try to clear their shelves for spring merchandise.
The extent of the pre-Christmas markdowns shocked many people who follow the retailing industry, and implied a level of desperation last seen in the depths of the 1990-91 recession.
Two days before Christmas, for example, Brooks Brothers was running a storewide sale, with prices cut 25 percent to 40 percent on a wide range of merchandise. At Lerners New York, crimson signs promised 50 percent off everything, even merchandise previously marked down. Eddie Bauer sent out a sale catalogue two weeks before Christmas.
On Saturday in Manhattan, the streets were fairly empty. For the first time since Thanksgiving, there were no lines outside F.A.O. Schwarz and the Warner Brothers Store. And Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Bloomingdale's were hardly packed with shoppers.
There were some exceptions: sales were apparently good at certain retailers of merchandise for the home, as well as for computers, software, consumer electronics and jewelry.
Entering the season, retailers had been more optimistic than last year heading into the fourth quarter, with roughly 10 percent more inventory than they had on hand a year earlier, said Dr. William Ford, senior economic adviser to Telecheck Services Inc., a check-clearing service.
But he added: "My sense of it is that when the smoke clears early next week and we start getting some hard data, we're going to see that while sales are up, they're not nearly as good as what retailers hoped for and what they stocked up for."
Telecheck said the dollar amount of purchases made using checks was up a narrow 2.2 percent for the 27 days from the day after Thanksgiving through last Wednesday. While heavy use of credit cards probably accounted for some of the slower pace reflected in Telecheck's numbers, sales this year were fundamentally less robust than anticipated, Dr. Ford said.
To be sure, Mastercard and Visa have both been reporting extraordinary increases in purchases made with their credit cards, and many have used those numbers to proclaim the 1994 holiday sales season a barn-burner.
But many analysts say the sharp increases reported by Visa and Mastercard do not provide an accurate snapshot of sales. For one thing, many consumers are shifting their spending from cash and checks to credit cards that offer them mileage on airline flight plans or discounts on cars and gasoline. And the number of stores accepting Visa and Mastercard has risen sharply.
In addition, some credit-card transactions included in the figures are made in grocery stores, which are not traditionally a source of Christmas presents.
Analysts said many retail companies might meet their sales goals but would have sacrificed profits to do so. "They're buying sales with promotions at this point," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm based in New York. "Business is being generated not because customers are coming in voluntarily, but because the retailers have their hooks out."
He said that a few companies had declined to hold sales in an effort to preserve their profit margins, but that for the most part, big markdowns were likely to eat into fourth-quarter profits. Anticipating those results, the stocks of many retailing companies are trading close to their 52-week lows.
Mr. Johnson of Johnson Redbook estimated that sales last week would increase from the corresponding week a year earlier by a percentage in the mid-teens, largely because retailers had one more selling day before Christmas than they had last year. "That's what's going to save sales for most of them," he said. "But so far, it's been a little below expectations for most stores."
Many retailing executives and Wall Street analysts said they were puzzled by the slow pace of sales. The nation's overall economic picture bode well for the holiday season, with surveys of consumer sentiment showing a rise in confidence. Unemployment is low, and the economy is growing at a healthy pace.
Some explanations for the disappointing season come from a study of the holiday shopping period completed in the last week by Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a retail consulting firm. Almost three-quarters of the 400 people surveyed across the country said they would be saving more and spending less this year, in part because they intended to pay off credit card debt.
Isaac Lagnado, a principal at Tactical, estimated that higher interest rates have already taken between $5 billion and $10 billion of discretionary income out of consumers' pockets. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed said higher expenditures for home purchases and mortgage refinancings would curtail their spending. "I think we started to see the effect of higher interest rates just as the holiday season began," Mr. Lagnado said.
And 44 percent said they would spend less because prices were too high.
But Daniel D. Barry, a financial analyst who follows retailers at Merrill Lynch & Company, looked to a time-honored excuse for poor sales. "Weather killed the Christmas season -- that's the only explanation for what's happened," he said, referring to moderate temperatures in many places.
But while such weather may hurt sales of coats and mittens, consumers still had to buy something to put under the tree.
When they did buy, they showed a distinct preference for merchandise for the home, computers, software, consumer electronics and jewelry. For the apparel industry, it was an unhappy year.
"There's still a wide divergence between apparel and hard goods," said Susan Silverstein, a retailing analyst at Gruntal & Company. "Unfortunately, you would expect some significant apparel sales for the holiday season, but it hasn't happened."
Given shoppers' predilection for merchandise like flannel sheets, flashlights with flexible stems and decorating items with holiday themes, it was easy to predict which retailers did well. Pier 1 Imports, a merchandiser of furniture and housewares, said it was expecting double-digit increases in sales at stores that were open a year earlier -- what the industry calls same-store sales, which provides a measure that is not swollen by new stores. Williams-Sonoma Inc., the housewares catalogue and retail company, reported strong sales increases.
The Lowes Companies, a hardware and housewares retailer, said it was expecting its best holiday season ever. "I don't know how it is for others, but we have not had a wait-and-see attitude among our consumers at all," said Cliff Oxford, vice president of corporate relations.
Some analysts said the May Department Stores Company, another retailing powerhouse; Gap Inc. stores; the Limited Inc., and even Toys "R" Us were among the companies hinting that December sales had been disappointing. Spiegel Inc., the large catalogue company that owns Eddie Bauer, and the Brookstone Group had already foreshadowed a bleak fourth quarter.
Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which usually sets the pace for the industry, was struggling to meet its projections as slow sales of apparel in its discount stores and at its Sam's Club warehouse stores dragged down stronger sales of hard goods, like electronics, kitchen appliances and compact disks and software.
Mr. Barry of Merrill Lynch said that among the retailers he follows, only Sears, Roebuck & Company, and two chains selling close-out merchandise, Consolidated Stores and MacFrugal's, were exceeding their targets for holiday sales.
Many retailers had counted on Friday and Saturday to provide enough momentum to meet their goals.
"It's always difficult to predict until the last numbers come in," said Gail Dorn, a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which operates the Target and Mervyn's chains and several department stores in the Midwest. "We haven't changed our forecast, which was for increases in the low- to mid-single digits."
The calendar's gift of an extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, compared with last year, was expected to create a sales windfall of as much as 2 percent. But analysts said the benefits afforded by the calendar would not offset the lackluster pace of sales.
"If you haven't made it over the last two weeks, I wouldn't bank my fourth quarter on these two days, especially with the markdowns they're taking," Ms. Silverstein of Gruntal & Company said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts to Halt Bribes for Alien Work Cards

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Trying to reduce the temptation for employees to take bribes, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has decided to stop issuing work cards in district offices. Instead, starting next spring, the cards will be mailed to immigrants from one or two central offices.
Work cards are given to aliens awaiting hearings on their immigration status. With the cards, they are free to look for work. But the cards are also prized because in some states they can be used to obtain driver's licenses, Social Security cards and other documents that are often used to demonstrate citizenship. As a result, the work cards can be a valuable item on the black market, costing illegal immigrants $500 or more. 
 In one particularly grievous case of corruption, eight employees of the Washington district office of the immigration service were recently convicted of accepting bribes. Altogether, the agency said, they had fraudulently given more than 4,000 people permission to work in this country.
Nor was the corruption in the Washington office an isolated case. Every year dozens of immigration service employees are arrested on charges of corruption or related misconduct. The New York Times reported on the widespread corruption in the agency last September.
The new procedure on issuing work cards, one of several steps the service is taking to deal with its corruption problem, also comes as immigration has become an important political issue.
The recommendation to mail the work cards from central offices came as part of a larger management review this fall of agency procedures. Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration, has acknowledged that her agency's employees -- some earning little more than the minimum wage -- are more vulnerable to corruption than those in most other agencies of Government because they grant coveted benefits to immigrants willing to pay almost any price to stay in the United States.
This month, the agency is also installing an advanced computer program that will enable internal auditors to track corruption and employee misconduct cases and see whether loopholes in the system made them possible.
"Now, every time we have a case, we have to look through all the other cases" by hand, William G. Rightor, the deputy director of internal audit, said as he demonstrated the new system last week.
The new tracking system is intended to allow auditors to spot common elements in repeated cases and take corrective action, a practice the agency had previously neglected. Had this system been in place before, agency officials said, the immigration service's management might have noticed the work card problem on its own.
Under the new plan for issuing work cards, district offices will approve the applications and then send the paperwork to regional immigration service centers. There, officers will review the papers, produce the work cards and mail them to the immigrants.
"We signed off on this two weeks ago," Chris Sale, the Deputy Commissioner, said last week. "It will be operational in June."

HEADLINE: Nov. 8 Is Long Gone, but the California Election Lingers On, and On and On

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Six weeks have passed since Californians trooped to the polls to vote on everybody and everything from governor to a way to slow illegal immigration. Yet Nov. 8 is anything but history.
The election's aftershocks are still being felt. 
 Initially, they brought allegations of extensive balloting fraud, which have since become the subject of a private statewide canvass of voters. More recently, the aftershocks have left the State Assembly in Sacramento leaderless and tied in partisan knots and have set off a flurry of efforts to recall some members.
"It's the election that won't die," said Sherry Bebitch-Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont College who specializes in California elections. "A lot of voters and politicians still have some anger and frustration left, and it looks like they're intent on venting it."
One politician, Representative Michael Huffington, the Republican from Santa Barbara who put up almost $28 million of his personal fortune in an unequaled political spending effort to unseat Senator Dianne Feinstein, still refuses to concede defeat.
According to the state's official count of ballots, Ms. Feinstein, a Democrat from San Francisco, won with 51 percent of the vote. But Mr. Huffington contends there may have been voting fraud and is awaiting the outcome of a private canvass by supporters. He argues that California does not monitor voter registration carefully enough, especially registration efforts by some of the state's thousands of illegal aliens.
"He's onto something," said Harold W. Ezell, a former Federal immigration official who is directing the canvass.
How many instances of fraud have been uncovered so far in the monthlong investigation?
"We're not quite ready to talk about that yet," Mr. Ezell replied.
Jennifer Grossman, a Huffington aide, added, "Until the figures are released, Mike's not saying another word -- and that includes conceding."
Ms. Grossman denied published reports that Mr. Huffington was so disgruntled with California politics that he planned to sell his home and move back to his native Texas, or perhaps elsewhere.
As for efforts to recall some members of the State Legislature, they are all directly related to the larger fight over control of the Assembly, the lower house.
More than in most other states, California voters have often relied on recall elections to settle political grudges. But the current efforts are the most extensive and serious in years and underscore the tension roiling the leaderless Assembly.
Four members already face recalls, and four others are likely to after getting caught up in the struggle over whether to re-elect Assemblyman Willie Brown of San Francisco to a record-setting eighth term as Speaker of the 80-member body.
The first vote ended in a 40-to-40 tie after Mr. Brown managed to woo over a disenchanted Republican. Now advocates of recall intend to break that tie, and the legislative logjam, by changing the mix of Republicans and Democrats through a set of specially petitioned elections.
Republicans, who hope to elect Assemblyman James L. Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga as Speaker, have begun collecting the petition signatures needed to recall three Democrats, all narrow winners on Nov. 8. They are also canvassing in the districts of three other Democrats to see whether recalls are feasible.
And Republicans are working with a vengeance to recall their apostate member, Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher of West Covina, who not only jumped to Mr. Brown's side but also proclaimed himself to be an independent as he did so.
Democrats, meanwhile, are exploring the feasibility of recalling Assemblyman Steve Kuykendall, a Republican from Rancho Palos Verdes. He narrowly won his seat after accepting a last-minute $125,000 campaign contribution from Philip Morris U.S.A., the tobacco company whose lobbyists are a major legislative force in Sacramento.
Mr. Brulte predicted on Wednesday that he would eventually win the speakership, which after the governorship is the second-most-powerful political post in the nation's most politically powerful state. At the same time, he accused Mr. Brown of a sour-grapes effort to hold on to power despite the Republicans' November surge that erased the numerical edge Democrats had long held in the Assembly.
"Republicans are not about to make Willie Brown the Speaker of the Assembly, not again," Mr. Brulte declared.
Mr. Brown renewed an offer to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement with Mr. Brulte, lest the Legislature, already beleaguered by social and economic troubles, become mired in inaction upon its return to the capital on Jan. 4.
The chairman of the California Democratic Party, Bill Press, was in a less charitable political mood than Mr. Brown. He accused Mr. Brulte of misusing the recall process and engaging in "political blackmail."
"The recall process was clearly intended for malfeasance, criminal activity, failure to perform duties -- not for one vote," Mr. Press said at a news conference on Wednesday, choosing to ignore a possible Democratic effort to recall Assemblyman Kuykendall.
"This use of the recall amounts to blackmail," he added. "We don't tolerate criminal blackmail, and we shouldn't tolerate political blackmail."
In fact, over the years, Californians have used the recall process, or tried to use it, mainly to punish elected officials for ideological malfeasance, not genuine malfeasance.
Most efforts have failed for a lack of petition signatures, the usual requirement being the gathering of enough names to equal at least 10 percent of the turnout in the last election. This has been particularly true of efforts to recall governors, judges and legislators.
In the one recent effort to recall a legislator that actually went to a vote, David A. Roberti, a State Senator who favored stronger gun controls managed to emerge victorious. But he was so battered politically and financially that he was later defeated in a race for another state office.
In other cases where the required number of petition signatures have been obtained and a recall vote has actually been held, a few mayors, city council members and county supervisors have been ousted.
Encouraged by those efforts, some Los Angeles voters are now petitioning to remove the president of the city's school board, Mark Slavkin. He voted for the city's filing a legal challenge to Proposition 187, the hotly disputed ballot initiative that voters approved overwhelmingly on Nov. 8. Among other things, it denies schooling to immigrant children who are in California illegally.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
A Political Mugging

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
Over the last two months there has been a series of savage right-wing attacks on a prospective nominee to be a Federal judge, Peter Edelman. It has the look of an organized campaign, and a curious one: an attempt not to contest the choice in the Senate but to scare President Clinton out of making the nomination.
I have known Mr. Edelman for years. Ordinarily that would keep me from writing on the subject. But the attackers describe a Peter Edelman so unlike the real person that I think comment is appropriate -- with due notice of my connection. 
 The lawyer I know is a man of reason, a consensus-builder widely liked and respected. He worked in the Justice Department and, during Robert Kennedy's years in the Senate, as his legislative assistant. Since 1982 he has been a law professor at Georgetown University. On leave now, he is Counselor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
His wife, Marian Wright Edelman, is president of the Children's Defense Fund, on whose board Hillary Rodham Clinton served. The Clintons and Edelmans are friends, a fact that may have something to do with the present hostility.
For some time Mr. Edelman has been on the Justice Department's lists of possible judicial nominees. Last September President Clinton selected him for a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Mr. Edelman was told that the nomination would be formally sent to the Senate some time after the new Congress convened in January.
Then came the attacks, notably in The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal and in a column by George Will. They painted Mr. Edelman as soft on crime and contemptuous of democracy: notions that I believe a few minutes of conversation with him would lead any reasonable person to dismiss.
The most intense criticism has been of an article Mr. Edelman wrote for the Hastings Law Journal in 1987. It suggests that a basis can be found in the Constitution for a right to a minimum income: enough to stave off desperate poverty.
The article notes that some conservative legal theorists want to go back to the long-abandoned arguments that government economic regulation is unconstitutional. It can be better argued, the article says, that the Constitution assures a measure of economic protection for citizens.
I entirely disagree with that argument. Locating affirmative economic rights in a constitution -- ours or any other country's -- will only weaken negative rights: the protections against official abuse that are found in the Bill of Rights.
But to lay out such an argument as a theory is hardly shocking, or proof of how one would act in the constraining role of a judge. Moreover, Mr. Edelman's Hastings article plainly saw the idea of going to court as a way of dramatizing the issue of poverty in this country. He said the judicial relief he described was "not desirable. The better response to poverty is legislative."
The vicious character of the campaign against Mr. Edelman is made clear by the charge that he is soft on crime. A Wall Street Journal editorial said:
"As director of New York State's Division for Youth in 1978, Mr. Edelman ordered a one-week furlough for a 17-year-old who had knifed a girl during a robbery. While on his furlough, this juvenile Willie Horton was arrested for raping, robbing and trying to electrocute a 63-year-old woman." That charge is completely false. Mr. Edelman had nothing to do with furloughing the 17-year-old. When a judge told him the youth was dangerous, he ordered a bar on any home visits -- but one had already been approved by the director of the facility where he was.
The truth was described in a letter to The Journal by J. Thomas Mullen, president of Catholic Charities in Cleveland, who was Mr. Edelman's deputy in New York. The state's former Governor, Hugh Carey, wrote to say that Mr. Edelman had been an outstanding youth director and had made many wise changes, including "far stricter supervision for violent offenders."
The incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, would no doubt prefer not to handle controversial nominations. But he is a fair-minded man, and he surely will think it fairer for the committee to examine Mr. Edelman's views than to have him stopped on the way by a political mugging.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan to Negotiate On Automotive Trade Today

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
American and Japanese negotiators are to meet today in London for hastily arranged discussions on various trade issues between the two countries, including automobiles, auto parts and activity in emerging markets.
Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said yesterday as he was departing for London that the meeting had been requested by Japanese officials. 
 The talks were announced yesterday by senior Japanese trade officials at a news conference in Tokyo. Hideaki Kumano, Japan's vice minister for international trade and industry, said the two sides had "suddenly agreed to have a meeting on various trade issues, including autos and auto parts."
Mr. Kumano said the talks would also cover trade in emerging markets like India, China and Vietnam, and trade with South Africa. Japan will be represented by Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international trade affairs.
While there has been some recent progress in the talks between the two countries, American negotiators have expressed frustration about the failure by Japan to further open its huge market in automobiles and automotive parts. President Clinton initiated proceedings against Tokyo in the fall that could lead to punitive tariffs on some Japanese auto exports to the United States.
In Tokyo early today, Japanese and American officials said that they did not expect substantive discussion on the issues involved in auto trade itself, only on the ground rules for future talks.
But even setting such ground rules could be difficult. At a meeting with the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, in Indonesia last month, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, set down three principles under which Japan would resume negotiations. These included that no numerical targets be set and that the discussions be limited to areas within the Japanese Government's scope and not those it deems matters for private industry.
If the United States accepted such principles, it could mean giving up talks aimed at getting Japanese auto dealers to carry more foreign cars or getting Japanese auto manufacturers to buy more foreign parts, two of Washington's key objetives.
Talks between the two countries on finding ways for Americans to sell more cars and parts in Japan have been stalled since September, leading to the President's consideration of sanctions against Japan.
At the meeting in Indonesia in November, held during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, American and Japanese officials discussed resuming the talks.
Officials of both countries said they had been trying to arrange a meeting between Mr. Garten and Mr. Okamatsu since last month.
One Japanese official said the two Governments wanted to meet in a place that would be away from most American and Japanese journalists.
The timing of the meeting could also be related to the fact that Tuesday is to be Mr. Okamatsu's last day in his job as the top trade-related official at the ministry.
Both Mr. Okamatsu and Mr. Kumano will retire tomorrow. Mr. Kumano, in particular, is said to be resigning to take responsibility for an internal political matter at his ministry.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama is scheduled to visit Washington in two weeks, and that might also motivate Japanese officials to want to report progress in trade negotiations.
The American trade deficit with Japan rose to a new peak of $6.7 billion in October, according to figures released this month by the Commerce Department. Cars and car parts account for about two-thirds of that, with the annual trade imbalance running at roughly $60 billion.
On Dec. 12, the Clinton Administration said it had finally reached an agreement with Tokyo to assure American companies access to Japan's $4.5 billion-a-year market for flat glass. There, the Japanese market has long been dominated by a cartel of three companies.
Administration officials portrayed the agreement as an important precedent because the Japanese Government agreed to take steps against a keiretsu, the close grouping of companies that hold one another's stock and buy one another's products.
However, American trade negotiators have recently begun to shift their emphasis from Japan to other countries in Asia and Latin America, where the growth in American exports is expected to rise sharply in the next decade.
Along with the increased exports, the political opportunities may be better elsewhere. The chance of a major breakthrough in trade talks with Japan is viewed as slim. And Mr. Clinton's advisers have said that they believe concentrating on other countries could yield an increase in exports and jobs in time for the 1996 Presidential election.

Japan Car Exports Up
 TOKYO, Dec. 26 (Reuters) -- The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said today that vehicle exports in November rose 10.7 percent from those of a year earlier, helped by a particularly strong showing in Europe. Earlier this month, the association forecast that Japan's overall vehicle exports would be 4.49 million units in 1994, down 10.6 percent from a year earlier. So far this year, vehicle exports in the 11 months through November have totaled 4,099,574 units, the association said.

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Stealth Bombers, a Missouri Hamlet Booms

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KNOB NOSTER, Mo.

 BODY:
Most towns with military installations are bracing for next year's large round of base closings and the economic calamity that they fear will follow. But not this tiny town, home to Whiteman Air Force Base.
Formerly a Minuteman missile base in the middle of west-central Missouri soybean fields, Whiteman is now home to the Air Force's growing fleet of radar-evading B-2 bombers. Four of the black, bat-winged planes, which cost $2.2 billion each, are flying at Whiteman, and 16 more are on the way. 
 Residents here confidently predict that their hamlet will dodge the disaster that hit cities like Charleston, S.C., in the last round of base closings in 1993. The Air Force has poured about $475 million into new roads, housing, maintenance buildings and special hangars for the B-2's. And the incoming Republican-controlled Congress is talking about ignoring a decision by the old Democratic-majority Congress to halt B-2 production at 20 planes, and may buy more bombers.
"This is the base of the future," said Mayor Bob Carr. "I can't conceive of them closing it down."
Indeed, Knob Noster and several neighboring communities are smugly riding a wave of economic gains right to the bank. Home construction in the area is up by 46 percent since 1990. Central Missouri State University in nearby Warrensburg is building a new stadium. Military retirees and urban dwellers fed up with life in Kansas City, 70 miles west of here, are flowing in.
The Whiteman Inn on U.S. 50 built a 36-room wing last summer, mainly to handle the extra construction workers and Air Force Reserve pilots who fly on weekends.
A standard three-bedroom, ranch-style house now costs about $75,000, up from $50,000 three years ago. In the Brookside Place subdivision just outside of town, houses are sprouting in place of cornfields and turkey farms, to the accompaniment of banging hammers and whirring saws.
"They're building new houses left and right; they're going bananas," said Wanda Zinn, an agent with Century 21 Gold Realty.
Knob Noster, population 2,261, derived its unusual name from two round-topped hills that overlook the town. Many people here say they hope the growth does not change the quiet nature of this sturdy Midwestern village.
Besides the Bank of Knob Noster and two restaurants, the town has a grocery store, two hardware stores, a barbershop and several other businesses. The Town Hall, police station, schools and several neatly kept homes complete the cityscape. There is an eight-member police force and a 25-member volunteer fire department.
"Our heaviest industry is a 300-pound Tupperware salesman," said Mayor Carr, who doubles as the town's humorist.
Whiteman pumps a $62.6 million payroll into the community, and the total annual economic impact on Knob Noster and neighboring communities is estimated at $327 million.
"This place would be nothing without the base," said Larry Uptegrove, a real estate agent who has lived in the area for 32 years.
But not everyone is happy with the base. Over pancakes at the Kozy Corner restaurant, Josefine and Richard Schowengerdt complain about the planes' deafening noise.
And the Schowengerdts have a much bigger problem: The Air Force wants to widen the road near the base -- right through their house. They are not alone: about 20 families are facing buyouts or bulldozers.
"They say they're making us fair offers, but if you don't like their offer they'll condemn you," said Mr. Schowengerdt, a 57-year-old retired Army staff sergeant. "People are being ripped out of homes they've lived in all their lives."
The B-2's arrival has also caused a subtle shift in the psyche of this military town. For more than 30 years, scores of citizens lived with the ultimate cold-war symbol -- 150 nuclear-tipped ICBM's -- literally in their backyards. In a doomsday scenario, Knob Noster would have been ground zero in any Soviet attack.
Now, with the end of the cold war, the Air Force is pulling up the missiles one by one like deadly weeds, filling in the silos and offering to sell the fenced one-acre sites back to farmers and ranchers.
Instead of this omnipotently ominous but silent weapon, Knob Noster now has a military neighbor that ties up traffic every time it takes off.
When the first B-2 flew in last December from California, more than 5,000 people jammed the base to see it. Since then, the B-2 has become such a hazard for gawking drivers that the Air Force is putting up signs that warn: "Low-flying aircraft. Please do not pull off the road."
And the swaggering bomber pilots cut a different figure than the missileers, who spent most of their time underground. "Your missile people are typically loners and much more reserved, whereas the pilots are much more outgoing and extroverted," said Gregory Rose, Warrensburg's acting city manager.
So far, Knob Noster seems to be adjusting. Phil Anthony's novelty shop on State Street does a brisk business in B-2 T-shirts, hats, key chains and bolo ties. The Office Cafe's B-2 special -- hamburger, french fries and a red, white and blue sundae for $3.99 -- was a smash. And Knob Noster High School's wrestling team has renamed itself the Stealth Panthers.

HEADLINE: Disaster Leaves Imprint on Town

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Tex., Dec. 22

 BODY:
In a few moments of unforgettable terror, a tornado roared into Lancaster one night last April, killing three people, destroying 280 houses and damaging many more. It literally tore out the heart of the town, transforming the quaint, 19th-century Town Square into mounds of brick and glass and dirt.
Eight months later, Lancaster is finding that recovery is slow. 
 To be sure, people here say, some good has come out of the destruction. Before the tornado hit, this middle-class suburb south of Dallas, home to 22,000 people, tidy ranch houses and picturesque boutiques, was a pleasant enough place to live but not especially close-knit. Now it has been transformed by the common goal of revival.
Rick Eilers, who lost his second-floor photography studio on Town Square and is struggling to reopen, even says that in one sense "the tornado is the best thing that ever happened to Lancaster."
"We have a direction, we have a purpose," Mr. Eilers said. "We're pulling together as a community. It's the town that won't die."
But the challenge is enormous. Today, owners of fewer than one-tenth of the destroyed houses have managed to rebuild; many residents just gave up and moved elsewhere, while others did not have enough insurance to try reconstruction. A few streets are nothing more than a collection of concrete slabs. And on the town square, only a dozen of the roughly 35 stores that were there in April have reopened.
What remained of three magnificent live oaks in the center of the square has been carted away; a fourth has been cut back to a fraction of its former size and grandeur. Other trees have been slashed to stumps little taller than fire hydrants.
Thousands of tornadoes touch down in the United States every spring and summer. Typically, several dozen of them reach populated areas where they can cause major devastation.
On the damage scale, the tornado in Lancaster (residents pronounce it LANK-as-tur) did not necessarily qualify as catastrophic. As awesome as the destruction was in the tornado's path of roughly a half-mile wide and several miles long, broad sections of the city were largely untouched.
And while in the immediate panic of that twister night, one rescue official who had surveyed the damage along Elm Street had screamed at fire officials to expect up to 125 dead, the actual death toll was three. Warning sirens had given Lancaster residents a crucial few moments to head for cover in closets and bathtubs.
But for the people here, as in other communities where national attention, quickly captured, swiftly fades after misfortune, the tornado is a continuing event, an ever-present memory. And for a visitor returning to talk again to some of the people who were left stunned in the twister's aftermath, their comments are a reminder that the true cleanup of a natural disaster can take years.
Perhaps the most potent symbol of the tornado's continued impact on Lancaster is the burned rubble from destroyed houses and businesses piled high at the edge of town, near the airstrip. Eight months after the event, the pile still smolders.
"This is one of the hardest things for people to drive past; they have literally taken our town to the dump," said Jan Pruitt, the executive director of the Lancaster Outreach Center, a social-service agency that coordinates the rebuilding and recruited volunteers to construct several houses.
One resident struggling to come back is Janet (Wink) McCasland, who on April 26, the day after the tornado struck, sat amid the litter on Town Square that had been her trim brick restaurant, the Coach House. "I just have no idea where to go from here," she said at the time. "I don't know whether we can ever restore this place."
The restaurant remains padlocked and the general air of disorder has lessened only by degrees. Ms. McCasland, 48, who had no insurance on the contents, has limped along with a catering business and is still working frantically to reopen, maybe early in the new year, she hopes. But she has virtually no money left after spending roughly $20,000 on repairs and replacement, she said, and to complete the job could require at least $10,000. The experience has taught her a few raw realities.
"You have to have cash to get cash," she said, discussing her efforts to get a bank loan. "That's a fact of life."
Some other buildings on Town Square, which dates to 1854, have been restored, the original orange brick clashing with the newer red, while others remain boarded up or even in jagged disarray.
"When life deals you scraps, make a quilt!" an optimist has spray-painted on a piece of wood board that has replaced a window in one building.
Even those who have managed to rebuild their lives are still coping with bad memories. "Three months ago I started on antidepressants," said Pat Royder, a vivacious woman in a blue sequined pantsuit who reopened her clothing boutique on Town Square this fall with help from a $30,000 Small Business Administration loan. "And I'm telling you, if Pat Royder is on antidepressants, can you imagine how many other people here are on antidepressants?"
Lancaster is definitely on the way to recovery, said Ronnie Lowe, a minister at a Church of Christ church here. But, he added, "People now realize that it is going to take a long, long time to get there completely."
It is one measure of the continuing disarray that the city has not come up with a final figure on the extent of the damage: estimates start at $6 million and rise to four times that. And no one could estimate how much has been spent on rebuilding, other than to say that it is clearly much less than needed.
Still, Lancaster struggles along. On Elm Street, where house after house was destroyed, the droning of bulldozers and the high-pitched warning beep of heavy equipment fill the air.
Elizabeth Staggs spent 44 years in her house on a nearby street until it was destroyed that night as she huddled in a neighbor's home. In its place stands a new two-bedroom bungalow, thanks to the combination of a $12,000 Federal grant, supplies donated by the Outreach Center, and volunteer labor from Mr. Lowe and members of church groups.
"I'm home," said Mrs. Staggs, who is 76. "That's the main thing. I'm on the same lot. Of course the neighborhood looks completely different. But I'm home."
Even those still without homes have erected symbols of their presence. On a lot left vacant after her house was bulldozed away, for instance, Noma Byrum put up a solitary Christmas tree.
The country singers Willie Nelson and Janie Fricke gave benefit concerts last fall that raised nearly $80,000 for materials to build homes for Mrs. Staggs and others. About $175,000 in other donations have come in. The Dallas Parks Foundation donated 1,700 trees to be planted throughout the city -- live oaks, red oaks, cypress. And there is a sense that Lancaster is on the mend.
"There was real despair for awhile," Ms. Pruitt said. "We came off the immediate high of 'Thank God, we're still alive' to the low of, 'We're all alone.' Now we can see it coming back together."
Suzi Weaver, whose family owns several Town Square buildings, some needing extensive repair, added: "I believe in the town. But there are some people who have given up, said it's not worth it, taken the insurance money and gone."
As destructive as the tornado was, there were some important affirmations that people here cling to. For Mrs. Pruitt, one came as the tornado blew out the windows in their house and her children clung to her in terror. The 15-year-old, Chris, thought he was going to die, she said.
"Mom, I just want you to know something," the teen-ager said solemnly as the tornado howled. "I really do appreciate everything you've done for me."

HEADLINE: 3 Empowerment Areas Must Create a Wish List

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Having been selected as one the nation's first Federal Empowerment Zones, with $300 million in public money available for a broad spectrum of new projects and services over the next 10 years, Harlem, Washington Heights and a part of the South Bronx must now agree on a shopping list. And it may not be easy.
"Now comes the really hard part," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Democrat from Harlem who was one of the chief Congressional architects of the empowerment zone program. 
 Mr. Rangel told a group of local leaders in Harlem on Wednesday that the challenge now "is getting people in this community to read from the same page."
The empowerment zone designation, announced last Tuesday, means that the area stands to reap a huge windfall in direct government assistance at a time of fiscal cutbacks at every level of government.
While the Federal commitment under the program is $100 million, both New York City and New York State say they will match the Federal funds. The city and state pledges, made more than a year ago by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, were reiterated last week by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki.
Unlike the procedures in a succession of antipoverty programs that tried to revive the blighted neighborhoods of New York City, decisions on how the money will be spent in the new empowerment zone will be left largely to people in the zone itself, not to agencies in Washington, Albany or lower Manhattan.
Officials in the zone must abide by an outline they submitted in their application for the Federal designation. The outline included adult education; AIDS prevention and treatment; day care; job training; small business loans; cleaning up vacant lots; improvements to La Marqueta, the shopping strip along Park Avenue between 110th and 116th Streets, and jump-starting the long-delayed plan for the Harlem International Trade Center on 125th Street.
But the specifics of which programs will be financed, and with how much government money, seem certain to provoke intense competition.
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, said he would lobby aggressively for only one new program envisioned for the empowerment zone: a small-business assistance program called the One Stop Capital Shop, in which government aid would be used to provide low-income loans and counseling for entrepreneurs.
Percy E. Sutton, the Harlem broadcasting executive and former Manhattan Borough President, said his shopping list was longer. Emphasizing the need to attract high-technology business and train high-technology workers, he said the government aid should be used for a computer training center to provide the public schools with better classroom computer equipment and to create a computerized marketing system that would link business people in the zone with customers and suppliers in Africa and Latin America.
Other ideas seem certain to come from the South Bronx, where Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, had waged an unsuccessful fight to have the boundaries of the zone changed to include more of his borough. Although only a sliver of the South Bronx is included in the zone, it includes Yankee Stadium, and many officials expect aggressive efforts to steer part of the government aid to improvements in or around the stadium, particularly since the city is concerned that the Yankees may leave the area.
"Yankee Stadium is an economic generator, and that is what the program is designed for," said Donald J. Cogsville, chief executive officer of the Harlem Economic Development Corporation, the state agency in charge of applying for employment zone benefits. Nonetheless, he said, any government assistance would probably be confined to "the blocks and the people surrounding the stadium," instead of the structure itself or the Yankees organization.
Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Mr. Ferrer, said that Mr. Ferrer, while opposing any direct government aid to the stadium itself, wanted to steer some of the empowerment zone funds to the Bronx Terminal Market, a blighted retail area that separates Yankee Stadium from the Harlem River, where ferry service, new stores and parking are planned.
He said Mr. Ferrer also hoped the influx of government money would be used to help revive the Harlem Rail Yards, an abandoned industrial tract in the South Bronx near Port Morris, with new freight train service and a paper mill for waste recycling.
Under the rules of the program, details of how the money will be spent are to be left to the boards of two as-yet uncreated local development corporations -- one for Harlem and Washington Heights, with its members appointed by Mr. Rangel, and the other for the South Bronx, with its members appointed by Mr. Ferrer.
Although the local development corporations will have most authority for distributing government aid, they will report to another yet-to-be-created board. That board will include representatives from Harlem, the South Bronx, the city and the state.
Although administration of the zone is most likely to be complex, Mr. Cogsville said that most of the money would be dedicated to social service programs, not to construction projects.

HEADLINE: OPEC Rivals Curb Cartel's Impact

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 26

 BODY:
The oil production of non-OPEC nations, declining since 1988, has begun an unexpected revival this year that will continue into the next century, tempering price increases and limiting the world's dependence on the oil cartel.
Already, higher supplies from oilfields beyond OPEC's domain have helped to keep prices low despite booming demand and OPEC production quotas. 
 New technology, improved corporate efficiency and the opening to exploration of vast foreign tracts, energy experts say, promise to increase non-OPEC production 6.5 percent by 2000.
On Alaska's North Slope, new finds and modern techniques for sucking more from existing wells have kept oil flowing at rates nearly two-thirds higher than the state predicted.
In China, Vietnam and Russia, Western exploration and production crews are swarming to areas that had been long closed to foreign investment.
In the North Sea, fields thought to be entering their dotage after 25 years of pumping are producing 20 percent more oil than last year, helped by lower production costs and new discoveries.
For the first time since 1988, output from non-OPEC nations will rise this year, to about 39.1 million barrels, up 600,000 barrels from last year, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a leading consulting firm. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries itself has recently confirmed this turnaround and predicted its continuation.
"The non-OPEC production increase," Dr. Subroto, OPEC's former secretary general, said in a recent speech, "changes the rules of the game."
Though more oil comes from outside the cartel, OPEC's coordination, vast reserves and spare capacity, especially in Saudi Arabia, have given its member nations disproportionate influence. By 2007, the cartel expects to be producing a majority of the world's oil. Still, in the late 1980's, nonmembers rebuffed OPEC's suggestions to cooperate on pricing.
There are no guarantees that higher production will keep prices stable. In the United States, new oil tanker insurance standards and reformulated gasoline mandates might roil the energy markets early next year. More Russian or Middle Eastern turmoil, or especially rapid growth in global demand, could still create shortages. In the long run, the largest part of the world's increasing thirst for oil can only be met by OPEC.
But for next year, the International Energy Agency, which represents oil-consuming nations, predicts that more than half the world's increased demand of 1.1 million barrels a day will be met by producers who do not belong to OPEC.
"All this non-OPEC oil is postponing the day when OPEC will be required to fill the gap," said Robert W. Esser, a Cambridge Energy senior consultant.
The latest supply figures and prices contrast remarkably with the outlook a few years ago. The consensus of industry executives and analysts in 1990 was that oil, then $20 a barrel, would go to $30 by 1995. They cited rising worldwide demand and lagging production.
The demand has materialized, especially among developing nations. But so has new capacity. Oil prices, which rose above $36 a 42-gallon barrel in 1981, have recently been less than half that because of increased supplies.
Oil companies have more than accommodated themselves to high production at low prices. "I don't think there's any question that the industry is learning to do things, like deepwater drilling, at $17 a barrel and $2 a cubic foot, that couldn't be done two or three years ago," said H. Laurance Fuller, Amoco's chief executive, referring to today's low oil and natural gas prices. "When life is tough you find ways to do things better."
Although most of the technological advances and foreign ventures are known, their combined impact is only now becoming clear. Even the production declines in the United States are slowing, because of new sources ranging from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Slope of Alaska.
New technology is rendering the rig count, long the most trusted guide to the domestic oil industry's health, less useful. Faster drilling and pinpoint targeting result in more discoveries and production for each drilling rig.
Twelve years ago, drilling 8,000 feet deep took 17 or 18 days. More durable drill bits have greatly reduced time spent pulling long strings of tubing to the surface, so the same depth now takes just five days.
"If we extend this trend,' joked Forrest E. Hoglund, chief executive of Enron Oil and Gas Company, in a recent speech, "by 1997 we shouldn't need a rig."
Others, however, are truly drilling without rigs. On Alaska's North Slope, Atlantic Richfield is using motorized drill bits at the end of flexible tubing to drill sidetracks to existing holes.
Newly developed North Slope fields and new drilling techniques have greatly slowed the decline in Alaska's flow. In 1988 the state predicted that daily production would fall from 2 million barrels then to 1 million by now. Current production: 1.6 million barrels a day.
Fields thought to be played out in other countries, including Venezuela, an OPEC member distant from the jittery Persian Gulf, are coming back to life with horizontal drilling and enhanced recovery techniques.
Methods for mapping underground reservoirs have improved the odds of a strike, promoting new production. What geologists call 3D-seismic technology bounces sound waves off underground formations, then uses computers to create three-dimensional pictures. These techniques help give oil companies the confidence to build billion-dollar platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.
The gulf is the leading site for deep-water production, which has been extended to 2,860 feet from 1,351 feet in the last six years. Oil companies are laying plans to bring the same technology to West Africa and South China. Using what they call directional drilling, they can sink wells miles from a platform, in much deeper water, without the cost of separate platforms.
Oil companies have also cut costs by reducing staff, making new projects more economical. Employment in the domestic oil industry has fallen by more than half in 12 years, from 920,000 to 450,000 today. Amoco's new data processing center in Tulsa, Okla., will do with 1,000 people next year what 1,800 did last year.
Lower costs and newer discoveries have allowed the North Sea to sharply increase its daily output by about 900,000 barrels, to 4.7 million, this year. In 1990, Britain predicted that its share of North Sea production would go from 1.9 million barrels then to 2.1 million now -- far short of the current rate of 2.5 million.
Other countries are giving the oil companies' capital and expertise an increasingly warm welcome. China, Vietnam, Venezuela and the former Soviet republics are only some that in recent years have been opened to foreign oil investment.
The rules governing these investments, often imposed by officials new to capitalist notions of a fair return, can be murky and changeable. Some oil companies are already disappointed by their earnings.
Still, an energy conference in Houston earlier this month, sponsored by the Arthur Andersen accounting and consulting firm, seemed like a global investment bazaar. Chinese and Vietnamese officials vied with OPEC leaders in appealing for oil company executives to help plumb their supplies.
In a speech there, even Dr. Subroto, the former OPEC leader, cited the advances of OPEC rivals while insisting that the West had to invest much more in OPEC nations to satisfy its future oil demand.
In 1990, Dr. Subroto predicted that world demand for OPEC crude oil would reach 29 million barrels a day by next year. But OPEC is now pumping only about 25 million barrels a day and plans to maintain that level in 1995.
Daily non-OPEC production of crude oil and associated liquids fell from a peak of more than 41 million barrels in 1988 to 38.5 million barrels last year, according to Cambridge Energy. Mr. Esser sees the rate returning to about 41 million barrels in 2000, then leveling off. OPEC has recently adopted almost exactly the same outlook.
Others are more optimistic. John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, sees output by OPEC rivals continuing to rise through the year 2005 for a total daily gain of about five million barrels from this year.
In the United States, the world's largest oil user and importer, increased technology and efficiency are slowing the declines in output. Since 1985, production has fallen from 10.6 million barrels a day to an estimated 8.3 million this year. Cambridge Energy predicts 7.5 million barrels a day in 2000.
Mr. Esser's challenge in predicting supplies is estimating how much more expenses will fall. "Costs are coming down so much that the minute you put a dot on a graphic," he said, "it could be wrong."

HEADLINE: Battle Over a Baby's Future Raises Hard Ethical Issues

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Ryan Nguyen was born on Oct. 27, six weeks before his due date, asphyxiated and with barely a heartbeat. His doctors at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., revived him after heroic efforts. But a few weeks later, they decided that aggressive medical care would only prolong his suffering and that he would never survive infancy. They suggested that his life support be withdrawn.
His parents refused, setting off an emotional battle over the baby's medical care. In the two months since his birth, Ryan Nguyen (pronounced win) has become a cause celebre in the Pacific Northwest. 
 On one side are Ryan's parents and their lawyer, who say the doctors at Sacred Heart were ready to allow the baby to die because his care was so expensive. On the other side are Ryan's doctors at Sacred Heart and other medical experts, who say the baby's case is hopeless because of his multiple problems, including kidney failure, bowel obstructions and brain damage.
And finally, there are the doctors at a medical center in Portland, Ore., who, reading about the baby in a newspaper, said that they were willing to treat him and that he was likely to survive. Almost immediately, Ryan was transferred to their care.
The arguments over the baby's future have evoked some of the most difficult issues in medical care: When should treatment be withdrawn? Who decides? Who should speak for a baby? And should there be limits on how much society will pay for a long shot at saving a life?
It is, ethicists and medical specialists say, a case that goes far beyond the circumstances of Ryan Nguyen's life.
Public debate on ending life has focused on the terminally ill and the elderly. This case raises the same questions, but at the start of life.
Dr. Mark Siegler, director of the MacLean Center for Clinical Ethics at the University of Chicago, said Ryan's case "summarizes some of the unsettled and unresolved difficulties in American medicine, and not just in pediatric medicine."
Dr. Siegler continued: "We thought that after 20 years of debate over end-of-life decisions that we had at least agreed on some empirical rules that would apply. But we find that when the rules are challenged, and particularly when the challenger is arguing for a pro-life decision, the guidelines tend to collapse."
He also pointed out that advance directives, living wills and claims that treatment was futile all fell by the wayside if an interested party, particularly a family member, wanted treatment to continue.
Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, asked: "If you can't say 'no' in a situation where there is permanent and apparently irreversible kidney failure, an inability to feed properly and moderate to severe brain damage -- a prognosis that is as grim as possible -- then do we have any credibility talking about rationing anything in our health care system? If you can't say 'no' here, then when would you say 'no'?"
But Dr. Randall D. Jenkins, director of pediatric nephrology at Legacy Emanuel Children's Hospital in Portland, where Ryan is being treated, disagrees. He said that although Ryan had "multiple problems," including brain damage and kidney failure, and that he most likely would need a kidney transplant, he nonetheless had "a significant chance of surviving and having a good quality life."
George Annas, a health law professor at Boston University, said that no matter how dismal a patient's outlook, "if you look hard enough, you can always find someone who will treat."
"There is no such thing as a medical standard that says you shouldn't treat," Professor Annas added, "and that's the problem. Even after we had this two-year debate about our health care system that everyone knows costs too much, we can't stop. Money's no object."
Dr. Carl Bodenstein, a neonatologist at Sacred Heart, said that for a baby as sick as Ryan, medical costs could average $2,000 a day.
Ryan's medical problems are severe, Dr. Bodenstein said. Although his kidneys produced urine, it was almost entirely water; they did not filter toxins from his blood. His intestines were blocked, and he had to be fed intravenously. And CT scans showed signs of brain damage. He also had recurrent seizures that sometimes could be controlled only if he was given three anti-epilepsy drugs, another indication of potentially severe brain damage, Dr. Bodenstein said.
For the first few weeks of Ryan's life, Dr. Bodenstein and his colleagues kept him alive by feeding him intravenously and giving him dialysis to substitute for his failed kidneys. But eventually they decided that his kidney problems made it almost certain that Ryan would die in infancy. To survive, Ryan would need to be maintained on dialysis for about two years and then have a kidney transplant. Experts in pediatric kidney disease who were consulted by Dr. Bodenstein thought it was virtually impossible to pull off that feat.
Dr. Ellis D. Avner, a professor of pediatrics and director of the kidney program at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, was one of those experts. Dr. Avner said his assessment was that "long-term dialysis would not only be inappropriate but would be immoral." He added, "It would prolong pain and agony in a child that has no likelihood of a good outcome."
Dr. Avner explained that in the best of circumstances, when a baby is born full term and has nothing wrong except failed kidneys, long-term dialysis of infants requires enormous effort by doctors, families and nurses, and still frequently fails.
It is, he said, "an often grueling and heroic effort in which we have success maybe 50 percent of the time, if that, in reaching a point where a child is large enough and healthy enough for a renal transplant." Even then, Dr. Avner said, 25 percent of those who receive transplants die.
Dr. Bodenstein and his colleagues suggested to Ryan's parents, Darla and Nghia (pronounced nee), that they stop dialysis and let Ryan die.
Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen found a lawyer, Russell Van Camp, who got a court order to keep the dialysis going while the hospital and Mr. Van Camp's wife, Teresa, a nurse, searched for a medical center that would take Ryan.
"I'm a pro-life attorney and this is pro-life, keeping the baby alive," Mr. Van Camp said in a telephone interview. "He was dying because his kidneys weren't working too good, that's all. A child is a precious gift; give him a chance."
Mr. Van Camp said that an issue in the doctors' decision to allow Ryan to die was that his parents are unemployed and on Medicaid, and that the hospital was unwilling to spend large sums of public money, especially on a baby that "doesn't have blond hair and blue eyes." Mr. Nguyen is a Vietnamese refugee, and Mrs. Nguyen is an American Indian.
Dr. Bodenstein vigorously denies those accusations.
Doctors at other major medical centers also did not want to treat Ryan, saying it would be futile. Dr. Nancy Binder, a neonatologist at Oregon Health Sciences Center, in Portland, who was consulted on the case, said she and her colleagues took it to the hospital ethics committee and determined that aggressive treatment would "involve all sorts of invasive procedures, pain and suffering, and we still couldn't see the baby eventually having a transplant and going home."
All it would mean, Dr. Binder said, was "a longer, more miserable death."
But on Dec. 13, Dr. Jenkins and his colleague at Legacy Emanuel, Dr. Patrick Lewallen, director of newborn intensive care, read about Ryan in The Portland Oregonian. They called the doctors at Sacred Heart and reviewed the case with them. And then, Dr. Lewallen said, "we sat down with our physicians and administrators and basically decided that we would take this patient."
On Dec. 16 doctors at Legacy Emanuel operated on Ryan's blocked intestines, removing several inches of bowel. "It's a moderate amount, but we have seen many babies lose that amount of bowel and survive," Dr. Lewallen said.
He added: "As medical director of a 40-bed nursery, I go in there, and Ryan is not the sickest. There are other cases that are harder. At this point, we don't have ethical issues surrounding his care."
On Sunday, Dr. Lewallen said that Ryan's condition was "guarded" and that the baby was "hanging in there." He also said that Ryan had "lots of problems but medically he's pretty darn stable."
Dr. Lewallen said he hoped that when Ryan was able to eat and get stronger, he would eventually be able to have a kidney transplant, and at that point he should have a 75 percent chance of survival.
Mrs. Nguyen, speaking in a telephone interview, said she, her husband and her 17-month-old son, Austin, plan to move to Vancouver, Wash., to be near Ryan during his expected two-month stay in the Portland hospital and yet not lose their Washington Medicaid payments.
Washington's Medicaid program has agreed to pay for Ryan's care in Oregon. But medical experts said that even Oregon's Medicaid program, which has determined not to pay for some expensive and medically debatable procedures, would also pay for Ryan. The reason is that the state considers each condition separately, and each of Ryan's medical problems by itself would qualify.
Mrs. Nguyen said Ryan was much better than the Sacred Heart doctors had told her. He does not have brain damage, she said, and "his kidneys are getting better." Mrs. Nguyen said her hope was that Ryan would "grow up to be healthy and be with his bigger brother."
Others are less sanguine.
"The real problem here is, what do you do in a life and death situation in which the absolute majority of educated, unbiased medical opinion favors death and in which, to some extent, society doesn't allow for death without going to the absolute nth degree?" Dr. Bodenstein asked. "Yes, technically, a lot of people can do a lot of things for this baby, yet a significant bulk of educated medical opinion feels it is not in this baby's interest to have death prolonged. Where do you go from there?"
And, even more troubling, Dr. Bodenstein said, is the question of why the decisions became so contentious.
"Where did this all go so wrong?" he asked. "Where did rational, civil processes with this family get lost? Where did we lose it with this family? That's the hardest part."

HEADLINE: Wall Street, No Longer Financial Epicenter, Struggles to Cling to Cachet

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Perhaps more than any other street in America, Wall Street has come to represent a concept beyond itself. As a synonym for big business, it has lent its name to movies, television shows and a national newspaper.
But these days, the large brokerage houses that once lined Wall Street and its cavernous side streets have spread far and wide in Manhattan, a reflection of how the area south of Chambers Street is no longer the dominant financial services center it once was. With aging buildings that cannot accommodate huge computers, and a declining need for financial companies to be near each other, The Street and its neighborhood are mere reminders of what they once were. 
 To combat that decline, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani this month proposed reducing taxes and changing zoning rules to revive the area. With the inducements, officials hope not only to keep the companies that are already there, but also to attract new housing and a broader diversity of business to Wall Street and the surrounding blocks of lower Manhattan.
Whether these changes will reverse the area's decline is open to debate, as downtown's ebbing fortunes may reflect deeper problems: poor public transportation to the suburbs and obsolete buildings that discourage renovation for either housing or offices.
For 25 years, New York City's investment banks and brokerage houses have been moving away from Wall Street, shifting their computers and clerical staffs to Brooklyn, New Jersey and as far away as Tampa, Fla., while headquarters and trading operations have been widely dispersed in Manhattan, from TriBeCa to the upper reaches of midtown, in Rockefeller Center.
In fact, Wall Street, with only one of the city's 20 largest brokerage houses, is one of several neighborhoods in Manhattan to cling to an undeserved cachet. Madison Avenue, still known as the center of the nation's advertising industry, retains only 2 of the city's 20 largest agencies. And of the city's 35 Broadway theaters, only 7 are on Broadway, though many are on the surrounding streets.
Many of the brokerage houses say they are committed to staying in the city, but feel they do not have to be near the stock exchange.
"We are still a community that wants to be in Manhattan, but the fact is that we don't need to be neatly geographically settled," said Robert Connor, a spokesman for Smith Barney, which was the first major firm to break from the cluster of securities companies that were around Wall Street, if not on it, in 1969. It moved that year to midtown, at the Avenue of the Americas and 54th Street.
Mr. Connor and other Wall Street executives say the need to be close to the city's stock exchanges -- and each other -- has been all but eliminated by computers, fax machines and other innovations.
In a sign that brokerage houses are willing to move to new and untested locations, Smith Barney is moving again, this time to Greenwich Street in TriBeCa, just off Franklin Street. Its move, announced a year ago, followed word in August 1993 from Morgan Stanley & Company that it had bought a headquarters in another unlikely location: at the corner of 47th and Broadway, in the glitter of Times Square.
Morgan Stanley now says it will move into the Times Square building, at 1585 Broadway, over the next six months. The move shows that if there is still a financial epicenter, it is the whole island of Manhattan, not just downtown.
"Two years ago, if I told people a securities firm was moving to Times Square, they would look at me like I was from Mars," said Martin Turchin, vice chairman at Edward S. Gordon, a commercial real estate brokerage firm that deals extensively with Wall Street clients.
Even though the firms deserting downtown are not necessarily leaving the city, the Giuliani administration feels it is necessary to give tax breaks to keep a critical mass of businesses downtown, which remains the third-largest business district in the country, behind midtown Manhattan and downtown Chicago. It also hopes that by attracting housing and a broader diversity of businesses, it would create a more vibrant, 24-hour neighborhood -- something that does not exist today.
To many urban planners and business executives, the dispersal of Wall Street has actually been a vote of confidence in New York City. Although it has become routine for securities companies to threaten to leave the city, thereby extracting lucrative long-term tax breaks from City Hall, no major firm has moved its headquarters or principal trading operations outside Manhattan, although many have moved their computers and data processing out.
To be sure, Wall Street retains the symbol of finance, the New York Stock Exchange (its front entrance is on Broad Street, but there is a side door on Wall Street). And the street remains home to several well-known brokerage houses that do not rank among the city's largest, including Gruntal & Company and D.H. Blair & Company.
Morgan Guaranty Trust, one of the nation's largest banks, built a new headquarters on Wall Street in the late 1980's, and operates a stock and bond trading subsidiary, J.P. Securities, from the same building, at 60 Wall Street. But for most of the blocks south of Chambers Street, including Wall Street, the flight of major brokerage houses and investment banks has left the neighborhood burdened by old office buildings, with nearly a quarter of their space vacant, and with their prospects of luring tenants undermined by small floors, poor ventilation and wiring, and outdated architecture.
"Modern technology has reduced the premium that companies are prepared to pay to be in immediate proximity to the New York Stock Exchange," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the newly formed Alliance for Downtown New York, the nation's largest business improvement district. Its members, all private lower Manhattan property owners, have agreed to contribute $8.6 million a year to upgrade the neighborhood's streets, improve public transportation and attract a greater variety of business and housing.
"We cannot rely on one industry to sustain any part of the city," said Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Development, who was one of the chief architects of the incentive package.
Mayor Giuliani's plan to attract more diverse business includes proposals for express taxi lanes and new bus routes from midtown Manhattan, and even envisions express train service for suburban commuters, linking the neighborhood to Grand Central Terminal and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn.
Ms. Reiter said a top priority remains keeping lower Manhattan's brokerage firms and investment banking companies in the area.
"Those that remain are looking to move out, and finding suitable space in midtown Manhattan is becoming a problem," she said. "Unless we do something to turn lower Manhattan around, they may be lost."
Experts say the decline of Wall Street can be traced to the years following the stock market crash of 1929, particularly 1933, when Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, requiring the powerful Wall Street banks created by J. P. Morgan and other financiers to stop trading in stocks and bonds. The separation of banks and brokerage houses remained largely intact until the 1980's, when Morgan Guaranty Trust and a handful of other large banks seized on provisions in Federal law that enabled them to re-enter the brokerage business.
During the 1930's, the old-line Wall Street banks were forced to surrender their brokerage business to a variety of more specialized trading and investment companies, which often took space nearby in lower Manhattan.
For these businesses, the biggest period of growth -- and movement away from the blocks surrounding Wall Street -- came from the mid-1960's to the late 1980's. In those years, a huge expansion of international business, waves of corporate mergers and acquisitions, and soaring increases in stock trading volume combined with new computer technology to prompt a search for new, larger and more modern office buildings.
The main lower Manhattan destinations became the World Trade Center, constructed between 1962 and 1977, where Dean Witter and Salomon Brothers are based, and the World Financial Center, built between 1985 and 1988, where four major firms, including Merrill Lynch, are based.
Seven of the biggest brokerage houses moved to headquarters in midtown Manhattan, where they remain. They include Paine Webber, on the Avenue of the Americas off 49th Street; Bear, Stearns, at Park Avenue and 45th Street, and Lazard Freres, in Rockefeller Center.
Jeffrey Schaefer, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, said the dispersal of the major securities companies was in part an attempt to find more prestigious locations that were easier for their employees and clients to reach from the New York suburbs and the region's airports.
Now, while they still need larger and more modern buildings than can be found on the blocks around Wall Street, he said the priority of many of the securities companies is to find the best deals they can strike on corporate real estate, with few reservations about moving off the beaten path in Manhattan.
"Firms need to consolidate their operations under one roof, but they don't need to be closely linked to other firms," Mr. Schaefer said. "They are driven by economics."

CUOMO STILL AN ENIGMA AFTER 12 YEARS
 When Governor Cuomo steps down after 12 years on Saturday, he will bring to an end one of the lengthiest and most celebrated governorships in recent history. Almost as soon as he was elected, Mr. Cuomo was a national figure. He was twice a shadow candidate for President and was regarded by many as the most inspiring speaker in contemporary politics. Yet despite these achievements, there hovers about Mr. Cuomo the sense, predicted so long ago in his diary, that he has disappointed many. A1.
 
A DAY TO SHOP FOR THE SHEER THRILL OF IT
 As much as yesterday might have been proclaimed a holiday of rest, throngs of happily incorrigible people paid tribute to it as the first shopping day of the rest of their lives.

HEADLINE: Casualty of the Peso: Investor Confidence

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 26

 BODY:
As the dust settles from Mexico's worst economic breakdown in more than a decade, it is becoming clear that the Government's desperate actions last week in floating the peso may have devalued investor confidence even more than they devalued the currency, making the recovery of trust essential to Mexico's rebuilding.
More than any other emerging nation, Mexico has depended on the confidence of foreign investors to finance much of its economic activity. Foreigners, particularly those from the United States, buy nearly 40 percent of Mexican treasury notes and account for almost 30 percent of the stock market's capitalization. 
 "Mexico is unique in the magnitude of its dependence on short-term foreign capital," said Lacey Gallagher, a Mexico analyst at Standard & Poor's, which on Friday lowered its ratings on the Mexican Government peso-denominated notes and said it would closely watch the country's foreign debt. "There is no other emerging market in which foreign investors hold as much local currency and short-term Government debt as they do in Mexico."
After losing about 30 percent of its value during what is already being called Mexico's "Christmas crisis," the peso appeared to have calmed down somewhat on Friday. However today, the peso fell to a rate of 5.075 to the dollar, compared with 4.7 late Friday. On the Mexican stock exchange, the Bolsa index rose 0.04 percent, to 2,342.79.
Many investors said they were wary of putting too much faith in the Government's overall economic program or the specifics of its hastily arranged recovery plan.
The investors said they wanted to see how officials would pick up the pieces and move forward on the lower-inflation path that Mexico has followed for six years. But the crisis has left all the Government's economic targets and policies suspect.
Analysts say the previously announced projections of 4 percent economic growth and 4 percent inflation are unrealistic, and officials acknowledge that they have no idea what will happen next year.
Government pledges to freeze prices throughout the country, even as airlines and small stores are already raising them, are considered unenforceable. The Government says that wages will not be allowed to rise, but Mexican union leaders insist they will. The Government promises that personal savings, now almost nonexistent, will increase, but with some mortgage rates climbing as high as 50 percent, few analysts think that Mexicans will have much to save.
"The Government is totally missing the point," said Claudio Brocado, director of research at the New York City office of Valores Finamex, a Mexican brokerage firm. "The major wild card in what happens to Mexico next year is investor confidence, but I don't think they understand what they've done to lose that confidence. It's not going to be an easy thing to regain."
The core of the problem is not so much the decision to devalue the peso, but the tactics used.
A number of investors and economists have argued for some time that the peso had to be devalued, and many expect last week's moves to reduce Mexico's damaging trade imbalance substantially. But their confidence was shaken by the way the three-week-old Government of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon handled the affair. And they worried about Mexico's resolve to stay the course that had lured so many foreigners to invest here.
After 1987, Mexico moved to quickly open its economy, and formerly restricted imports flooded in so fast that the nation built up a staggering imbalance of imports over exports. That trade deficit grew to $23 billion in 1993 from $4 billion in 1987 and was, before the devaluation, expected to total $30 billion next year.
With domestic savings very low, the only way to cover the imbalance was with foreign money, usually raised through the sale of treasury notes and bonds. To entice foreign investors, Mexico took the bold step of guaranteeing that its peso would not be abruptly devalued and backed it up with a rigidly controlled trading range. The Government pledged to buy pesos if the peso slipped outside that range.
The glue holding it all together was the confidence that the Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had worked hard to build. His Finance Minister, Pedro Aspe, was a distinguished aristocrat who proved to be an effective salesman of Mexico's new maturity. Mr. Aspe developed a network of contacts with important New York investment bankers and money-fund managers, who were consulted before any significant shift in economic policy.
The peso's trading band worked well until this year, when investor confidence was sorely tested. Mexico experienced several political shocks, beginning with the uprising in Chiapas state that started on Jan. 1. Then came assassinations of two major political figures, high-visibility kidnappings and Machiavellian political intrigue leading up to the Aug. 21 presidential election.
Over the year, the stock exchange has lost 43 percent of its dollar value, Baring Securities calculated, and even before the "Christmas crisis," the peso had depreciated about 11 percent. Beyond all that, even more fundamental financial changes were taking place.
Starting in February with the first of several interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the United States, investors began to switch money from Mexico and other emerging markets back into the United States. As Mexico's trade deficit ballooned, it became increasingly clear to some analysts -- and acknowledged by a few outspoken members of the Government -- that the deficit could not be financed and the peso's value could not be maintained.
By September, when President-elect Zedillo was assembling his Cabinet and preparing to approve the periodic renewal of a complex pact between Government, business and labor that sets the value of the peso, and has been the centerpiece of the inflation battle, high-ranking economists in the administration were pushing for a controlled devaluation.
An official who was involved said the Government considered temporarily widening the trading band, which would have allowed the peso to settle at a more natural level. After a few weeks or months, they intended to reimpose the previous restrictions.
But President Salinas felt that to have done so would have sent a signal of no confidence in Mr. Aspe, who had consistently denied the need for any devaluation. So the Government-business-labor pact was signed on Sept. 24 with the exchange-rate policy unchanged.
Then, on Dec. 19, came news of a new rebel offensive in Chiapas, which led to a run on the peso and backed the Government into a corner. Even though the reports of violence were exaggerated, the central bank was forced to intervene to protect the peso's value against speculation, lowering its reserves to a dangerous level. When the bank warned that it could no longer defend the peso, the Government was forced to let it float freely against the dollar for the first time since 1987.
In New York, bankers who were used to getting through directly to Mr. Aspe found that the new Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, who had announced the devaluation on television, would not return their calls.
In the last week, Mr. Zedillo's administration appears to have been chastened. Mr. Serra acknowledged that he handled the situation badly and flew to New York on Thursday, for what turned out to be a hostile meeting with investment bankers. Mr. Zedillo said Friday that Mexico was living through a crisis that would test his abilities.
"In the end, you've got to ask whether this is a matter of the credibility of the country or the credibility of the currency," said Eduardo Cepeda, managing director of J. P. Morgan here. "Frankly, I don't think these guys deserve to lose all the credibility they've built up over the years. What happened is the end of parity, not the end of Mexico."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
At Year's End, Revisiting Five Towns Left in Limbo

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves

 BODY:
AT year's end, time to update some 1994 Our Towns columns:
In March, Our Towns chronicled the story of Mariko Westbrook of Newark, who boarded a bus after a post-Christmas downtown shopping trip, but never made it home. She had suggested to a woman with a little girl seated near her that the child looked uncomfortably bundled. The woman beat Mrs. Westbrook about the face and kicked her off the bus with such force that she landed on her head, lapsed into a coma and died four days later. 
 Almost a year after her death, no arrests have been made. The description of Mrs. Westbrook's killer -- a tall, 200-pound young black woman -- has yielded some tips, all dead ends. Mrs. Westbrook's son, Peter, said he and his sister are in constant contact with Newark detectives. But the lead detective on the case has retired. Calls always bring the same reply: no break yet. "It's like it's a dead issue," Mr. Westbrook said. He plans to meet this week with a citizens' anti-violence group that offered to help with the case.
The Avon, Conn., police department made the news last spring, when its first and only black officer, Alvin Schwapp, sued both the department and the town for racial discrimination. Now, more trouble.
Among the claims in Mr. Schwapp's $15 million lawsuit is that Avon officers were directed to stop black and Hispanic motorists passing through from Hartford on the way to a park and reservoir in Barkhamsted. While the N.A.A.C.P., the State Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and the F.B.I. started their own investigations, Avon's police chief appointed three veteran sergeants to conduct an internal probe. In September, the sergeants finished a report that concluded there is indeed racial bias in the Avon Police Department.
Officer Schwapp had a basis for his complaints, the report said. The Barkhamsted Express, the practice of stopping black and Hispanic motorists passing through town on Route 44, exists.
The sergeants' findings weren't revealed until last month, when they filed a $1 million lawsuit of their own against the town and the department. Their suit claims the police chief, James A. Martino Jr., refused to accept their findings and threatened to fire them if they did not alter the report to his ends. Town officials say Chief Martino has turned the matter over to the state's attorney for an independent review.
REMEMBER the poor, beleaguered Elmsford Animal Shelter? One of the rare animal shelters that refuses to kill dogs or cats or turn them away, the Elmsford Animal Shelter has crammed up to 450 animals on a third of an acre in Westchester County. As it waited and waited for funds for a bigger, better space, it has faced run-ins with local health officials and complaints from neighbors about noise and odors.
Now the good news: the shelter is moving. Its new digs, a 25,000-square-foot building on almost five acres, will be ready for animals in about two weeks, said Mimi Stone, the director. By March, the shelter, which will comfortably house 1,000 animals, should be fully operational and ready for animal-loving guests.
Sabatini's Restaurant, on a prime corner of Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, is staying put, for now. That's the 30-year-old family restaurant that the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment and Economic Development Commission is planning to claim under eminent domain so that Trump Plaza can expand. The Sabatinis have been fighting to keep their restaurant for more than a year. Since the fall, they've had to break in a new lawyer. Their first lawyer happened to have worked for Trump, and Trump's lawyers successfully challenged his representation as a conflict of interest.
The family also recently heard that Donald Trump claimed to have made them a buyout offer of $2.5 million. They say they were never approached. They go to court in January, when a judge will rule whether the casino commission is entitled to seize the property. Both sides plan to appeal if the decision doesn't go the way they want.
THE first "Our Towns" of the year visited Bill and Jane Schneider, sole residents of the Sullivan County, N.Y., hamlet of Mongaup. The Schneiders had refused to move when the rest of their neighbors agreed to a buyout from Orange and Rockland Utilities, which operates the Rio Dam hydroelectric plant above their house.
Officials from the utility had told residents of Mongaup that because of a change in Federal regulations and the possibility of a flood, they would do well to leave. The Schneiders stayed when they found out that there was no change in Federal regulations. Besides, there had never been a flood in the 30 years they lived there.
The State Attorney General's office, which has been investigating Orange and Rockland officials, is also looking into the utility's reasons for buying out Mongaup. Only Mrs. Schneider and a son lives there now. In August, during his morning bicycle ride along the winding paths near home, Bill Schneider had a heart attack and died. Mrs. Schneider said he had a lovely funeral. Just about everyone in the town of Lumberland showed up, including all their old neighbors in what was once the hamlet of Mongaup.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Heads for North Korea to Seek Release of Copter Pilot

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The United States has sent a senior diplomat to North Korea in hopes of speeding the release of a captured American helicopter pilot, the State Department said Monday in Washington.
The trip, being arranged in response to an request received in Washington early Monday from North Korea, raises the prospects that Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, whose helicopter crossed into North Korean territory on Dec. 17, would soon be freed. 
 But in a seemingly contradictory move, North Korea also issued a blistering attack on the United States about the same time, accusing Mr. Hall of being on an espionage mission and suggesting that North Korea was not yet ready to free the pilot.
"In view of the seriousness of the incident, we cannot but investigate the truth of the incident more deeply" the Government-controlled Korean Central News Agency said in a statement issued Monday, Washington time. It said the North Korean armed forces "will never pardon anyone who intrudes into their land, sea and sky even 0.001 millimeter."
The two events, coming after days in which there was little movement on the issue, left Washington "hopeful" but cautious, according to one United States official. He said that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard was being sent to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, because the North Korean mission to the United Nations had suggested this would "facilitate the resolution" of the situation.
"The wisest thing to do is very carefully and deliberately pursue the diplomacy that was suggested by North Korea," another senior State Department official said. He said the broadside issued by North Korea "does not change the Hubbard mission."
Mr. Hall, who was based in South Korea, has been held by North Korea since his two-person Army helicopter crossed over the North-South border on Dec. 17 and was either shot down or crashed. His co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, was killed in the incident and his body was returned to the United States last week.
United States officials, who had been hoping Mr. Hall would be freed by Christmas, have repeatedly warned that failure to free the pilot would endanger the progress that has been made in improving relations between North Korea and the United States since the two nations signed an agreement in October that aims to curb North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program.
Mr. Hubbard left by military plane Monday afternoon in Washington and is expected to arrive in Seoul, South Korea, this evening. He is expected to cross the demilitarized zone into North Korea on Wednesday, the State Department said in a statement.
Mr. Hubbard was chosen because he is an expert on East Asia and is well-known to Pyongyang, one United States official said. Mr. Hubbard was the deputy to Robert L. Gallucci on the team that negotiated the nuclear agreement with North Korea.
On Monday, the United States and North Korea held a high-level military meeting on the border between South and North Korea. The American military based in Seoul said that "no substantive progress" toward freeing Mr. Hall was made in that meeting, but some officials said it was encouraging nonetheless that generals from both sides were engaged in dialogue.
The United States has maintained that the pilots were on a routine training and orientation flight and that they strayed across the border by accident because a navigational error.
In Washington Monday, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States "categorically rejects the unfounded accusation" that the helicopter was on an espionage mission.
"At this point, it is fundamentally important that the D.P.R.K. promptly release Chief Warrant Officer Hall, who has been held for nine days now and who is responsible for nothing more than an inadvertent error," she said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
It is unclear what North Korea was trying to accomplish by the seemingly contradictory moves today. One theory that has been advanced recently is that there is a split between the Foreign Ministry, which is more interested in improving relations with the United States, and the military, which takes a harder line. It could also be that North Korea is trying show that it is not giving in to Washington too easily and is defending its sovereignty.

HEADLINE: Music Returns to Haiti With the Spirit of Hope

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 23

 BODY:
For two months now, ever since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned from exile, one particular song has been playing everywhere in Haiti: on the radio, in the dance clubs, on the streets, in the fields. Called "Reconciliation," it has become a symbol of the mood of hopefulness that now prevails here.
But until this week, the Phantoms, the group that wrote and sang this infectious anthem of the new, democratic Haiti, could not themselves be found anywhere in their homeland. Like the president they admire, they had been forced into exile in the United States, and recorded "Reconciliation" there during the summer, hoping that their vision of peace would actually come to pass. 
 To Haitians, therefore, the return of the Phantoms and other performers who had had to leave the country, including Boukman Eksperyans and Manno Charlemagne, is also a sign that the worst is finally over. After three years of a brutal military dictatorship that routinely used censorship and intimidation as weapons to control artistic expression, Haitian music is flowering again.
Songs and videos that were banned because of the coded political messages they contained are once again being broadcast on radio and television. Bands that could not perform in public because of assassination threats against them have resumed playing to enthusiastic audiences. Record companies that had to shut down because of an economic embargo, which meant they could no longer import tape or press compact disks, are back in business.
"The police aren't dragging people out of our shows at gunpoint any more, it's safe for us to rehearse after dark, and I've even gone two or three weeks without scanning the crowd for weapons," said Richard Morse, lead singer of the voodoo rock group Ram, which had several hit songs banned from the airwaves by the military but chose to remain in Haiti. "It's a wonderful feeling, but I almost don't believe it after the trauma we've been through."
The creative resurgence here comes at a time of heightened interest abroad in Haitian music. Several compilations of Haitian music have been released by labels in the United States that specialize in the "world beat" sound, a Ram song, "Ibo Lele," was included on the soundtrack of the movie "Philadelphia," and a Haitian band opened for the Rolling Stones at several stops on their recent "Voodoo Lounge" tour.
But for Haiti's seven million people, the restoration of free expression through music is seen as an essential part of the democracy they hope to build. In a country where three out of four people cannot read, songs are more than a form of entertainment: they are one of the principal means by which ideas and opinions about politics, society and religion are disseminated and debated.
"As a top Haitian band, we're in a position to teach Haitians what democracy is all about, what human rights and education are worth," said King Kino, lead singer of the Phantoms. "The problem in this country is one of information and how to get it to the people, and that is something we have a duty to do."
Many Haitian bands have routinely sought to play that role, and it was that habit that got them into trouble with the military authorities in the first place. For Boukman Eksperyans, things got particularly difficult after they wrote a song called "Dangerous Crossroads," which includes such lyrics as "if you're an assassin, get out of here, if you're a thief, get out of here," to protest the September 1991 overthrow of Father Aristide.
"The military never attacked us directly, but a colonel told me never to go out at night," said Theodore (Lolo) Beaubrun, founder of the group, which is named for the leader of an 18th-century rebellion against French colonialism. "There were shows we did where we felt we were near death, but nobody in Boukman was happy when we left Haiti," he said.
As a Haitian band well known abroad, Boukman Eksperyans was able to leave the country to perform pretty much at will. This year, the band had just finished a European tour when the economic embargo against the military regime was broadened to include travel restrictions on Haitians, and the group found themselves unable to enter the United States, where they were scheduled to play about 20 concerts, or to return to Haiti. On May 21, Michel Olicha Lynch, a percussionist and bass player in the group, died of meningitis in Haiti, in part, Mr. Beaubrun said, because the embargo made it difficult for him to obtain medicine he needed.
"We are not angry at anything that has happened to us, because we are people of the spirit, and we think of all of this as just another experience," Mr. Beaubrun said. "Other people suffered more, and that gives us courage to sing to our people."
Just about the only Haitian musician of note who still has not been heard from is Manno Charlemagne, a singer and composer whose fiery songs of social protest have led him to be compared with the early Bob Dylan. Mr. Charlemagne, who did not respond to requests for an interview, has visited Haiti since the dictatorship fell, but has not performed in public here, limiting himself to occasional shows in Miami, where he has been living in exile.
"Manno didn't like the American invasion," said a friend of the singer, referring to the landing of 20,000 United States troops here three months ago, which paved the way for the restoration of Father Aristide. "He does not want to have to criticize Aristide, so he is not saying anything at all."
The Phantoms, however, are eager to return to the fray and make up for lost time. Interviewed recently in Miami, where the group has a large following among Haitian exiles and Haitian-Americans, King Kino said that just the thought of returning home had inspired a new burst of creativity and enthusiasm among the band members.
"No one should have to be in exile," he said. "It's very frustrating to have a country and know you can't go there. Everyone belongs in their own country, because in a foreign country you feel like an alien from space. Everything is new and strange, and you never really get used to it."
The only positive aspect of exile, the musicians agreed, was the opportunity to expand artistically. Boukman Eksperyans spent the last few months before the fall of the military in neighboring Jamaica, recording a new album that is to be released in the United States early in 1995 and forming friendships with the reggae performers Jimmy Cliff, Ziggy Marley and Third World.
"We met a lot of great people and learned a lot about how to make records while we were there," Mr. Beaubrun said. "Those Jamaican engineers are great. We loved the sound they get for the bass and drums, and that has changed the way our music sounds."
Haitian music has always been open to foreign influences, but new records being released here reflect the increased exposure to the outside world that has taken place over the last three years. Splashes of reggae, rock and rap are now commonplace, merging with the traditional lilting beat of Haitian compas music and the heavier rhythms of voodoo in fascinating and unexpected combinations.
Many of the new records also have a strong political content, expressed through parables and allegories. The military dictatorship may be gone, and it may no longer be quite so dangerous to speak out, but musicians say they want to make sure that their audience does not become complacent.
"People may want to think everything is all right now that Aristide has returned," Mr. Beaubrun said. "But we have to go further than that, and not let the politicians divide the people again. It is really important for us to be here and feel what's going on and talk about what we feel, to awaken the people and change the system."

HEADLINE: Astronomers Debate Conflicting Answers for the Age of the Universe

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
THE axis between polar extremes in one of the most critical and fervently contested battles in science today could be said to run along the second-floor corridor of the Carnegie Observatories building here on Santa Barbara Street, one of astronomy's intellectual addresses.
The dispute is over a seemingly simple number, the long-sought value for the Hubble constant, that would establish the expansion rate of the universe and enable cosmologists to calculate the billions of years that have elapsed since the beginning of space and time. Depending on the outcome, important theories may totter and require revision. But when reputable scientists doing excellent research find themselves getting dramatically different but defensible answers, no one can be sure who is right. 
 At one end of the Carnegie corridor is the office of Dr. Wendy L. Freedman, leader of an international team of astronomers that used the Hubble Space Telescope to get the most precise measurement yet of the distance between Earth and a far-off galaxy. From this they derived a high value for the Hubble constant and thus a relatively young age for the universe of between 8 billion and 12 billion years.
When the results were announced in October, Dr. Freedman and her team cautioned that it was premature to believe that the problem of determining the Hubble constant had been solved. "It has not," they asserted, noting that reliable distances to many more galaxies would be needed to confirm the high value. Still, with other scientists using different techniques and arriving at similar results, there is a growing impression that the battle may soon be won by the young-universe forces.
Down the corridor is the foremost defender of a low Hubble constant and so of a much more slowly expanding and older universe of perhaps 15 billion to 20 billion years. He is Dr. Allan R. Sandage, who learned his astronomy under the great Edwin P. Hubble, the orbiting telescope's namesake. Hubble was the astronomer who in 1929 discovered that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions, thereby kicking off the search for the elusive number for that expansion rate.
Dr. Sandage has spent his career trying to clock the expansion, regularly getting a low number, and is by no means ready to concede defeat. Complaining of a kind of bandwagon effect favoring his opposition, he recently offered other astronomers some wry advice he had read in Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot," which was, he said, "Don't cross the river until you find the bridge."
Dr. Sandage pointed to what he said were subtle biases in the selection of targets for the recent distance measurements that could have tilted the results toward the higher values being reported for the Hubble constant. Early next year, he and Dr. David Branch, an astronomer at the University of Oklahoma, plan to report Hubble telescope observations of two exploding stars, or supernovas, of the type Dr. Sandage has relied on for his measurements giving the low values.
"We've seen nothing in these experiments that change our early results or our position," he said.
The spirited conflict over the age of the universe is only part of the ferment throughout astronomy, the welcomed consequence of major advances in ways of investigating the depths of the universe.
"We are in an extraordinarily exciting period for astronomy," said Dr. Vera C. Rubin, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution in Washington. "Any confusion we are experiencing is just because so much is being learned so fast."
New instruments in astronomy are usually designed to create new possibilities for discovery, whether because they see farther or exploit different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Hubble telescope, perched above the cloying atmosphere that for centuries has clouded humankind's view of the heavens, has made so many new discoveries in its first year of full operation that it is in danger of creating a revolution.
Since astronauts corrected its flawed optics a year ago, findings by the Hubble telescope in Earth's orbit have charged astronomy's atmosphere with surging excitement. Expectations among astronomers were never higher that they may at last be close to answering some truly cosmic questions about the origin, evolution and fate of the universe. A rush of spectacular pictures has both confirmed and confounded scientific thinking.
The telescope has provided the most definitive evidence yet for the existence at the core of a galaxy of a dense gravitational mass called a black hole. It photographed a dust cloud that could be giving birth to planets. It also took pictures of surprisingly mature galaxies from the time when the universe was only one-tenth its present age and discovered that there are apparently too few dim stars to account for much of the "missing mass" of the universe.
But one of the telescope's primary objectives was to find the value of the Hubble constant, one of the essential numbers required to explain so much about the universe -- its age, expansion rate and destiny, whether it will expand forever, reach some equilibrium or eventually collapse in what is called the Big Crunch. Progress is stalled for the moment, however, because of the conflicting distance measurements being produced by the Hubble telescope and other instruments.
As much as they want the matter resolved, scientists accept the disagreement as another example of science at work and count on a resolution in a few years, if not sooner.
"It's a common occurrence in a forefront area of science, where the questions are tough and the measurements extremely difficult," said Dr. David N. Schramm, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. "You have different groups using different methods and they get different answers. You see it all the time, and the public rarely notices. But when it happens to be in cosmology, it makes headlines."
The persistence of the disagreement does worry scientists that somehow they are overlooking some subtle mistakes in their observations or calculations, or else that their understanding of the cosmos is limited in some unrecognized but fundamental respect.
Theorists, in particular, are concerned and busily trying to reshape their ideas to conform to either a young or old universe. It would make their lives easier if Dr. Sandage proved to be correct, for there should then be ample time for cosmic evolution under the simplest Big Bang models. But if Dr. Freedman's group should prevail, the standard theory would have to be modified, and theorists are already pondering such fixes as an idea postulated by Einstein but later discarded, which is that a repulsive force known as the cosmological constant is accelerating cosmic expansion.
Although arguments over high and low Hubble constants and young and old universes have been raging for two decades, they came into sharper focus with the observations by Dr. Freedman's group. The Hubble telescope was able to detect Cepheid stars in the M100 spiral galaxy out in the distant Virgo Cluster. Astronomers have long established a correlation between the pulsations of these stars and their absolute brightness. This makes them excellent "standard candles," objects of known intrinsic brightness so that their distances can be estimated by comparing their observed brightness with the known intrinsic brightness. The more distant a galaxy is from gravitational perturbations of the Milky Way, scientists think, the more reliable it should be as an indicator of the expansion rate.
In the first definitive observations of Cepheids that far away, the Hubble data indicated that M100 galaxy is about 56 million light-years from Earth. By combining this number with the galaxy's recession velocity, a much easier number to obtain, Dr. Freedman and her colleagues inferred a value for the Hubble constant of 80 plus or minus 11 miles per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years). Depending on the density of matter in the universe, this puts the date of the Big Bang between 8 billion and 12 billion years ago.
Other astronomers praised the complex analysis and could find no obvious errors. They noted that the exact position of the galaxy in the Virgo Cluster was not determined, which could affect the results, but Dr. Freedman's team said it had taken that into account in assigning a wide margin of error to the estimate. But one aspect gave everyone pause. The new findings made it appear that the universe was younger than the oldest stars, which have been estimated at 14 billion to 16 billion years old.
Perhaps these stellar ages are wrong. In recent weeks, scientists have busily checked their figures and found, Dr. Schramm said, the age for the oldest stars of 14 billion, plus or minus 2 billion, is a "pretty robust number." The estimates are based on an understanding of nuclear physics and the rate at which hydrogen converts to helium in stars. Even the 12 billion age, Dr. Schramm cautioned, involved "bending over backwards with assumptions."
By resorting to versions of Einstein's old cosmological constant, theorists were testing ways of explaining how the cosmic expansion might have been slower in an earlier epoch, allowing more time for the evolution of stars and galaxies. The influence of an energy force of unknown nature could have speeded up cosmic expansion by now. This means that the true age of the universe might be greater than indicated by the present expansion rate.
Such theoretical contortions may not be necessary, if Dr. Sandage is right. He has raised at least two procedural objections to the high Hubble Constant values.
The high numbers, he contended, are derived by astronomers who use a higher estimate for the velocity of the Virgo Cluster's core, independent of local motions. Only a small reduction in that estimate, which he said was justifiable, "removes this one source of the difference between our results and others," he said.
Dr. Sandage has also argued that in many recent experiments using Cepheids and other targets, the selection of only the brightest known objects in the class being examined introduced a bias that had a "pernicious effect" on the results.
But one of Dr. Sandage's own experimental assumptions is also being challenged.
In recent years, Dr. Sandage's targets of choice for distance measurements have been type Ia supernovas, exploding stars whose light is assumed to reach the same maximum brightness. Used as a standard candle, these objects have consistently given Dr. Sandage and his collaborators Hubble Constants of about 50.
But Dr. Mark M. Phillips, an astronomer at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, recently found that not all Type Ia supernovas have the same brightness characteristics. Astronomers complain that Dr. Sandage has yet to correct his data to reflect this particular behavior.
In a study to be published next week in Astrophysical Journal Letters, Dr. Robert P. Kirshner and his colleagues at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., report that they got a Hubble Constant of 55 when they used the same supernova method as Dr. Sandage's. But when they corrected the data for the brightness variation, the constant rose to 67, give or take 7.
Nearly all astronomers agree that no definitive answer has yet been reached.
Dr. Peter L. Galison, a historian of science at Harvard and author of "How Experiments End" (University of Chicago Press, 1987), said such disputes in science generally are resolved sooner or later. New tests or a whole new generation of experiments could prove decisive. Another possible outcome could be that the immediate partisans in the battle may never agree, but the weight of evidence so favors one side that the rest of science eventually accepts it.
In some of the classic conflicts of the past, the historian said, disagreement persisted because scientists failed to recognize statistical errors or background effects distorting the data. "In cases of enormously delicate measurements involving strong theoretical expectations," he said, "often scientists may stop looking for background effects when they get the result they are expecting."
Dr. Michael Pierce, an astronomer at Indiana University in Bloomington, thinks the issue would have been settled by now in favor of the high number if the theoretical implications were not so troubling.
Dr. Schramm of the University of Chicago said a resolution might come in the next 5 to 10 years, "without having to wait for the principals to die." His remark recalled an observation by Max Planck, the originator of quantum theory, who proclaimed that old ideas in science die only with those who hold them.
Dr. Kirshner said, "I don't think it's going to be resolved in a sudden stroke." But he believes agreement could come in two to three years.
Several new tests are being tried, and if their findings begin to converge on a particular number, high or low, then astronomers may be satisfied that they have the answer. If the numbers still diverge widely and persistently, scientists may have to concede that even in this time of breathtaking astronomical discoveries, some things like the age of the universe remain for now beyond human understanding.

HEADLINE: Italian Coalition Didn't Fight Corruption

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Dec. 22 front-page article on the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy had a misleading subheading: "Fall of a Coalition Formed to Fight Corruption." 
 For whatever reason the coalition was formed, it never fought corruption. It only fought the magistrates who were fighting corruption, the so-called Mani Pulite (clean hands) pool, until it succeeded in forcing the resignation of their leader, Antonio DiPietro, who was investigating corruption in Mr. Berlusconi's own economic empire.
The Government also did very little to deliver on its other electoral promises, which would have been very hard, as they were mostly contradictory promises -- reducing taxes and cutting the deficits, or pie in the sky, increasing employment by a million new jobs.
Instead, the Government spent most of its time advancing its own interests, such as fighting attempts to resolve the conflict of interests arising from Mr. Berlusconi's business empire, which represents a substantial fraction of Italian private wealth. It includes a private television monopoly, which he reinforced through control of public television.
Meanwhile, the Italian economy, which is my main professional concern, has been deteriorating, at least compared with other European countries, as the world financial community lost confidence in the Berlusconi Government.
The clearest evidence is the rise in the premiums investors require to risk investing in Italy, rather than in a safe country like Germany. That premium has increased from 2.5 percent at the end of the previous Ciampi Government to 5 percent on one-year maturities, more for the longer term. The resulting high interest rates are strangling the Italian economy. These are the real reasons for the Berlusconi Government's fall.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Battered Best Buy investors may need to brace for more bad news.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
THE stock of the Best Buy Company, a fast-growing consumer electronics retailer, has already fallen more than 25 percent this month after the company disclosed earnings and sales would be less than Wall Street expectations. And there's a broad view that more bad news is on the way for the company's investors.
Even at its current $29.875 a share, investors are paying 20 times estimated fiscal 1995 earnings for Best Buy. The price-earnings ratio is 12.9 at Circuit City Stores Inc.; 12.5 at the Tandy Corporation, which owns Radio Shack and Incredible Universe stores, and 11 at the Good Guys Inc. 
 And analysts suggest Best Buy could have more disappointing news in its fourth quarter, which ends Feb. 25, even though holiday shoppers are opening their wallets for consumer electronics. The problem is that Best Buy has about $100 million more in inventory than expected, most of it in televisions, according to reports issued this month by David C. Childe, who follows the stock for Johnson Rice & Company of New Orleans.
The chain expects to work through the excess inventory without markdowns, said Allen U. Lenzmeier, Best Buy's chief financial officer.
The 204-store chain, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., earned $29.5 million on $3.1 billion in sales in the first nine months of this year. Profits rose by 46 percent.
Best Buy also will have $4 million, higher than anticipated, of costs in the fourth quarter as it opens a number of new stores, Mr. Childe predicted. Best Buy has added more than 50 stores since last November.
Higher-than-budgeted opening costs in the third quarter contributed to the collapse in Best Buy's shares on Dec. 1.
Mr. Lenzmeier said the fourth-quarter costs were closer to $3 million.
"Management has remained quite guarded about providing significant additional Q4 guidance," Mr. Childe's report said. Telephone calls to him were not returned.
Edwin L. Underwood, vice president of the brokerage firm Scott & Stringfellow, is not recommending Best Buy. He predicted that rising interest rates would slow consumer spending on high-ticket items, cutting into Best Buy's sales growth: "I think it will be tougher going forward."
Terrence McEvoy, who follows Best Buy for Janney Montgomery Scott, concurred. "This is a risky investment," he said. While the company's overall business has been strong, he said, sales have shifted to lower-profit home-office equipment, which could squeeze margins.
So far, Best Buy's "growth rate has deserved a lofty multiple," he said, adding, "Whether they will generate earnings to justify that, I don't know. Make a bet on Santa Claus."
Ned Sherwood, president of ZS Fund L.P., which owns about 20 percent of Sun Television and Appliances, a 40-store chain based in Columbus, Ohio, does not want to bet. He contends Wall Street analysts focus too narrowly on same-store sales gains in evaluating consumer electronics retailers and should look at return on capital, which is dependent on profit margins.
By his analysis, which uses a return-on-capital ratio based on fiscal 1994 figures, Best Buy is the worst buy of the lot with a return of 4.5 percent. This analysis puts Sun on top, with 19 percent. Circuit City comes in at 11.5 percent and Good Guys at 5.4 percent.
"Sun, Good Guys and other regionals are getting punished because of fears over what the two major chains will do," Mr. Sherwood said. It is presumed that continued expansion by Best Buy and Circuit City would hurt growth elsewhere.

HEADLINE: With Each Fall in Peso, Tourism Bargains Rise

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
While the devaluation of the peso has caused an exodus of investment dollars from Mexico, travel agents say American tourists will be going in the opposite direction, heading to Mexico, where the dollar will now buy much more.
According to early estimates, that could make a big loser out of the Caribbean, which has been waging a vigorous advertising and marketing campaign to woo more American tourists. 
 "Mexico and the Caribbean both attract much the same clientele -- a lot of middle-class American tourists, including many repeat travelers and many very young ones," said Richard D'Ambrosio, a spokesman for Thomas Cook Travel/American Express. "They both tend to be price sensitive, so now when the dollar goes a lot further in Mexico, it's likely to siphon off a lot of business from the Caribbean."
Joann Mazzotta, executive vice president of Friendly Holidays in Lake Success, N.Y., concurs. "A lot of people figure, why not go where you get the best value for your money, and right now that's Mexico."
But for Mexicans planning vacations in the United States and elsewhere, the trips have just as suddenly become more pricey.
"We're already feeling the effects," an agent at Thomas Cook Travel in Guadalajara said yesterday. "International airline tickets are in dollars, so a $2,000 ticket that cost 7,000 pesos a few days ago now costs more than 9,000." As a result, the agent said, many clients have canceled reservations.
Price changes for travel from the United States on package tours are not expected immediately. The prices of such tours are generally set months in advance and are paid in dollars.
Before last week's devaluation, travel agencies were offering seven-day packages that ranged from a trip from New York to Cancun for $425, including hotel and round-trip air fare, to an eight-day stay in Acapulco for $479, including air fare. Caribbean prices began at $315 for three days in Jamaica to $959 for seven days in a resort that includes meals and recreation.
However, tour operators expect prices to come down in the spring if inflation in Mexico holds steady.
For the moment, lower prices are available for independent travelers making their own reservations at hotels in Mexico.
"What will be a bargain for all American tourists in Mexico," said Manny Corral, director of sales and marketing for the Ritz Carlton/Cancun, "are purchases of food and beverages, gifts, local travel and sightseeing."
Officials of the Caribbean Tourism Organization are confident they will not be hurt by the devaluation.
"We're well aware of it, but I don't see it as a big factor, at least for this winter," said Michael J. Youngman, director of marketing for the 31-member organization. "In fact, last year's cold winter got us a lot of advance bookings, and so did the Old Farmer's Almanac prediction of another cold winter."
Caribbean tourism this year is expected to rise 5 to 6 percent above last year's 13.3 million visitors, Mr. Youngman said. Fifty-two percent of the visitors are from the United States.
Three years ago, Mexican tourism officials set a goal of 10 million visitors by 1994, up from 6.4 million in 1990. But the total in 1993 rose to only 6.6 million people, who brought in more than $4 billion, according to the Ministry of Tourism. In the first six months of this year, 3.4 million visitors -- about 70 percent of them from the United States -- spent more than $2.15 billion in Mexico.
Nevertheless, even a tourism industry that hasn't lived up to expectations is important to Mexico: A recent report by Solomon Brothers noted that Mexican tourism revenues have more than doubled since 1986. It also said that tourism is the second-largest industry, after oil.
As part of its goal to increase tourism from the United States, Mexico made it easier for American tour buses to operate in Mexico.
In meetings with tour bus officials, Mexican authorities had pledged to improve the country's highways and cut its extensive red tape, including eliminating a requirement that foreigners switch to Mexican buses and use a Mexican tour operator after crossing the border.
"They've done everything they promised they would," said Jean Anderson of Anderson Travel Tours of Houston, which takes about 100 bus groups to Mexico a year. As a result, American companies bringing group tours to Mexico have increased to an estimated 150 in 1994 from 14 in 1991, according to the Mexican Tourism Office.
The issue of how much American cities will suffer from the peso's devaluation is still not certain, "The biggest tourism from Mexico is day visitors from Tijuana, most of whom come over to shop," said Dr. Charles E. Nathanson, executive director of San Diego Dialogue, a research organization of the University of California at San Diego. "But they're not coming just for price, they also shop for quality and the availability of products."
Furthermore, 40,000 Mexicans cross the border each day to work legally in Southern California, earning up to $700 million a year, about one-tenth the gross regional product of Tijuana. And more than 200,000 visits a month to San Diego from the Tijuana area are for entertainment and dinner.
"So adding up the effects of a strengthened dollar and all the purchases of Americans who shop in Tijuana," Dr. Nathanson said, "the devaluation is probably pretty good news for Tijuana."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Unlocking Oil in Canada's Tar Sands

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT McMURRAY, Alberta

 BODY:
For millions of years, crude oil has been locked within the tar sands that abound along the Athabasca River, 300 miles north of Edmonton, but until recently it looked doubtful that the estimated 300 billion barrels could be recovered economically.
Now a couple of companies representing a broad array of Canadian, American and Japanese interests have shown that such unconventional fuels can not only make money but also augment Canada's output of domestic conventional crude, which has declined over the last 20 years by 500,000 barrels a day. 
 From nothing a little longer than two decades ago, oil sands output has jumped to 390,000 barrels a day, doubling over the last 10 years alone. It now represents one-quarter of Canada's total crude oil production.
The two oil extraction operations here at Fort McMurray are run by Syncrude Canada Ltd., a consortium led by Imperial Oil Ltd. and 69 percent owned by Exxon, and Suncor Inc., which is 55 percent owned by the Sun Company of Philadelphia.
Once the operations were considered white elephants. But the costs of recovering the oil have fallen below $12 a barrel, thanks to such modern technology as computerized 240-ton dump trucks riding on rubber tires twice the height of their drivers. And both companies see their costs dropping below $10 per barrel within three to four years.
The oil, from which most of the polluting sulfur is removed, contains bitumen. This tarry substance is treated to produce a "sweet" crude that is particularly attractive for refineries that have to meet increasingly strict environmental standards. It now sells for at least $6 a barrel more than it costs to produce. The benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has been pushing up from about $18 a barrel.
"So you can see we've developed quite a margin there," says Eric P. Newell, the former Imperial refinery manager who has run the Syncrude operation since 1989.
"We have a very high volume, very long life and very low technical risk," added Mr. Newell, a 50-year-old chemical engineer. "In a low-price environment, we still make money. It's a steady, lower rate of return, like an annuity. But if the price goes up," he noted, cracking a smile, "we just print money."
Two other tar sands operations in Alberta, one run by Shell at Peace River to the west of here, and the other managed by Imperial at Cold Lake, which is southeast of here, have reported similar success.
All this oil once lay below the bed of an ancient sea. As waters dispersed, the oil rose into the sandy areas of the former sea floor, lighter hydrocarbons evaporated, leaving the heavier hydrocarbons like bitumen.
Over millions of years, nature covered the bitumen-impregnated sands with boulders, clay, gravel, and muskeg.
In the summer, the tar bubbles up. Indians used the bitumen to caulk canoes, patch teepees, and burn smudge fires to repel black flies and mosquitoes.
"During my childhood," said Katharine Govier, an Edmonton-born novelist, "there were periodic flutters of excitement in the public consciousness about tapping these sands, but no one knew exactly what that entailed, and anyway something always happened to prevent it."
Nothing prevents it now. The so-called overburden of rock and gravel is peeled off year-round in huge open-pit mining operations. The sands, frozen steel-hard at this season but gooey in summer, are dumped onto conveyer belts leading to plants where the bitumen is separated and refined. The specialists here say the extraction involves no new high-tech breakthrough that might be transferable to other geographical conditions.
"The challenge here is removing a lot of dirt," said Edythe A. Parkinson, the 46-year-old executive vice president of Suncor's Oil Sands Group. "But miners know how to do that. All you have to do is become really good at mining."
The mining operations continue 24 hours a day through summers that are short, hot and buggy and winters when temperatures can plunge to 40 below. The mining and refining operations, begun here in the late 1960's, have transformed Fort McMurray from a sleepy river town into one of the most populous communities in northern Canada.
The 40,000 inhabitants, 8,000 of whom work directly in the oil extraction operations, live in a modern community with shopping centers and a golf course. The paved road from Edmonton becomes a dirt track just beyond the Syncrude plant 25 miles north of town.
Fort McMurray benefited from the sharp rise in oil prices in the 1970's. After oil prices fell sharply in 1985, the town faced grave questions about its commercial viability.
But Suncor and Syncrude cut costs and raised productivity with some of the most heavily computerized manufacturing operations in North America.
"We've come of age," said Ms. Parkinson, who has headed Suncor's operation at Fort McMurray for three years. "We've proven to people that we can sustain and maintain a competitive source of crude oil. This is an operation that makes both sense and money,"
Suncor and Syncrude, which share some information and work together on research projects, are gearing up for expansions that will increase their production by about 20 percent over the next three to four years.
Their combined output hit a billion barrels in 1992, making the oil sands Canada's second-largest cumulative oil producer, outranked only by Alberta's Pembina field with more than 1.2 billion barrels. By 1998 the combined production at Fort McMurray is expected to exceed Pembina's.
After a large loss in 1992, Suncor, which has conventional oil and gas assets elsewhere, reported earnings for the first nine months of 1994 that jumped 70 percent over those of the corresponding period in 1993. Its shares, which are traded on the Toronto and American Stock Exchanges, have nearly doubled since they were first listed two years ago.
Syncrude, which has made money for the last 16 years, expects another good year in 1994 with earnings and cash flow within range of last year's $73 million and $255 million, respectively.
Despite Syncrude's profitability, some of its partners have been cutting back for their own reasons. Petro-Canada reduced its 17 percent holding to 12 percent in 1991 to free up cash for other parts of its business, including the $7 billion Hibernia oil rig off Newfoundland. Mocal Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Oil Company of Japan, bought the 5 percent from Petro-Canada for $132 million.
The province of Alberta, which owned a 16.74 percent stake, cut back last year by selling 5 percent to the Murphy Oil Corporation of Arkansas for $150 million. Alberta's cash-short provincial government wants to sell more and has been talking to the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan, among other enterprises.
The 300 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil that geologists believe is hidden in the Alberta tar sands exceed the 265 billion barrels estimated in Saudi Arabia. But extracting the oil in Saudi Arabia is easier and costs far less -- well below $1 a barrel.

Planet Earth's Preacher, With Canada His Pulpit

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia

 BODY:
He recycles like mad to cut his family's garbage down to one bag a month, uses refillable fountain pens, cloth handkerchiefs and reusable chopsticks, and gets around on buses, bikes and skates.
David Suzuki is the first to concede the triviality of such individual pursuits to conserve the planet's resources. But Mr. Suzuki, Canada's best-known advocate of environmental causes, says it is important to start somewhere to conserve a world threatened by unbridled economic growth -- and to live by one's beliefs. 
 "We just can't go on this way," he said in an interview in a tiny office cubicle lined with books near the University of British Columbia, where he is a professor of zoology. "We live in a finite world. Nothing can continue to increase forever. We have to pull back and let nature recover to the best of its ability."
He is not very optimistic about persuading other people to pull back to save the planet. He points to the virtual disappearance of environmental issues from the global screen after the 1992 United Nations "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro. His daughter, Severn, who was then 12, made a moving plea there for conservation for a new generation.
Mr. Suzuki says that an estimate by a friend, the Harvard biologist and entomologist Edward O. Wilson, that more money is spent in New York City bars in two weeks than on studying biodiversity for a year makes him even more dispirited.
"That shows you what our economic priorities are," said the 58-year-old Mr. Suzuki. A quarter of a century ago, he turned away from a promising career in genetics to focus on the environment. He has evolved into an icon, combining environmental crusading of an almost religious fervor with a highly successful effort to popularize science.
Such CBC television shows as "Suzuki on Science" and "The Nature of Things" (which has been seen on public television in the United States, as has his 1993 series, "The Secret of Life"), his more than 20 books and weekly columns in at least 30 newspapers have given his forest of graying tresses, laser-like gaze and goatee instant recognition in Canada.
He is not without critics. Two prominent newspapers have dropped his column. The Globe and Mail in Toronto complained about his "narrow focus." The Vancouver Sun said he had become "repetitious and boring." Even his usually admiring brother-in-law, Pieter Cullis, a biochemistry professor at the University of British Columbia, calls his environmentalism "religious zealotry."
Mr. Suzuki does not take exception to that characterization. "Yes, the issues ultimately are spiritual," he said. "They have to do with what we are, what is our place, how we were meant to live and the future of our children."
Back in 1969 his work at the University of British Columbia exploring mutations in fruit flies earned him an award as Canada's outstanding scientist under age 40. But the study of genetics itself and its link to his own bitter childhood memories drove him out of that field.
In 1942, in the national panic during World War II, his Japanese-Canadian family was stripped of its assets, split up and sent to internment camps.
After he grew up, he said, "I began to read up on the social implications of genetics, and my God! I discovered the Nazi Holocaust was fueled by geneticists, and that it was geneticists who laid the groundwork for people believing it doesn't matter whether you're born in Canada for three generations -- once a Jap, always a Jap."
The internment "seared my soul," he said.
While he was a student in the United States -- he earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1961 -- he joined the American civil rights and peace movements.
"That's when I began to develop such a rage that my first wife said to me, 'You're becoming a racist -- like you hate people because they're white,' " he said. "The rage was directed against the discrimination against blacks, and as a victim myself I identified totally with them."
Mr. Suzuki said it was a "natural step" from there into environmental advocacy.
A love of nature had been stirred by his father, Kaoru Carr Suzuki, who took him camping and fishing, teaching him how to bait a fishhook with morning grasshoppers and to stand perfectly still when a bear crossed the path.
"It became clear by the late 1960's that the major issue confronting us was planetary ecological change," he said. "The human numbers were increasing at such a rate, the consumptive demand of our species was so great that the earth was already having trouble responding."
His hope is to build environmental consciousness at the community level. He started a foundation to promote such concepts as the "ecocity," helping urban dwellers to shrink their ecological footprint, for example, by reducing the amount of garbage they create.
One Vancouver-based organization sends out women who hold the equivalent of environmental Tupperware parties to promote recycling and changes in buying habits.
Mr. Suzuki contends that women are the most committed environmentalists. "If you look at people who start environmental organizations, who become often the leaders, but also the workhorses, invariably they are women," he said.
Why? he was asked. "Women think about children," he replied. "And they think about the future."

Prices Rise For Bonds in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, and the yield on the 30-year bond fell to a three-month low in thin holiday trading.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 25/32 , to 971/32 , for a yield of 7.76 percent, down from 7.83 percent on Friday. The rates on the shorter-maturity bills were steady, and at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the discount rate declined for the third consecutive week. 
 For the second consecutive trading day, the yield on the five-year note, at 7.78 percent, was higher than the yield on the longer-term 30-year bond. Because the yields of longer-term securities are usually higher, with a greater risk of loss, that "inversion" is getting some notice.
Yet such an occurrence is not unusual when the Federal Reserve is pushing short-term interest rates higher to slow economic growth and curb inflation. When the Fed began to move short-term rates higher, as it did last February, long-term rates rose.
But as the Fed moved short-term rates even higher, investors began to become more confident that the economy would slow and inflation would subside. And because the fear of inflation drives long-term yields higher, they can fall as confidence in the Fed grows.
Traders said it was too soon to tell whether the slight inversion would last. It could be a product of light holiday trading, when movements in yields tend to be exaggerated.
Bond prices seem to get a push from the view that the economy may be slowing, though the economic data released yesterday left the outlook unclear.
Kevin W. SigRist, a corporate economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said yesterday's Johnson Redbook sales report for the third week of December showed an increase of 3.3 percent from the previous week. Sales of clothing were soft, as expected. But sales of electronics were stronger, as expected, and more than made up for the weakness in clothing, he said.
Market participants said there were reports that holiday sales in many cases had failed to live up to the high expectations of many retailers, forcing them to mark down prices during the final days of Christmas. That hurt profitability but apparently helped to move merchandise.
Some economists said the move would put the estimates of the gains in year-over-year sales at 5 to 6 percent.
While hardly the blockbuster Christmas that some had looked for against the backdrop of healthy economic growth, the holiday sales should still be adequate enough to maintain a modest increase in the report on December retail sales. That in turn will translate into growth in real consumption approaching a robust annual rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, said Greg Jones, an economist for MMS International, a market analysis and research firm.
The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence in December rose to 102.2, with the November number revised slightly lower, to 100.4, from 101.3. The level for December was the highest in four and a half years. Some economist said that those looking for signs of a faltering economy would not find any in thatnumber.
Mr. SigRist said the recent reading on consumer confidence indicated that consumer spending was still robust. "I think going into next year, consumer consumption still looks pretty healthy," he said, "although we're nearing a peak in terms of growth."
In the medium term, he said, "bonds in particular will be vulnerable to signs of stronger-than-expected economic growth."
"When everybody gets back to their desks after the holiday we may see bonds suffer a little," he said.
The decline in existing-home sales reported yesterday may have been greater than many had expected, and that buoyed early trading and encouraged some traders to cover short positions. Short-selling occurs when some market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices and keeping the difference as profit. But if prices rise, those participants must cover their short positions by buying back the securities in order to limit their losses.
Some analysts say the decline in home sales may be a sign that rising interest rates are beginning to slow the economic momentum, but continued growth in employment and income should prevent significant erosion.
Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.595	96.845	Discounted Rate	5.56%	6.24%	Coupon Yield	5.72%	6.53%	High Price	98.602	96.855	Discounted Rate	5.53%	6.22%	Coupon Yield	5.69%	6.51%	Low Price	98.592	96.845	Discounted Rate	5.57%	6.24%	Coupon Yield	5.73%	6.53%	Accepted at low price	16%	90%	Total applied for	$36,904,970	$39,316,670	Accepted	$13,008,270	$13,057,170	Noncompetitive	$1,385,979	$1,254,948

HEADLINE: Merchants Fear Fewer Sales Ahead

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Even as retailers take final markdowns as they prepare to bring in new merchandise, they worry that 1995 is shaping up as a difficult year.
The holiday selling season, which ended with a whimper on Saturday, was softer than many anticipated. And many merchants expect shoppers to suffer holiday hangovers nonetheless, when they begin receiving credit card bills next month. 
 Visa and Mastercard reported strong increases in purchases made with their credit cards. Mastercard International said it authorized 35.2 percent more transactions using American Express, Discover, Visa and Mastercard from the day after Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve, compared with the period last year. Visa's Holiday Spendtrak showed a 25.6 percent rise in purchases with Visa cards in the period compared with a year earlier.
While that might suggest some sort of retail sales strength, analysts noted that the number of stores accepting the credit cards has risen and that the transactions also reflect an increase in the use of credit cards to pay for daily expenses like groceries.
And regardless of why credit card use increased, the rise in consumer debt suggests lower spending in the months ahead.
As a result, "those number mean bigger debts and bigger payments in the upcoming months," said Michael C. Bozic, chief executive of the Hills Stores Company. "I think, unfortunately, they may be a harbinger of even slower growth in the coming year for retailers."
Mr. Bozic said sales at Hills, a chain of discount stores scattered from New England to the Mid-Atlantic states, would probably eke out a 5 percent gain for December, "but it was no picnic getting there." During the last three Decembers, Hills has averaged sales gains of 10 percent.
Retail industry analysts spent yesterday lowering estimates of fourth-quarter earnings because they expect profit margins to suffer from the panicky price-slashing that many companies adopted. Many retailers made their sales projections only after sacrificing profits to drastic markdowns.
Kimberly K. Walin, a retailing analyst at Lehman Brothers, reduced her estimates for the fourth-quarter earnings of nine retail companies, including such powerhouses as J. C. Penney, May Department Stores, Dayton Hudson and Toys "R" Us.
"While sales in the Christmas week were solid, they were not sufficiently strong for a blockbuster Christmas over all," she said.
Several retailers entered the last week of the holiday season with much slower sales than they had anticipated, but last-minute shoppers helped push up sales.
Telecheck Services Inc., a check authorization service, said the dollar amount of purchases made using checks rose 5.1 percent on a comparable-store basis between Thanksgiving and Christmas, compared with the year-earlier period.
Last week, Telecheck said that the dollar amount of purchases made using checks was up only 2.2 percent on a comparable basis for the period between the day after Thanksgiving and last Wednesday, compared with a year earlier.
"The unusually heavy surge of late spending was driven by an extra shopping day this season and the fact that Christmas Eve fell on a Saturday," said William Ford, Telecheck's economic adviser. "Those two factors helped boost a lagging shopping season up to the lower end of our retail check sales prediction."
The sluggish holiday sales confounded most retailers. Yesterday, the Conference Board, a business research group, reported that its survey of consumer confidence rose to its highest level in four years, and other indicators show that the economy is percolating along.
But while unemployment is low, income is not growing. "Despite signs that the economy is forging ahead, people aren't feeling it in their pockets," Alan M. Rifkin, a retailing analyst at Salomon Brothers, said.
Still, some retailers did well, notably those selling jewelry, consumer electronics, home decorating items, appliances and other hard goods.
"We'll be up percentage-wise in the single digits by the end of the month, and we're very pleased with that, since the beginning of the month was pretty slow," said Alan M. Zimmer, president and chief executive of Reeds Jewelers, a jewelry chain in the Southeast.
Unlike retailers that loaded up with merchandise in the expectation of robust sales, Reeds kept its inventories tidy. "We stayed pretty lean and used overnight shipments when we needed to," Mr. Zimmer said.

HEADLINE: A Rare Mix of Tenants;
Working Residents Create a New Model for Welfare Hotels

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
In the ornate lobby of the former Times Square Hotel, a remarkable cross-section of people come and go.
There's the model who used to appear in J. Crew catalogues but now suffers from AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. There's the actress who scrimps by as an extra on television shows like "Law and Order" and "One Life to Live," waiting to make it big. And there's the Vietnam veteran who has coped with depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome since the war. 
 At the Times Square, once one of New York City's most notorious welfare hotels, a social experiment of sorts is under way. The formerly homeless and the mentally ill are living together with almost an equal number of working people, neighbors in a newly restored building that used to be a neighborhood blight.
For the two nonprofit groups that provide a range of social services for the residents, the experiment at 255 West 43d Street was intended to demonstrate that single-room-occupancy hotels can be salvaged, that they can become more than just dumping grounds for people with problems. The groups saw clear, pragmatic reasons for offering many low-rent apartments to working people, as it would make it easier not only to manage the property, but also to earn the community's acceptance.
But their primary motivation was therapeutic. They knew that the mix of tenants would be healthy for their clients.
"Most of our special-needs tenants have never lived in a place where they had examples of people who got up in the morning and went to work, people whose lives functioned," said Rosanne Haggerty, executive director of Common Ground Community, a nonprofit housing and economic development organization that owns and manages the building. "To observe that, instead of having it described to you, is a really powerful thing."
Common Ground wants to repeat the model in the Prince George, a former welfare hotel that stands empty at 14 East 28th Street, near Madison Avenue. The group has preliminary financing commitments from the city and state, but must sell the idea to a community that still recalls the horrors of that once-elegant hotel's most recent incarnation.
At the Times Square -- "Hotel" was dropped from the name to reflect its new use -- some residents are obviously ill. But because the working residents and special-needs tenants are spread out on all the floors, it is hard to tell who has AIDS or a mental illness or a history of homelessness, and who does not. "We lose track," said Ms. Haggerty, referring to the 73 staff members.
Rob Skinner, a 56-year-old Vietnam veteran with chronic depression, has found residing with regular working people and going about his business without the label of mental illness liberating. "You haven't been stereotyped, so it brings out the best in you," he said, "and you strive to fit right in."
The residents who are there because they meet the income requirements, making $13,000 to $25,000 a year, witness occasionally zany, sometimes tragic behavior. But some say they get a charge out of the diversity of the tenants and could never afford such a nice studio apartment in a nonsubsidized midtown Manhattan building.
"There's just a great energy here," said Peter Zazzali, a 28-year-old actor who pays $474 a month for his studio. "There are people stricken with god-awful diseases and older, destitute folks whose issues are being dealt with. Then there are a lot of artists. It's not to say there aren't discouraging moments at times, but in general there's a positive quality to everything going on here."
Sometimes, Jennifer Ann Galvez, a 25-year-old actress, has to put up with dates whose teasing about her choice of residence verges toward ridicule. And she once rode an elevator with a woman screaming that Mussolini had been her husband.
But then, Ms. Galvez thinks of her actor friends who are doubled up in one-bedroom apartments in genteel buildings with doormen and swimming pools.
"They're temping in the daytime and waiting tables at night, and they don't have time to act," Ms. Galvez said. "With the money I'm not spending on rent, I can see Broadway shows and travel."
It was a housing concept that almost did not happen.
The Times Square Hotel, a rundown single-room-occupancy hotel and a huge source of affordable housing with 735 units, was used by New York City in the late 1980's to house hundreds of homeless families. And it was managed by Tran Dinh Truong, a notorious landlord whose Kenmore Hotel on East 23d Street was seized by Federal authorities last summer because of poor conditions there.
With stabbings, fires, drug dealing and rats all rampant in the Times Square Hotel, according to court papers, the city government took over management from Mr. Truong in 1990 and sought proposals for an economy-class tourist hotel. Its plan called for the 205 original single-room-occupancy tenants, many of them elderly and mentally ill, to live in a part of the building that was sealed off and had a separate entrance.
But Common Ground and the Center for Urban Community Services starting talking up their own plan -- a plan that did not write off the original tenants but included them -- with local officials and community leaders in the Times Square area.
Some nearby businesses initially recoiled at the prospect of adding a permanent group of mentally disabled and formerly homeless individuals, as well as people with AIDS, to a neighborhood already burdened by teen-age runaways, drug addicts and criminals. Government officials doubted that such an experiment could work on the scale of such a large building.
But, responding to the enthusiastic support of Community Board 5, Mayor David N. Dinkins approved the plan. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development contributed $28.8 million through a loan program for the purchase and renovation of the building. And Federal historic rehabilitation tax credits paid for the restoration of the lobby's elaborate gilt and cream plaster ceiling, terrazzo floors, marble stairs and original chandeliers.
Money for social services has come from a range of government agencies: the city's Division of AIDS Services, Department of Homeless Services and Department of Mental Health; the state's Department of Social Services and Office of Mental Health, and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Now, after a two-and-a-half-year gut renovation, the 15-story building's facade and interiors practically gleam. The number of units was reduced from 735 to 652 so that all the residents would have private bathrooms and 80 percent would have their own kitchens. Each floor also has a special activities room, from an art studio and a computer lab to a music rehearsal space and a weight room.
Rodney W. McCray, a former model with AIDS, was living in a boarding room without a bathroom before moving to the Times Square. "I took two friends who have really nice apartments on a tour here," he said. "They were impressed. And they're snobs."
Many early skeptics now praise the project. "It's a small miracle," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a division of the state's Urban Development Corporation. "From an economic development point of view, it has cleaned up what was a serious eyesore."
Residents who are mentally ill or who were once homeless have many opportunities to work in one of the 100 jobs in the building, whether stocking the soda vending machine two hours a week or working full time as security guards.
What has perhaps attracted the most notice from the neighborhood is the addition of a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop on the building's ground floor, at the corner of Eighth Avenue and West 43d Street -- a yuppie beacon on a stretch of blocks dominated by sex shops and scruffy souvenir outlets.
One of the assistant managers and all of the ice cream scoopers live in the building. Because Ben & Jerry's donated the $25,000 franchise to Common Ground, all profits go back into the jobs program, as well as economic development plans for the building's remaining commercial space.
The breakdown of tenants is based on a rather complex formula. There are 165 original single-room-occupancy tenants remaining. As they move out or die over the years, they will be replaced on a 50-50 basis: half of the new tenants will have low incomes, while the other half will qualify for the social services. Common Ground plans to limit the number of residents with AIDS to 50 and the number of people with mental illness to 200.
While some other projects in the city have integrated the same kinds of populations, the income ceilings are generally lower, so the working people tend to be poorer. In addition, they might make up only a fifth of the residents, Ms. Haggerty said. And the Times Square actually recruited some of the actors who work in the surrounding theater district, adding an arty sophistication to the building's makeup.
Whether Ms. Haggerty and her colleagues can pull it off again at the 13-story Prince George remains to be seen. Their first move was to change the name of the building to the Madison Square to dissociate the project from the 1980's welfare hotel.
Real estate interests and neighbors have already expressed concern. But Community Board 5 appears to have faith in Common Ground, with its housing and human services committee recently voting unanimously in favor of the plan. Anticipating community opposition, Nicholas Fish, the community board's chairman, cautioned his neighbors to have an open mind.
"We cannot allow the bad facilities to crowd out the good proposals," he said, "because we don't get many good proposals."

HEADLINE: Home Resales Declined 2.6% Last Month

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes fell in November to the lowest level in 17 months, as rising mortgage rates pushed buyers out of the market, a real estate trade group said today. The Midwest posted the only advance.
The group, the National Association of Realtors, said sales of existing single-family homes dropped 2.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.81 million, down from 3.91 million in October, when sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The November rate was the lowest since June 1993, when it was 3.7 million annually.
Home sales, while down this year, defied expectations by remaining relatively strong in the face of rising interest rates. But, with the most recent increases in interest rates, they seem to be heading down.
Surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation show that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.18 percent in November, up from 8.93 percent in October and 7.15 percent last February.
A jump from 7 percent to 9 percent adds $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage.
"We expected sales to slow down, given the direction rates have taken," said Edmund G. Woods Jr., president of the realtors' group.
Last December, the sales rate reached a new high of 4.35 million. That was two months before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to slow the economy and cool inflationary pressures.
Looking ahead, John A. Tuccillo, chief economist at the realtors' group, predicted further declines, "but nothing catastrophic."
Despite the drop in November, Mr. Woods said the pace of sales remained strong, adding that "we expect it to stay that way."
The trade group estimated that sales for all of 1994 would reach 3.97 million units, well above the 3.8 million homes sold in 1993.
The median price of an existing home was $108,100 in November, up from $107,100 in the corresponding month a year ago. The median price is the midpoint, meaning half the homes cost more and half cost less.
Sales rose 1.9 percent in November in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 1.09 million. The median price was $86,600, up from $85,500 in November 1993.
Sales were unchanged at a rate of 560,000 in the Northeast, where the median price was $134,900, down from $140,700 in November 1993.
But sales fell elsewhere, including the South, where they plunged 7.7 percent, to an annual rate of 1.32 million. Sales fell 1.2 percent in the West, to a rate of 830,000.
The median price of an existing home in the South was $94,600, down from $95,700 in the corresponding month a year earlier, and in the West it was $145,000, up from $140,400.

HEADLINE: Woman in the News;
A Disciplinarian to Shepherd Pataki's Budget: Patricia Ann Woodworth

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
When Patricia A. Woodworth was recruited as Michigan's budget director in 1991, she inherited a deficit equal to nearly 25 percent of the state budget as well as a history of Federal mandates and state court decisions that left little leeway to reduce spending. She immediately took aim at Michigan's welfare program and aggressively lobbied the Legislature to scrap relief for employable single adults -- a goal that skeptics figured she could not accomplish.
"We just eliminated it," Ms. Woodworth recalled yesterday. "Not in the first year, but we got it done in the second. At that point, one house of the Legislature was Democratic, but the Democrats went along. Public sympathy was for cutting taxes and reducing government spending and they read the writing on the wall." 
 As the new budget director for Governor-elect George E. Pataki, Ms. Woodworth will need a generous dose of public sympathy as she tackles a projected $5 billion budget deficit come January. She acknowledges that the budget gap is daunting, though proportionately smaller than the one she wrestled with in Michigan, but the challenge she will face in New York seems familiar.
"It's changing the core philosophy of government, looking at different ways of doing things, working better and smarter and with less," she said.
"I try and put myself in the position of the average taxpayer earning in the high $20,000's or low $30,000's," said Ms. Woodworth, who made $87,300 as Michigan's budget director, "and wonder if this is a dollar we should take out of their hands and put into government's." She will earn about $105,800 a year in the new post.
Ms. Woodworth, a 39-year-old classical pianist and accomplished oboe player, may be known best to her neighbors in Battle Creek and East Lansing, Mich., for her green thumb. Which also may account for her fiscally conservative budget ideology: that selective pruning helps a plant stay healthy and grow.
As budget director in Michigan and, before that, in Florida, she earned a reputation as an aggressive disciplinarian over spending.
The legacy of which Ms. Woodworth is the most proud is a computerized bookkeeping system that just began operation in Lansing. But the most notable fiscal reform with which she is associated is Michigan's decision earlier this year to raise the state sales tax to 6 percent, from 4 percent, and to triple cigarette taxes in order to virtually end the traditional dependence of local schools on property taxes.
Helped by an influx of Federal aid, she creatively contained costs and mined new revenue sources to generate cuts in taxes on property, business and income in Michigan and to propel its Republican Governor, John Engler, to prominence in the reinventing-government movement.
"This only happened because we had a Governor who was willing to set the budget direction, and a budget director who was tough enough to enforce the discipline needed," said State Representative Dan Gilmer, a Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee. "I would never want to get into a bluff poker game with Patti Woodworth."
State Senator John F. Kelly of Detroit, a Democrat who battled with Ms. Woodworth over her cuts in social services, said: "When Patti gets the directive from the Governor, she follows it to the maximum. She takes no prisoners. She's very good with numbers, but she's even better with reductions. She did some very creative work in keeping programs that should be kept and in making transfers that were difficult for opponents to block."
"I was in the trenches trying to figure out ways to humiliate them about their lack of compassion," Mr. Kelly added. "But I must admit, in retrospect three years later, the number of complaints other than by the providers was small."
Another adversary, David C. Hollister, who was chairman of the welfare budget committee in the House before being elected the Mayor of Lansing last year, said of Ms. Woodworth: "She's smart, tough -- compassionate doesn't come to mind. She's kind of a bulldog for the Governor. She's got a singular sense of purpose, which is to serve the Governor, and the rest of it, be damned."
In Michigan, Ms. Woodworth is credited with bringing representatives of the Governor and Legislature together to agree on joint economic forecasts -- a device that had been used effectively in Florida where she was Gov. Bob Martinez's chief adviser on budget, tax policy, education, environment, criminal justice and social services.
"She didn't do it by herself, but they came up with a lot of creative ways to balance the budget without raising taxes," said Robert J. Kleine, senior economist with Public Sector Consultants, a public policy group in Michigan.
Patricia Ann Woodworth was born in Cheverly, Md., Jan. 10, 1955. The daughter of an Agriculture Department lawyer and a homemaker, she was raised in the Maryland suburbs and graduated magna cum laude from the University of Maryland in 1977.
After serving as a management intern with the Social Security Administration in Washington, she held budget jobs with the Senate Finance Committee, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget, where she was a special assistant to the director, David Stockman, during the Reagan Administration.
Her husband, Dr. John Schwarz, is a Republican State Senator from Battle Creek and a practicing surgeon. They plan to commute between New York and Michigan on weekends. As to the state of the couple's own budget, Ms. Woodworth said, "suffice it to say, it's balanced."

HEADLINE: Man Indicted In Bombing On Subway

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
Edward J. Leary was indicted yesterday on charges of carrying the firebomb that injured more than 40 people on a crowded subway on Dec. 21 as part of an extortion plot to hold the city's subways ransom.
The terse, two-page grand jury indictment handed up at the close of court business last night listed one count each of attempted murder in the second degree, first-degree assault, attempted grand larceny and possession of a weapon against Mr. Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer expert. 
 Yesterday's charges were, in effect, an interim indictment required by a state penal code rule that grand jury charges must be brought soon after arrest -- in this case, within 144 hours, or exactly six days. Officials in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said they planned to bring a more detailed superseding indictment, which would probably carry more counts against the defendant.
"The investigation is continuing," said Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the District Attorney's office. "At this point, some of the victims can't even give testimony because they are still hospitalized."
Stephen J. Murphy, the lawyer for Mr. Leary, has proclaimed his client's innocence and yesterday held a news conference in a restaurant in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn with Mr. Leary's wife, Marge Schaller.
Wearing a maroon knitted cap pulled low over her head, dark sunglasses and a scarf, Ms. Schaller, a nurse, said she knew nothing of a bomb plot and believed her husband was innocent.
"No, I don't think he did it," she said, breaking into sobs at several points. "I think he's a victim. He's not the sort of person who would do something like that. He loved New York."
Mr. Leary was arrested in his hospital bed at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center burn unit around 2 A.M. on Thursday morning after police officers searching his 10-room house in suburban Scotch Plains, N.J., said they found a half-dozen pages of angry handwritten notes referring to what they said was an extortion plan.
Prosecutors said the search also turned up bomb-making instructions as well as glass jars, batteries and kitchen timers identical to those that the police say were used to build the firebomb. The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, originally said Mr. Leary would be charged with 45 counts of first-degree assault, one for each of the injured passengers.
The police say they believe the firebomb that exploded on the southbound No. 4 train on Wednesday was actually Mr. Leary's second bomb, coming less than a week after a similar device caused a fire on a subway train passing through Harlem, badly burning two teen-agers. The police at first suspected that one of the teen-agers was carrying the firebomb in her backpack.
Mr. Leary, who has third-degree burns over 40 percent of his body and is heavily sedated with morphine, is listed in critical but stable condition, awaiting two operations on his badly burned legs. Two other passengers are also listed in critical condition with extensive burns.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Peso In a Day of Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged further against the peso yesterday, while ending mixed against other currencies in very light trading.
Besides the slide of the peso, there was no significant movement elsewhere in foreign-exchange trading. Many currency dealers have already closed their books for the year, and financial markets in London, the most active center of foreign-exchange trading, were closed because of a holiday. 
 Attention focused on the peso crisis, which erupted last week when the Mexican Government abruptly scrapped a policy of defending the currency's value and allowed it trade freely against the dollar. Since then, heavy speculative selling of pesos has depressed the currency by more than a third.
The United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, Lawrence H. Summers, expressed concern about the tumbling peso yesterday, saying in a statement that "recent movements in the value of the Mexican peso have gone far beyond what can be justified by Mexican economic fundamentals." Mr. Summers also said that excessive depreciation of the currency "is in no one's interest."
The statement in itself was considered unusual and seen as an attempt to calm nervous investors, who have been witnessing the value of their peso-denominated assets wither by the day. But currency dealers said the Treasury statement had no significant effect on slowing the peso's descent.
In late New York trading, the peso fell to 5.700 pesos to the dollar from 4.700 pesos in New York on Friday. On Monday, while financial markets in New York were closed, markets in Mexico City were open, and the peso was quoted at a rate of 5.075 to the dollar.
The severity of the drop has drastically reduced the value of Mexican assets held by United States investors, and that has prompted more selling and left many currency professionals wondering when the peso will stabilize.
"That's the zillion-dollar question," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a New York currency investment firm. "People had a rude awakening in Mexico. They learned there's risk involved. I think, quite frankly, the peso drop reflects all these people running for the doors."
In other trading in New York, the dollar slipped to 1.5757 German marks from 1.5790 marks on Friday. It rose to 100.32 Japanese yen from 100.12 yen. "It was extremely quiet," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign-exchange trading at the New York office of Credit Suisse. "There's no fundamentals, no volume."
The last week of the year ordinarily is one of the slowest times for foreign-exchange dealings.

HEADLINE: MEXICAN CURRENCY RESUMES ITS FALL, OFFICIALS SILENT

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Mexico's economic crisis took a new turn for the worse today as investors dumped more of their holdings in pesos, driving the value of the Mexican currency down by nearly 10 percent more against the dollar.
Despite a brief rally late in the trading day, the peso closed at 5.70 to the dollar, or about 40 percent less than it was worth when the crisis broke out a week ago. 
 Mexican stock prices also fell, bringing demands from both Mexican executives and foreign investors that the Government explain how it would try to stabilize the economy.
Instead, for the fourth straight day, Government officials gave virtually no public indication of their plans. Spokesmen for President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon denied reports that he would speak to the nation tonight, appparently contributing to the confusion and concern.
"People this morning were hoping to see some demonstration of leadership from the Zedillo administration or from Zedillo himself, but it didn't come," said Marla Marron, a Latin American equities analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York.
The peso's continuing fall added to the huge losses -- on paper and in some cases, real -- of Americans who invested tens of billions of dollars in Mexican stocks and bonds.
It also heightened concern that at a time of considerable political tension in Mexico, the Government will have to cut spending deeply, hold down wages and raise interest rates sharply to avoid a return of runaway inflation.
The cheaper peso did make Mexico more attractive as a destination for foreign tourists [Page D1.].
Rumors persisted about what the Government might do. With the peso already well below the levels where many economists expected it to settle after the Government floated the currency last Thursday, speculators played on fears that Mexico might not be able to cover some of its short-term debts or might impose exchange-rate controls.
Despite a commitment from the United States last week to provide $6 billion in emergency credits to help Mexico cope with the depletion of its hard-currency reserves, pressure appeared to be increasing on the Clinton Administration to come to the rescue with more substantial aid.
Such a move could put the Government in the uncomfortable position of bailing out United States investors who had made considerable profits on stocks they knew to be risky. Yet a further deterioration of the Mexican economy could increase the flows to the United States of cheap Mexican exports and of undocumented migrants seeking jobs.
In Washington today, Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, said the peso had depreciated far more than was justified by the Mexican economy's condition.
"Excessive depreciation is in no one's interest," said Mr. Summers, who is the senior official involved in talks with Mexican officials.
Still, there was little sign this afternoon that his remarks had buoyed investors' confidence. Some analysts of Mexican securities predicted that even an economic-stabilization program that included deep cuts in public spending would only be persuasive if it were endorsed by the International Monetary Fund or some other pillar of international finance.
Mexican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the day's turmoil reinforced their conviction that they should not present a stabilization plan until they were certain they had a plan that would work. Two senior officials said this would not be before next Monday, although another said it might be finished Thursday or Friday.
"If we come out with any document that is not 100 percent sure and 100 percent credible, it is going to be counterproductive," a senior economic official here said. "We cannot take the risk of putting out something that is not perfect."
Such caution may reflect one of the more painful lessons learned by the economic team that took office with Mr. Zedillo at the start of the month. The Government found itself low on the dollar reserves used to support the peso when its value fell to the bottom of a range within which it was allowed to trade, so last Tuesday the Zedillo administration widened the so-called trading band, effectively letting the currency be devalued about 15 percent.
But many economic analysts said Mr. Zedillo erred in not devaluing the peso further and absorb all the pressure for an adjustment. When the currency's value quickly fell to the bottom of the new trading band, the Government was forced on Wednesday night to announce that it would eliminate the band altogether and let the peso float freely.
Part of the reason that both the peso and the Mexican stock exchange were whipsawed today, analysts said, was that the New York markets had been closed Monday. Thus, there were relatively few buyers even for what might seem like bargains next week. American mutual funds that held sizable positions in Mexican securities were also said to have begun selling shares.
"Even in this crisis, Mexicans are on vacation," said David L. Roberts, a vice president at Duff & Phelps Credit Ratings, which continued this week to rate some Mexican debt issues as investment grade. "It is the people in California and New York who are working this week who had to sell positions. All the decisions are being made by sellers."
Today, stocks fell 65.89 points on the Mexican stock exchange, to close at 2,276.90, a drop of 2.81 percent. In a sign that foreigners were instrumental in driving down the market, one of the stocks most widely held in the United States, Telefonos de Mexico, plummmeted more than 6 percent.
The analysts said investors also worried that the Government might have trouble paying off more than $5 billion worth of short-term debt, which falls due over the next six weeks and is pegged to the prevailing exchange rate. Yet because the debt is due in pesos, it is doubtful that the Government would be caught short even if the bonds were not rolled over.
The challenge that Mr. Zedillo and his advisers now face is how severe an adjustment to make. If it is too sharp, it could strangle the economy, said Nora Lustig, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But if inflation is allowed to rise quickly, it will frighten away investors, bring demands for higher wages and erode the effect of a cheaper peso in making exports more competitive.
"Until we see what they are going to do in the short run, what they are going to do in the middle run, we are in a no man's land," she said. "The irrationality in the markets is going to continue."

Players and Owners File Complaints With Labor Board

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Unable to settle their duel over baseball's economic system at the bargaining table, striking players and owners filed dual unfair-labor-practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board yesterday.
The exchange of charges is the first volley in a new phase of the four-and-a-half-month-old strike that will now continue more in legal briefs and evidentiary documents than at the bargaining table. Congress, which has indicated that it will look at baseball's antitrust exemption, and the courts are expected to join the N.L.R.B. as new playing fields before the dispute is resolved. 
 Daniel Silverman, the labor board's New York regional director, said he didn't expect the cross-charges to delay his staff's investigation of the dispute, which centers on the owners' implementation of a salary cap. Silverman said that cases generally take four to six weeks to investigate, which means the two sides should know the outcome of this initial phase in the first half of February.
"I think it won't affect adversely the timeliness of our investigation," Silverman said of the dual, or dueling, charges. "We fully anticipate that we'll be able to begin the investigation immediately and make a recommendation to the general counsel as soon as possible."
The board's general counsel, Fred Feinstein, on Silverman's recommendation, could decide to issue complaints against both sides, against only one or against neither. A hearing before an administrative law judge would follow the issuance of a complaint.
If they issue a complaint, Silverman and Feinstein also will decide if seeking an injunction in United States District Court would be appropriate. For the players, an injunction would prevent the clubs from operating under the salary cap until it was determined whether the owners' declaration of a bargaining impasse and implementation of new work rules were proper. For the owners, an injunction would require the players to return to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith.
It's not very likely that much bargaining, if any, will go on while this scenario is being played out.
Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, called the owners' charge a delaying tactic, but Chuck O'Connor, management's chief lawyer, said: "We haven't been the ones talking about litigation. We've been trying to negotiate a new agreement. I still believe this will be resolved in a room that contains a bargaining table and not in a courtroom or the halls of Congress. Unfortunately, the union is more disposed to and more comfortable in the environment of litigation and legislation, not negotiation."
The union charged that the clubs have "interfered with, restrained and coerced" players in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Specifically, the union said that the clubs have refused to bargain in good faith and should not be permitted to make changes unilaterally in the working conditions.
In a letter to Silverman, Michael Weiner, counsel to the union, asked that the board, if it decides to issue a complaint against the clubs, also seek a restraining order that would prevent them from using the salary cap as major league baseball's new economic system.
The clubs charged that the union has violated the labor act by, among other things, refusing to negotiate wages on a collective basis and instead insisting on "the individual negotiation of wages and salary arbitration." In short, the players haven't bargained in good faith, the owners said.
"Why the association, as opposed to the clubs, would have any interest in not reaching an agreement is beyond reason," Donald Fehr, the union head, said in a statement. "This move by the clubs, just like their last charge, which was dismissed by the board, is a transparent attempt to divert attention from their own misconduct."
The board last week dismissed the clubs' charge that the union violated the labor act through allegedly threatening comments made by Bobby Bonilla and John Franco aimed at striking players who might report to training camps next spring.
The board, on the other hand, issued a complaint against the clubs for their failure to make a $7.8 million payment to the players' pension and benefit plan Aug. 1. The board accused the clubs of not bargaining in good faith and scheduled a hearing before an administrative law judge March 14.
In commenting on the union's latest bad-faith bargaining charge, Fehr said, "From the beginning, the clubs have had one and only one thought in mind: forcing a salary cap upon the players."
"As the investigation proceeds," his statement continued, "we are confident the board will come to see that the clubs entered into negotiations with no intention of reaching an agreement other than upon the clubs' preconceived terms."
The clubs, at the same time, said in a news release that from the time they made their first salary-cap proposal June 14 until talks broke off last Thursday, "the union refused to negotiate over any aspect of a system that would set the wages of its members on a collective basis."
Management's goal in negotiations was to induce the players to accept 50 percent of the industry revenue, thereby establishing the clubs' labor costs before any individual contract negotiations were conducted. The clubs implemented the salary cap last Friday in a set of new work rules that also eliminated salary arbitration.
O'Connor said that baseball's "biggest cost item" is player compensation, adding, "To refuse to negotiate that, we feel, was irresponsible and we don't feel it's permissible under the labor act."
O'Connor said he hoped the two sides would return to the bargaining in the near future.
"The union has placed so much emphasis on litigation and legislation, it had to get it out of its system," he said. "I would hope we would not let the month of January go by without trying to negotiate this."

HEADLINE: Advanced Placement Exams Suffering an Erosion in Value

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d 

 BODY:
For more than 40 years, Advanced Placement tests have been a standard fixture in high school for America's ablest students. While they attended high school, the students earned college credit by taking demanding classes from art and Latin to calculus and physics.
But as the number of Advanced Placement courses -- and students taking them -- has proliferated, more and more colleges and universities are tightening the number of credits they will award to students. Some institutions have increased the minimum test score they will accept. Others are refusing to accept the credits as substitutes for college work, saying that as they have redesigned curriculums, the tests have become outdated. 
 All of this puts students like Adriana Izquierda, a 19-year-old freshman at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in an unexpected spot. During her senior year in Buffalo, Ms. Izquierda thought she had taken enough Advanced Placement courses to skip her freshman year of college and save the money. The tests cost about $72 each, or about $22 a credit, far cheaper than the actual cost of a typical college-level course.
Harvard University, which accepted her, agreed to give Ms. Izquierda credit for all her advanced placement classes, offering her 52 undergraduate credits in American history, French, German, English composition, economics, calculus and biology, and placing her in the sophomore class.
Instead, Ms. Izquierda decided to go to Hopkins, because as a pre-med student she believed it had a stronger science curriculum and more research opportunities. But Hopkins, like a small but growing number of private, competitive colleges, was unwilling to give her credit for all the courses.
After she enrolled, she learned that the university would give her only 22 credits, leaving her 2 short of the minimum 24 credits that Hopkins requires of sophomore students. That meant she started as a second-semester freshman.
"I was surprised and startled that they didn't accept more," said Ms. Izquierda, a double major in biology and history.
She plans to appeal to the economics department to accept two additional courses for 6 college credits before trying to get other departments to accept her other advanced placement work.
The changing attitudes of some institutions toward the advanced placement tests come as more students are taking the tests -- a record of nearly 400,000 in 1994. Colleges encourage this by taking the tests into consideration for admission and for merit-based scholarships. And students are increasingly encouraged by state education departments that will, in the case of South Carolina, even pay for the courses and exams because of the critical thinking skills built into the instruction of advanced placement courses, not the rote learning that still often occurs in more traditional high school courses.
But, said Kathy Christie, an analyst with the Education Commission of the States, an education research and policy organization in Denver, "if it looks like the advanced placement tests are not matching the curriculum that universities are offering or if it looks like too many students are learning by rote, then these are two good reasons for demanding higher scores or not taking the scores at all."
Not a factor, Ms. Christie said, is the financial windfall that institutions receive by having students repeat courses they took in high school. Students like Ms. Izquierda are rare, and the total population of students with advanced placement credit represents a fraction of many institutions' enrollment.
Some institutions, like Amherst College, have never accepted the credits, and this fall a faculty committee at the private, four-year liberal arts college in Amherst, Mass., voted yet again to make freshmen take the college's full course load.
"I have raised the question of why this college has this policy," said Jane Reynolds, who has been Amherst's dean of admission for six years. "I said: 'Look, we are using it as an evaluation tool. Why aren't we giving credit for these courses like our competitors?' From a consumer standpoint, I wanted to know why."
The faculty committee's response: It feels comfortable giving credit for only the work the college administers.
"I have been around the argument enough that I agree with them," said Ms. Reynolds, who added that students and families generally accept the college's position when it is explained.
Few college administrators and professors question the rigor of the advanced placement tests, which were written for the College Board by the Educational Testing Service, the Princeton, N.J., testing and education research company that also administers the Scholastic Assessment Test, the Graduate Record Examination and other tests used for college admissions.
Advanced placement classes and the subsequent exams, first introduced in 1953, now cover 16 subjects and 29 tests under a broad program that continues to grow. In the 1996-97 academic year, statistics and environmental science will be added to the courses and test offerings, which attracted a record 400,000 high school students this year, some taking several tests. Students passed a record 361,125 of the nearly 600,000 tests administered in 1994.
The test includes multiple-choice questions, writing essays and reading long passages that encourage the use of critical thinking skills. The tests -- which are graded on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score and 3 passing -- have been popular methods for years to reduce tuition costs for students and parents. At minimum, a student could save a few hundred dollars to several thousand in his first year of college, depending on the number of tests he passed and his institution's tuition.
Although most institutions still accept advanced placement credits as suitable substitutes for college work, the explosion of students taking the tests has triggered fundamental changes in how institutions use the tests. Some colleges and universities have questioned their wisdom in giving credit to students who score a 3 because it is considered a sort of middle ground in which professors say student ability varies greatly.
"The 5's are spectacular," said Judith de Luce, a professor in the classics department at Miami University in Ohio, and who is the chief grader for the College Board on its advanced placement Latin test. "The 4's are solid. The concern lies at the 3 score.
"The top 3's are really very good, but compared with the 4's and the 5's, some of the 3's at the low end are not nearly as good."
College and university officials said they had found that students who score a 3 have much more trouble with advanced courses. Not surprisingly, the student who scores a 3 is more likely to withdraw from the course or hold others back.
This scenario pushed Miami's English and physics departments two years ago to increase minimum test scores to 4 from 3.
"We began to worry that we were not doing these students any favors," said T. William Houk, chairman of the physics department who has helped write some of the advanced placement physics tests. Struggling in the first year of college, Dr. Houk added, "doesn't help their maturity and doesn't help their confidence."
The department's curriculum also was revamped in recent years, said Dr. Houk, and the advanced placement physics courses and tests no longer covered a lot of the material discussed in the department's curriculum.
Decisions on whether to increase the minimum test score or whether to accept advanced placement credits at all are still largely left to individual academic departments at a university, and only a small number of institutions -- like Clemson University in South Carolina -- have institution-wide policies.
Although Clemson generally accepts 3's on the range of advanced placement tests, entering freshmen at the public, four-year college of 16,500 students receive advanced placement credit for only the second half of Western civilization, a course that runs two semesters.
Jerome V. Reel, senior vice provost and dean of undergraduate studies at Clemson, said the advanced placement course in Western civilization began at A.D. 1500 whereas Clemson's course started before Christ, with some of the earliest settlements in Africa.
The changing climate has not been lost on students. Amy Pate, who graduated last May from a Nashville high school, would not attend an institution that did not accept her advanced placement credits.
"I knew I wanted to double major, so one of my requirements was that they were going to have to accept advanced placement," said Ms. Pate, who took advanced placement courses and passed tests in European history, American history, chemistry, biology, the first part of calculus, both Latin courses, comparative government and politics, United States government and politics, art history and English.
In all, she amassed 51 hours of college credit -- enough to make her a second-semester sophomore in only her first year of college. Ms. Pate settled on Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, which accepted all of her courses except comparative government and politics, for which the university had no equivalent course. She enrolled this fall as a second-semester sophomore and in January starts her junior year.
Because of her academic ability, Ms. Pate also received scholarships, which further reduced the Pates' financial obligation. Of Miami's annual $14,000 out-of-state tuition, room and board, Ms. Pate's mother, Ann Pate, said she and her husband, Thurman, would pay only about $2,000 this year.
Mrs. Pate said, "Advanced placement not only helped financially but also really prepared her for the rigors of a college curriculum."

HEADLINE: Asian Workers Lift Themselves by Bootstraps

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert's use of a tragic fire in a Thailand toy factory to attack Asian "sweatshops" (column, Dec. 21) shows an almost willful ignorance of global economics. 
 The wages in these countries may be "grotesquely low" in the opinion of Mr. Herbert, but they are probably appealing to the workers who receive them. For many of these workers, this may be their first step up into a cash economy from a largely subsistence rural existence. And as they spend their meager wages, they create a demand for food and products that lifts the living standards of their entire country. Only 30 to 40 years ago, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea were the targets of similar attacks by Mr. Herbert's ideological predecessors -- and look where those countries are today.
As the wages and skills of these Asian successes have advanced, the 80-cents-an-hour jobs have been transferred to other, less-developed countries like China. This starts a new cycle of economic growth. By no stretch of the imagination is China dragging down the living standards and working conditions of its neighbors. Rather, it allows them to leverage themselves up.
By United States standards, working conditions in developing countries are horrific. So are living conditions. The only way to improve conditions is to develop the economies.
Where people like Mr. Herbert see misery, the workers themselves see opportunities: to buy their first sewing machine or bicycle, or sneakers, or a cow for the family plot.
Sad as it may be to liberals, there is no reason greedy multinational corporations and their sordid subcontractors should pay above the prevailing wage in these countries, particularly since the labor force is largely unskilled. But as more companies enter the market, local wages tend to rise; and as workers become more skilled, they can command not only higher wages but also better working conditions. That's why the process is called a market economy.
When given the choice of buying toys or sneakers or sugar produced by underpaid foreigners -- and the whole purpose of tariffs and sanctions is to prevent the exercise of that choice -- the average consumer will seize the opportunity. And he or she should. The actions of those "greedy" corporations benefit both their "exploited" third-world workers and their "insensitive" first-world customers -- because if the profits aren't there, those jobs won't be either.

Meanwhile at Mattel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Let's see if I understand the economic situation at Mattel Inc. that led to its announcement to terminate 1,000 employees (Business Day, Dec. 20). The toy company made record profits this year, acquired major competitors, saw its stock price climb 19 percent, and announced a stock split and dividend increase to benefit shareholders. Revenues and profits have increase steadily for six years. Yet Mattel decides to dismiss 4.5 percent of its work force to pursue "efficiencies" and is lauded for this by corporate analysts. 
 To hear the so-called experts: record sales, record profits, fewer competitors and a booming stock price all represent a need to lay off people.
Does anyone still wonder why so many Americans are skeptical of those who tout an economic rebound and a brighter future for the average worker?

HEADLINE: It's Official: Texans Outnumber New Yorkers

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Population estimates for 1994 issued by the Census Bureau today showed that Texas has surpassed New York as the second-most-populous state as a result of fewer people moving to the Empire State from other parts of the country.
"New York is a study in contrasts," said Edwin Byerly, a Census Bureau statistician and demographer who worked on the annual report that constitutes the official estimates of the nation's population changes. "On the one hand, New York has the second-highest rate of international migration, but it's last in terms of the rate of domestic migration, people moving there from other states." 
 The report today showed California was the most populous state with 31.4 million people, Texas second with 18.4 million and New York third with 18.2 million.
Earlier this year, a Texas demographer had predicted that Texas would pass New York in the national population rankings, and Census Bureau statisticians agreed in the spring that their own projections showed such a change had probably occurred in January.
Today, with the bureau's official confirmation of the shift, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York had no comment, a spokesman for his office said. But when told of the projection in the spring, Mr. Cuomo attributed Texas's advance to "a whole lot of people pouring over the border," and said it was not "a sign of economic growth or of added confidence."
But today's report suggested that migration from outside the country was stronger in New York than in Texas. The report dealt only with states and included no figure for metropolitan areas.
Indeed, Texas's growth in the period covered by the report, July 1993 to July 1994, was due more to its having the second-highest excess of births over deaths (California was first) and the second-highest net migration with other states (Florida was first). It was also third highest in net international migration from July 1993 to July 1994 (behind California and New York).
The last time Texas changed population rank was in 1973, when it passed Pennsylvania to become the third-most-populous state.
Nationally, immigration continued to play a significant role in raising population, the Census Bureau said. About 30 percent, or 762,000, of the national population growth was attributed to immigration.
California ranked first in net international migration with 272,000 immigrants, and New York was second with 101,000. Texas had 75,000.
Mr. Byerly said the population data on California continued to "show how bad things have gotten" with the state's economy.
In the 1980's, California was the fifth-fastest-growing state. But in last year's reporting period, it was 35th in its rate of growth. Mr. Byerly said that in contrast to the boom days of the mid-1980's, people who would have moved to California had shifted their destinations to the Rocky Mountain states.
Today's report said that the only places showing population declines were Connecticut and Rhode Island, each of which lost about 3,000 people, and the District of Columbia, which lost 9,000 people.
The report also showed continuing growth in the South and West. Eight of the 10 fastest-growing states were in the Rocky Mountain region. The South had the largest population increase of any region, at 1.3 million people.
Over all, the nation expanded its population to 260.3 million in 1994 from 257.8 million in 1993, a growth of 2.6 million, or 1 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS READYING FURTHER BILLIONS TO RESCUE MEXICO

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The United States is preparing to spend billions of dollars, possibly as soon as next week, to help Mexico in its financial crisis. The money would be used to prop up the peso in foreign-exchange markets and help make payments on Mexico's national debt, an Administration official said today.
The money would be in addition to the $6 billion line of credit that the United States made available to Mexico last week. It would most likely consist of American loans to the Mexican Government and possibly American purchases of pesos in currency markets, the official said. 
 The Administration official confirmed that discussions were under way on providing assistance to Mexico, but refused to be quoted directly on any details.
The preparations reflect the Clinton Administration's assessment that Mexico is too important to the United States to be left without assistance at a time of severe economic and financial stress. The goal of the package would not be to obtain greater leverage over Mexico on areas of specific dispute like drugs or illegal immigration, but rather to help assure Mexico's long-term economic and political stability.
Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said tonight that "in approaching this situation, we've recognized the central importance of Mexico to the United States because it is our second-largest trading partner, because we share a 2,000-mile border and because our societies are so closely intertwined."
Bankers and analysts gave a cautious welcome to reports that the United States was preparing a multibillion-dollar aid package for Mexico. But they said that any revival of confidence in Mexico's battered currency and economy would be fragile for a long time to come. [Page D6.]
The scale of the assistance is unclear, and would not represent the first time the United States has helped Mexico. In 1982 Washington bought extra oil from Mexico and the Federal Reserve urged commercial banks to reschedule Mexico's foreign debt after it defaulted.
Further assistance from other rich industrial nations -- notably Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- remains possible this year, but American officials have had few conversations with them so far.
The Administration official who disclosed the broad rescue plan also confirmed rumors tonight that Mexico had not yet spent any of the $6 billion line of credit to support the peso. This suggests that Mexico may be waiting until the United States is ready to help in a coordinated intervention in the currency markets to drive up the peso.
The country's volatile financial markets started to calm down today with both the stock exchange and the peso improving.
Within the financial markets, attention has focused in recent days on Mexican Government bonds that are falling due in coming weeks. American officials refused to give specifics about the workings of the bailout package.
But it is clear that Washington's efforts to help are not directly aimed at supporting the peso or relieving Mexico of its obligations to pay off the bonds. Instead, the United States is focusing on the overall problem of making sure that Mexico has enough money to meet these short-term needs.
The understanding has been that any American help would have to be repaid.
The peso -- after dropping nearly 40 percent in the last week and a half -- bounced back by more than 14 percent today, partly on a series of rumors of international assistance to Mexico. The main one was that Canada, the United States and the International Monetary Fund would set up a fund of $10 billion to $15 billion to help the Mexican Government make the bond payments.
But an international monetary official who insisted on anonymity said tonight that all stories of an I.M.F. bailout were false. Because Mexico still owes $4 billion to the I.M.F. that it borrowed in 1989 and the early 1990's, the monetary fund's rules require that any new line of credit come after the negotiation of a comprehensive economic plan it has approved, a process that takes many months.
Top Mexican officials were so confident that 1994 would be a year of financial and economic success that they allowed a $5.4 billion line of credit at the International Monetary Fund to expire on May 25, 1993.
The I.M.F. is a 179-nation organization based in Washington that serves as the lender of last resort for countries facing currency crises.
The Mexican bonds, known as tesobonos, pay interest and principal that is calculated in dollars but paid in pesos. If it takes more pesos than before to buy a dollar, as has been the case this week, then Mexico must pay more pesos to redeem these bonds. International bankers said today that $3.6 billion of these bonds would fall due next month.
Mexico's usual practice until now has been to sell new tesobonos, often to foreigners, and use the proceeds to redeem others falling due.
But the collapse of foreign demand for the Mexican bonds has left the Government there with a stark range of choices: It can print more pesos, which risks higher inflation; it can borrow the money at home, which might send interest rates so high that they bring on a recession in Mexico, or the Government can find a foreign country, like the United States, willing either to buy new bonds or to lend Mexico a few billion dollars until other foreigners become interested in these bonds again.
Mexico's situation is made even more difficult because it needs money at the same time to prop up the peso.
Mr. Summers and several assistants have handled the issue in close consultation with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. They have exchanged so many phone calls with Mexican officials that they now recognize each others' voices instantly over the phone.
Former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, before stepping down on Dec. 22, also spoke frequently with his new Mexican counterpart, Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche.
Frank N. Newman, the acting Treasury Secretary, and Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy, who has been chosen by Mr. Clinton to replace Mr. Bentsen, are both on vacation this week. They have kept in touch by telephone with developments in Mexico. Members of Congress who scattered on Christmas vacations have largely ignored Mexico's troubles.
The nation's difficulties should have only modest effects on the overall United States economy, private economists said. Indeed, the peso's drop, making Mexican goods cheaper for Americans to buy, is likely to shave one- or two-tenths of a percentage point off the inflation rate in the United States during the next two years, according to Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers.
But if Mexico fell into a deep recession because of the peso's troubles, that might affect the United States economy by reducing growth here, also by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point in 1995 and 1996, Mr. Sinai said.
These effects are assumed to be modest because the Mexican economy is not big by the standards of industrial powers. While the Clinton Administration has portrayed sales of American-made goods to Mexico as a source of jobs and prosperity, these sales are quite small when seen in comparison with the broad economy of the United States.
Through September of this year, for example, American exports to Mexico totaled $37.52 billion, amounting to only three-quarters of 1 percent of all goods and services produced in the United States in that period.

Rwanda Now Faces Painful Ordeal of Rebirth

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIGALI, Rwanda, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Signs that life is returning to normal can be found everywhere in Rwanda. A roaring crowd fills a Kigali stadium for a Sunday afternoon soccer match. The cement factory in the southwest is operating again. Children play in dirt schoolyards. Day laborers in their green aprons pick tea on vast estates. And the carols of worshipers pour forth in a packed church where scores were massacred in April.
But in the six months since the end of a civil war that surpassed the unthinkable -- hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered and then hundreds of thousands fled -- such signs mask two crucial unresolved problems that threaten to pitch this country into another cauldron of violence. 
 They are refugees and justice -- too many of the former, too little of the latter.
Real stability within Rwanda remains elusive, indeed impossible, while more than a million Rwandans, out of a prewar population of over eight million, are still in exile in neighboring African countries. But the refugees will not return until they know they can get their house or plot of land back, until revenge killing and arbitrary imprisonment stop.
And that will not happen, Rwandans and United Nations officials agree, until there is a judicial system that punishes those responsible for the massacres, and deters those who would abuse the law today, whether for revenge or for personal gain.
For Rwanda's leaders, re-creating a homeland is an intimidating task made harder by the lack of foreign aid -- most of which has gone thus far to help the refugees, not to rebuild a nation. It is also a test of their political strength and skill as they seek to re-establish trust in the face of new ethnic friction and the shadow of the former Government and its military, now in exile with the refugees.
Few countries have suffered the destruction Rwanda has. The human loss is incomprehensible -- at least half a million of the Tutsi minority killed, men, women and children shot, stoned, hacked up with machetes by Hutu militiamen and soldiers.
There may be no administrative building in this country that still has its roof and windows. Offices were systematically looted or vandalized by officials of the former Government before they fled.
What unleashed this mayhem? It was not simply an eruption of long-simmering ethnic hatreds. It is not even entirely accurate to say the Hutu and Tutsi are different ethnic groups -- they speak the same language, worship the same God, share many of the same cultural traditions.
Even the physical characteristics that once distinguished them -- the Tutsi, tall and thin; the Hutu, short and broad -- have disappeared for vast segments of the population after generations of intermarriage.
"Bad leaders," said Goretti Uwamariya, 29, when asked what had caused the war. It is the answer one hears over and over again in Rwanda, from peasants in remote villages to intellectuals, and it underscores the fact that the Hutu and the Tutsi lived together, friction contained, until politicians set them against each other.
Mrs. Uwamariya, a Tutsi, was at church on the Sunday before Christmas, worshiping with Hutu and Tutsi at a Mass in which her family members killed by Hutu mobs in the April violence were remembered: her husband, a brother, a sister and several aunts and uncles.
Mrs. Uwamariya said it would not be easy to live with the Hutu again, but it would be necessary to try because there really was no other choice. In October she gave birth to a daughter.
"I'll teach her to love everybody regardless of their tribe or their region," she said. "Otherwise she will become like the killers of her father."
 
The Rulers
Not a Democracy Or a Dictatorship
 It is hard to pin a political label on Rwanda at the moment.
It falls short of being a democracy, since no one was elected to any position, and the dominant institution is the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, which won the war and is in effect the ruling political party.
The most important political leader is Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, who was commander of the rebel army and is now Vice President and Defense Minister.
But it would be unfair to call the Government a military dictatorship. The army is one of the most disciplined in Africa. At roadblocks, soldiers, though dressed in rumpled uniforms, are polite and sober and do not demand money. On the Rwandan side of the border with Zaire, the officials are inefficient, bureaucratic, pleasant and honest. On the Zairian side they are inefficient, bureaucratic, nasty and corrupt.
Rwanda has a civilian President and Prime Minister, and while they do not have General Kagame's influence over the country's political direction, they are more than figureheads.
Most Cabinet members are civilians, and two key posts, Interior and Justice, are held by Hutu. Most of the 11 provincial governors are civilians, and in Cyangugu, the third-largest province, the Government recently named a Hutu human rights campaigner, Theobald Rutihunza, to the top spot.
"I'm not sure how much power I have," Mr. Rutihunza said in a recent interview in his barren office. But he is testing it daily as he investigates human rights abuses by the army and urges commanders not to arrest people without sufficient evidence.
Throughout the country some 15,000 people have been seized on the street or hauled from their homes because someone has accused them of involvement in the massacres. Many Rwandans fear a dangerous abuse of power, like that which marked the former Government.
"Before, it was the militia," said a Tutsi intellectual. "Now it is the army. It is the same." He lost sisters and brothers to the Hutu militia and has other family members in the Patriotic Front.
But the human rights picture is decidedly mixed.
The Justice Minister allows foreign journalists to go into the prisons far more readily than do his counterparts in some democratic countries.
The country, roughly the size of Vermont, is also awash with United Nations human rights monitors. They poke and probe into prisons and allegations of human rights abuses to a degree that would not be tolerated by a vast majority of the members of the United Nations.
These contradictions have led to uncertainty about where the country is headed. Any hope that it will be a stable, relatively open society is doomed if the Government cannot get the refugees back, because the refugees will become the army that plunges Rwanda into another round of warfare, the way the Patriotic Front grew out of the mass of Rwandan refugees who fled to Uganda 30 years ago.
 
The Refugees
Who Can Count The Exiles?
 With so many of its citizens refugees, the current Government cannot claim to be legitimate. The leaders of the former Government know that, and the refugees have become their pawns in a deadly game.
"The R.P.F. won the war militarily," said Jean Kambanda, who was Prime Minister in the former Government when it was defeated. "But they lost the political war, because the population has fled."
There are more than four million refugees in Zaire alone, he asserted, which is four times the United Nations figure. "Only some children, old people and sick people who could not flee are left in the country," he said.
Mr. Kambanda has become prime minister of a government in exile. The president is Theodore Sindikubwabo, who was President of the former Government during the slaughter of Tutsi. The chief of staff of the exile army, Augustin Bizimungu, was the military chief of staff during the massacres.
At his home in exile in Bukavu, Zaire, on the shore of picturesque Lake Kivu, Mr. Kambanda said there had been a genocide. He also said his Government had tried to stop the killings by the militia. He handed a visitor a pamphlet, "The Rwandese People Accuse . . . ," which accuses the Tutsi-led Patriotic Front of genocide of Hutu. Sophisticated and printed on high-quality paper, the pamphlet has been distributed in the refugee camps.
Striking a moderate stance in a recent interview, Mr. Kambanda, 39, a bespectacled economist, said there must be a negotiated political settlement between the current and former Government.
But the former army is preparing for war, training near the refugee camps, with the arms it took with it when fleeing Rwanda. A full-scale invasion seems unlikely, but guerrilla attacks are almost certain, which would likely lead to repressive measures by the Government, which is just what the exile government wants.
The former Government's militia, the men who carried out most of the massacres, are now terrorizing the camp populations to keep the refugees from going home. Even children have become tools to help promote the former Government's objectives.
At least 60,000 children are orphans. Many lost one or both parents to the mobs or to cholera; other parents are still alive but have become separated from the children.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has begun a major effort, using computers and field workers, to find parents or other members of a child's extended family.
But the effort has been hampered by the militia. The Red Cross stopped working in one orphanage after young toughs threatened workers taking two boys to join their parents. And in some camps the militiamen are not allowing the relief workers to deliver messages from people in Rwanda to relatives in the camps, a service the Red Cross has performed in wars around the world.
The current Rwandan Government insists that it is only because of such intimidation that the refugees are not returning. But fear of the Patriotic Front soldiers is also keeping the refugees in the camps.
Goretti Umiziyimana's home in Kigali is only a couple of hours by car from the refugee camp in southern Rwanda where she has lived for several months, but she is afraid to go home.
The new Government needs the likes of Mrs. Umiziyimana, 27, a secondary school teacher, and she should have no reason to fear. Her husband, a radio journalist, Tharcisse Rubwiriza, was killed by the militia in April because he was a moderate Hutu.
Actually, she has gone back to Kigali a couple of times. And she found two soldiers and their families living in her house. It is a common occurrence -- houses abandoned by Hutu who fled now being taken over by soldiers or Tutsi. The soldiers have refused to leave the house, and Mrs. Umiziyimana said they told her they knew her husband had been killed, which she took as an implicit threat.
But many refugees have returned, at least 600,000 by some counts. These are not the Hutu who fled to Zaire this summer. These are Tutsi who fled during Hutu pogroms 20 and 30 years ago.
Their return is changing the demographics and politics of the country in a potentially explosive way. No census has been taken since the war, but there is no doubt that Tutsi now make up far more than the 15 percent of the population that they did before the war. In Kigali and some villages, Tutsis are the majority.
In Masaka, east of Kigali, the prewar population of 8,000 shrank to only a few hundred after the killing and exodus. It is now back to 5,000; 4,000 are Tutsi from the diaspora.
"We came back because we had regained our country," said Jean Kamuzinzi, 42, who was tending a small herd of cattle. The cattle and 10 Tutsi families had come back together from Burundi; they were given the grazing land and houses by the new Government, which is more governmental support than returning Hutu get.
The Tutsi returning from Burundi appear to cause the most problems.
"They are very arrogant," said Francois Nsanzuwera, Kigali's chief prosecutor. "They feel they are entitled to everything. Even other Tutsi are annoyed."
Several Rwandan Tutsi said that Tutsi who had returned from Burundi were occupying their houses. They are afraid to do anything to get their houses back for fear of being killed.
For centuries, the Tutsi have felt superior to the Hutu, an attitude reinforced by the Belgians, who ruled through the Tutsi. The Tutsi in Burundi feel their superiority even more keenly, because even though they are only 15 percent of the population, they have dominated the army and the Government.
There is a growing concern here that Tutsi from Burundi may eventually gain similar political control in Rwanda. And already there are questions about how serious the Patriotic Front is about getting the Hutu refugees to return.
"So far they've made good speeches," said Shaharyar Khan, the senior United Nations diplomat in Rwanda. "But not enough has been done on the ground to bring people back."
Returning Hutu refugees have been subjected to such intense and humiliating screening and interrogation that they often wish they had stayed in the refugee camps and certainly carry no message to others to return.
"You need a different atmosphere," Mr. Khan said. He suggested that it could be done with inexpensive gestures, like welcoming committees in villages.
But at some point, if it wants to get the refugees back, the Government will have to engage in negotiations with Hutu leaders now in exile.
"We will go home when they negotiate with our leaders," said a university student who is now a refugee in the Kibumba camp. The condition he set is one that many educated refugees place on repatriation.
Not all of the refugees are peasants. Thousands of the country's former civil servants are refugees, as are doctors, teachers and other professionals the country needs back if it is to develop.
So far, the new Government has adamantly refused to negotiate with anyone who had any connection with the former Government, arguing that their hands are bloodied by the genocide. But Mr. Khan and others argue that there are moderate Hutus in exile and the Government needs to talk to them.
 
The Future
How to Rebuild A Country?
 Earlier this month, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is not prone to hyperbole, said it feared that "the indecision of the international community" would lead to "an escalation of violence and a resumption of hostilities, with the same horrific results and incalculable repercussions in humanitarian terms."
Getting the refugees home has been a priority of the international community. Yet the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not had a consistent policy on repatriation.
First the agency was neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging refugees who wanted to return. Then it helped those who asked for help. Then it stopped doing even that. Recently, it went back to a policy of providing assistance to those refugees who express a desire to go home. But this will not be enough.
An aggressive campaign will be required to get the refugees back, one that insures the safety of the refugees in the camps and when they get back home. And the refugees will be more likely to go home if there is something to go home to, like electric power, water, schools -- in short, a functioning government.
Rwanda can not rebuild without vast outside assistance, any more than Germany or Japan could have recovered after World War II without American aid.
While the bill for the Rwandan emergency is approaching a billion dollars, nearly all of it so far has gone for the refugees.
"We have $700 million of jerrycans and powdered milk, and I haven't got $2 million dollars to put the power system in order so that people can read and write and not be looted at night," Mr. Khan said.
Mr. Khan told of a Government minister who visited his office one day and looked out the window at the parking lot filled with United Nations vehicles. "I wish I could have just one of those," the minister said. He has to walk to work.
A high priority is the judicial system.
"It is the basis of our reconstruction and rehabilitation and any kind of development," said Aloyise Inyumba, Rwanda's Minister of the Family and Women. "People have lost confidence because they don't have security of their lives, security of their property."
For months, United Nations and private relief agencies have been saying that rebuilding the judicial system is the highest priority. "It is the key to everything," said one United Nations official.
Justice Minister Alphonse Nkubito has drawn up a long list of his needs, from paper and typewriters to vehicles, which he has given to a long line of representatives from governments and private organizations who come by his devastated offices to ask how they can help.
And what has he received? A couple of weeks ago, $27,000 in cash from the German Government -- appreciated, but barely enough to buy the paper he needs, Mr. Nkubito said.
And beyond that?
"Many promises," Mr. Nkubito said.

Chronology: "Four Years: Descent Into Chaos"
 
1990
 
October: Civil war erupts, with attacks by the Rwandan Patriotic Front from bases in Uganda. The Patriotic Front is made up mostly of Tutsi who have been refugees in Uganda and served in the Uganda Army.

August: Government and Patriotic Front sign a peace accord in Arusha, Tanzania. The accord never fully takes effect.
 
November: United Nations forces arrive to monitor the accord.
 
1994
 
April 6: Plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda is shot down as it approaches airport in the capital, Kigali. He is returning from a meeting in Tanzania to discuss putting the accord into effect. Though the source of the attack has never been pinpointed, it is widely thought to have been the work of extremist Hutu, opposed to any power-sharing with the Patriotic Front. Within hours, the killing, by Government soldiers and Hutu militia, begins. Victims are Tutsi and moderate Hutu.
 
April 7: Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana is tortured and shot by Rwandan soldiers. Ten Belgian United Nations soldiers protecting her are also killed.
 
April 10: United States Embassy in Kigali closes. France, Belgium and the United States evacuate their citizens.
 
April 18: International Committee of the Red Cross reports "tens of thousands" have been killed.
 
April 21: Security Council reduces size of United Nations military contingent in Rwanda, from 2,500 to 270.
 
April 29: About 250,000 Rwandans flee to Tanzania in 24 hours. Saying that the number of killed may have reached 200,000. Secretary General Boutros Bourtros-Ghali calls for more United Nations troops to be sent to Rwanda. Security Council rejects the request.
 
May 10: United Nations begins to discuss sending 5,500 troops to Rwanda. The Clinton Administration favors a smaller force.
 
May 31: In a report to the Security Council, Mr. Boutros-Ghali says: "We have failed in our response to the agony of Rwanda, and thus have acquesced in the continued loss of human lives." He says "there can be little doubt" that the killing in Rwanda "constitutes genocide." Clinton Adminstration is reluctant to use the word genocide. "as a responsible government, you don't just go around hollering 'genocide," said the United States Ambassador to Rwanda, David Rawson.
 
June 8: Security Council approves 5,500 troops for Rwanda.
 
June 23: France, which has long been a military supporter of the Hutu Government, begins a "humanitarian intervention" in Rwanda. The Security Council narrowly endorses the intervention. Nongovernment relief organizations express opposition.
 
July 4: The rebel army captures Kigali.
 
July 14: Rwandan refugees, mostly Hutu, begin flooding into Zaire, nearly a million over the next few days.
 
July 18: The Patriotic Front says the war is over, declares a cease-fire, and announces formation of a government.
 
July 19: Cholera strikes refugees in Goma, killing thousands every day.
 
Aug. 21: The French withdraw.
 
Sept. 23: A report by a consultant for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees accuses the new Rwandan Government of killing returning refugees. The agency stops assisting refugees who wish to return.
 
Nov. 8: The Security Council approves a resolution establishing an international court to try people charged with genocide in Rwanda. Rwanda votes against the resolution, partly because there is no provision for the death penalty, and says that while it will cooperate with the court, it also intends to carry out its own trials.
 
Dec. 19: The office of the High Commissioner for Refugees reverses policy agains and says it will provide assistance to refugees who wish to return to Rwanda, but it will not encourage them to do so. (pg. A14)

HEADLINE: Local Economy Is 'Very Weak,' Comptroller's Report Finds

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The New York City economy is "very weak" and its recovery "very fragile," the City Comptroller said yesterday, adding that job growth slowed sharply, office vacancies increased and retail sales grew more slowly in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 31.
Data provided by the Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, also showed that the city lost 2,000 jobs from Sept. 31 to Nov. 30. Employment was the only one of the economic measures analyzed for those months. 
 In a monthly report on the city economy, Mr. Hevesi said that its poor performance in recent months was a reversal from earlier in the year, when its recovery from the longest and deepest recession since World War II was steady, but at a slower pace than in most of the nation.
He attributed the slowdown to rising interest rates, which have been nudged up six times this year by the Federal Reserve in attempts to rein in the pace of the national economic expansion, thereby bringing inflation under control.
"One of our big problems is that every time the Federal Reserve acts to solve a perceived problem in Boise, Idaho or Kansas, it hurts New York," Mr. Hevesi said in an interview. "We do not have an inflation rate that requires six rate increases by the Federal Reserve."
He warned that additional interest-rate increases would trigger a recession for the city next year.
"Business decisions are made on the basis of Federal Reserve action," Mr. Hevesi said. "People hunker down."
The report said the city's inflation rate during the third quarter was 2.5 percent, slightly higher than in the previous quarter but far below the third-quarter rate of 2.9 percent for the nation. In a comparison of the nation's 15 largest cities, the report said that only five -- Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington -- had lower inflation than New York.
It found other cause for optimism. Unemployment in the city declined, with the third-quarter rate falling to 8.1 percent from 9 percent in the previous quarter, the report said. The rate had been over 9 percent throughout 1993.
In other positive signs, Mr. Hevesi said, hotel occupancy and room rates were on the rise in the third quarter, and building permits for privately-owned housing -- still far below the levels of the 1980s -- rose by 16 pecent over the third quarter of 1993.
But the report found weightier evidence that the city's economic recovery had slowed down, if not come to a halt. It said employment rose by 4,100 jobs during the quarter, less than half of the increase of 8,900 jobs gained in the second quarter.
The market for commercial real estate was particularly weak in the third quarter, the report found. In midtown Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate had been declining for more than a year, the third-quarter rate rose to 14.4 percent from 13.9 percent in the second quarter.
In lower Manhattan, the report said the rate rose to 17.9 percent in the third quarter from 17.2 percent in the second quarter.
Although the report did not account for the Christmas shopping season, which is the most critical time of year for most stores, it said sales during the third quarter increased only slightly after much better gains during the second quarter.
It said third-quarter retail sales in the city increased 0.8 percent, compared to the third quarter of 1993. Second-quarter sales had risen 2.2 percent compared to the second quarter a year earlier.
In July, the worst month for retailers this year, it said sales in the city plummeted by 4 percent compared to July 1993.

 BODY:

A PATAKI APPOINTEE FOCUSES ON WELFARE
 Governor-elect George E. Pataki named Westchester County's Commissioner for Social Services to do for the state what she has done at home -- dramatically reduce the cost of welfare. But unable to get the Commissioner, Mary E. Glass, to sign on for the long term, he agreed to limit her appointment to 90 days. A1. 
 Conservative forces are determined to keep Mr. Pataki true to their ideal of less government as he builds the state's first Republican administration in 20 years. B4.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
PATAKI FACES HARD CALL ON WATER RULES
 To protect its water supply, New York City has put together a plan to regulate everything from new development to the disposal of plowed snow in the vast upstate region that supplies the city's water. The proposal, which pits upstate communities against the city, drops a hard political choice squarely into the lap of Governor-elect Pataki. B3.
 
LOCAL ECONOMY IS CALLED 'VERY WEAK'
 The New York City economy is "very weak" and its recovery "very fragile," City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said. B3.
 
A LIBERAL LOOKS BACK WITH PRIDE
 Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, makes no apologies. He is what he is: "A liberal. That's me. I'm an unabashed liberal. I still believe in government as an institution for improving the lives of people, as a mechanism to do good." What an admission. In this era of privatizing and downsizing, someone is saying hurrah for government. Metro Matters, B3.
 
COMPUTER REPLACES RAZOR FOR RABBI
 A conflict between a state prison rule requiring that inmates be photographed clean-shaven and a religious belief that a man's beard must not be touched was resolved in Federal court through new computer technology. B3.
 
YOUTH IS SHOT TO DEATH IN ROBBERY
 Wanda Matthews always told her 17-year-old son Adonis to keep his jewelry hidden and not resist robbers. But just before midnight on Tuesday, on a subway platform in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, he was wearing a gold medallion and chain around his neck. And when two men tried to rob him, he fought back and was shot to death, the police said. B2.
 
MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF TOURIST
 The police arrested a 22-year-old man and charged him with second-degree murder in the 1991 shooting of a tourist who was struck by a stray bullet as she sat in the passenger seat of a car at a Chinatown intersection. B4.

'SOFT MONEY' TALKS, TOO
 In New Jersey, the Mercer County Democratic Committee had only one local election on its hands this year, a low-key county freeholder race in which the Democrats were trounced. So why were Jeffrey Katzenberg of Hollywood, and Leon Hess of the giant oil company that bears his name, and the teamsters' union in Washington pouring tens of thousands of dollars into the county party's coffers?

CHARITY SETTLES DISPUTE ON SPENDING
 Trustees at the Freedom Forum have paid more than $170,000 in restitution to the charitable foundation as part of a settlement of charges involving excessive spending, New York State officials said. B5.

HEADLINE: As Congress Fumes, Clinton Urges North Koreans to Free Pilot

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton called on North Korea today to release an American pilot captured 11 days ago, as key lawmakers of both parties of Congress predicted that Congress would block a nuclear agreement between the two countries if the diplomatic crisis is not resolved.
"We have made it clear to the North Koreans that we want the prompt release of Airman Hall and that there is no reason for his detention," the President said, rejecting North Korean accusations that the pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, was on a spy mission. 
 Mr. Clinton said it would be "premature" to comment on whether the United States would delay carrying out the nuclear agreement if Mr. Hall was not released, saying that negotiations between the State Department envoy, Thomas Hubbard, and North Korean officials must be given a chance.
Although Mr. Clinton did not threaten to retaliate against North Korea, he appeared less upbeat than he did in his radio address last Saturday. Then, he touted the nuclear accord with North Korea as a victory of "our firm diplomacy," and said he was "hopeful" that Mr. Hall "will soon be back with his family." The accord between the two countries requires North Korea to freeze and ultimately dismantle its weapons-grade nuclear program in exchange for $4 billion in economic incentives.
Mr. Clinton's remarks were made hours before North Korea released what it said was a confession by Mr. Hall. Some officials interpreted the confession as a positive development that allows North Korea to save face and release Mr. Hall; others saw it as a sign that the crisis will drag out until the North wins concessions.
Earlier, as word reached Washington that Mr. Hubbard had failed to make progress in his talks in Pyongyang today, the State Department spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said that the United States had no intention of going beyond its official message of "regret" for the incident by issuing a formal apology.
And he denied that the incident could have been avoided if the United States had embraced the North Korean proposal to replace the United Nations-sponsored Military Armistice Commission with direct bilateral military talks and an eventual peace treaty.
Even if the standoff is resolved soon, it seems clear that some lawmakers will use the incident to delay or even sabotage it.
"The mood of the Hill will be a very negative one," Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who visited North Korea earlier this month, said. "Many of us feel that the deal reached by the Administration was not the best."
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican and new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed that, saying, "A number of us in Congress have been skeptical about this nuclear agreement and this incident simply adds fuel to that fire."
Senator Bob Dole, the incoming Senate majority leader and the most outspoken opponent of the accord on Capitol Hill, said in a statement, "North Korea's shameful handling of Bobby Hall casts doubt over the entire premise of the Clinton Administration's policy -- that there is a North Korean Government willing and able to deal responsibly with the United States."
Representative Bill Richardson, the New Mexico Democrat who successfully negotiated the return of the body of the dead pilot, David Hilemon, predicted trouble. "Unless this helicopter incident is resolved soon, even moderates in Congress will oppose the implementation of the nuclear accord," Mr. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: Republican Bill Would Trim Aid for Poor Children Who Are Ill or Disabled

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
House Republicans are drafting legislation that would abolish Federal cash payments for 847,000 poor children who are severely disabled or chronically ill. They would replace the payments with vouchers that could be spent on a more limited program of medical care.
The lawmakers said the proposal was part of the Republicans' overall effort to redesign the nation's welfare system and control costs. It would fundamentally alter the program, Supplemental Security Income for children, which provides cash grants of up to $446 a month for children with chronic illnesses and disabilities like mental retardation, cerebral palsy and spina bifida. 
 Administration officials said today that they were willing to consider the Republican proposal and would be interested in making changes in the program as long as those changes helped disabled children become productive, working members of society.
Republicans express many concerns about the current program. They note that the number of children receiving disability benefits has soared, to 847,000 this year from 296,000 in 1989, and that the annual cost has tripled, to $4.4 billion. They contend that benefits are paid to children with common behavior problems and that some parents coach children to fake disabilities.
But advocacy groups and parents of disabled children say the program enables them to cope with the extraordinary costs of caring for these children at home. They say, too, that many items and services purchased under the program would not be covered by the proposed vouchers because they are not purely medical.
Under current law, Supplemental Security Income payments may be used for food, shelter and clothing and for a wide range of medical and social services. For example, the money can be used to hire specially trained child-care workers and to purchase diapers so a child who is incontinent can attend school. Parents are supposed to report annually how the money is used.
The vouchers proposed by the Republicans could be used only for medical expenses and equipment.
The parents say the program is economical because it is far more expensive to care for disabled children in institutions rather than at home. They say abuses in the program have been grossly overstated, and they denounce the Republican plan as a regressive measure that would severely reduce the usefulness of Federal aid.
"Vouchers will lead to more children being institutionalized," said Sharon M. Barnhill of Chicago, who receives a monthly check of $446 for her 9-year-old son, Neville, who has Down syndrome and "can't cross the street, has no concept of danger, does not talk, is not toilet-trained and does not know how to dress himself."
Anne M. Lauritzen of Lincoln, Neb., whose 19-year-old son has spina bifida and is mildly retarded, said that if Congress replaced cash grants with vouchers, it would implicitly tell parents that "the Government doesn't trust families to decide how best to use the money for their children."
Philip A. Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said the agency had found "very little evidence of coaching, fraud or abuse" in the program, which it runs. He said the agency had liberalized the rules for eligibility to comply with a 1990 Supreme Court decision.
Mr. Gambino said the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, would appoint a commission soon to study the program, as required by a new law.
Senators from both parties have expressed concern about the growth of the program. But Democratic Senators like Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut have championed children's programs and may resist major restrictions.
The Republican bill is being drafted by Representative Jim McCrery of Louisiana, with support from Representatives Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the next Speaker of the House; Bill Archer of Texas; E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, and Bill Thomas of California.

HEADLINE: Beyond Probation: Trying to Break Cycle of Arrest and Rearrest

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young -- A periodic report: Seeking Solutions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
On a bone-chilling morning last April, Tony W., a powerfully built teen-ager who specialized in armed robberies on the streets of New York City, stepped out of one of New York State's most forbidding institutions for teen-agers to begin what he hoped would be a new life.
The sky was stained a dispiriting gray, and a light rain was pelting Tony's windbreaker. But he had been locked up for more than five months -- a long time for a 15-year-old -- and a wave of euphoria swept through him as he took his first steps to freedom that morning. Rattling down to the city in the train, he promised himself he would never be back behind bars. 
 But the odds were heavily against him, as they are for legions of teen-agers around the country, sent from locked institutions back to the same families, neighborhoods and schools where they got into trouble.
Because so many young people are being arrested -- and because so few institutional spaces exist for the most violent teen-agers -- convicted youths are often released in New York and other states after less than a year of confinement. Even in the places that try hardest to change young people's attitudes and behavior, the time is often so short that counseling and therapy have little chance of taking hold.
Faced with data showing that more than three-quarters of the teen-agers released from juvenile institutions are soon arrested again, specialists in crime and violence are now arguing that if youths like Tony are to be persuaded to give up crime, they each must be assigned advocates to lead them along the path of a life in which money comes from work and insults are absorbed without a deadly counter-strike.
The work of helping teen-agers make the transition from an institution to life outside is known as aftercare.
It is still a fairly new concept, one that has not yet been adopted in most of the country. Even where aftercare exists, its results have yet to be scientifically evaluated.
Nonetheless, experts in the field say there is an increasing consensus that aftercare is a key to preventing recidivism.
While aftercare is expensive -- $8,000 a year or more for each youth served in the most intensive aftercare programs -- experts stress that if it prevents even a few young people from being reincarcerated, at a cost of up to $100,000 a year, it is a sound investment.
"The idea of giving a kid the structured environment of an institution and then just releasing him to the streets is just a waste," said Peter Reinharz, the chief prosecutor for juveniles in the Family Court in New York City. "There has got to be something at the back end, after the institution. There has to be someone who tells the kid, 'Look, you're going down the wrong path,' and something hanging over his head: 'If you screw up you're going back in.' Somebody has got to hold the hammer."
Around the country, aftercare ranges from programs in which counselors meet with youths several times a day to ones in which they telephone youths and their families once or twice a week to help the youths get back into school and find jobs or simply to invite them to gatherings where successful adults share their experiences.
Whatever the style, aftercare goes far beyond the realm of traditional probation and parole, in which officers rely on weekly or monthly office visits and periodic drug testing to keep tabs on former convicts.
Advocates of aftercare say that, ideally, each case manager should be working with a dozen or fewer young people. That is happening in a few programs around the country. But it is far more common for case workers to be assigned 80 or 90 young people, making it impossible to work closely with them and their families.
"Until quite recently the concept of aftercare in juvenile justice was an afterthought," said Dr. Barry Krisberg, president of the National Council of Crime and Delinquency, a private research center in San Francisco. "But now we realize that the process of helping youths return to their community is of even greater importance than the institutional experience."
Dr. Krisberg estimated that no more than a half-dozen states had established aftercare programs. But federally sponsored pilot programs are beginning in New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada in January.
And Edward J. Loughran, the director of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Juvenile Justice Project, a private group in Boston, is starting or expanding aftercare programs in Nebraska, Connecticut, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Wayne County, Mich.
One obstacle to the wider adoption of aftercare, in an era of tight state budgets and fiscal conservatism, is the expense of additional counselors and training programs.
"We have been spending all our money on incarceration," said David M. Altschuler, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a specialist on aftercare. "We literally go for broke on the incarceration side, then skimp and cut corners when it comes to aftercare and parole."
Then, too, some critics regard aftercare as coddling. But experts in the field see it instead as an important public safety tool.
"It really extends the state's arm over youths," said Mr. Loughran, a former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services. "It's keeping involved with them and holding them accountable."
New York operates one of the most ambitious arrays of aftercare programs, but even in most of its programs, case managers are swamped and involved with each young person for no more than a few hours a week. And many of the young people wind up back in jail.
"We need almost a one-on-one with these kids, a very close relationship," said Michael A. Corriero, a State Supreme Court judge who presides over the cases of the most serious juvenile offenders in Manhattan. "We try to have it, but it's not properly funded or supported."
The neighboring states provide far less in aftercare. New Jersey has no aftercare programs at all, while Connecticut provides some services, paid for partly with a $750,000 Federal grant that the state has received for each of the last two years.
Though aftercare is sometimes voluntary, it is most often imposed as part of a criminal sentence. Tony W., for example, was sentenced to six months' confinement and four and a half years of probation, including one year in aftercare, for armed robbery of a grocery store in Queens. He was released a bit early for good behavior.
Because a social worker recommended Tony as a youth who recognized that he had made a mistake and wanted to change, he was accepted into the Youth Advocacy Project, a private organization in Manhattan supported by grants and government funds. But Charmane Wong, the director of the program, said he had been accepted only reluctantly because of his prior arrests and because he had seemed balky with one of her case managers -- and her concerns proved well founded.
The Youth Advocacy Project's counselors, who try to act like big brothers and sisters, establish and monitor nightly curfews and help youths get back into school. They find them jobs and enroll them in neighborhood recreation programs run by groups like the Police Athletic League and the Boys Clubs of America.
Rap stars and small-business owners, lawyers and experts on AIDS spend an hour or so at weekly discussions, talking about their work and their ways of navigating society. Each counselor at the Youth Advocacy Project works with eight teen-agers on the streets and three or four still in custody. Counselors check in with parents and teachers and employers every few days and, on the phone and in person, they try to encourage the young men to stay out of trouble.
Four other New York aftercare programs, all run by the State Division for Youth -- one in Brooklyn and three upstate -- are even more comprehensive than the Youth Advocacy Project. Counselors are assisted by "trackers" who drop in on the teen-agers unexpectedly every day, and some programs provide daily group counseling. But, altogether, these programs deal with only 47 teen-agers. And like the Youth Advocacy Project, which supervises 75 youths, the operating cost is about $8,000 a year for each participant.
The vast majority of young people returning to the streets each year in New York State -- about 1,300 of them -- gets far less attention.
In New York City, each counselor works with about 80 teen-agers, a quarter of them living at home or with guardians and the rest still institutionalized. Upstate, the caseload is lighter, but counselors often have to drive long distances to meet their clients. So the time available for each youth is still short. With these larger caseloads, the cost per youth is about $2,600.
Most of the teen-agers in the Division for Youth programs are monitored for about five months, although some remain assigned to a counselor for up to a year, as in the Youth Advocacy Project.
What happens in New Jersey is far more typical of the nation as a whole. There, youths are pretty much on their own after they leave an institution. Most are released after serving a third to a half of their sentences and are then required to check in monthly with a parole officer who works with about 80 youths and adults. Paradoxically, both in New Jersey and New York, the youths who are most unruly when institutionalized are forced to serve their full sentences and are then released without any follow-up at all.
When New Jersey starts its aftercare program in January, it will provide for a stay of six months in a small residence in Camden or Newark for its most serious young criminals, followed by six months of close supervision on the streets. But it is only a trial, with Federal and state financing guaranteed for one year, and it will serve only 100 of the 900 or so youths who leave New Jersey's youth prisons each year.
 
The Arrest
Robbing Since 12; Locked Up at 14
Last year was a rough one for Tony. In January the eldest of his three brothers, who was 43 years old and an unemployed former convict, died in an ambulance on the way to a Brooklyn hospital. The family, including another older brother who has done time for armed robbery, was never quite sure what caused his death. A little more than two weeks later, his mother died of a kidney ailment.
His father had been ill and unable to work regularly, and Tony, who suffers from epileptic seizures, went to live with a sister in her 30's, her husband and their three children.
In November, Tony and two friends took $200 at gunpoint from a man on a Brooklyn street. The others got away, but Tony was arrested. The judge let him go back to his sister's apartment, but in December the police caught him as he ran away from a grocery store robbery in Queens, and he was sent upstate to the Division for Youth's Harlem Valley Secure Center in Wingdale.
Tony's sister said she believed that his life had begun to unravel with the death of his mother. But Tony said in an interview that he had been robbing people since he was 12.
The first time, he said, he got a Walkman, $60 and a book bag. He always threw the wallets on the ground, he said, "because they need the papers." And he said he had learned that if you try to rob someone who has no money and you just let him go, instead of hurting him, he usually does not call the police. Tony said he had always worked with two or three other boys, never alone. Someone would always have a knife or a gun.
His mother, he said, had lectured him about crime. He knew it was wrong. "But I felt like making fast money," he said. "I feel if I don't take it, somebody else will."
The night of the grocery store robbery he had been hanging out on a street in Brooklyn with Saul N., who had been a friend since they were 5 years old. He told Saul and a few other friends that he was going to "go rob somebody."
"Saul said, 'Why you going to rob somebody and get a few dollars?' " Tony recalled. " 'I know a store we can rob and get two or three thousand.' I said, like, 'Come on, let's go.' "
One of the other youths had a car, and they drove to Queens because, Tony said, "you don't supposed to do things where you live."
Tony and Saul expected to find a man working alone in the grocery. But when they walked in, they saw another man stacking canned goods.
"So we walked back outside and Saul asked do I still want to do it," Tony said. "And I asked him if he still wanted to do it. And we both said like, 'Yeah.' "
Back in the grocery store, they asked the man at the cash register for a pack of cigarettes. "He reached up for the cigarettes," Tony said, "and that's when my co-defendant pulled out the gun."
The two teen-agers ordered the clerks -- one in his 40's, the other in his late 20's -- to kneel in front of the counter while Tony emptied the cash register. They yanked money and food stamps out of the clerks' pockets and walked out. On the street, they saw a patrol car passing by and just kept walking, trying to keep cool. But one of the clerks ran into the street screaming for help and, within minutes, the two youths were in handcuffs. Tony was 14 and on his way to jail.
 
The Release
Slipping Back Into Old Habits
 Some young people are rescued by aftercare. Anne Elizabeth Zeek, a senior city probation officer who directs the Kings Juvenile Offender Program in Brooklyn, is working with a 15-year-old convicted armed robber who was sent to her in September from an upstate institution, hostile and sulky. It turned out that he could not read. Ms. Zeek got him a tutor who started by introducing the alphabet, and within a month, she said, there was "a total transformation."
But Tony did not do so well.
Though state officials say it isn't supposed to happen, he and Saul were put in the same unit at Harlem Valley. Then, compounding the error, they were released the same day and shared the train ride home.
The two teen-agers were jubilant to be on their own outside the institution, and, Tony said, they chattered almost giddily about making a new start and "not coming back to be locked up again."
No one was waiting for them when they reached Grand Central Station, Tony said, because they had been released earlier than expected. So the two friends in crime made their way around Brooklyn together, announcing their new freedom to relatives and friends. By early evening he and Saul were hanging out on one of their favorite corners again with some of the same teen-agers they had joined in robberies, getting high on marijuana.
Both youths had been told to check in immediately with Brian Gattuso, a 22-year-old caseworker at the Youth Advocacy Project who had just graduated from St. John's University with a degree in psychology. Saul dropped in briefly to the project's office in mid-Manhattan. But Tony's father called Mr. Gattuso to say that his son would not be in because he had collapsed with a seizure.
Mr. Gattuso and Ms. Wong, of the Youth Advocacy Project, now wonder if Tony was really ill or if that was the beginning of the excuses and cover-ups for Tony's lapses.
In any case, a full week went by before Tony showed up at the Youth Advocacy Project's office.
Mr. Gattuso reminded Tony that he was required to come to the office each Thursday for a talk and to attend the weekly group discussions and that he was to abide by a curfew of 8 P.M. on weekdays, with an extension of one hour on weekends. He also tested Tony for marijuana use.
At curfew time, Tony was supposed to telephone Mr. Gattuso's beeper to indicate that he was home. Mr. Gattuso would then phone the home number to make sure. Tony was back living with his father, and as a first step, Mr. Gattuso had to help get a telephone installed. But Tony was never very cooperative.
"I beeped him once or twice," Tony said, "Then I didn't beep him again."
When the lab report came back, it showed that Tony had been smoking marijuana. Mr. Gattuso said he had been unable to reach Tony's father so he had phoned his sister to let her know about the drug use and to have Tony get in touch.
Ms. Wong said her case managers often talked with their youths and their parents by telephone every day and went to their homes two or three times a week. But she said that Tony's father had often failed to answer the telephone and that Mr. Gattuso had been unable to make appointments to visit. Tony's father would not speak with a reporter.
Another condition of Tony's release was that he return to school. But Halsey Junior High, where he had last attended class in the eighth grade, did not want to take him back. Gershwin Junior High, nearby, did not seem eager to have him, either. But Mr. Gattuso made some phone calls and, after about six weeks, Tony was admitted to Gershwin.
"I went there like two or three days," Tony said, "and that was it. Every time I went there, they weren't doing anything in class. They were practicing for graduation and I said, 'Why am I practicing for graduation? I wasn't even in school.' "
Tony said Mr. Gattuso had offered to help him find a job. But he wasn't interested. "I figured you work all these hours and just get a little bit of money," he said. "You can rob somebody in five minutes and get more money than you'd make in like a week of working."
 
The Return
Heading Quickly For a Crash
 On June 30 there were two armed robberies near the border of Brooklyn and Queens. The victim was killed in each case. The police quickly arrested a friend of Tony's as the trigger man. Two days later, Tony was roused from his bed at 3 A.M. and accused of being an accomplice. Charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of a weapon, he maintains that he and a third teen-age suspect were at a girlfriend's house at the time of the shootings.
Tony had been out on the streets for a little more than 11 weeks. However the murder charges are resolved, there is no doubt that he had been heading for a crash. He had gone straight back to his old friends. They were still packing semi-automatic pistols. They were still getting stoned and living a predator's life. They didn't steal cars or radios; they went for people.
"I was starting to do the same things again," Tony said in a conversation at the Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx, where he has been since his arrest on the murder charges. "I didn't really think about it, but I started doing it again, just being with the same people. I was supposed to go to school. I was supposed to call Brian. I didn't do anything."
Tony's friend Saul stayed out of jail a little longer. But in November, he was arrested and charged with robbery. He is now being held in a jail at Riker's Island. Tony said he might have done better if Mr. Gattuso had been more demanding. But caseworkers say it is impossible to be with their young people all the time. Moreover, the goal is get them moving on their own.
And even the best aftercare programs do not work for everyone. For Tony and countless others, there is little to build on. They have grown up in households where parents were too busy or too troubled to focus on raising children. Many of the children, the authorities say, do not learn to brush their teeth and bathe regularly until they are incarcerated.
Tony did even not know what kind of work his father had done before becoming disabled. He knew that his mother had worked in a school dining hall. But he wasn't quite sure what she had done.
"I keep saying, 'If only I had a place to put them while we work with them,' " said Ms. Wong, of the Youth Advocacy Project. "You work with them and then you send them back to the same environment, the same household, the same neighborhood. That's the biggest factor."

HEADLINE: A Year to Forget: 1994 Leaves Mexico Reeling

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: AMECAMECA, Mexico, Dec. 27

 BODY:
There were clues right from the start that something was very, very wrong with Mexico's 1994.
The year that was predicted to be such a good one had barely begun when an uprising broke out in the state of Chiapas. Following closely were the assassinations of top political figures -- the first since 1929 -- the kidnappings of powerful businessmen, vicious infighting in the long-ruling political party and Mexico's worst economic crisis of the last decade. 
 "The best that can be said about 1994," the president of the Association of Mexican Bankers, Jose Madariaga Lomelin, said recently, "is that it is almost over."
Not quite. As Mexico staggered into the last days of the year, Popocatepetl, a long-dormant volcano south of the biggest urban area in the world, threatened to blow.
More than 50,000 terrified people were evacuated from a string of small communities at the foot of the 17,887-foot volcano when it emitted huge clouds of steam and ash.
"In all my 43 years on earth I've never seen such a year as this, never" said Leon Herrera Garcia, a store owner from Mexico City who had come to this community in the shadow of the volcano to see Popo, as it is called, for himself. "We've had economic problems, political problems, social problems and now this gold ribbon to wrap it all up," he said sarcastically, nodding toward the volcano. "There's an old Mexican saying: The day that starts bad, ends bad. I guess that's what happened here this year."
Lots of nations are visited by misfortune and more than their share of disaster. But few have experienced such an abrupt reversal of fortune as Mexico has this year.
As 1993 ended, Mexico was riding high. The North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada was to go into effect on Jan. 1, and with the lowering of tariffs and the opening of free commerce Mexico was supposed to be inducted into the community of developed nations.
But hours into the new year, hundreds of masked Maya Indian rebels marched out of the forest, declaring the trade agreement "a death sentence" for Mexico's Indians and setting off the country most serious guerrilla uprising in a generation.
That seemed to blow the lid off simmering social and political unrest. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon had barely settled into his office at the beginning of this month when he received a written statement from the masked rebel leader who calls himself Subcomandante Marcos. "Welcome to the nightmare," the rebel wrote.
The list of Mexico's outrageous misfortunes goes on and on. The worst drought in a decade has cost the lives of 44 Tarahumara Indians in the northern state of Chihuahua.
Almost 50 Indians in the state of Morelos, celebrating the feast day of the Virgin of Guadelupe, Mexico's patron saint, died from drinking mezcal laced with fuel additive.
A banker who was identified by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as one of Mexico's most dynamic businessmen became a fugitive when regulators accused him of illegally lending himself $700 million from his bank's vaults.
High-profile business deals like the acquisition of most of the worldwide Westin hotel chain by an unknown 33-year-old Mexican entrepreneur were supposed to mark Mexico's promotion to the big leagues. Instead, no one would lend him the money. The deal collapsed, and so did a little of Mexico's reputation.
Mexico's national soccer team lost its World Cup berth on penalty kicks, and Julio Cesar Chavez, the boxer, lost his first match in 14 years. Even when there was good news like the victory of the Mexican runner German Silva in the New York City Marathon, it came with a twist. Mr. Silva took a wrong turn near the race's end and had to be pointed in the right direction.
At times it seemed that fate was not only wanton but cruel. Videotapes of the assassination of the PRI presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, on March 24 are agonizing because they clearly show an old six-shooter put to the candidate's head, but not the person holding the gun.
On the day that Mexico's most politically powerful woman, Senator Maria de Los Angeles Moreno, was named woman of the year, the No. 2 federal prosecutor was publicly accusing her of having obstructed the investigation into the assassination of her party's secretary general in September.
The devaluation of the peso, passage of Proposition 187, Operation Blockade -- the negative news dragged on and on. A year-end review on a Mexico City cable television network was given a name that sums it up accurately: "1994, The Year That Did Not End."
With the way things have gone, many Mexicans were not surprised when Popocatepetl rumbled back to life, even though the last major eruption was at the beginning of the 14th century, before the Spanish conquistadors arrived.
Billowing clouds have released tons of ash and melted part of the volcano's snowcap. Thousands of people spent Christmas Day in refugee centers. Scientists are still not sure what is happening, but Popo has calmed down enough to allow some of the refugees to return to their homes.
"The volcano is an apt metaphor for Mexican history," said Enrique Krauze, a popular historian in Mexico City. "Every end of the century since the 18th century has witnessed the same pattern: long periods of peace, order and progress followed by political violence and revolution. But the reason then and now has always been the same. Mexico has not been able to solve its basic problem, which is to find out how we should govern ourselves."
Some have argued that the Mexican political system, with a single party holding power for 65 years, is entering its final stage of decay. Others think 1994 is just an exaggeration of the normal six-year cycle in which Mexico's powerful President loses stature as soon as his party's candidate -- and his likely successor -- is named.
Alejandro Mendoza Carlillo, 30, an accountant who has lived in sight of Popo all his life, thinks it is something beyond politics. "Things happen," he said, "that we are powerless to explain."
Mexicans have been called stoic, even fatalistic, traits that come from both their Aztec and Spanish ancestors. And as 1995 aproaches, here in this town on the side of the volcano, disaster is never far from mind. Legend has it that there once was a town here called Ameca that was obliterated by the last eruption of Popo. The town was rebuilt atop the ruins of the old one and simply renamed Amecameca.
The townspeople here have their own way of dealing with a year that will not end. When Popo started trembling, they went up to a little chapel on the hill facing the volcano and removed a blackened religious figure representing Our Lord of the Sacred Mountain that was made from cornstalks more than 400 years ago.
"They held a procession and marched through the streets with the sacred image," said Sister Maria of the Sacred Heart, one of 16 Roman Catholic nuns with a convent at the chapel. "The next day, you can believe it, the volcano was calm again."
Bad luck? Bad politics? Demons inside the earth? Sister Maria rejected all proffered explanations.
"There is no such thing as a horrible year, not here, not anywhere," she said. "It's only that men sometimes think of it that way."

HEADLINE: Flexing Its Muscle, Italy's Northern League Beats Up on Itself

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The federalist Northern League, whose mercurial leader was instrumental in bringing about the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi last week, has since been plunged into one of the most troubled and unstable periods in the party's brief history.
It took a day of crisis meetings here on Tuesday to heal the rift caused when the League's leader, Umberto Bossi, lined up with the Communist opposition to challenge Mr. Berlusconi with a no-confidence motion in Parliament. The move divided the League, which had been part of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition. 
 Dozens of League legislators threatened to defect from the party if Mr. Bossi sought further support from the former Communists, now known as the Democratic Party of the Left, which along with the former Christian Democrats, now the Popular Party, teamed up on the no-confidence motions that prompted Mr. Berlusconi to resign.
Mr. Bossi did not say whether his approach to the left was strategy or a tactical move to help topple Mr. Berlusconi, but he did agree to forget the Communists. Today, the leader of the dissidents within the party, Roberto Maroni, the Justice Minister in the outgoing Government, joined Mr. Bossi in making demands for changes in Italian election and antitrust laws.
The proposals were included in the party's position that Mr. Bossi presented today to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who is holding consultations with all Italian parties before deciding whether to call new elections or appoint a new Prime Minister-designate to try to forge a new government that can win approval from the current Parliament.
The Northern League wants Mr. Scalfaro to appoint a government of technicians to enact a new election law that would give Italy a winner-take-all system like that in the United States, antitrust legislation and a law regulating public and private television. The latter measures would be to avoid a repetition of the suspicions of conflict of interest that haunted Mr. Berlusconi.
But even as Mr. Bossi marched to the Quirinale Palace today to put his party's proposals to President Scalfaro, there seemed to be a real possibility that the only glue holding the League together was the fear that if elections were held now, it might end up the big losers.
"Our common point is not to go to new elections," said Luigi Negri, a Member of Parliament and spokesman for the League dissidents. "This would provoke an economic crisis, and one is unable to understand what new alignment would emerge. On the contrary, there would be even greater confusion."
The League's successes, going from a predominantly regional movement to a national party that shared power in Mr. Berlusconi's Government, were born of exceptional circumstances in the late 1980's: the fall of the Berlin Wall, the crisis in Italy's Communist Party, the decline of the old ruling Christian Democratic party, and the judicial investigation into charges of corruption among Italy's mainstream parties, especially the Christian Democrats and their major ally, the Socialist Party.
For the moment, the League has deferred personnel and policy debate to a party congress scheduled for February. But leaders like Mr. Negri recognize a conflict ahead.
"The League is now a part of Government, but it was born as a revolutionary movement," he said. "Now its task is to transform itself, to become a governing party, to take responsibility, to create a leadership class. But there are strong internal differences over entering into a view of this type."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
A Liberal Looks Back With Pride

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
AFTER more than two decades in government, Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, makes no apologies. He is what he is:
"A liberal. That's me. I'm an unabashed liberal. I still believe in government as an institution for improving the lives of people, as a mechanism to do good." 
 What an admission. In this era of privatizing and downsizing, someone is saying hurrah for government. But Mr. Brezenoff is in an introspective mood these days, and, in his mild but determined way, blunt. With Republicans governing New Jersey and, imminently, New York, this Democrat decided to quit the Port Authority for the presidency of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.
Mr. Brezenoff realizes only too well that after the country's right turn in November, many now look upon public servants like him as anachronisms.
"I'm not blind to what occurred in this last election and many others in the last 20 years," he said yesterday, overlooking his breathtaking two-state domain from the World Trade Center. "Obviously it reflects broad dissatisfaction, focused, wrongly, I believe, on government. There's a sense of government as the enemy. The fact is, this country is going to have to generate millions of new jobs and they can't come only from the private sector. To keep society whole and employed is going to have to involve government."
WITH politicians everywhere saying less is more, Mr. Brezenoff is saying more is more, and he predicts that the pendulum will swing back some day. For the moment, he believes, many white voters are fixated on "red button" issues like the death penalty and welfare because they are hurting economically, and need to fix blame somewhere.
"I was at a dinner party recently, with a mixed group of people from business, finance and so on," he said. "A lot of people talked, with vehemence, about Medicaid as scandalous. They heatedly argued for eliminating Medicaid.
"My gut reaction was, 'When you see it as a scandal, are you talking about millions of people who didn't have medical care before, and wouldn't have it now except for Medicaid?' Their focus was on excess, on the margins, on imperfections. Who wouldn't argue we have to do these things better? But who could argue the United States would be a better place without Medicaid?"
When Mr. Brezenoff got involved in public life, there was no Medicaid. It was the early, hopeful sixties, when the graduate of Jefferson High School and Brooklyn College foreshadowed his activist career by protesting against the all-white construction crews building the Downstate Medical Center.
He later joined John V. Lindsay's mayoral administration, spent nine years with the Ford Foundation, and rejoined city government under former Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1978. As a Commissioner, First Deputy Mayor and Port Authority chief, he has earned a reputation for calm temperament, stubborn liberalism and managerial skills -- qualities the public saw when he led the revival of the World Trade Center after the 1993 bombing.
At the Port Authority, he put some of his theories into practice with workfare and summer job programs. Like Mr. Koch, he calls himself a "liberal with sanity," and enhanced the Authority's 42d Street bus terminal by getting police officers to steer vagrants into social programs.
THOSE are the kinds of services government must provide, he said. To critics of welfare, he acknowledges a problem with chronic welfare recipients, but says welfare does work for "the millions of people who turn to public assistance temporarily when they lose their jobs or are fleeing abusive husbands."
"If it helps large numbers of people to bridge difficult circumstances I don't see how that doesn't work," he said. "The fact is, welfare benefits have eroded substantially in this country because of inflation and no increases."
What's more, Mr. Brezenoff thinks it's awful that suburban schools get more aid per student than city schools do, that the safety net is frayed, that the government isn't doing enough pump-priming -- all rejected totems of the New Deal and its successors. Yes, the decimated family needs fixing, Mr. Brezenoff said.
"But the solution can't just come from that," he said. "Some of the worst days I had as Deputy Mayor was when I visited Rikers and saw all those young men. I'm not going to say people aren't responsible for their actions. But on the other hand, when I see a population that large, I'm going to conclude that in addition to holding the individual responsible, there is a role for society."
Mr. Brezenoff does not speak like a man about to leave government. Indeed, he fantasized about taking on one more public challenge, like running the city's troubled Child Welfare Agency. But the time had come for personal reasons, too: Next month the 57-year-old Mr. Brezenoff, who is divorced and has a 24-year-old son, is marrying his longtime companion, Jo Wright, a singer.
Besides, right after the election, a colleague gave him a picture frame in the shape of a dinosaur. With his photo in it. "It was friendly. And funny," he said. And maybe a little prescient.

Padres and Astros Make a 12-Player Swap

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Operating on the economic theory that a club has to spend money to make money, the new owner of the San Diego Padres reversed the free fall yesterday and restocked his team with some talent. In the biggest baseball deal in numbers in 37 years, the Padres made a 12-player trade with the Houston Astros, acquiring third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Steve Finley in their group of six players.
"We want a competitive, winning team, an exciting team," said Larry Lucchino, the Padres' new chief executive under the new owner, John Moores. "To improve this team, on the field and in stability and prosperity, expenses and revenues have to go up." 
 In adding $8.6 million in salary for Caminiti and Finley for next season, the Padres insured that their expenses will rise. Their payroll would have been $13.2 million for a full 1994 season under an ownership that had stripped the team of expenses and talent.
"With an improved team," Lucchino said by telephone from his law office in Washington, "improvement will come on the revenue side."
Besides Caminiti and Finley, the Padres received Andujar Cedeno, the Astros' starting shortstop; Roberto Petagine, a minor league first baseman, and Brian Williams, a sometime starting pitcher, plus a player to be named or $50,000 in cash.
The Astros, who suddenly more closely resemble the previous Padres than the present Padres do, succeeded in their quest to shed salary and become a younger, cheaper team. They received two starting outfielders, Phil Plantier and Derek Bell; two pitchers yet to establish themselves, Pedro Martinez and Doug Brocail, and two infielders, Ricky Gutierrez and Craig Shipley.
If the trade remains a 12-player transaction, it will be the largest in numbers since the Detroit Tigers and the Kansas City Athletics exchanged 13 players in 1957, including Billy Martin, Gus Zernial and Duke Maas.
The general managers, Bob Watson of Houston and Randy Smith of San Diego, began discussing this trade at the general managers meetings in Phoenix in mid-November.
"As we got closer to new ownership, Larry Lucchino and I talked," Smith said from San Diego. "They were prepared to add some salary if I felt it could improve the club. We kept adding to it and put it to bed yesterday."
Although Smith and Watson worked out the details, Lucchino said he and Tal Smith, the Astros' new president and Randy's father, agreed to it on Tuesday. Watson chose to view the deal from the baseball viewpoint rather than the economic one, although it has been widely known that the Astros were out to make serious inroads into their $30.5 million payroll. They already had traded Pete Harnisch, a $3 million pitcher.
"It doesn't leave us short," Watson said from Houston, discussing the loss of three front-line players. "There are some very positive things."
The Astros, he explained, got a right fielder, Bell, whom they have liked for a long time; a left-handed power hitter, Plantier, to help protect the right-handed Jeff Bagwell in the lineup, and a left-handed pitcher, Martinez, whom they needed. Furthermore, Watson said, the trade opens spots for two rookies, shortstop Orlando Miller and third baseman Phil Nevin.
"We're positive that this was the right baseball move," Watson said. "To be real honest, Caminiti and Finley were going to be free agents next year. Under the new system, we have control of these players for at least three years and some five years."
Caminiti batted .283, hit 18 home runs and drove in 75 runs last season. Finley batted .276. Cedeno committed 23 errors, most in the major leagues.
Plantier, struck by injuries and slumps, fell from 34 home runs and 100 runs batted in to 18 and 41 in the strike-shortened season. Bell batted .311 and had 24 stolen bases.

AT&T Seeks to Broaden Rate Increases

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The AT&T Corporation, having received Federal approval to increase monthly long-distance rates, is now seeking to raise other rates, including those for calling cards and operator-handled calls.
The company filed the proposed increases today with the Federal Communications Commission and said the new rates would generate $259 million in additional revenue. 
 The plan would affect far fewer callers than the rate increase for monthly long-distance service that went into effect on Dec. 16, said Joseph Nacchio, president of AT&T's Consumer Communications Services unit. Exact figures were not available.
An AT&T spokesman, Jim McGann, said the proposed higher rates were a result of inflation and increased costs for providing the services.
If approved, the new rates would take effect on Jan. 10.
Under AT&T's proposed pricing, domestic calling card and operator-handled calls would go up by 3.8 percent. Direct-dial calls from the United States to some countries would increase by 1.3 percent and monthly subscription fees for some domestic savings plans would increase by 2.4 percent.
The most popular savings plans, True USA and True World, will not be affected because they do not charge subscription fees, Mr. McGann said.
Among the affected plans are Any Hour Saver, in which the $10 monthly subscription would rise to $10.75, and Reach Out 24 Hour, in which the fee would rise to $9.50 from $8.70, he said.
On Dec. 16 AT&T increased monthly long-distance rates by about 35 cents a customer, generating about $274 million in additional revenue annually.
The new pricing request also seeks to increase rates by an average of 5 percent for USA Direct Service calls. That service allows a person in another country to place a call to the United States using an American operator. The proposed increase would apply to 27 countries.

HEADLINE: Bailout Plan For Mexico Wins Praise

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Bankers and financial analysts gave a cautious welcome yesterday to reports that the United States was preparing a multibillion-dollar international aid package for Mexico. But they cautioned that any revival of confidence in Mexico's battered currency and economy would remain fragile for a long time to come.
"The aid should give the Mexicans time to show the new measures they are taking to support their devaluation are going to work," said James Colmenares, vice president for portfolio management at Morgan Stanley Asset Management. 
 The Clinton Administration is leading an effort to put together a rescue package for Mexico, according to people with knowledge of the plan. They would not give details about the size or the way it would work. But the Treasury has discussed some possibilities with investment bankers and others to test the sentiment in financial markets.
Mr. Colmenares and other bankers and Mexican analysts said they believed that the United States, with possible help from Canada, was preparing a $15 billion to $20 billion aid package to help Mexico repay billions of dollars of Mexican treasury bills held by foreigners. Those bills, known as tesobonos, fall due in the coming months and must be redeemed if investors decide to cash them in.
One approach could be a line of credit upon which Mexico could draw, effectively borrowing the money from countries participating in it, the bankers said.
A second, more complex, approach involves turning billions of the tesobonos into three-year notes, which would give the Mexican Government a longer time to pay them off. Tesobonos have maturities of three months to one year.
To make such three-year notes attractive to investors, they would offer an interest rate of about 12 percent to 15 percent, or about twice what is now paid on a three-year United States Treasury note. Yesterday, those notes were trading at a yield of 7.76 percent.
In addition, the notes, which would be paid off by the Mexicans, would also carry some kind of United States guarantee that would assure that the dollars would be available to pay both the interest and principal during the next three years.
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon plans to outline his strategy for restoring international confidence in Mexico's economy in an address to the nation scheduled for Monday. Mr. Colmenares said he expected the Mexican leader to make "a very concrete statement" on the Government's plans for further sales of state-run companies, including the electric utility industry, to the public.
But he warned that there could be new problems when the 60-day wage freeze, to which unions agreed last week, expired. "Will the Government be able to hold the line on wages then?" he asked.
Mexico needs a new injection of emergency financial aid because billions of dollars of tesobonos will come due this year, many of them owned by foreigners, especially Americans.
With confidence in the peso so low, foreign holders of these bonds, whose interest and principal is calculated at the current value of the dollar, are expected to cash them in as they mature.
But the dollar reserves of the Mexican central bank, which stood at about $29 billion early in the year, are currently thought to be near $7 billion and far too low to meet the expected outflow.
Bankers do not agree precisely on the number of tesobonos that will fall due in the near future or on the number that are owned by foreigners. But Morgan Stanley Capital Management estimates that $29 billion will mature in the year ahead and believes that one-third of those, valued at $10.6 billion, are owned by foreigners.
Alfredo Viegas, Latin American strategist at Salomon Brothers, said an aid package in the $10 billion to $15 billion range "is the minimum that would be credible." He said if that could be done, he would expect the peso, which closed yesterday at 4.975 pesos to the dollar, to rally to "the low fours to the dollar." That would mean a peso would be valued at about 24 cents, compared with yesterday's close of 20 cents.
But Mr. Viegas was cautious about Mexico's chances of attracting a new inflow of foreign investment funds to help cover its large foreign trade deficit. "Mutual fund redemptions and inflows tend to lag bad news," he said, adding that investors might pull out of Mexican funds or at least stop putting new money into them early next year as a result of the losses this year. "Where is the new money coming from?" he asked.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Silver Prices Rise Sharply Amid Currency Gyrations

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Silver prices leapt yesterday as a sharp drop in the dollar set off buying of precious metals.
Analysts also attributed silver's gains to civil and economic problems in Mexico, the largest producer of silver, and to a seasonal tendency toward higher commodity prices. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 0.65 point, it's sixth consecutive daily gain, to 236.84. 
 "I think what we're seeing here is a year-end rally in commodities in general and the metals are benefiting from it," said Peter Cardillo, research director for Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
Silver for January delivery rose 10.2 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $4.884 an ounce, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Dec. 1. The March contract rose 10.3 cents, to $4.93 an ounce.
February gold rose $2, to $385.30 an ounce, on the Comex. January platinum rose $3.10, to $417.80 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The surge was silver's strongest one-day gain since Sept. 20.
The metals rose as the dollar tumbled against other world currencies on worries that Mexico's financial crisis would adversely affect the dollar and Treasury securities. There were reports that Mexico would try to increase a $6 billion credit line with the United States and use the borrowed money to buy pesos.
"Yesterday and the last couple of days, the markets have told us the U.S. dollar and the U.S. stock market were havens of safety," said Leonard Kaplan, vice president and chief trader of precious metals at the Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. "Today, the markets said, 'No, we didn't mean the dollar, we meant the German deutsche mark,' which is farther away from Mexico."
Silver futures also were pushed up by a "knee-jerk response" to civil tensions in Mexico, said George Milling-Stanley, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, lifted by strong gains in heating oil on forecasts for colder weather this weekend in the Midwest and Northeast. February crude rose 15 cents, to $17.79 a barrel, and January home heating oil surged 0.86 cent, to 50.11 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Orange County Seeks Advice on Bond Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., is asking some of the nation's top brokerage firms to devise ways for it to sell bonds to help pay its debts in the wake of its bankruptcy filing.
Salomon Brothers, the county's financial adviser, has sent a request for proposals to 17 municipal bond firms, asking them for plans to underwrite securities sales "in connection with a restructuring of the county's financial liabilities." 
 Orange County and an investment fund it managed for about 180 municipalities declared bankruptcy Dec. 6, after the fund lost more than $2 billion on risky investments that fell when interest rates rose. The fund's assets total about $5.4 billion.
Separately yesterday, Orange County bailed out two financially troubled Southern California cities that placed money in its investment fund. Santa Ana and Montebello each received about $14 million to cover emergency payments on their debts and prevent further defaults.
 Montebello, located in Los Angeles County, owes noteholders $25 million due on Dec. 30. Santa Ana, the Orange County seat, defaulted on Dec. 15 on a $5.24 million payment. Its bondholders will be paid on Jan. 3, an official said.
The Orange County board of supervisors is considering various plans to raise money to pay the county's debts, including the sale of the county's John Wayne Airport and other properties, budget cuts and securities sales.
A bond sale is not necessarily going to occur, Orange County officials said. The request for proposals "does not constitute a commitment on the part of the county to effect an offering," the three-page document said.
The plan is being drawn up "in the event the county wants to go to the bond market," said Sandra Sternberg, an Orange County spokeswoman. "There is no offering on the table. There is no date or time" even tentatively set for a sale.
There are precedents for bond-financed bailouts of municipalities.
When New York City teetered near insolvency in the mid-1970s, New York State legislators created the state Municipal Assistance Corporation, a bond agency that financed the city through its fiscal crisis.
Philadelphia also weathered a cash-flow crisis in the early 1990's with the help of a specially created state bond agency, the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority.
"Anything's possible," said David Herships, municipal bond analyst at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. "As part of an overall plan it's feasible" if the county can identify sources of revenue that would back the bonds.
Orange County is probably just trying to determine whether bond firms are interested in taking on what is likely to be a daunting task, some municipal market participants said.
For the time being, the county's financial advisers are concentrating on liquidating the pool's investment holdings to protect the fund against further losses and to raise cash to pay lenders and investors. In the last two weeks, Orange County's investment pool raised $3.34 billion through the sale of securities, raising $1.81 billion for the pool and $1.53 billion to pay back lenders.
Orange County solicited a bond plan from some of the top securities firms. The 17 companies asked for proposals included Goldman, Sachs; Lehman Brothers; Smith Barney; CS First Boston; PaineWebber; Bear, Stearns; J. P. Morgan Securities; Morgan Stanley; Prudential Securities; BA Securities; A. G. Edwards & Sons; Dillon, Read; Stone & Youngberg; Merrill Lynch; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; Artemis Capital Group, and Pryor, McClendon, Counts.
The proposal asked underwriters to acknowledge that they would be paid fees only at completion of an underwriting. It also asked each firm to describe the services it would provide and to provide its qualifications, a list of personnel assigned to the underwriting and experience in such types of underwritings.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Declining Dollar Pushes Treasury Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday in thin trading, hurt by a sharp decline in the value of the dollar.
Prices of the longer maturities declined as some investors sold bonds and turned to the short end of the market to wait out current jitters. The investors were concerned that a falling dollar would discourage foreign investors from buying United States debt securities. The dollar was affected by worries about the possible impact of the financial crisis in Mexico. 
 The bond market views a weaker dollar as inflationary, said Jim Madelmayer, a vice president at S. G. Warburg & Company, because it means it will cost Americans more to import goods.
But traders noted that thinly traded markets almost always exaggerate price movements. Thin trading in the currency markets also exaggerated the dollar's decline.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 26/32 , to 967/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.83 percent, from 7.76 percent on Tuesday.
Short-maturity issues, particulary the three- and six-month bills, were the only maturities benefiting from year-end demand and continued flows of investment out of Mexico.
 Before yesterday's decline, Treasury securities were steady in light trading as the yield gap between a 2-year note and a 30-year bond narrowed to as little as 7 basis points -- the smallest since May 3, 1990. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
By late in the day, the gap had widened to 14 basis points. A narrower spread suggests rising investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates enough to control inflation.
The market turns its attention today to the release of the Government's leading economic indicators for November and a bill auction.
The influence of the index of leading indicators, however, has diminished, James Madelmayer, a vice president at S. G. Warburg & Company said, because of the lag in reporting. "It used to be important; now, it's probably not even in the top 10 movers of importance to the marketplace," he said.
In other economic data that could move the market, new-home sales for November are scheduled to be released tomorrow.
The Treasury said yesterday that it would auction $14 billion of 16-day cash management bills today. The bills will be issued on Jan. 3, 1995, and mature on Jan. 19, 1995. Minimum bids will be in amounts of $1 million.
Trading in municipal bonds saw little change yesterday, as investors with only two sessions left before the year's end, focused on swapping bonds to record capital losses for tax purposes, traders said.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively traded municipal issues was unchanged yesterday, at 6.90 percent. Helping to buoy municipal prices were the actions of some securities firms that are buying bonds and building inventories, anticipating higher prices in January because issuance will not be as high over the next 30 days, The Bond Buyer reported yesterday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Retreat In Side Effect of Peso's Crisis

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled in thin trading against the German mark and other leading currencies yesterday as Mexico's financial crisis roiled financial markets in the United States.
Steady for most of the day, the dollar plunged more than 3 pfennigs in early afternoon trading in New York. 
 "This has everything to do with the peso," said Laurence Hayward, a trader at Nationsbank of Texas in Houston.
The dollar fell as low as 1.5410 marks, its lowest level since Nov. 15, before recovering to 1.5450 marks in late New York trading yesterday, down from 1.5757 marks. It was the steepest one-day fall against the mark since July 11.
The dollar also slipped as low as 98.75 yen, its lowest level since Nov. 29, before recovering to 99.30 yen, from 100.32 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also fell to 1.3040 Swiss francs from 1.3295 francs on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.5700 from $1.5495.
Traders said the dollar fell quickly yesterday because trading in the final week of the year is typically much less active than usual. With so many people out of the market, there were fewer buyers for the dollars available, dealers and analysts said.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell 12.7 percent, to 4.9750 pesos from 5.700 pesos on Tuesday. That lessened the dollar's gain against the peso to 44 percent since the Mexican Government decided last week first to devalue its currency and then to let it trade freely against the dollar.
Speculation that the United States may do more to help support the peso helped bolster the Mexican currency, traders said.
The Canadian dollar also tumbled yesterday, falling as low as 71.14 United States cents, its lowest level since March 1986. In late New York trading, the Canadian currency settled at 71.16 United States cents, down from 71.41 United States cents on Tuesday.
The Canadian dollar continues to suffer from concern about Canada's large debt burden, the movement for secession in Quebec and the Bank of Canada's failure to match the magnitude of the interest rate increases made by the United States Federal Reserve.
"The whole region of North America has turned into a peso bloc," said Richard Koss, currency sales manager at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
From Kodak, two images of its competitive position.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AS far as the Eastman Kodak Company is concerned:
(a) It's a big, bad world out there, one in which the giant American film company is engaged in a grueling duel with Fuji Photo Film for domination of the global market. 
 (b) The past era of monopoly is long gone, now that half a dozen other multinational corporations have made huge investments in the color film business.
"They can't have it both ways," says Lawrence White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
Actually, maybe they can. In the last two years, notes Greg Rushford, publisher of a Washington-based newsletter called The Rushford Report, Kodak's lawyers have positioned themselves on both sides of this argument. What's more, they have won both times around.
To some, this only demonstrates that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. But, more to the point, it also reflects the contradictions between America's antitrust and international trade laws -- contradictions that Corporate America is discovering can be exploited at the expense of both foreign competitors and American consumers.
Start with the trade case. Kodak filed dumping charges against Fuji in 1993, contending that Fuji, the world's second-largest producer, was competing unfairly in the American market for photographic chemicals and paper. Kodak's experts, Jerry Hausman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Paul Krugman of Stanford, hypothesized that Fuji was selling billions of dollars' worth of products below cost in the American market to discourage the no-longer-invincible Kodak from investing in the next generation of photo technology. Once Kodak slipped behind, they reasoned, Fuji would be able to reap the rewards of its commanding position by raising prices.
If such arguments sound familiar, go to the head of the class. Kodak repackaged the old case against so-called predatory pricing in the new language of strategic trade theory. And it worked: the International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial Federal agency, ruled in October 1993 that Fuji was selling photo paper at less than fair value. Before the Commerce Department had a chance to calculate the penalty, Fuji agreed to raise prices.
What was good for Kodak was also good for American consumers -- or so Kodak suggested. According to the Kodak version, Fuji would have been willing to absorb huge losses in the short run to drive Kodak from segments of the film business and then reap monopoly profits.
But even as Kodak was warning that it was in danger of losing this battle of titans, it was explaining separately to Federal District Court Judge Michael Telesca in Rochester that Kodak should be released from two antitrust consent decrees because the world market for film was too competitive to be dominated by one company.
Kodak was hobbled by the courts earlier in the century in response to what its critics thought were attempts to monopolize the market for amateur film. In 1921, Kodak was barred from selling what are now called private-label brands -- the house brands sold in great volume by discount chains like Wal-Mart. And in 1954, it agreed to stop tying sales of unexposed film to film processing, thereby handicapping its capacity to dominate the processing business.
But Kodak argued -- and the judge agreed -- that the consent decrees were obsolete. Thanks to computer-based technology, color film can now be processed by thousands of independent shops. And while film in the bright yellow box may still command a premium price, public acceptance of high quality film from Fuji, Konica, Agfa and 3M virtually guarantees that the market will remain competitive, however aggressively any company tries to dominate it. In lifting the consent decrees, Judge Telesca cited a 1986 Federal court ruling that "predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."
Judge Telesca may well be right. The globalization of markets, the fickle nature of consumer preferences, the unpredictable path of technological change and the relative ease of raising capital all make predatory pricing a highly problematic strategy. But by the same token, they make Kodak's theory that Fuji was selling cheap today in order to sell dear tomorrow look rather dicey. What, after all, could Fuji hope to gain by losing scads of money if the prospects for successful predation later on were so remote?
The anti-dumping laws, says F. M. Scherer, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, are grounded on ideas that economists no longer take very seriously. But what in other circumstances might merely be cause for chuckles about the tangled webs that lawyers weave, Mr. Scherer views as deeply ironic. "Competition from Fuji," he explained, "is largely responsible for the rising quality and falling price of color photography."
Perhaps the best news for consumers, then, is that it took so long before Kodak discovered that investments in lawyers pay as well as investments in film technology.

HEADLINE: Mexico: Don't Panic Over the Peso

 BODY:
Mexico's peso crisis has obviously shaken Mexican officials and foreign investors alike and could damage Mexico's short-term economic prospects. But it does not reflect fundamental flaws in Mexico's newly liberalized economy. Moreover, President Ernesto Zedillo's economic ministers have responded to the challenge competently, avoiding premature efforts to peg a new exchange rate. The markets will eventually stabilize. Yesterday the peso rebounded some 15 percent.
Devaluations inspire temporary crises of confidence, and this one is no exception. It is likely to lead to slower growth, faster inflation and fewer imports from the U.S. A larger gap between U.S. and Mexican wages could tempt more Mexicans to cross the border seeking work. 
 Opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement will be tempted to say they told you so. But without Nafta, these negative consequences might have been even more pronounced. Nafta also helped bring emergency financial support from the U.S., in the form of $6 billion in credits aimed at shoring up investor confidence. A far larger package is now reportedly being prepared.
It is up to Mr. Zedillo, however, to reassure poor Mexicans that after years of waiting for the rewards of economic liberalization to trickle down, they will not be put off again with promises. His task will be all the harder because restoring confidence abroad will require a degree of budgetary austerity at home that could force Mr. Zedillo to defer some of his planned new social spending for awhile.
But he need not retreat from his promises to open up Mexico's political system by disentangling the ruling party from the government and assuring more honest state and local elections. There are risks in liberalizing a semi-authoritarian political system at a time of disappointment. The risks of not opening up would be far graver.
Traditionally, outgoing Mexican administrations take responsibility for any devaluations during a transition period. But Mr. Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas, gambled that foreign investment would soon recover from the slowdown it experienced amid last year's political troubles and that no devaluation would be necessary. It was reasonable to bet that Mexico needed to woo investors with a period of exchange-rate stability and could afford the cost of growing trade deficits.
But those investors held back, and Mr. Zedillo had little choice but to let the peso fall. His Finance Minister has been criticized for denying the possibility of devaluation until the last moment, but that is standard practice everywhere. Now there are demands that the Government intervene to defend a new exchange rate, but that would be premature before the market begins to settle down on its own.
Mr. Zedillo, who won the ruling party's presidential nomination only after the original nominee was assassinated, and won the presidency after the fairest vote count in modern Mexican history, is being faulted in some quarters for not being a take-charge leader like his predecessor. Yet he could turn out to be the right man for these times.
He understands the economic imperatives of the moment and is right to resist calls to defend an indefensible fixed peso rate. He also seems to understand the political imperatives just as clearly and has committed his administration to long-overdue political reforms. He should remain confident, disregard panicky advice and maintain his sensible course.

HEADLINE: Time to Look at Baseball's Exemption

 BODY:
The owners of baseball's 28 major-league teams have declared an impasse in wage negotiations and imposed what their players dreaded most -- a cap on team payrolls. The players vow to continue their strike and seek legal remedies. The result is that baseball's wealthy owners and players have left the game in even sorrier shape than last year, when their failure to reach a new labor agreement destroyed the end of the regular season, the playoffs and the World Series.
This year there could be no games at all -- or at best games played by impostors. The two sides have a responsibility to resume talks. The owners may not want to, but two influential U.S. Senators -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah -- think they have hit upon the right stimulus. They will offer legislation ending the owners' cherished, 72-year-old exemption from antitrust laws. That exemption gives the owners uniquely broad powers over wages and work rules that, the Senators believe, dampen their incentive to compromise. 
 The idea deserves a hearing. Absent a rapid negotiated settlement, baseball's immediate future is dismal. The players have lodged an unfair-labor-practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board that, they hope, will eventually lead to a court injunction against the salary-cap plan. But such an injunction could trigger a lockout by the owners, who say they cannot afford to continue under the old economic rules.
With spring training less than two months away, the owners are already scrambling for replacement players ("Can you hit the curve ball? Yes? You're hired.") But will the replacements be major-league strikebreakers? Minor leaguers hungry for a shot at the big time? Retreads? In any case, they will not be the polished professionals whom people pay increasingly good money to see.
Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles, a maverick owner who opposed the cap, predicts artistic disaster followed by financial disaster. "I looked in the phone book for replacement players and I couldn't find any," he said, suggesting that baseball's greatest need may soon be replacement fans.
It is this relentless destruction of the game that has now focused the attention of Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Hatch on the antitrust exemption. In labor-management struggles, the exemption has the effect of allowing the owners to act as a cartel, imposing industrywide salary limits while enjoying substantial immunity from any lawsuits the players might file. To Donald Fehr, the players' negotiator, that means the owners have little incentive to bargain seriously because, at the end of the day, they can do pretty much what they want.
Some critics want to revoke the exemption entirely, reasoning that no other professional sport is given such license. Others say the survival of the minor leagues depends, in part, on the power to control payrolls and transfer players permitted by the exemption; they would narrow the exemption but not eliminate it.
Either way, changing the exemption will not solve baseball's troubles. It would limit the owners' ability to impose a cap unilaterally. But it will not solve the problem that has bedeviled baseball ever since the players negotiated the right to move more freely from team to team. That problem is to find ways to alleviate the effects of a bidding system that has inflated payroll costs and put a few franchises in peril -- without at the same time destroying the players' right to sell their services on a relatively free market. That question can only be answered by the people whose egos and livelihoods are bound up in the game -- the players and owners.

HEADLINE: Proponent of Work for Welfare Is Among 9 Pataki Appointments

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki yesterday named Westchester's Commissioner for Social Services to do for the state what she has done at home -- dramatically reduce the cost of welfare. But unable to persuade Commissioner Mary E. Glass to sign on for the long term, he agreed to limit her appointment to 90 days.
Aides to Mr. Pataki, who named eight other top members of his administration yesterday, said that even if Ms. Glass were unable to complete the task of revamping the Department of Social Services, he would have sent a strong signal that he intended to make good on a campaign pledge to change welfare. 
 In the last five years, Ms. Glass, 53, has overseen an initiative in which 60 percent of those on home relief, the welfare program for single adults, were dropped from the Westchester rolls because of a requirement that able-bodied people work and other efforts to cut down on costs. Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman said he wants Ms. Glass to duplicate the program throughout the state. Some counties already have similar programs in place.
"It's important to put forth that we are committed to workfare, not welfare," said Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki.
While some critics question the initiative's compassion, as well as its long-range ability to wean people from welfare, Mr. Pataki's aides estimated that it could save more than $450 million, or 1.3 percent of the state's general-fund budget of $34 billion. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has announced his intention to pursue a similar program.
"I think the American people and the people of New York are a generous people, if people are willing to help themselves," said Ms. Glass, who said she wants the state job only for three months because of greater loyalties to her county position. "If they are not, that's what makes the taxpayers resistant to programs."
Along with Ms. Glass, the appointments yesterday, while only a portion of the top jobs in the bureaucracy, began to reveal the contours of Mr. Pataki's government. The nine names included old friends, campaign compatriots like Bernadette Castro collecting chits from Mr. Pataki, and seasoned professionals in business or government.
And while some are steeped in the substance of their agencies, others, like Ms. Castro, who will become Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, seem to be novices in the area of government their agencies will oversee. Ms. Castro, 50, the furniture heir who ran unsuccessfully this year against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, conceded that she had not seen many of the state's parks and, while she wanted to protect them and encourage greater use, she was not sure exactly what her mandate would be.
"You know, I have to visit them first, I really do," said Ms. Castro, who apparently survived her public complaints that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's political patron, had undercut her campaign. "There are a lot of treasures that New York has that I think have been kept a secret."
Mr. Pataki, who did not appear in public today, released a statement saying the appointments reflected his commitment to a new direction for government. "These appointments represent New York's best and brightest," he said. "Each is committed to sweeping, fundamental change and in bringing hope and opportunity to New York State."
The Governor-elect has now announced his choices for 14 of the state's top jobs, perhaps a quarter of the major appointments he must make. The salaries of those hired today -- all of whom except the Secretary of State require confirmation by the state Senate -- range from $90,832 to $95,635.
Of those appointed so far, 10 are men, 4 are women; 12 are white and 2 are black; 12 are Republicans, 1 is a Democrat and 1 is not registered in any party.
In addition to Ms. Castro, Mr. Pataki appointed two other people with close ties to the campaign. Joseph E. Holland, a Harlem lawyer and entrepreneur, was named Commissioner of Housing and Urban Renewal. Mr. Holland, 38, who is black, had been a Republican candidate for Attorney General but stepped aside at the party convention this year and was made Mr. Pataki's co-campaign chairman.
Mr. Pataki also named Alexander F. Treadwell, 48, a vice chairman of the New York State Republican Committee, as Secretary of State, a job that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo once held.
Mr. Pataki continued to tap old friends for jobs. He appointed Richard E. Jackson, a lifelong friend with whom he ran track and played basketball in Peekskill, Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Mr. Jackson, 49, the Governor-elect's second black appointee, was elected Mayor of Peekskill after Mr. Pataki held the same position, and he has been a mathematics teacher since 1968. He does not have a background in transportation.
"His administrative background and experience qualify him to serve as Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles," Mr. Pataki said.
Mr. Pataki retained one official appointed by Mr. Cuomo: James W. McMahon, 51, a career state trooper who is not registered in a party, will remain as Superintendent of the State Police, a job he was appointed to last April.
For three other appointments, Mr. Pataki chose experts from the private sector. He named Neil D. Levin, 40, a vice president and investment banker at Goldman, Sachs and Company, to be Superintendent of Banking. Mr. Levin, who has been with Goldman, Sachs since 1985, is a former aide to Mr. D'Amato, and the two have remained friends.
George C. Sinnott, a private arbitrator and member of the State Employment Relations Board, was named Commissioner of the State Department of Civil Service. And Michael H. Urbach, 51, an accountant in Albany, was named Commissioner of Taxation and Finance.
The Westchester welfare program, under Ms. Glass, had two main components. First was an intensive screening to insure that people on home relief were actually eligible for it, and that people who were sick or addicted to drugs or alcohol were shifted to a Federal benefits program. The second element was a requirement that able-bodied recipients work 20 hours a week -- usually performing menial chores like scrubbing graffiti or removing debris for local governments.
The result was that in Westchester, where there are roughly 6,000 people now on home relief, the program grew less than 1 percent over five years, saving an estimated $40 million, Ms. Glass said. In comparison, the growth in New York City over the same period was 49 percent.
But some skeptics say the work requirement has hampered people's ability to search for permanent jobs. It is also unclear how easily the program could be transferred immediately to New York State or New York City, because of the much greater numbers and difficulty in duplicating the computer-tracking system of recipients that Westchester has in place.
Ms. Glass said she believes such a rapid expansion could be accomplished during her short tenure, and that software developed in Westchester could be upgraded readily to handle the entire state.
"This is not hard," said Ms. Glass, who is unmarried and lives in Lake Peekskill. "I'm going to jump-start it because I have real-life experience with programs over a number of years."
Michael J. Dowling, who resigned yesterday as Mr. Cuomo's social services commissioner, called the Westchester program effective but said it was just one of many similar efforts the state has been trying to encourage among counties. While praising the savings, he said the program represents only a limited approach to welfare change. It does not, for example, affect the largest welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which serves single people with children.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Governor-elect George E. Pataki's choice for Commissioner of Social Services referred incorrectly in some copies to his administration's plan for reductions in the home-relief welfare program. The changes would not require legislative approval. In some editions, the article also misstated the breakdown by sex of Mr. Pataki's 14 top appointments so far. The group includes 10 men and 4 women, not 11 and 3.

HEADLINE: Programs Seek to Stop Trouble Before It Starts

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The subject for the day in Natalie Nash's sixth-grade class was "dissing" and the lesson was how children could keep their self-respect when challenged in real life.
Two boys in baggy sweat shirts were assigned to act out roles from a textbook on what happens when one child insults another. "Man, you're so dumb you don't know nothing," said Hector, assuming a practiced swagger. Faster than a magician, the second student, Angel, pretended to punch Hector in the face. 
 The class in the James G. Blaine Elementary School here, a hulking old edifice in a poor neighborhood, laughed knowingly. "That's right," Ms. Nash said. "That's what happens when you don't think about the consequences."
The class is part of a pioneering program with 5,000 students in a dozen Chicago-area schools that tries to prevent juvenile violence by teaching children -- and in some cases, their parents -- amicable ways to resolve disputes.
Financed by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Chicago project is only one of thousands of anti-violence programs that have sprung up in schools, clinics, churches and neighborhoods around the country in the past few years in response to the epidemic of violence among young people.
A growing number of experts agree that the approach favored by the public and politicians -- threatening criminals with longer and longer sentences -- has little impact on adolescents, especially those from poor, already stressed families. Instead, they say, the best hope lies with early intervention, working with children as young as 6 and their parents to head off antisocial behavior.
"Early aggressive behavior is the single best predictor of later violence and delinquency," said Patrick G. Tolan, an associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois in Chicago, who is co-director of the school project here.
Dr. Tolan and others said that the most worrisome signs of trouble in young children were irritability and impulsiveness and a propensity to fight, lie, cheat, steal or be cruel to animals.
With such children, the earlier an older person intervenes, the better, said Gerald Patterson, a psychologist and co-founder of the Oregon Social Learning Center in Eugene, an agency widely respected for its work with antisocial youth. Treatment is most effective on children from the ages of 4 to 9, Dr. Patterson said, while those older than 11 are much more difficult to reach.
"After 14, it is extremely hard to make any changes," he said.
The most popular violence-prevention programs have been "conflict resolution" curriculums introduced in schools in the past few years, not only in Chicago, but also in hundreds of places like New York, Boston, the Los Angeles area, Tucson, Ariz., and Washington.
Whether these programs, some of them sold commercially in the form of textbooks and videos, have any real benefit remains a matter of debate, since few have been scientifically evaluated.
"I think what they can change is fighting in the cafeteria line," said Terrie Moffitt, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin. "But that is very different from changing violence on the street corner."
But Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and a developer of one of the most widely used curriculums, said it was wrong to dismiss the school programs.
"I think violence is a learned behavior and getting along is a skill, just like basketball," Dr. Prothrow-Stith said. "You need to practice."
The problem confronting any simple prevention strategy, like the school curriculums, said John Cuie, a professor of psychology at Duke University, is that violence has complex roots.
It can arise out of living in a poor neighborhood, where violent crime, unemployment and drugs are rampant. It can spring from growing up in a family where the parents are abusive or neglectful. Or it can grow out of the difficulties an impulsive child has on entering first grade, and facing the necessity of sitting still and learning to read.
"A successful intervention needs to attack all these factors at once," Professor Cuie said, and continue over many years.
He has developed one of the most highly regarded prevention programs, Families and Schools Together, or FAST Track, which is being used in 50 schools in Durham, N.C., Nashville, Seattle and rural western Pennsylvania. Professor Cuie's program combines training for parents, including visits to the homes by trained staff members, and special enrichment classes for selected students, the 10 percent seen as most troubled by their teachers and parents.
The very thing that puts these children at risk -- that they become angry easily, that they do not use language as effectively as other children -- makes them harder to help.
There are as yet no hard data on the results of the Duke and Chicago projects, both of which started in 1991, but those involved in the projects say they believe they are slowly making progress.
And experts take encouragement from recent findings by the Perry Preschool program run by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation in Ypsilanti, Mich. The study was conducted in the 1960's among poor black children, combining parent training and academic enrichment. Now, rechecking the participants at age 27, a study has found that graduates of the program are five times less likely to have serious arrest records than those who were in a control group.
In the search for effective policies, experts are intrigued by an often-overlooked truth: the vast majority of children who grow up in the poorest, most blighted neighborhoods do not turn to violence.
Researchers say they are paying new attention to the importance of the parenting skills of those who rear young children -- skills that Mr. Patterson said were profoundly lacking among many of the 15- and 16-year-olds trying to rear children in difficult circumstances.
"They yell and scream or hit the child, even in our presence," Mr. Patterson said. "I'm afraid parenting is something that is being lost in America. Parenting is not some natural instinct. You really have to learn it at the foot of a master, your own parents, if you are lucky enough."
Mr. Patterson tries to teach more consistent parenting, helping mothers and fathers learn to monitor their children's activities and discipline them without corporal punishment.
"The magnitude of change in the child is correlated with the magnitude of improvement in parenting skills," Dr. Patterson said.
Other experts suggest that all teen-agers be taught parenting skills.
Joan McCord, a professor of criminal justice at Temple University in Philadelphia, suggests that teen-age girls learn mothering skills, by working with real babies, before they become pregnant.
Dr. Dorothy Otnow-Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine, suggested that, to identify families that need help, children entering school should be routinely screened for evidence of abuse and neglect, just as they now are given physical exams.
One reason there is so little progress in curbing violence, despite all the public concern, is that little money is spent on research, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University who calculates that the Federal budget for crime research is under $50 million a year, compared with $310 million for research into Alzheimer's disease, $1.3 billion for AIDS research and $2.1 billion for cancer.
Recent research has yielded some practical strategies. Studies by Lawrence Sherman, the chief criminologist for the Indianapolis Police Department, has found that 3 percent of the addresses in some cities account for more than half of the crimes. Based on these findings about what he calls "hot spots," police in some cities, including St. Petersburg, Fla., have freed teams of officers from answering routine 911 calls to allow them to focus on certain geographic areas.
Selected officers in St. Petersburg have also been assigned to work as mentors with adolescents living in "high risk" neighborhoods, spending time with them and their families.
Research by Mr. Sherman and others has led police departments in several cities, including New York, to begin pursuing illegal guns the way they long have drugs, using arrests as a starting point to build cases, looking for dealers and making deals for information. Although it is illegal in virtually every state for juveniles to possess handguns, the police have until recently done little to crack down on illegal guns.
Based on suggestions from criminologists, the Justice Department is preparing to finance the development of a gun detector that could identify hidden weapons at a distance, enabling the police to confiscate more firearms.
Politically, the most popular response to youth violence is the wave of tough new laws mandating longer sentences for youthful offenders and requiring such offenders to be tried in adult court. But few criminologists or law-enforcement authorities believe that the new laws will have much deterrence.
"The evidence is overwhelmingly clear that incarceration does not work as a deterrent, especially for kids, for whom life is an adventure," said Professor McCord. The United States has doubled its prison population over the last two decades, at the same time the rate of homicides among young people 15 to 19 years old jumped about 150 percent.
What might help, Professor McCord said, would be to change the policy in family courts in which judges often throw out a juvenile's first and second offenses.
"There ought to be penalties for first offenses, and serious consideration to restitution, like service kinds of work, so we don't send the wrong message," he said.
The most that can be said for the effect of the new laws is that they may keep dangerous children off the street longer, cutting down the number of crimes they commit, said Howard N. Snyder of the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: What Can Be Done About the Scourge of Violence Among Juveniles? The Experts on Different Fronts of the Battlefield Discuss Strategies

 BODY:

Reuben Greenberg
Chief of police
Charleston, S.C.
During the daytime, according to state law, children from ages 6 to 17 have got to go to school. The truancy law gives us the right to stop them whether or not they're engaged in criminal activity. We pack them up and deliver them to school. We've delivered 3,200 kids back to school in the three years we've been doing this, some from as far as 50 miles away. 
 It is not an education program on our part; it's a crime-prevention program. We took six and a half hours that they had the opportunity to engage in criminal activity in, and took it away from them. If they are suspended or expelled, we can't take them to school, so we take them home.
After school, we don't have any leverage till midnight. Then we have what we call Operation Midnight. If we see children walking around the streets after midnight, we pick them up and return them to their parents. We don't take them to jail; we don't arrest them.
We call the parents and say, 'Do you know your son is out here?' If they say, 'Yes,' then it's O.K. Otherwise, we bring them home. And if they think a 12-year-old can be out at 4 in the morning, we call a social worker.
The overall daytime crime rate has dropped 27 percent. Not only have children stopped committing crimes during the day, they have also not been the victims of crime. Not a single kid in this town has been shot or shot at during school hours. No kids have been shot from midnight to 6 in the morning either, and only one kid was stabbed. We did this with no arrests, no going to court, not putting anyone in jail and no overtime.
We have also invented our own kind of gun-buyback program. We'll pay $100 to anyone who calls the police with detailed information about people who illegally carry guns in public places. Nobody needs a gun in school for protection.
Kids are the greatest snitches in the world to begin with, and when you give them $100 they become super snitches.
 
Elvin L. Martinez
Florida State Representative who chairs the Legislature's Criminal Justice Committee, and is a major sponsor of the state's tough juvenile justice law, passed in April
We changed public policy from decades where the 'best interests of the child' were the first thing considered, to a policy where the first consideration is public safety.
So we decided that now, any juvenile who commits three violent felonies can be waived into adult court at any age and must be waived at 14. It's three strikes and you're an adult.
We made punishments more severe. We tripled the amount of spaces we have for commitment programs. We created boot camps. We created a new level of offender -- maximum risk -- that can be kept until age 21 or for 36 months.
We authorized judges to take juveniles into custody for contempt of court. If a judge tells a truant to go back to school, and the truant does not go back, now he is disobeying the judge's order.
The law also does away with the confidentiality of records for violent crimes committed by juveniles. And we attack the gang problem with RICO. If a gang initiation involves stealing a car, then all the members of the gang can be charged with car-theft.
We made it more difficult for a judge to impose juvenile sanctions in an adult court. He must enter a written order and find certain things, like why he thinks the child exhibits hope. Otherwise he must treat the child as an adult who falls under the sentence guidelines and goes to jail.
We allow the court to have jurisdiction over the parent, or the caretaker. The court can find them in contempt and make them pay for their children's actions. It will call attention to the fact that they have responsibilities for their children. We will provide parenting classes if they need them.
The most dramatic thing is that children no longer will be able to believe that the system is a joke.
 
James Q. Wilson
Professor of management and public policy
University of California at Los Angeles
There are one million people in prison. We are not going to change them. We have boys on the streets; we can't change them. So we have to push the intervention back to where we know it is possible to make a difference: in childhood.
We certainly know the importance of disorganized families, of abusive parents, of parental criminality, of impulsive temperaments, of verbal deficits that lead to difficulty in school, of early drug use.
Not everybody who has these things is going to become criminal, but they are the best general predictors.
The crucial turning point is the third grade. It is not an iron law. There are a few late bloomers who turn to crime in their teens. But if kids are going to do badly in school, third grade is when it starts.
What I would do is consolidate fiscally all the current welfare programs -- A.F.D.C., Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps -- and aim them better at children to improve the life course of those children.
I would tell all teen-age mothers with children living in poor neighborhoods, white or black, that if they want to get Government subsidies they have to do one of several things. They have to move to a group shelter supervised by adults, where mothers are trained to be mothers. Drugs and alcohol won't be allowed. Or an alternative is to make available publicly funded boarding schools, with vouchers, where mothers can send their kids, away from the mean streets.
Suppose all the benefits that go to a 15-year-old with a child were taken out and endorsed to a group shelter. It might be possible that by pooling resources over 30 to 40 mothers per place you might be able to run a reasonably good shelter. The main goal in welfare reform ought to be saving the children, not necessarily making mothers work.
 
Vince Lane
President
Chicago Housing Authority. Grew up in a cold-water flat on the city's South Side.
You've got to get at the root causes -- people living in poverty, families losing their values, kids not being able to get or hold jobs, the loss of religious beliefs --so that now young people will do anything at any time regardless of the consequences.
What I am trying to do is undo one fundamental flaw, the way we deliver public housing for poor people, so that neighborhoods can function properly. Well-intentioned people set up a standard for poor people, giving them welfare and public housing and then pushing them all off to one side.
But you can't maintain a viable population where most of the people living in a place are out of work and dependent on welfare. We now have third and fourth generations in public housing waiting for welfare checks. I met a little girl who said she couldn't wait to get pregnant so she can get welfare and her own apartment, because she doesn't like living with her grandmother.
I would like to demolish 12,000 to 15,000 of our 40,000 public housing units in Chicago. I would transfer the $3 billion of assets of our public housing authority, to get the real cash flow from them, and build or acquire single family houses or condos. If people need money down, I will provide 25 percent down.
To get them there, I would enter into a pact with the Federal and local governments that created the problem of overconcentrated public housing and agree that we would never have two poor people living side by side. That would be low enough that home owners wouldn't have to worry about their values or schools, and it wouldn't create gangs.
There are now 150,000 people in Chicago in public housing. If you spread them over the nine million people in the city's metropolitan area, it would be no more than 1.5 percent per block. That would take us back to where we used to be traditionally, where we always had poor people, but they weren't so concentrated, and churches and community organizations could help them.
 
Mary Taylor Previte
Administrator
Camden County Youth Center, a pretrial juvenile detention center in Gloucester Township, N.J.
In 20 years in this business, I've discovered that the kids that are turned around in almost every case are attached or glued to one decent human being. It can be a family member, or a person in the neighborhood.
One of the causes for kids falling apart is that these children have no one paying attention to them. As a result, they have no memories, no rituals and no traditions. I asked one kid, 'Give me a memory, something your family does every year,' and she couldn't think of one. She was 16.
That may not sound like a big deal, but memories of a daddy building a snow fort become a road map for the future, when they have a family. In here, there is a lot of father hunger. I see it in how the kids try to model themselves after our officers, asking to look at pictures of their families. The kids say, on the street where I live, there ain't one house has a father. Grown-ups have abandoned kids.
And the level of anarchy is getting worse. I am now getting the children of the kids I had years ago. Grandmothers at 28.
So any answer has got to start with families, with people spending time with their children. When I was a little girl, I was locked up in a Japanese concentration camp and separated from my parents for three years. The reason I didn't crumble was that we had teachers who gave us a safe feeling.
You also have to give children comforting predictable rituals, so that they know that every day they will get up at a certain time and go to school at a fixed time. The problem now is kids are in chaos. They don't know what is going to happen. Violence is the response to not knowing what is going to happen next. They become self-protective. Emotionally their fists are up at every moment, ready to punch out someone. Only now it is guns. They are so severely damaged, they expect to die.
 
Judge Judith Sheindlin
Supervising judge
Manhattan Family Court
 We are spending substantial sums of money for the care of juveniles in placement facilities -- $70,000 to $80,000 a year apiece in New York State. But there is a recidivism rate of 75 to 86 percent, depending on whose statistics you believe. If you were in business and getting three-quarters of your product back, you'd soon be out of business. Taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
I think by age 15 there is a small number of kids, who for whatever deprivations they have suffered, are cooked, as my grandmother would have said. They are gone. Whatever you do is not going to make a difference. They are functionally illiterate. They have a hopelessness they can't get over. So they have no empathy, no social morality. It is very hard in 10 months to inculcate those values and then send them back to the same dysfunctional society and say, 'Do your best.' You haven't given them anything.
I think the solution is to pare down the money we spend on those kids who are placed, which means you have spartan institutions. The residents in them get three meals a day, with set chores and schools, but that's it. You want exercise, go out in the yard and run. You have fewer staff. And you have made a statement to these bad kids, jail is not going to be a pleasant place.
With the money you save, you invest in the vast majority of kids who come from the same environments and are right on the cusp. Give them better schools, and after-school programs to help them get jobs. You need to say to those kids, we know you are not getting an adequate break, that you come from a dysfunctional family with parents on drugs, and we appreciate that you haven't yet crossed the line to criminal offending.
People will say, You are stigmatizing the bad kids. Well, if you have 36 kids in a classroom and 4 are throwing chairs at the teacher, you have to excise them. Otherwise all will be lost. This is a war.
 
Dr. Carl Bell
Director
Community Mental Health Council on Chicago's South Side. A former gang member who became a psychiatrist.
The mistake people make is that they do this broad-brush sweeping thing with poor people. They damn them. They talk about lost generations of black children. Give me a break. There are so many efforts to save kids it is not funny. I constantly have uncles, sisters, cousins bringing kids in, saying they want to save this child. Their mother is on coke. There is a safety net in the black community. That's why 95 percent of the children who grow up in poverty don't become bad.
We need to be clear that most kids who carry guns do it to relieve a traumatic sense of helplessness. They turn to guns as a solution to being victims of violence, the Batman syndrome. Unfortunately, we've got many studies about the impact of violence on television, but very few about the impact of real-life violence.
The issue is, how do you take kids who have been victimized by violence and turn them into good guys?
Because studies show that children who are not wanted by their parents catch hell, I would prevent women from having unwanted children. Offer them birth control and education about how children turn out. An unwanted child is unrocked, unfed, unchanged, untaught, and as a result grows up deprived and out of control. They are sad, and as they get older, this gets covered over with anger. Then you have a kid with an attitude.
I would also do parent training. You need on-the-job training, staying with them. We use grandmothers. One proposal is, take every woman on welfare, select the ones that are good parents, and give them a job to help take care of a teen-age mother.
That's how Alcoholics Anonymous works. To do something about violence we are going to have to take an A.A. approach. Nice people are not going to to go into these places. Take a welfare mother and give her a role in life.
 
Clementine Barfield
Founder
Save Our Sons and Daughters, a national support group based in Detroit for parents of children killed by violence
There is a lot more that we need to be doing to stop gun violence. We know guns are made to kill, but when they kill children, people seem to be surprised.
We have finally made the legislators pay attention to us, but now the legislators have introduced all kinds of stupid laws that won't change anything. We have not halted the manufacture and importation of guns.
Right now, there is still a free market for guns coming into the community, and the only people being hurt are the people in the community.
We can't expect children to be what we are not, to be peaceful if we are not. If we are consistently putting guns at their disposal, children will get killed.
Young people today have been exposed to so much. A lot of times we have to replace the ugly images they have, of friends being killed, of abuse, of seeing neighborhoods run down.
We have to replace these images with the image that I can get better, that yes, there is a future for me, that my neighborhood can be better, my school can be better.
In Detroit, there is a group of men, Brothers on Patrol, who go into a housing project each morning to make sure the children have a safe corridor to go to school. Every morning and every afternoon, before and after school, they set up a safe corridor for kids to get to school and home. Some of them are fathers, some of them are just young men in the community.
We started our organization when we found that black people don't have support groups. We have always had the church and the family, but we haven't had organizations outside them to help us grieve.
 
James Garbarino
Director
Family Life Development Center at Cornell University
 There are three things I would do.
At the earliest age, we need the home health visitor. You are trying to minimize the earliest damage and neglect, which includes everything from poor prenatal maternal nutrition to preventing neglect by high risk parents. If these very young kids are hurt, you are building up the pool of high risk kids.
The key policy thing is the home health visitor ought to be thought of as part of the infrastructure of a community like potable water and sewerage. You can imagine that if we didn't have those things in place, we'd be faced with cholera victims support groups.
With elementary school children, I would try to identify and work with the traumatized kids, who have what amounts to post-traumatic stress disorder. This is important because repeated findings in research show that aggressive behavior at age 8 is predictive into adulthood unless you intervene. The same program that is 75 percent effective with elementary school age children is only 25 percent effective with adolescents.
Make sure when children are in school to get a health history. Some of these children have been hit in the head. They may need medical help. The chances are, they will also need programs that teach them discipline and how to calm themselves.
At the adolescent level, if I could do one single thing it would be to ensure that teen-agers are not in a high school bigger than 400 to 500 students. The research shows that small high schools create a situation that elicits more participation and have lower drop out rates. These effects are most pronounced for the most economically marginalized children. These marginal kids desperately need forces to draw them in to the school.
 
John J. DiIulio Jr.
Professor of politics and public affairs
Princeton University
 If you have enough decent family members, friends and go to church enough, you will probably be all right. This is what we call socialization.
On the other side, the other thing that keeps people from committing a crime is coercion. But there is no amount of prison or jail or probation or treating kids as adults that will do as much as proper socialization.
The situation we face now is new: we don't know how to rebuild families. It is one thing to talk about replacing infrastructure, roads and bridges, or even political institutions, but what can't be rebuilt from the ground up are these incredibly intricate family networks.
I think the only practical answer is pretty simple. You have about one-half of 1 percent of children at any given time who are severely abused and neglected, kids sitting unchanged in dirty diapers, who are being beaten, who witness or participate in drug deals. By the time they are 5 or older they will have multiple contacts with government agencies -- social service agencies, the police, the courts.
In all this fog of debate about welfare and orphanages, you have to remove these kids, under existing law, say after the second time they are seen by an agency.
The best way I know is to think about creating a black urban kibbutz. They should be black-run and black-staffed, with people from the neighborhood who have led good, stable lives. These are not orphanages and not boarding schools. The children will know who their parents are.
Ask yourself the following question: Suddenly one of your loved ones is transported to the inner city. What are you going to call for? More cops? More prisons? You might. But I know what you would call for in a second. You would want to get the child out of there and to a place where there are decent loving adults around.

HEADLINE: Japanese Less Confident of Economic Future, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The Japanese have become less confident that their country will dominate the world economy in the next century, and Americans have grown more certain that they can meet Japanese competition, a new poll shows.
In the survey, conducted early this month in both countries by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System, only 25 percent of Japanese respondents said they believed their country would be the world's premier economic power over the long term. Three years ago, 53 percent of the Japanese expected Japan to emerge as the most important economic superpower. 
 Now, the survey shows, there is far more awareness in Japan about the economic rise of China -- traditionally Japan's biggest competitor for influence in Asia -- than there is among Americans. A quarter of all Japanese identified China as the coming dominant economy in the world; in the United States, only 4 percent cited China.
The survey of 1,337 Japanese and 1,147 Americans showed a marked improvement in the sour view each country took of the other only 18 months ago, with more Japanese and Americans describing relations between their two countries as "friendly." But the poll also indicated a growing suspicion on the part of the Japanese that the United States is no longer a reliable military ally.
For the first time since 1990, when the question was first asked, less than half the Japanese -- 47 percent -- expressed confidence that Washington was an ally they could depend upon. And for the first time a majority of Japanese -- 53 percent -- said they thought Japan should consider amending the section of their American-written Constitution that has prevented the country from creating a military force able to project power beyond its own shores. In 1993, only 42 percent in Japan said such a change should be considered.
Each poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
"This is a dramatic change from the past," said Richard Samuels, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institution of Technology and the author of a recent study of Japan's postwar military policy. "Fifteen years ago, you could not talk about a change in the Constitution."
The future of the alliance is certain to be a major theme in a meeting in Washington on Jan. 11 between President Clinton and Japan's first Socialist Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama. State Department officials have already made clear that they hope to steer the discussions away from the trade disputes that usually dominate such sessions and to focus on other aspects that, in the words of one senior State Department official, "have clearly been neglected in recent years."
A changing agenda may fit the national mood. For the first time since the question was first asked in 1985, a majority of Americans -- 51 percent -- judged the overall outcome of trade with Japan to be good for the United States. In 1985, at Detroit's low-point in manufacturing quality, only half of all Americans felt that way. But among Japanese, 82 percent said that Japan's cars are a better value.
Japanese also believe overwhelmingly -- 83 percent -- that their blue-collar workers still work harder than Americans, a figure that has barely budged since the question was first asked in 1985. A majority of Japanese and a plurality of Americans also said they still believe Japan makes consumer products that are technologically more advanced than American-made goods.

HEADLINE: Mexican President Outlines Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 29

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon moved to take control of Mexico's economic crisis today by outlining an emergency plan to stabilize the economy and announcing the resignation of the Finance Minister who oversaw the devaluation of the peso that led to the collapse of the Government's economic strategy.
Breaking a public silence that had lasted for five days and confounded investors, Mr. Zedillo told national radio and television audiences of a plan "in which everyone will have to do their part and no one will be exempt from sacrifice." 
 His Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, had offered to resign several times in the face of criticism from both Mexicans and foreign investors who had lost billions of dollars in the peso's fall. Today, the resignation was accepted.
Mr. Zedillo, who was inaugurated as President four weeks ago, announced that Mr. Serra would be replaced by Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, 46, a Government economist favored by New York investors. As under secretary of finance in the previous administration, Mr. Ortiz tried last fall to persuade President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to devalue the peso in an orderly fashion. His proposal was rejected.
Details of Mr. Zedillo's plan will not be released until a few hours before he gives another speech to the nation Monday night. But several key advisers made clear in interviews today that the new strategy would require severe concessions from labor, deep cuts in public spending and a temporary slowdown of economic growth -- all in an attempt to cut by more than half the $30 billion trade imbalance that lies at the core of Mexico's crisis.
The ambitious plan to rebuild investor confidence, includes an international aid package totaling $10 billion to $15 billion in loans from the United States, Canada, the European central banks and several private American banks, including Citibank.
The money, which includes a credit line of $6 billion already authorized by the United States, will be used to go into the currency markets and buy pesos to support the currency's value and to help Mexico meet obligations on $5 billion in short-term bonds that fall due next month.
In Washington, Congressional experts who also insisted on anonymity said that rather than ask a Republican Congress for money to lend to Mexico, the Treasury Department was likely to use its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The little-known fund, intended for use at the Treasury's discretion in exchange crises, held $20.4 billion as of Sept. 30, a recent Federal Reserve publication said.
During an interview today with news-agency reporters, President Clinton implied that the United States would help Mexico. When asked about the Mexican currency crisis, he replied: "It is something that I take seriously, and we are looking at it very seriously. We're talking to the Mexican Government about what we can do."
The President continued, "I would have to say that if you look where Mexico is today, compared to where they were several years ago, they have made a serious commitment to economic reform, to social reform, to cultural reform and to political reform." Mr. Clinton then added, "I would like to see that commitment rewarded, obviously, in so far as it can be in having those folks build a stable and growing economy."
Most details of the international economic package, parts of which became known Wednesday, have been settled with the help of Treasury officials, Mexican officials said. But the domestic section dealing with wages and inflation controls will not be settled until Monday, when business and labor leaders are expected to reach a politically viable consensus with the Government on its plan to stabilize the economy.
Since the peso was devalued and a day later allowed to float freely against the dollar, it has lost about 30 percent of its value. Today, the peso closed at 4.875 to the dollar, up modestly from 4.975 on Wednesday.
The Mexican stock market also rose sharply today, closing at 2,411, an increase of 3.14 percent over Wednesday.
Mexican officials said they expected the currency to settle somewhere between 4 and 4.5 pesos to the dollar. That rate would then become the basis for a new exchange policy. Canada has a similar plan that pegs the value of the Canadian dollar to what is called a monetary conditions index. Under such a plan, the value of the peso would be linked to short-term interest rates and other important indicators, so that as rates rise, the peso weakens and vice versa.
Lawrence B. Goodman, vice president for emerging-markets research at Salomon Brothers, said that such an exchange policy was considered experimental and had never been used in a nation as big as Mexico -- with a population estimated above 92 million. He said it would be more realistic to see this combined with a more traditional approach that used an index tied to the currency of a nation's primary trading partners, such as was done in Chile and Israel.
Either way, the Mexican Government is likely to settle on a policy that gives it far more flexibility. Before the decision on Dec. 21 to let the peso float, Mexico had relied on a trading band that very slowly dropped the band's lower limit. By maintaining the band, experts say, Mexico overpriced its exports and invited a flood of imported products.
A Mexican finance official involved in the new stabilization plan said the old exchange system had to be abandoned because "it was the variable in the Government's economic strategy that blew up."
Economists say the challenge for Mexico now is to maintain the price advantages that come with 30 percent-plus devaluation, without setting off inflation. The Government hopes that the higher import prices and lower real wages caused by the devaluation will suppress demands for imports, and thereby drop the country's trade deficit from $30 billion to about $14 billion or $15 billion.
Officials said the Government would also reduce public spending by 2 or 3 percent of the gross domestic product. It will restrict economic-development loans and public financing that had been used to stimulate the economy and will accelerate the privatization of Government-owned ports, petrochemcial plants and power-generating stations.
The elements of the international rescue plan include a swap line of about $6 billion from the Bank for International Settlements, which is owned by the central banks of Europe, and a smaller amount from American commercial banks.
Contrary to rumors, a Mexican official said, the International Monetary Fund had not been asked to provide any big loans. Rather, he said, Mexico had sought the fund's approval of the stabilization plan to bolster investors' confidence.
The success of the plan, the official said, rested on the Government's ability to control inflation. Economists in the United States have estimated that inflation in Mexico will rise to 20 percent next year, from about 9 percent this year. But Mexican finance officials today projected the rate closer to 15 percent, largely as a result of the recent crisis.
It is not clear at the moment what role Mexican banks will play in extricating the country from the crisis or whether the Government will encourage other foreign banks, including American, to become more active. The Government in October authorized 18 foreign banks to operate in Mexico.
Throughout the day, business, labor and Government leaders met privately to negotiate final details of the stabilization plan. In the last seven years, a pact among those forces has been the primary tool for controlling inflation, even though it often resulted in suppressing the real wages of workers, who have less buying power now than in 1980.
The Government needs the leaders of the unions and of the peasants' movement to accept pay increases substantially below the inflation rate, further reducing their purchasing power.
Mr. Zedillo, in his address today, conceded that his administration had "underestimated the problem" of the peso's fall, but now wanted to convert "a critical situation into an opportunity for growth."
He said the emergency measures would last only until the economy was back on track. An official estimated that could take as long as eight months.

HEADLINE: Haiti Bids au Revoir to Francophilia, Says Yo to G.I. Joe

BYLINE: by LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 23

 BODY:
American soldiers are still patrolling the streets, but now they are being joined by American advisers to Government ministries, American aid workers and American business executives. Teen-age Haitians from wealthy families, eager to appear trendy, now drive around with their car radios tuned to the American armed forces station that broadcasts here.
For a nation whose language is French-based and which has traditionally identified itself with France and French culture, three months of living under an American military presence has brought about a basic shift in attitude. 
 Though the country's Francophile elite are resisting, Haiti is rapidly slipping out of the French orbit and looking more than ever to the United States as its main foreign model and patron, many Haitians and foreign diplomats say.
"One of the results of the Haitian crisis of the last three years is that France and French culture are going to take a back seat, and their role is going to be diminished here," said Lionel Delatour, a Haitian business consultant and former diplomat. "I think the momentum is unstoppable, and I think it's a healthy development for this country."
An American official, speaking on condition he not be identified, was even more categorical. "Sept. 19 was a death knell for French influence in this country," he asserted, referring to the date 20,000 American troops began landing here to restore Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. "They basically ceded the territory to us, and now they are steamed about it."
As a result of the intervention, the United States has thousands of soldiers here, has pledged more than $200 million in foreign aid, and maintains an embassy with more than 75 diplomats. France is represented by 100 gendarmes and an aid package of about $60 million, and the French Embassy has a small staff headed by a charge d'affaires who says "the vision of Haiti as a battlefield" between the United States and France is "pure rubbish."
"We are not here in order to have a competition with the Americans or the Canadians," the French official, Philippe Selz, said in an interview. "We are here to help the Haitians get out of the mess they have been in for so many years."
But many Haitians argue otherwise. The French "these days are working double time to reconquer their lost terrain, first by multiplying their missions to Haiti and then by taking the initiative to push for the replacement of American forces by those of the United Nations," a front-page editorial in the daily Le Nouvelliste said recently.
Diplomats, too, say they have detected signs of a French effort, which they regard as futile, to regain the dominance they once enjoyed. "There is room for only one great power here, and everyone except the French recognizes who that is," said a representative of one Western Hemisphere nation.
Haiti is the poorest nation in the Americas, and the international effort to rebuild the country is expected to bring a foreign aid flow of well over a billion dollars, with the nations most friendly to Haiti expected to win the bulk of the lucrative contracts. In addition, the Haitian middle and upper classes are avid travelers and consumers, and spend large sums abroad in the countries they visit.
Since President Aristide returned to power in mid-October, France has sent its Minister of Cooperation, a parliamentary delegation and cultural groups on official visits. They all stressed the historical, linguistic and cultural ties between France and Haiti. French companies have also been active, hoping to snare Government contracts and other business opportunities that are part of the reconstruction of the shattered economy.
But that effort has been overshadowed by the American presence in the streets of the capital and in the provinces. "You can send ministers here every week," said Mr. Delatour, who studied in the United States. "But what the average Haitian sees is a man in green uniform, and he is not French."
Even before the troops arrived, American culture had been gradually displacing many French traditions and attitudes here over the last 15 years. As many as a million Haitians live in the United States, compared with 40,000 in France, and more Haitians study at American universities or visit Miami and New York on business and shopping trips than go to France.
As a result, a growing number of Haitians, the young in particular, have acquired a taste for things American. Denzel Washington and Eddie Murphy have replaced Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo as movie idols, the Chicago Bulls appear to have a larger following than the Marseilles Football Club, and rap has largely pushed aside French popular music.
The deployment of American troops has also speeded the process, especially among the vast majority of ordinary Haitians too poor to travel abroad. Having so many American soldiers, who bring American habits and entertainments with them, so close at hand offers those Haitians "a new insight into our culture that they have never witnessed before," one United States official explained.
The presence of many black American soldiers, including several hundred who are of Haitian descent and speak Creole, seems to have particularly impressed the average Haitian. Adults and children alike flock around them with questions about American life and culture, and some Haitians say they have been inspired by the sight of black officers commanding white, Hispanic and Asian-American soldiers.
"It's a good thing, a revolution for our country, because now we see that Haitians can be the same as Americans," Francois Eddy, a 24-year-old student, said as he observed an American military encampment near the main airport. "I suppose that could also be possible with the French, but the Americans seem to have more warmth and the French to be more hard-headed."
Among Haitian intellectuals there is also a sense of gratitude at the role that black American political leaders like Randall Robinson, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and members of the Black Congressional Caucus played in liberating Haiti from military rule. That has fostered a greater sense of identification with the United States and its values, they say.
But some students of Haitian culture and history argue that it would be premature to write off the French, who were Haiti's colonial masters until the country achieved independence in 1804. The United States, they point out, occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934 and left little influence behind, while France's legacy still permeates daily life.
"The French have one advantage over you Americans, which is that they have programmed the Haitian people," Georges Michel, a historian who has written extensively on the American and French roles here, said. "They can enter the password at any time and go into our memory -- the language and the mentality. You can never do that."
But this time the influx of Americans occurs as the dominance of French culture and language, and of the predominantly light-skinned elite who are its most ardent advocates, is already being challenged by Creole, the language of the majority of Haitians. In that decades-old cultural struggle, partisans of Creole tended to regard the American language and culture as tools that can be used to weaken the French influence they consider baleful.
The desire to embrace and emphasize Haiti's Creole roots and language has been particularly strong among members of the Lavalas political movement, which swept President Aristide into office in elections held four years ago this month. Many of the Francophiles, on the other hand, supported the military coup that overthrew him in September 1991, and have seen their prestige evaporate with his return.
Last month, for example, Haiti's Minister of Culture, Jean-Claude Bajeux, said he intended to push for the "Haitianization" of the country's culture, which implies less emphasis on French elements. And unlike previous presidents, President Aristide prefers to make his official declarations in Creole, not French, and has even injected English into some recent speeches.
"In the past, Aristide appeared not to be in favor of French," Mr. Selz, the French charge d'affaires, acknowledged. "He had roots among the people and noticed who their oppressors were: those who spoke French and despised Creole. But I think that tendency was stronger in the past than now."
Haitians need to be encouraged to see French as "an asset, not a liability," Mr. Selz said. "We don't want Haiti to go back to colonial times. But this rivalry approach is not a good one. It's wrong for Haiti, and not good for either you Americans or for us. Haiti can only lose time and energy if it goes in that direction."

HEADLINE: Computer Use Indictment Is Thrown Out

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Declining to prosecute a computer-age crime with telegraph-era law, a Federal judge in Boston yesterday dismissed an indictment against a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had been accused of operating a computer system used for distributing pirated software.
The student, David LaMacchia, a 21-year-old electrical engineering and computer science major from Rockville, Md., was indicted in April for using two of the university's computers as secret electronic bulletin boards, where computer users linked to the Internet could trade illegally copied software. 
 Prosecutors said that while Mr. LaMacchia apparently did not profit from the trading, his operation was one of the largest hubs in a worldwide electronic black market that trades billions of dollars worth of illegally copied software each year.
Judge Richard Stearns of Federal District Court ruled that while Mr. LaMacchia's conduct might have been "heedlessly irresponsible" and perhaps in violation of civil copyright laws, he could not be prosecuted under Federal wire fraud felony statutes without making criminal "the conduct of not only persons like LaMacchia, but also the myriad of home computer users who succumb to the temptation to copy even a single software program for private use."
"It is not clear that making criminals of a large number of consumers of computer software is a result that even the software industry would consider desirable," the judge wrote.
Tens of millions of personal computer users routinely make copies of software programs, often for legitimate reasons like emergency backups or transferring programs to new machines. Software industry associations contend, however, that illegal copying of software deprives software companies of as much as $13.8 billion in potential revenue each year.
Mr. LaMacchia was accused of operating the software repositories, known on the Internet as Cynosure, from November 1993 until the university shut them down in January 1994. Donald Stern, the United States Attorney in Boston, said more than $1 million worth of illegally copied software, including popular games and business programs, had passed through the system during the few weeks it was in operation.
Mr. LaMacchia, who the authorities said used the pseudonyms Grimjack and John Gaunt, was not accused of using the software himself or of profiting from the trading. Rather, Grimjack orchestrated the flow of software in and out of the systems and admonished its many anonymous users to keep the site's location on the Internet a secret.
Judge Stearns, saying "this case presents the issue of whether new wine can be poured into old bottles," suggested that it was up to Congress to draft new laws to deal with copyright issues in the computer software era. "What the Government is seeking to do is to punish conduct that reasonable people might agree deserves the sanctions of the criminal law." But, he concluded, the Government had erred in trying to use the criminal penalties of the wire fraud statutes against what was, at most, a civil violation of copyright laws.
Judge Stearns used unusually strong language to express his disapproval of Mr. LaMacchia's actions, writing, "If the indictment is to be believed, one might at best describe his actions as heedlessly irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values."
Mr. Stern, the United States Attorney, said prosecutors had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.
"I intend to raise with the Department of Justice whether it should file legislation explicitly dealing with willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software to remove any uncertainties," Mr. Stern said.
Harvey A. Silverglate, Mr. LaMacchia's lawyer, noted that his client was not accused of trying to profit from the trading in illegal software, and said the charges did not constitute a criminal violation of existing copyright law.
"So the Government has taken this old Federal wire fraud law, which predates computer software, and has claimed they can recast this copyright case as a wire fraud case and prosecute it as a five-year prison felony," Mr. Silverglate said. "If the court allows prosecutions of noncriminal activity under these circumstances, it sends a chill down the spine of anyone operating a computerized bulletin board system."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Names 3 Supporters to State Board

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 29

 BODY:
In one of his final acts as Governor, Mario M. Cuomo today appointed three longtime officials in his administration to jobs on the state's Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, giving them job security for between two and four years and salaries of more than $68,000.
The appointments do not require confirmation by the State Senate and cannot be rescinded by Governor-elect George E. Pataki, who takes office on Sunday. 
 One of the appointees is Robert B. Adams, Mr. Cuomo's Commissioner of the Office of General Services. Another is Allen Cappelli, who took a leave this year from his job as a top official in the state Insurance Department to run get-out-the-vote operations for Mr. Cuomo's unsuccessful re-election campaign. The third appointee is Kenneth M. Mackintosh, an administrator at the state's School of Public Health in Albany and the former deputy of Mr. Cuomo's appointments office, the clearinghouse for gubernatorial patronage.
Mr. Adams, whose term will expire in 1996, and Mr. Mackintosh, whose term will expire in 1997, will receive annual salaries of $68,330 for the full-time positions. Mr. Cappelli, whose term will expire in 1998, will receive $76,421 because Mr. Cuomo named him chairman of the board. The five-member board hears appeals of unemployment insurance claims that have been denied by the state Labor Department.
The vacancies on the board have existed for between two and four years, with the positions filled by their previous occupants in a holdover capacity. Unlike with many gubernatorial appointments to boards and commissions, Mr. Cuomo did not announce today's actions in a news release. His decision to make the appointments in the waning days of his administration, and to attempt to do so quietly, provoked outrage from Pataki transition officials.
"This is politics as usual," said Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, appropriating the Cuomo campaign's favorite charge against Mr. Pataki. "It's an outrage and it should be stopped. It's particularly ironic that Mario Cuomo would choose the unemployment appeals board to reward political operatives, given New York's current economic condition."
After the election, Mr. Pataki asked Mr. Cuomo to freeze hiring and promotions during the remainder of his tenure to help the incoming administration close a large budget gap. Mr. Cuomo declined to impose a freeze, but said he would limit hiring as much as possible. He also said, after meeting with Mr. Pataki on Dec. 1, that Mr. Pataki "is the Governor right now as far as I'm concerned."
Despite that statement, the Cuomo administration has hired nearly 1,000 employees during the last six weeks, some of them seemingly far from essential to the health and safety of the state's clients and consumers. And Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, David Egner, explained Mr. Cuomo's three appointments today by saying that "the Governor was elected to serve his full four-year term and he would really be abdicating his responsibility if he were to cease functioning as Governor before his term has expired."
Mr. Egner added, "He felt that these were very talented individuals who were valued public servants and that the state would benefit by their services."

HEADLINE: Orange County to Draw On Reserve for Payment

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29

 BODY:
In a sign of further belt-tightening, officials of Orange County, Calif., said today that the bankrupt county would dip into a special reserve fund to paying interest to bondholders, rather than cash on hand.
The move, intended to conserve the county's limited cash, is also aimed at assuring Wall Street that the county will maintain a tight grip on its financial resources and continue to meet its debt payments. 
 The action is intended to save the county from spending $53.4 million to repay short-term tax and revenue anticipation notes due this month and next. The money to pay bondholders will now come from reserves that were established when the bonds were first issued to serve as an emergency fund for just such circumstances.
Gaddi H. Vasquez, the new chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said the move would "allow us to keep open our lines to the financial markets, while enabling the county to conserve cash for the immediate operating needs." The option the county is trying to avoid is an outright default on the bonds, an action that many fear could cut off its access to credit markets.
The move should prove comforting to bondholders because it clearly signals that Orange County does not want to cut off payments to them. Still, it also raises concerns because the county is acknowledging that it does not have enough money in its current account to meet its near-term interest payment obligations.
Today's action came as Orange County tries to devise ways to close a budget shortfall that is now estimated at as much as $120 million. The shortfall was caused by the $2 billion loss in a county investment pool that resulted from an aggressive bet on falling interest rates by Robert L. Citron, the county's former treasurer. Mr. Citron resigned earlier this month, only a day before Orange County filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 6.
A week ago, the county said it would have to make cuts in its budget of nearly $40 million, including layoffs of some workers.
"This is a technical default," said Joe Mysack, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer in New York, who still termed the action "prudent."
Mr. Mysack added: "This is an unusual situation. The county needs to have money on hand to meet pressing needs. It can replenish its bond reserve fund further down the line."
When bonds are sold, reserve funds are usually set aside to cover the possibility that the bond issuer might not be able to meets interest obligations. But those funds are only rarely drawn upon. Typically, a bond issuer will set aside money from its incoming receipts a few months before an interest payment is due, using that cash to pay its bondholders.
In this case, the county supervisors decided to suspend payments into a set-aside account of $34.7 million in December and $18.7 million in January. The interest payments are due in June and July.
"This is part of the county's cash management plan," said Jane Eddy, an analyst with Standard and Poor's Rating Group. "It is not a signal that the county intends to default on these securities. We understand why they are doing this."
The announcement came on a day that the supervisors took several actions. The board said the county would, subject to the approval of a bankruptcy judge, make $3.9 million in interest payments on six bond issues. It also plans to dip into reserve funds to make immediate interest payments of around $1 million on notes issued in 1985 and 1986.
"This is a very intelligent move by the board of supervisors to keep access to the capital markets," said Gedale Horowitz, a senior managing director at Salomon Brothers, the county's financial adviser. "It says to the market that the county cares about the investor. But it doesn't know where this will all come out yet."

Sale to Fannie Mae
 SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 29 (AP) -- Orange County arranged the first big sale of risky securities from its investment pool today, opening the final phase of liquidating the fund. The deal was with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, which agreed to buy back $630 million in face value of a species of derivatives known as structured notes, for $577 million in cash. The county said it would use $92.2 million of the $577 million to reduce the fund's heavy borrowings. The rest will help improve the liquidity of the fund. The county's financial adviser, Salomon Brothers, earlier had sold about $3.3 billion in less risky securities from the fund.

HEADLINE: Nicholas G. Pappas, New York Official And Writer, 66

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Nicholas G. Pappas, a writer and former economic development official for New York City, died on Wednesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 66 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Bill Neugebauer, a family friend. 
 Mr. Pappas was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the shadow of Ebbets Field. At his death, he was working on a book of reminiscences and reflections of prominent people recalling the Brooklyn Dodgers and their move to Los Angeles. Mr. Neugebauer said that Mr. Pappas had interviewed nearly 400 people for the book but had been able to finish only two chapters.
Mr. Pappas attended Columbia College for two years before he joined the Army in 1951. Assigned to the Signal Corps, he became a sergeant-instructor in telegraphy.
His 20 years of city service stemmed from his work for Robert F. Wagner's first mayoral campaign in 1953. Fluent in Greek, Mr. Pappas got out the Greek-American vote, and Mr. Wagner made him a deputy commissioner in the Department of Economic Development.
In that post, he worked as a liaison between minorities and city agencies dealing with their business and economic concerns. He was also a speechwriter for Mayor Wagner and his successor, Abraham D. Beame.
Mr. Pappas became one of the city's more visible middle-level managers. He directed safe-street programs and projects that improved street lighting, turned stretches of the city's thoroughfares into pedestrian malls at dusk and dotted neighborhoods with vest-pocket parks.
He resigned in 1974 to write full time. He maintained close ties with the city's Greek-American community and frequently contributed to Greek-American newspapers and magazines.
Mr. Pappas is survived by a brother, James G., of Dix Hills, L.I.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Team Prepares to Battle for Rowland's Budget

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
When Lorraine M. Aronson was asked to become deputy budget director in Governor-elect John G. Rowland's administration, her reaction was instantaneous.
"Get out of the car," she yelled at Reginald L. Jones, the future budget chief, whom she had picked up for what was to be a friendly lunch. 
 Ms. Aronson, a longtime state administrator, said she knew that the job of shrinking state government would be a brutal 20-hour-a-day ordeal. But though she is a Democrat, she ultimately accepted the post in the Republican administration, because, she said, it offered her a chance to work with Mr. Jones on their mutual policy passion: reinventing state government.
To meet the goals set by Mr. Rowland, the budget team will have to cut about $800 million from next year's budget, roughly 8 percent of what is needed to maintain current services. This would be the first time the state lowered its real spending since 1960.
Such a change is needed for Mr. Rowland to keep his campaign promise of reducing the income tax, the state's largest source of revenue, by 20 percent in his first year in office.
Mr. Jones and Ms. Aronson say the task cannot be accomplished by tinkering with programs or even indiscriminate across-the-board cuts, but requires a large-scale rethinking of state government.
"The Rowland vision says, in effect, don't just scissor the margins to get a few cuts," Mr. Jones said. "I want to look at the substance and essence of everything we do to reorganize it to get the best service at the lowest cost. It's part of this public wave for change, the need to address people's discouragement that no matter who they vote for, the bureaucracy keeps spending the same way."
But in a radio interview on Thursday, he warned that it would be difficult to meet Mr. Rowland's tax-cut goal in the first year of his administration.
"We're going to have to take another look at out how fast tax rates can be brought down," Mr. Jones said on WPOP-AM in Hartford. "My immediate goal is to establish a budget next year at a spending level no higher than what we're spending now. If I can accomplish that, I think there are tax options available."
But by the second year, he said, the administration should be back on schedule and able to cut the income tax by one-third.
On paper, Mr. Jones, 68, and Ms. Aronson, 43, are an unlikely team.
Mr. Jones, a Republican, spent his career in business. After retiring as a managing partner at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, he served for six years in the State House of Representatives. Ms. Aronson has devoted her professional life to government, serving most recently as Deputy Commissioner of Education after a three-year stint as Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s deputy budget director, the job she is about to hold again.
While Mr. Jones led the fight against the state income tax imposed in 1991, Ms. Aronson was part of the team that persuaded the Legislature to enact it.
But the two agree that state government has become cumbersome, and both are known for their skill at cutting spending and revamping programs. Over the years, they have developed a warm friendship.
When Mr. Rowland asked Mr. Jones to be his budget director, Mr. Jones knew immediately that he wanted Ms. Aronson as his deputy.
"I didn't know that there would be much chance of her taking this job," he said in an interview at the Office of Policy and Management, "but she apparently likes it over here."
"No, I like you," Ms. Aronson remarked. "I know better than to like the job, having done it."
Both acknowledged that in preparing Mr. Rowland's budget, they face a daunting challenge.
Mr. Rowland's critics say that Governor Weicker has taken major steps to control state spending over the last four years, leaving little room for deeper cuts. They note that the number of full-time state employees has fallen by 164, from 52,580 in June 1989 to 52,416 in June 1994, even while the state was following court orders to expand its prison system and hire hundreds of social workers for the Department of Children and Family Services.
Mr. Weicker has frozen welfare benefits for families since 1991, has reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes, has decreased spending on state retirement benefits and has cut several hundred million dollars from towns and cities' requests for school aid.
Jerome P. Brown, president of the New England Healthcare Employees Union, District 1199, said that poor and working people had suffered enough cuts and that Mr. Rowland's push for a drop in real spending was uncalled for, because revenue has exceeded expenditures in the last few budgets.
"I don't know whether you need to spend more or just spend the same amount more intelligently, but I'm sure you don't need to cut it," Mr. Brown said.
But advocates for further cuts said that Mr. Weicker failed to stop the growth in the budget and that at the present pace, spending will soon surpass revenues.
The Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a nonprofit budget research group, said state spending grew twice as fast as the economy in the last fiscal year, and spending now equals 9.2 percent of the state's aggregate personal income, up from 7 percent in 1985 and 8.5 percent in 1990. Despite a constitutional amendment imposing a cap on expenditures, state spending in the last fiscal year increased more than it had in four years.
The growth has been particularly notable in these three areas:
*Medicaid, which now takes about one of every five state dollars, increased 70 percent over the last four years.
*Debt service, which comprises about one-tenth of expenditures, has grown by about 67 percent since 1990.
*The Corrections Department, which has grown by 85 percent, now takes about 4 percent of total state spending.
"The accelerating rate of state budget increases indicates that Connecticut's spending giant remains untamed," said John Carson, president of the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council.
Mr. Jones and Ms. Aronson see the solution as a fundamental restructuring of state government. While Mr. Jones and Ms. Aronson say it is too early to provide a detailed plan for achieving the savings Mr. Rowland has requested, Mr. Jones offered a seven-point outline of his approach to the budget: restructuring agencies; changes in "system engineering," like purchasing and inventories; reconsidering entitlements; renegotiating employee fringe benefits; examining financing alternatives for the state debt; reviewing state assets that could be sold, and looking at other expenses.
Mr. Jones mentioned privatizing state services as a way to attain some savings, citing the Department of Motor Vehicles and state prisons as possible candidates.
Restructuring and privatizing alone, however, are unlikely to provide enough money for Mr. Rowland's income tax cut. Both Ms. Aronson and Mr. Jones granted that some big immediate savings would come from rethinking the amount spent on entitlements and other programs, like Medicaid reimbursement to nursing homes and education aid to towns and cities.
Mr. Jones also mentioned issuing new bonds to cover as much as $359 million in state debt, which he said would be palatable if accompanied by substantial cuts in the issuance of bonds in future years.
When the two come up with a budget, they then will have to overcome opposition in the legislature, where proposed cuts in programs and benefits have often been overturned.
But Mr. Jones said the public mood has changed, making it easier to get such a package approved.
"Whether you're going to eat your broccoli depends on how hungry you have become," he said. "People are now ready for some of these ideas."

HEADLINE: Old Building, New Finances;
Lean Times Don't Stop Renovation at City Hall

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Some 180 years ago, New York's new City Hall, with its gracious French Renaissance facade and elegant Georgian interior, was considered one of the most handsome buildings in the country.
Today, after 56 mayoral administrations, several technological revolutions and multiple fiscal crises, City Hall is a mixture of the grand, the pedestrian and the crumbling. Gawky metal coat racks line graceful corridors. A grandfather clock insists it is 2:35, 24 hours a day. The rotunda's white marble is chipped and discolored. 
 The Giuliani administration would like to see City Hall returned to splendor, and then kept that way with a self-perpetuating maintenance budget. In fact, it has set about devising, for the first time, a long-term renovation and maintenance plan for the building.
But in these days of belt-tightening and private-sector financing, city officials have found themselves looking at some admittedly novel ways to foot the bill.
John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, has already altered one longstanding city policy to raise money, allowing the building to be used for filming in exchange for a fee. Castle Rock Entertainment paid what Mr. Dyson called a "small honorarium" -- reportedly $50,000 -- to get its cameras inside recently to shoot a new movie, "City Hall," starring Al Pacino.
Officials are also considering renting out, for receptions, two stately City Hall chambers -- the Committee of the Whole and the Governor's Room. "I could imagine somebody might pay $5,000 to welcome somebody," Mr. Dyson said.
Other ideas include installing vending machines in the lobby and putting carts out front to sell food and drink (but definitely not a cafe, Mr. Dyson stressed). Or paid tours of City Hall on weekends. "We could show the Mayor's office," Mr. Dyson said. "He's usually out at a parade or something at those times."
The administration is also exploring the idea of opening a gift shop inside City Hall offering "I Love New York" mugs, Department of Sanitation neckties and other souvenirs. Citybooks, the marketing arm of the Department of General Services, currently sells souvenirs through a catalogue and from a small storefront on Chambers Street just north of City Hall.
"These are all ways to just get enough money, maybe $20,000 a year, to have the building maintain itself," Mr. Dyson said.
Private donations, the result of one-time fund-raising efforts, have often supplemented city money in financing the occasional renovations of City Hall over the years. Mr. Dyson credits Richard H. Jenrette, chairman of the Equitable Companies and a longtime restoration proponent, with underwriting much of the current restoration of the Committee of the Whole room, to be unveiled in early January.
 "We want to make one example," said Mr. Dyson, who is hoping that making a showpiece of the Committee of the Whole room will attract other corporate donations for the next phase: restoring the Governor's Room, followed by the Public Hearing Room and the City Council Chambers.
Ways of maintaining public buildings vary. A bond appropriation is financing up to $10 million in maintenance work at Chicago's turn-of-the-century City Hall.
In Washington, souvenir sales are the bread and butter of maintaining another important historic building, the White House. The nonprofit White House Historical Association has provided $11 million for the White House building, grounds and furnishings since the association was established by Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The group's revenue comes largely from the sale of books, ornaments, note cards, post cards and the like sold from a catalogue and shop.
In New York, the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, a private nonprofit group, finances renovations of the Mayor's residence as well as maintaining the house. A 1991 city report showed that the conservancy spent $143,500 on Gracie Mansion.
A similar sponsorship for City Hall was approved by the Dinkins administration but was never established. It remains an option under consideration by the Giuliani administration.
Whatever financing is developed, City Hall needs more than mere decoration. Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, estimated that structural work could cost as much as $10 million. Only the exterior, rotunda and City Hall Park are landmarked, but a "historic structures" report, at a cost of $100,000, is needed to assess the building's problems. Ms. Breen said work was likely to include repairs of the leaky roof, electrical rewiring and installation of central air conditioning (as much for the preservation of the collection of early American paintings in the Governor's Room as for human comfort).
While Mr. Dyson declines to be specific about the cost of the restoration of the Committee of the Whole room, an official involved in the restoration said it was around $50,000. Draperies dyed light green to match the new silk carpet cost $14,000 by themselves; shining up and rewiring the brass chandelier was $5,000.
Equitable's decorator, William Thompson of Berrytown Associates in Berrytown, N.Y., referred to a turn-of-the-century engraving of the room for ideas, seeking a historical flavor if not period-perfect accuracy. The room, whose most prominent feature is its domed ceiling, has been painted ivory. The new carpet matches the one in a portrait of James Monroe that now hangs over the refurbished fireplace. A grand circular mahogany table was donated by Equitable.
The Committee of the Whole room, originally the Common Council Chamber, was later used by the Board of Estimate for committee meetings. (In a committee of the whole meeting, all members get together to discuss issues of common concern.)
Completed in 1814, City Hall cost New York nearly $500,000 to build, almost half the city's tax revenue during the 10 years it was under construction. Designed to accommodate all branches of the municipal government, the three-story building now houses mayoral and City Council operations and has five public chambers and less than two dozen offices.
The Governor's Room, which the Art Commission last renovated in 1983, served as an office for New York governors through Alfred E. Smith's term in the 1920's. It now displays early American portraits, including the work of John Trumbull. In the room's entryway, the bodies of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant lay in state. (As the story goes, the rotunda's curved, cantilevered staircases were so newfangled that for years visitors refused to climb them -- until thousands decided that viewing Lincoln made the risk worth taking.)
Mr. Dyson himself donated $800 for paint for the Committee of the Whole room; a history buff who has made the restoration his pet project, he winces at the cavalier way City Hall has sometimes been treated.
"There's a lot of Rube Goldberg stuff in this building," he said. "I'm not sure if Rube Goldberg was in fact a New Yorker, but he would have been proud of some of the things we found here." He pointed to a contraption by a window in the Committee of the Whole room that holds, suspended, an electric cord that leads to floodlights by the parking lot. "Why they just didn't put it under the ground I can't quite figure out."
He agrees that the project is daunting. The battered Blue Room in the west wing, where the Mayor's news conferences are held, has frayed carpeting and folding metal furniture. George Washington's desk, on the second floor, is bathed in a stream of damaging sunlight.
"If we have a wonderful building like this that we allow to deteriorate, it says something about us, about our spirit as New Yorkers and where we're going, what kind of city we are, what kind of a people we are," Mr. Dyson said. "A tiny bit of attention can make a big difference."

International Lease Is Buying Airbus Jets

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Airbus Industrie, Europe's large aircraft maker, said today that the International Lease Finance Corporation of the United States had placed firm orders for 30 new passenger jets with options for 10 more.
The order, estimated by industry sources to be worth at least $1.5 billion, calls for deliveries to start in February 1996 and continue to 2000. 
 This brings Airbus' total orders this year to 110, putting it almost neck and neck with its rival the Boeing Company, the Seattle-based plane maker that won 111 orders in 1994.
Airbus is a consortium comprising France's Aerospatiale , British Aerospace P.L.C., Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz A.G.
International Lease, a subsidiary of U.S. financial giant American International Group Inc., is the world's second-largest leasing firm providing airlines with aircraft. GPA is the largest.
International Lease had been expected to clinch the order since it signed a $1.5 billion syndicated loan with commercial banks in December.
Jean Pierson, Airbus managing director, aims to wrest market leadership from Boeing, but the chairman of the United States company, Frank Shrontz, is determined to defend Boeing's share, which he estimates at 60 percent.
The plane makers have always disputed market shares, but Boeing, founded in 1903, has held an undisputed lead since it brought out its B707 in 1955. Airbus was set up in 1972 and delivered its first planes in the mid-1970's.
In the middle of 1994, Airbus boasted that it had taken more orders than Boeing for the first time. Airbus's Mr. Pierson later said he was aiming for more than 50 percent of the world market, a statement that irked Boeing.
Airbus, Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, based in St. Louis, have been hit hard by a worldwide recession that began with the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and that is only now showing signs of bottoming out.
Thursday's transaction includes firm orders for 8 A319s, 13 A320s and 9 A321s. ILFC also took options on three A319s, three A321s and four A320s.
The A319, which seats about 124 passengers, is a shortened version of the A320 and the final assembly of the first plane of this type is expected in March next year.
The A320, in service since 1988, is a short-to-medium-haul twin-engine single-aisle plane that can seat 150.
The A321, which went into service this year, is a stretched version of the A320, seating 186.
"There has been growing airline lesse demand for A319, A320 and A321 aircraft from a large number of I.L.F.C. customers worldwide," the company chairman, Leslie Gonda, said in a statement.
International Lease is the single largest customer of Airbus, with 155 aircraft already under order. Of those, 40 have been delivered.

HEADLINE: Whistleblower, Out of Job, Wins $4 Million Settlement

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A whistleblower who has been unemployed since he quit a $470-a-week job as a New York State social services trainee four years ago and accused his department of misusing Federal funds has won more than $4 million as part of a settlement in which the state has agreed to pay the Federal Government $27 million.
The whistleblower, George Denoncourt, 48, filed the unusual lawsuit -- and won 15 percent of the settlement -- under the Federal False Claims Act, a Civil War statute originally intended to combat war profiteering, but amended in 1986 to encourage whistleblowers to expose modern skulduggery against government. 
 "He feels good about it," Stuart Pierson, a Washington lawyer representing Mr. Denoncourt, said yesterday as state officials acknowledged that they had settled the case, albeit without admitting any wrongdoing. "He and his family suffered a lot of financial privation to pursue this case."
Mr. Pierson said his client, a former resident of Troy, N.Y., who lives with his wife and four children in New Hampshire, received $4,050,000 as his share of the settlement, and $225,000 from the state for "being forced to resign" from a job that, he charged, was part of a state fraud against the Government.
Mr. Denoncourt, while a trainee with the Social Service Department's Office of Human Resources Development from January 1989 to October 1990, complained that Federal funds intended for training employees like him were being spent improperly on equipment and unauthorized workers, Mr. Pierson said.
"He felt his office was engaged in criminal activities having to do with Federal funds, and they would not give him a transfer to an honest job, so he had no recourse but to resign," Mr. Pierson said. His client then cooperated with a state investigation that ended in a critical report but no charges.
Continuing to pursue the case, Mr. Denoncourt in 1992 filed suit in Federal Court in Washington, charging that $14 million in Federal funds over 12 years had been spent improperly by state agencies on computers, fax machines and other equipment and on hiring janitors and other unauthorized workers.
The Justice Department did not join the suit, though it was a party to the $27 million settlement -- half of it for repayment, half as a civil penalty. Separately, Mr. Pierson said, the Justice Department has filed its own claims for $26 million in social-service training funds that it says were improperly used by the state. Negotiations over those claims are continuing, he said.
Terrance McGrath, a spokesman for the Social Services Department, said the state had settled only to save heavy litigation costs and treble damages if the suit was ultimately lost. He said the case involved only a small fraction of the $15 billion in Federal funds in his department's $30 billion budget.
Insisting that state employees had merely followed practices that dated to the 1970's and had done nothing improper, Mr. McGrath called the case a dispute over the interpretation of complex Federal rules governing the social-service training funds. Albany and Washington are always in disagreement over such funds -- with an average of $1.5 billion in dispute all the time, he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Are Mixed In Pre-Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday with some of the longer maturities down slightly in thin pre-holiday trading.
The market was weighed down by a report showing a larger-than-expected gain in the Government's chief forecasting gauge and by only a modest recovery in the dollar after a sharp decline on Wednesday. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 3/32 of a percentage point, to 96 4/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.84 percent from 7.83 percent on Wednesday. Rates on short-term bills were down slightly. The three-month bill rate was unchanged at 5.45 percent, while a six-month bill declined 6 basis points, to 6.17 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Tony Crescenzi, director of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said trading yesterday "did have some volatility, and that might be because it is in the midst of some consolidation, following its recent countertrend rally in the long end."
"This might be just the consolidation that the market needs in order to make further gains," he said, adding, "The failure of the dollar to barely recoup its losses left people in the bond market unsure on where the dollar would head next."
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that its index of leading indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in October.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director for ASB Capital Management, noted that the leading indicators had been stagnant lately, suggesting that by the end of the second quarter of 1995 the United States economy may slow in response to interest rate increases.
The market turns its attention today to a report on new-home sales for November. The data are often volatile and may not get a lot of attention from the market, Mr. Crescenzi said. The Chicago Purchasing Managers report will also be issued today.
The Public Securities Association, a trade group of securities firms, recommended that the Treasury market close at 2 P.M. today.
In the municipal market, prices fell as investors continued to sell bonds to record tax losses. Prices fell as much as 3/8 of a point, with few bonds trading. Investors got few clues about the direction of prices with little trading and only $263 million in new issues sold.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively municipal issues rose to 6.91 percent, from 6.90 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's 16-day cash management bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.752
Discounted Rate . . . 5.59%

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Added Demand From Asia Sends Copper to 6-Year High

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose to their highest levels in six years yesterday as economic growth in the United States, Japan and Germany continued to fuel a rally.
Demand from Asia has also been increased by the prolonged closing of the Philippines' only smelter, which was shut before the Christmas holiday because of typhoon damage and was not expected to reopen until next week. 
 "The market continues to attract Asian demand," an analyst at Paine Webber, Bernard Savaiko, said.
Copper futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York set contract highs for most months, with the contract for March delivery closing up 0.15 cent at 138.05 cents a pound, just below the day's peak of 138.40 cents.
On the Metal Exchange in London, copper for delivery in three months climbed above $3,000 a metric ton for the first time in six years.
Since the beginning of the year, copper prices have soared about 70 percent.
Demand for cooper is expected to grow more than 3 percent next year. Since no new mine or refinery output will be added until the latter half of 1995, analysts expect copper reserves to fall steadily.
Cotton prices also rose yesterday, approaching their highest levels since May 1991. Cotton for March delivery rose 0.46 cent, to 89.86 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Sharon Johnson, cotton analyst with Frank Scheider & Company, said the United States remained the only place in the world with cotton available to sell.
Despite the gains in copper and cotton, the Commodity Research Bureau's index slipped 0.49 point, to 236.35.
Among the commodities losing ground was crude oil, despite a surge in the January gasoline futures contract, which is due to expire today.
January unleaded gasoline jumped 0.93 cent, to 54.99 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But February crude oil fell 7 cents, to $17.72 a barrel.

Dollar Stages a Rebound From Mexico-Related Loss

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies in light trading yesterday, recovering from a sharp drop on Wednesday.
The dollar suffered its biggest one-day loss against the German mark in five months on Wednesday as Mexico's financial crisis roiled markets in the United States. 
 "The dollar is recovering today because it was dramatically overdone yesterday," Hunt Taylor said late in the trading day yesterday. He is managing director of the Reynwood Trading Corporation, a currency fund manager in Short Hills, N.J., with $100 million of assets.
Elizabeth Bussanich, a currency adviser at the Bank of Montreal in New York, said, "A lot of investors feel the dollar is a good bargain at these levels." She noted that the dollar was also supported by expectations that the Federal Reserve would again raise short-term interest rates at the end of January.
Higher rates typically bolster a currency by attracting investors to the rising yields of fixed-income securities denominated in the currency. The likelihood of higher rates means the dollar could reach 1.60 marks next month, she said.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5527 marks from 1.5450 marks on Wednesday, and to 1.3125 Swiss francs from 1.3040 francs. The dollar edged up to 99.70 Japanese yen from 99.30 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5610 from $1.5700.
The dollar closed at 4.8750 pesos, down 2 percent from Wednesday's close of 4.9750 pesos. The dollar has risen 40.7 percent against the peso since the Mexican Government first devalued its currency last week.
But the peso did not have much effect on the dollar's value against other currencies yesterday, traders said. "I think the worst is over," said Earl Johnson, currency adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar fell to a new eight-year low of 70.98 United States cents, before recovering to 71.15 cents in late trading, down slightly from 71.16 cents on Wednesday.
The Mexican crisis compounded the weakness of the Canadian dollar, which has been weighed down by the country's budget deficits and questions over Quebec.
Fund managers with holdings throughout North America sold Canadian assets in recent days to compensate for their losses on Mexican stocks and bonds, traders said. After selling Canadian stocks and bonds, the fund managers converted the Canadian dollar proceeds to United States dollars, traders said.

HEADLINE: U.S., Edging Higher, Ranks as World's 7th-Richest Nation

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The United States has advanced one notch to become the world's seventh-richest nation, but American shoppers get more for their money than residents in every country but Luxembourg, the World Bank said today.
The multilateral lending agency said the United States' economic output per person rose to $24,750 in 1993 from $23,830 in 1992. 
 In seventh place, the United States is behind Sweden and ahead of Iceland -- or about where it has been most years since at least 1980. Germany was seventh in 1992.
The data, included in the 27th edition of the World Bank Atlas, showed that Switzerland remained the world's wealthiest nation, with economic output per person of $36,410, down $320 from 1992.
Others in the top 10 were: Luxembourg, $35,850; Japan, $31,450; Denmark, $26,510; Norway, $26,340; Sweden, $24,830; Iceland, $23,620; Germany, $23,560, and Kuwait, $23,350.
By contrast, Mozambique remained the poorest country in the world, with output of just $80 a person.
While the United States ranked at the lower end of the top 10 list, Americans can take consolation from one fact: they have more purchasing power because prices are cheaper in the United States than overseas.
For the first time, the atlas shows the buying power within each country, after adjusting for differing price levels among nations.
Costlier goods and services reduce consumers' buying power, thus lowering the "real" per capita income in wealthier nations. Conversely, the lower the prices, the further the money will go, thus raising the effective consumer income.
Luxembourg had the highest real output per person of $29,510, followed by the United States at $24,750. The United States consistently has ranked among the top two on this basis. "Everybody loves coming to the United States because prices are cheaper here," Michael Ward, a World Bank economist, said.
Others rounding out the "real" top 10 were: Switzerland, $23,620; the United Arab Emirates, $23,390; Qatar, $22,910; Hong Kong, $21,670; Japan, $21,090; Germany, $20,980; Singapore, $20,470, and Canada, $20,410.
Such rankings have long been disputed, and the World Bank has long shied away from them, because they make poor countries look a little less poor and possibly less deserving of foreign aid.

HEADLINE: U.S. Index Signals Slower Growth in '95

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The Government's chief forecasting gauge signals slower economic growth next year, the Commerce Department reported today.
The department's index of leading indicators posted a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in November, after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in October, the first setback in 15 months. 
 While the November gain was better than expected, the performance of the index has clearly been signaling for the last six months a slowdown in growth but no outright downturn, analysts said.
"The leading indicators don't suggest a recession but there are clear indications that the economy will slip into a pattern of low growth next year," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Many analysts are forecasting that growth next year, as measured by the gross domestic product, will be below 3 percent. That would be significantly lower than the 4 percent growth rate expected for 1994.
In a second report today, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 3,000 last week, to 322,000, reflecting continued strength in labor markets.
That report was in line with other indicators that 1994 was ending at a robust pace. That strength has confirmed analysts' expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time since February when its policy-making committee meets in late January.
The Fed has been raising rates to slow growth and keep inflation from accelerating. Analysts said there were hints in the November leading- index report that this effort was starting to bear fruit with interest-sensitive sectors like building permits showing weakness.
The leading indicators report showed an even split with five business barometers showing strength and five others flashing signs of weakness.
The biggest contributor to the gain was a sharp rise in orders for new plant and equipment. Other components showing strength were gains in factory orders for consumer goods, a rise in unfilled orders for durable goods, a decline for the month in average weekly unemployment claims and a rise in prices of sensitive materials.
The biggest negative factor was a slowdown in growth of the money supply followed by a fall in stock prices, a drop in building permits, changes in business deliveries and a drop in consumer expectations.

HEADLINE: Ringing In The New With Music

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
ON New Year's Eve in New York City, it's a seller's market for revelry. The streets are swarmed and the restaurants packed with prospective merrymakers, all seeking the right place and atmosphere to share the ballyhooed moment when the calendar changes. Live music, with its promise of instant community and Dionysian prospects, is a potent lure; from the jazz cafes to Madison Square Garden, music packs 'em in, as people choose to spend the evening with others who share their taste or dance to the same beat.
For many people, putting on a party hat and slipping a CD into the home stereo -- or watching the Guy Lombardo Orchestra on PBS -- just doesn't provide the same excitement. Even at places that don't usually present music, New Year's Eve is the time to book a band. 
 For regular club- and concertgoers, New Year's Eve is a hint of what it must be like to live in Argentina; the overnight inflation rate is astonishing, more than enough to cover typical extras like free noisemakers and Champagne at midnight. It's also a night when things run even later than scheduled, since no one wants to leave the party early. But it's a special occasion, sometimes enough to make performers put out extra soul or spunk.
Planning ahead for New Year's Eve is a good idea, especially in New York City. Concerts sell out, clubs fill up and even at places that aren't filled, admission prices are significantly higher for those who decide at the last minute. On page C30 is a listing of pop critics' choices for clubs and concerts where tickets were still available at press time. In New York City, there's something for every taste, from standards to punk-rock, big bands to funk.

HEADLINE: Don't Abolish Meals Program for Elderly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For 30 years the Older Americans Act has provided vital services to people 60 years old and older, particularly those with the greatest economic and social needs. One of the most important services has been the nutrition program through which well-balanced meals are provided at senior citizen centers or are delivered to the homebound. 
It has proved to be a shining example of a low-cost, locally managed, volunteer-assisted, family supportive government program.
Early next month Congress will be presented with a legislative package, part of the Republican Contract With America, that would place the nutrition program into a block grant with food stamps, school lunches and other such programs. This will be accomplished through the personal responsibility-welfare reform bill.
The Older Americans Act is not an entitlement and has never been considered "welfare." Its loss would be a tragedy.

HEADLINE: Mexican Trade Won't Gain From Devaluation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Apropos "Mexico's Devaluation: Not So Scary" (editorial, Dec. 24): Some discussions in support of the Mexican peso's devaluation, though not this particular discussion, argue that currency values can be manipulated to manage trade. This was the essence of mercantilist trade theory, which died in the 19th century with the global influence of the British gold standard. 
 The idea crept back to produce the Depression's competitive currency devaluations. It surfaced again in persuading President Nixon to break the dollar's link to gold in 1971 in order to devalue the dollar against the Japanese yen and European currencies for trade advantage. One should be wary of embracing it.
Classical economic theory holds that it is not possible to change the terms of trade between two people or two countries by changing the value of the unit of account.
If three loaves of bread will trade for three bottles of wine when the dollar is valued at one unit, the same terms will hold if the government devalues the dollar to half a unit. The mercantilist model holds human behavior constant in promising that the producers of bread and wine will trade two loaves for four bottles.
The only confusion occurs in the short term, when the currency change overrides trade contracts that had already been signed. In that case, the vintner is legally forced to supply four bottles in exchange for the baker's two loaves.
When new contracts are made, the terms re-establish themselves. Currency changes usually occur when one trading partner can exert political influence to force the change, for short-term mercantilist advantage.
The point is made clearer by studying currency changes in countries that have contracts of short maturities. In Mexico last week, the Government devalued the peso almost 40 percent to gain advantages for its export industries. Before the week was out, Mexican labor leaders demanded 40 percent wage increases to offset the loss of purchasing power, insisting that business meanwhile freeze domestic prices.
All the new Mexican Government accomplished was to undermine confidence in its management of the peso as a commercial unit of account, which will make it more difficult for capital to flow to Mexico or for capital to form inside Mexico.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman would say that the Fed cannot control trade flows by altering the dollar's value. He might even note that since 1971, when we tried to lower our trade deficit with Japan, the dollar lost 75 percent of its value relative to the yen, yet our trade deficit with Japan increased severalfold.

HEADLINE: Mexican Trade Won't Gain From Devaluation;
Oversold Agreements

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Mexico's Devaluation: Not So Scary" (editorial, Dec. 24), asserting all is well with the North American Free Trade Agreement, states that "the purpose of trade is not to raise employment -- which the Federal Reserve now controls," but "to steer workers into high productivity jobs." 
 This is a reasonable and defensible position. Unfortunately, it is at odds with the positions put forward by the Clinton Administration and others who sold the North American trade agreement on promises of hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
It is also at odds with arguments in support of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in recent editorials, in which you maintained the agreement would produce economic gains of $100 billion (Oct. 5) or $200 billion (Sept. 29) a year.
These estimates of gains from GATT came from what are known as "computable general equilibrium models." In these models, trade affects employment directly (that is, the Federal Reserve does not control employment).
But these huge estimated gains are almost entirely attributable to the demand stimulus that is associated with a tax cut (tariff reduction), without any offsetting cut in spending. The sort of gains from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that would be associated with your new position are less than one-hundredth this size.
The GATT debate, like the North American Free Trade Agreement debate before it, would have been far more productive had exaggerated forecasts of economic gains not been given such extensive publicity.

HEADLINE: Two Confident Fighters Ready to Take On a New Year;
Clinton's Course: Islands of Constants in Ocean of Political Change

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
As Bill Clinton has struggled to right his Presidency in the grim weeks since Election Day, his advisers say, he has consulted friends old and new, far and wide, and heard them out at all hours of day and night. But he appears to have listened mostly to the man who has been his chief political strategist for 20 years: Bill Clinton.
If there was any doubt about the President's resolve to keep his job, he removed it today, taking the opportunity of a year-end interview with news-service reporters to declare unequivocally that he would run for re-election and to allow gamely that he was "not worried" about the possibility of a Democratic primary challenge. 
 Whether in talking politics, drafting two recent major speeches, or settling the scope of his proposed tax breaks for the middle-class, Mr. Clinton's hand has been heaviest, and sometimes all but alone. The President's aides suggest he has passed from shock to fury to the show of upbeat acceptance he displayed today.
"The battle over this all is going to be inside the President's own head," one Democratic Congressman said of the White House's effort to adapt to the new Republican ascendancy and the chorus of Democratic doubters. "He thinks he can make the best decisions, and so he basically says, shovel in the facts and opinions and I'll decide."
That has long been Mr. Clinton's approach -- for good, and often for ill. In the glum lull of his 1992 campaign, after the agonies of the New Hampshire primary and before the uplift of the Democratic Convention, he essentially functioned as scheduler, consultant, fund-raiser and factotum -- with exhausting and uneven effects. The solution then was to put James Carville, the crafty Cajun campaign consultant, in firm control.
The task of governing now is much more complex, Mr. Carville's stock is lower and interviews with White House aides and Democrats in Washington produced this rough consensus on the shifting status of those who have Mr. Clinton's ear, and whose advice leavens his actions:
*Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose public appearances since Nov. 8 have mostly been limited to ceremonial events, remains de facto chief domestic policy adviser. She is present at meetings on topics from health to welfare, and together with George Stephanopoulos, the senior presidential adviser, was a staunch advocate of the proposed tax breaks. In the news-service interview, Mr. Clinton said, "I hope she will continue to be an activist."
*The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, brought in last summer to help control the President's time, has succeeded well enough that he can now be a bottleneck, in such demand among Cabinet secretaries and old Capitol Hill colleagues that he is harder to reach than Mr. Clinton himself. Meetings are shorter, attended by fewer aides, with fewer tales told out of school. But Mr. Panetta, an old deficit hawk, could not deter Mr. Clinton from proposing tax breaks that would make it just that much harder to keep the deficit in check.
*The luster of Mr. Carville and his partner, Paul Begala, the pollster, Stanley Greenberg, and the media consultant, Mandy Grunwald -- the quartet that led Mr. Clinton's campaign -- is much dimmed. They are blamed in varying degrees for bad and costly advice and commercials for the Democrats this year, for apparent indiscretions in a spate of mid-term chronicles of the Clinton presidency, and their access to presidential deliberations has been diminished.
*Vice President Al Gore, always a central adviser, has assumed even greater importance and a renewed bond with the President, especially on questions of reshaping the bureaucracy and cutting the budget.
*Harold M. Ickes, the labor lawyer who ran Mr. Clinton's New York campaign in 1992 and is now deputy White House chief of staff, remains in the thick of the action, perhaps the individual trusted most by Mr. and Mrs. Clinton. He is perpetually mentioned as a likely candidate for a senior job in the re-election effort next year.
Much else, by the senior staff's own acknowledgment, is in flux, as Mr. Clinton prepares to name a new press secretary, new political aides, a new Democratic Party chairman and, by spring, at least a skeletal campaign staff for 1996. Not even the oldest hands in a White House that remains overwhelmingly young have any experience in dealing with a Republican Congressional majority.
"A lot of this is still seeing through a glass darkly," one senior aide said last week.
In the interview today, Mr. Clinton said he expected both cooperation and "hard fights" with the Republicans but predicted "an exciting and productive time for America if we really try to help the country instead of to help ourselves" in the next election. "I intend to seek re-election but that is not uppermost in my mind," he said, adding: "I get up every day fighting for the American people."
But the President is just as certainly fighting for his political life, and that has led him in recent weeks to lash out at advisers, formal and informal, whose advice he took in the fall campaign.
Several aides said that former Representative Tony Coelho, who was among those urging the Democrats to campaign against the Republican "Contract With America" -- a strategy that Mr. Clinton embraced, but that backfired badly -- had personally rubbed the President the wrong way with a manner franker than Mr. Clinton was accustomed to.
In meetings in the Oval Office, in telephone conversations, at holiday parties, the President has buttonholed old friends like Gov. Ned McWherter of Tennessee; Dick Morris, the Arkansas political consultant who advised his early gubernatorial campaigns; defeated Congressional Democrats like Dan Rostenkowski and Thomas S. Foley, and disgruntled moderate Democrats like Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who advised Mr. Clinton to shake up a White House staff they thought remained too liberal.
Precisely what comes out of such sessions is much harder to summarize, and always has been.
"Oh, I couldn't tell you how he makes up his mind," James Blair, the lawyer for Tyson Foods in Arkansas and one of Mr. Clinton's longtime advisers, recalled earlier this year of the the discussions that led up to the 1992 campaign. "He loves to take advice. He loves to talk. He frequently gives people signals that they misinterpret because he will take the opposite side of whatever your viewpoint is, and then you think that's what he believes. He just uses that as a device to milk your mind."
The President is tapping some minds less these days. One senior aide said that Mr. Begala, the consultant, has been in bad odor, especially with Mrs. Clinton, since the publication last summer of "The Agenda," Bob Woodward's book on the formulation of Mr. Clinton's economic plan last year. In the book, unattributed anecdotes that appear to come from Mr. Begala have the effect -- perhaps unintentional -- of belittling the President.
Several Democrats said one remaining question is whether Mr. Panetta will consolidate his authority even more. If Mr. Ickes should leave to work on the campaign, and if the other deputy chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, should become the coordinator of economic policy, filling the slot vacated by Treasury Secretary-designate Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Panetta might get to bring in his own team.
"Leon's been the best thing that's happened there," one friend of Mr. Panetta said. "But it was never going to be that the President would say, 'Here, Leon, run it.' "

HEADLINE: With Hope and Caution, U.N. Is Trying to Extend the Cease-Fire in Bosnia

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Warring factions in the conflict that has convulsed Bosnia and Herzegovina for 33 months continued today to inch toward a four-month cessation of fighting, which United Nations mediators hope will be a prelude to a political settlement of the war.
Seeking to conclude the accord by this weekend, the senior United Nations commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, met in Sarajevo with the Vice President of Bosnia, Ejup Ganic, then traveled to nearby Pale for talks with Bosnian Serb leaders. 
 Sporadic combat continued around the northwestern town of Bihac, but the rest of the country was calm as both Government and Bosnian Serb forces continued to observe the cease-fire negotiated last week by former President Jimmy Carter.
"I don't think there's been a cease-fire in my time here that's held as well as this one," said General Rose, who has commanded United Nations troops here for 11 months. "I think that's an indication of good intentions and of goodwill toward the peace process."
Leaders of both sides echoed the General's optimism.
"I hope that if we have a cease-fire in Bihac and a withdrawal of Croatian Serb troops from the area, we can proceed further and come to a cessation of hostilities," Vice President Ganic said.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Radovan Karadzic, reported that negotiations were "going very well."
"We expect the U.N. to discuss it with the Muslims and then we can go, let's say, to Geneva or a ship in the Adriatic Sea and sign it solemnly," Dr. Karadzic said. "I hope this will be done before Jan. 1."
United Nations officials in Zagreb said they were expecting the chief United Nations envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, to attend any signing ceremony. The officials said they expected any signing to take place in Sarajevo, but Dr. Karadzic seems to prefer another venue.
A Bosnian Government official said in Sarajevo that Mr. Akashi would travel to Sarajevo on Saturday morning in an effort to clinch an accord on a cessation of fighting. The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters that Mr. Akashi would seek to bridge "serious differences" between the two sides.
"He has some work to do if there is going to be a deal by Jan. 1," the official said.
If the accord is signed, mediators will then face the more daunting challenge of persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept the comprehensive peace plan proposed earlier this year by the five-nation "contact group," which consists of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
The Muslim-dominated Government has already accepted the plan, which would give it and its Croat allies control over 51 percent of the country's territory and Bosnian Serbs the remaining 49 percent. Bosnian Serb leaders have complained that the land apportioned to them under the plan is militarily indefensible and economically unproductive.
The self-appointed Bosnian Serb parliament, meeting in Pale on Thursday, approved a statement saying its side was ready to enter negotiations "based on the existing plan." That language fell short of what negotiators want. They have presented the contact group plan as a finished document not subject to change, and insist that the Bosnian Serbs accept it as it stands.
In the Serb-held region of Croatia today, Serb soldiers fired machine-gun bursts at two United Nations military observers and then forced them to lie on the ground while they were interrogated at gunpoint, the United Nations spokesman, Thant Myint-U, reported.
Mr. Thant Myint-U said the observers, a Ghanian and a Jordanian, were following a Serbian convoy "at a discreet distance" when they were fired upon. The observers turned back but were chased by Serbs, pulled from their vehicle, searched and interrogated before being released.
"We consider this completely unacceptable behavior," Mr. Thant Myint-U said.

A market year that began with traders and analysts confidently predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average would rise above 4,000 ended with the Dow up 1.01 point, at 3,834.44. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.89 point, down 1.3 percent for the year. [41.]
 
Treasury prices declined in a light trading session. Prices were little changed in the municipal bond market. [51.]
 
Pork prices rose sharply after a report indicated that hog farmers were planning to reduce the size of their herds. [52.]
 
The dollar slipped against the German mark and the Japanese yen in thin, preholiday trading. [52.]
 
 
International
 
The United States is threatening China with trade sanctions in an effort to force Beijing to halt abuses of copyright and patent protections. The proposed sanctions will be disclosed today. [41.]
 
Mexico's new Finance Minister lacks the political ambitions of his predecessor, which may prove to his advantage as he seeks to regain the confidence of investors. The new minister, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, is known as a bulldog administrator, and he takes the helm of an economy battered by the plunge in the peso. [41.]
 
 
Companies
 
Health Systems International is a billion-dollar takeover target. FHP International has offered $1.69 billion in stock, and Foundation Health has offered $1.55 billion in stock. Other bids are expected for Health Systems, which has one of the biggest publicly owned health maintenance organizations in the West. [41.]
 
Advanced Micro Devices won a victory in its long-running legal dispute with Intel over a 1982 licensing deal. [41.]
 
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises outlined a reorganization plan that would get it out of bankruptcy by the middle of next year. The plan, to which creditors have agreed in principle, has apparently resolved a dispute over the troubled chain's management. [43.]
 
Gaylord Entertainment is selling its cable-television systems for $370 million to focus on its cable country-music networks. [43.]
 
Standa of Italy plans to sell its seven Euromercato hypermarkets, which have been valued at close to $600 million. [43.]
 
MCI Communications filed a complaint against Pacific Bell ahead of the opening of California's local toll-call market. [43.]
 
 
Your Money
 
The rich are different in at least one respect: they can invest with the money management services of Bessemer Trust, whose minimum portfolio is $5 million. For those who won't be seeking personal service at Bessemer's oak-paneled offices, the firm has outlined its investment suggestions for the coming year. [39.]
 
Real estate investment trusts -- REIT's -- have been on an upturn after a roller-coaster year. Real estate mutual funds, which buy REIT's, were the best-performing fund sector in December. [39.]
 
Some brokerage firms are lowering fees on wrap accounts, but investors may need to ask for the lower prices to get them. [39.]

HEADLINE: Dogged Doctor for Mexico's Morass

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 30

 BODY:
After being passed over for Finance Minister and being forced to watch the man who got the post send the Mexican peso into a tailspin, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez finally has the job he wanted, and all the worries that go with it.
 With the resignation on Thursday of Jaime Serra Puche, Mr. Ortiz, a Stanford-trained economist who was Mexico's under secretary of finance for six years, takes control of an economy battered and thrown off course by the 30 percent devaluation of the peso. 
 Mr. Ortiz, 46, is known as a bulldog administrator -- short on style but tough enough to take on anyone who crosses him. He is already respected by Mexican and foreign business executives for his grasp of practical economics, which he proved in his work in privatizing Mexican banks. Now he must regain for Mexico the confidence of investors who pulled billions of dollars out of the market and threaten to remove more unless they see a credible rescue plan.
 Because he cannot be blamed for the recent clumsy devaluations, Mr. Ortiz is in a better position than his predecessor to devise and carry out a stabilization plan.
 The plan's details are not expected to be made known until Monday, but officials in interviews have sketched an austere program to further cool Mexico's sluggish economy, reduce already uneven consumer purchasing power and take advantage of higher import prices and lower prices on exports caused by the devaluation.
 By sharply reducing imports and cutting public spending, Mexico hopes to halve the $30 billion trade imbalance, which the Government now recognizes as the country's fundamental financial problem.
 Mr. Ortiz, within hours of taking over, was on the phone to New York, talking up investors and soliciting help from American commercial banks like Chase Manhattan.
 Such an open style is worlds apart from the way Mr. Serra worked during his 29 days in office. Mr. Serra was used to giving answers, not asking questions. His relationship with investment bankers was strained almost to breaking during a disastrous meeting at the New York Federal Reserve offices last week.
 The biggest difference between the new and old ministers, mutual acquaintances say, is that Mr. Serra had political ambitions and considered himself a potential presidential candidate, while Mr. Ortiz does not think of himself as anything other than an economist.
 "One of the advantages he has over Serra is that he does not try to give political answers; he's direct and to the point," said an American analyst who has worked extensively with Mr. Ortiz. "He's a hands-on person who knows the international community very well."
 Like Mr. Serra, Mr. Ortiz is a close friend of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. All three come from a generation of Mexican economists who earned graduate degrees at universities in the United States and are now running Mexico. When Mr. Ortiz earned his Ph.D. from Stanford, the title of his dissertation was "The Accumulation of Capital and Economic Growth, a Financial Perspective of Mexico."
 He has taught at Stanford and at Mexican universities, and from 1984 to 1988 worked with the International Monetary Fund in Washington, in time as an executive director representing Mexico and seven other Spanish-speaking nations. He was particularly active in currency issues.
 As undersecretary in the Finance ministry, Mr. Ortiz was responsible for the lucrative sale of Mexico's Government-owned banks, which took in about $12.4 billion.
 The privatizations hit some rough spots. In one instance, the same investors backed two separate bids to buy Banco Mexicano Somex. After their higher bid for $845 million was accepted, the investors pulled out, saying the price was too high. Some of them joined the runners-up, who paid $242 billion less for the bank. Despite criticism of the sale, Mr. Ortiz said the bidders did nothing illegal.
 In September, Government regulators filed charges against Carlos Cabal Peniche, a flamboyant businessman who had bought two of the privatized banks with the blessing of authorities, including Mr. Ortiz. He is now a fugitive, accused of illegally lending himself $700 million from the banks he had purchased.
 Mr. Ortiz handled the potentially embarrassing situation with candor. He called in reporters, briefed them on the details and conceded that supervision would have to be toughened. But he also said the actions taken against Mr. Cabal showed that Mexico was willing to go after law breakers.
 Mr. Ortiz's banking experience should prove useful as Mexico tries to undo the damage from the peso's slide. Some banks are expected to find themselves short of capital as a result. And American bankers here say that the Government is considering a change in the law that would let foreigners purchase Mexican banks.
 A slightly built man with curly hair, Mr. Ortiz as under secretary was overshadowed by the dignified presence of his former boss, Pedro Aspe, with whom he did not always see eye to eye.
 This past fall, Mr. Ortiz argued that the peso had to be devalued because Mexico could no longer sustain its trade imbalance. He suggested that the devaluation be carried out in an orderly way by widening the trading band that governed the peso's value, and increasing the daily depreciation allowed within the band by about one-third. But Mr. Aspe, and President Salinas, refused to take action.
 A pressing issue now facing Mr. Ortiz is what to do with the peso. Government officials working on the stabilization plan say there is a reluctance to return to the previous sort of semi-fixed exchange rate. The Mexican central bank is studying the monetary index used in Canada as a possible model.
 Under such a plan, the Government would abandon its policy of maintaining the exchange value of the peso in a tight trading band. Instead, it would set a broader target range for the peso, but would not be committed to keeping the currency's value in that range. This means that the Government would be more able to adjust more easily to changes in the flow of international investment.
 But at the same time, it might be more difficult to sufficiently control the domestic economy so that the Government could set attainable goals for inflation and limits for wage and price increases.
 The target range under the new plan is expected to be between 4 and 4.5 pesos to the dollar, officials said.
 In the future, if foreign investors find the local currency too attractive, running up its value and making exports more costly, short-term interest rates could be lowered to cool things off. Conversely, if the local currency is weak, the Government could raise interest rates to make the peso, and peso-denominated investments, more attractive.
 Mexican business and labor leaders are meeting with officials to agree on wage and price controls that will help Mexico through this difficult period. Workers are bound to suffer because wage increases next year are expected to lag behind the inflation rate. Government officials are estimating an inflation rate of 15 percent for 1995. But some outside economists believe that inflation of 20 percent is more realistic.
 A Mexican official working on the stabilization plan since the crisis last week said Mr. Ortiz had been able to step right into Mr. Serra's job "because he knows all the details of Mexico's financial working."
 President Zedillo is expected to outline the plan when he addresses the nation on Monday night. Mr. Ortiz should not have trouble completing the plan in time, the official said.
 "He doesn't like to do things in convoluted ways," the official added. "He goes right to the point."

HEADLINE: New Year's Eve: Sizzle and Fizzle;
Partying at Home If Partying at All: Who Needs Crowds?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Just last year, Jed Feuer had fistfuls of invitations for New Year's Eve parties where the guests stayed until well into the new year, huffing and puffing on noisemakers, hurling confetti at each other and guzzling glass after glass of champagne.
 This year, he has received not a one. And tonight, he will welcome 1995 at home, alone. 
 "I'm disappointed there's no fun party," said Mr. Feuer, a composer whose credits include the score for the play "Eating Raoul." "But I would rather be by myself than go to a party that's not fun."
 Maybe it's post-Christmas fatigue among party givers. Or that partygoers are worried about drunken drivers on the way home. Some have had their fill of potentially rowdy celebrations, like the one in Times Square, which largely attracts tourists, teen-agers and onetime-only New Yorkers. Others fume at restaurants and nightclubs that charge double or triple their usual prices for New Year's Eve.
 Judging from conversations with dozens of New Yorkers this week, there will be fewer lampshade-wearing blowouts tonight and more people singing "Auld Lang Syne" at home, if they bother to sing at all.
 Just because New Yorkers are not going far does not mean that they have decided it's time for austerity. Sherry-Lehmann Inc., the liquor store on Madison Avenue, has sold 5 to 10 percent more champagne than last year. "But I haven't heard about as many things this year," said David Tindall, the store's manager. "Nothing huge and excessive."
 The word from Petrossian, a boutique and restaurant that sold $55,000 worth of caviar on New Year's Eve a year ago, is much the same. "People aren't having big bashes," said Kate Merlino, a spokeswoman for Petrossian. "They're taking what they buy home or going to a friend's apartment and having a quiet celebration."
 But some celebrations will not be totally silent. Alexandra Hughes invited 100 friends for a New Year's Eve party last year. The wine and the cheese, the turkey and the ham cost more than $1,000. Not this year.
 "I'm just telling a few friends, go to the bar across the street," said Ms. Hughes, a mezzo-soprano who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "It's been a shaky year workwise, and I have an audition on the second of January. I thought, am I going to be able to recuperate and get it together and go and sing well 24 hours later?" So Ms. Hughes is venturing across the street.
 Paulette Hemmings, a nurse, is not venturing out at all. She said she would stay at home and watch television, counting down the minutes to midnight and watching the ball descend in Times Square. In past years, she has gone there to see the same thing, live and in person. Not tonight. "You get squashed," she said, "and I don't feel safe there."
 Other non-table-hoppers say it's the people at the next table they want to avoid. "It's amateur night out there," said G. David Newman, a financial consultant from Morris Plains, N.J. "It's a night when people who don't go out the rest of the year go out. We go out enough the rest of the year that we don't need to go out New Year's Eve. It's just not worth bothering. And I dislike forced frivolity."
 This is not to say that there won't be crowds out and about, some bigger than last year. Advance ticket sales for the alcohol-free First Night celebration in midtown Manhattan are up from last year and registration for the New York Road Runners' Club midnight run in Central Park is about the same as in 1993. They are signs, the race's organizers say, that the lure of old-fashioned parties is dimming.
 No wonder professional party planners say this is shaping up as a slow night. Margie Beck of Bravo Entertainment in Manhattan, which arranges for everything from magicians to stripograms, has only three events on her schedule.
 "It used to be a very busy night," she said.
 But party-hopping is the last thing Samuel Sanders wants. A couple of years ago, he bounced from party to party on New Year's Eve. He made it to four in all before the night was out. Not this year.
 "I seldom really get a chance to just stay at home and do nothing," said Mr. Sanders, a pianist who is scheduled to travel to six cities in Florida in six days next month. "You're so programmed to always be busy, do things, go out. This is a time when you just want to make believe you're away even when you're home. It's like taking a vacation right in your own home."
 Gerald Celente, the author of "Trend Tracking" (Warner Books), agrees that Americans will be partying less tonight. Stricter drunken-driving laws, he said, have made some would-be partygoers party closer to home -- within walking distance if not within their own homes. Also, he said, there is no longer a national focus on a particular New Year's Eve event. In other words, Guy Lombardo. "Tuning into Dick Clark just isn't a kick," he said.
 But Mr. Celente maintains that the biggest party pooper is a phenomenon he calls "futurephobia."
 "Whether it's Generation X or the baby boomers or the generation ahead of them," he said, "they're fearing the future. They fear it in terms of jobs, in terms of disease, in terms of the economy, in terms of world situations. And so they don't see anything to celebrate about a holiday that looks to the future."
 Deborah Faria of Manhattan plans to pay some bills. That might sound as pleasant as, say, a pre-midnight root canal. But Ms. Faria, a marketing consultant at the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, has her reasons.
 "I don't want to start the year with a hangover," Ms. Faria said, "and I'm tired from the holidays. I want to feel like I'm a little bit organized, since the entire rest of the year I'll just be falling behind."
 So she will bake a batch of chocolate-chip cookies and, at midnight, treat her cat to a steak.

CUOMO LIFTS RULE ON HOUSING HOMELESS
In a parting favor to Mayor Giuliani, Governor Cuomo relieved New York City of an 11-year-old obligation to immediately shelter homeless families. If the new state rule withstands court challenges, it will mean the city can legally leave families to sleep for two nights or more on the tables, chairs and floors of city offices while they wait for shelter. In the last four years, the city has routinely failed to place thousands of families as quickly as the state required, and as a result, state courts have fined it more than $5 million. Page 1.

BROOKLYN WORRIES ABOUT DEVELOPMENT
 
The Giuliani administration's plan to revitalize the real estate fortunes of Wall Street has provoked concern among political leaders and developers in Brooklyn that an enhanced market in lower Manhattan could imperil Brooklyn's downtown development.

HEADLINE: U.S. Preparing Trade Sanctions Against China

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Unable to resolve a dispute with China over American accusations of piracy of computer software, movies and tapes, the United States is preparing a list of punitive tariffs that the Chinese warn could bring on a trade war.
 Officials close to the negotiations said today that the threatened trade sanctions would involve more than $1 billion in Chinese products. The goal is to force the Chinese to halt what United States officials say are abuses that cost American companies $800 million annually in patent and copyright piracy. 
 A formal announcement of the proposed sanctions will be made Saturday by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the officials, who spoke on condition that their names not be used.
 The sanctions will not go into effect until after a 30-day comment period. American importers will be given the chance to argue against sanctions in particular areas that might cause extensive harm to American businesses and consumers.
 In Beijing, Chinese officials were taking a tough line as well, saying they had increased efforts to halt abuses of copyright and patent protections. They warned that if the United States carried through with its threat, the Chinese Government would retaliate against American products.
 "To threaten trade retaliation will not solve the problem and will do no good," said Shen Guofand, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
 One United States official said the Chinese products that would face sanctions would include all of the most popular Chinese imports to the United States: textiles, clothing, toys and electronics.
America's trade deficit with China is certain to set another record this year, running at an annual rate of $29.5 billion through October. That puts the China deficit second only to that with Japan, which was running at an annual rate of $64.7 billion through the first 10 months of the year.
 Those figures have made Japan and China the chief targets of United States efforts to knock down foreign barriers in a bid to narrow the overall trade gap.
 As for Japan, United States officials reported they were close to reaching agreement on lowering barriers that have prevented American banks and brokerage companies from expanding their operations in Japan.
 Timothy Geithner, a Treasury Department official who heads the American negotiating team, said today that many contentious issues in financial services had been resolved during talks with the Japanese this week in Seattle.
 "We made a lot of progress across the board and we are close," he told reporters. A Treasury source said that both sides needed more time to draft final language but that an agreement could come soon.
 The prospects for the Chinese trade negotiations, however, appeared less promising. But if the dispute follows the pattern of trade fights with China over the last several years, a deal could still be reached before the sanctions take effect.
 United States officials planned to release a preliminary list of products that could be subject to punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent.
 Last January, Washington withdrew a threat of sharp reductions in China's textile quotas after reaching a last-minute agreement with Beijing. Earlier, during the Bush Administration, $3.9 billion of Chinese goods were put on a list for sanctions, but the sanctions never took effect because the Chinese agreed to a series of market-opening moves.
 American business groups have urged the White House to stand firm in the latest conflict. The Recording Industry Association said today that there were 26 Chinese plants capable of producing 70 million compact disks in violation of copyrights and that such practices had cost American music producers $345 million in 1993.
 American computer software makers and film producers have made similar assertions that their products are being copied illegally in China.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Off on Mixed Economic News

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell in a shortened session yesterday, bringing down the curtain on one of the market's worst years in decades.
A report indicating strong economic growth, coupled with a weak dollar, prompted investors to sell yesterday. The price of the 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to 9524/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.87 percent, from 7.84 percent Thursday. 
 To show how much Treasury securities have fallen this year, Hotchkis & Wiley, a Los Angeles money manager, said that as of Thursday a 6.25 percent 30-year bond had fallen in price by 17 percent from the beginning of the year. If an investor had sold that issue at the peak in yields on Nov. 7, the price would have declined more than 20 percent.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new single-family homes fell 2.5 percent, the first drop in five months. While that was in line with analysts' expectations, a separate report yesterday from the Chicago Purchasing Management Association showed that business activity remained at a high level in November in that region. Traders said this was enough to send bonds lower in light trading.
Looking at 1994, Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said many market participants came into the year under the impression that economic growth was still weak. Growth accelerated and the Federal Reserve repeatedly raised short-term interest rates.
Investors responded by selling bonds. Mr. Platt noted how severe the selloff had been, with interest rates up as much as three percentage points in some maturities.
According to the Lehman Government/Corporate Index, which some consider a good measure of bond market performance, 1994 will be the first time since the index's creation in 1973 that total return will be negative.
In the municipal bond market yesterday, prices were little changed as very few of the money managers who did work felt compelled to take on new holdings before year's end. There was some last-minute selling for tax purposes, with more than $40 million in municipal paper offered on the secondary market. The Bond Buyer index showed the average yield to maturity up very slightly, at 6.92 percent.

HEADLINE: Poor Schools Avert Seizure By New Jersey

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
In November, Atlantic City became the newest member of a seemingly ever-expanding club: New Jersey school districts at risk of being seized by the state.
 Every district on the list is urban, as are the two school systems already under state control -- Jersey City and Paterson. And with Newark on the verge of being taken over, New Jersey might seem to be moving steadily toward the day when Trenton will pilot every urban system in the state. 
 But not every urban district that fails to meet state standards ends up under state control. For example, Hoboken won back its certification in 1992 after years of intensive state monitoring. Camden, which ran into trouble in 1986, hopes to be certified in June. Trenton and Asbury Park, while still struggling, have also made significant progress, state officials said.
 What is the difference between a district that makes progress and a district that fails, between a school system that can avert state control and a district that cannot -- between, in essence, Camden and Jersey City?
 "We were wondering that ourselves," said Leo F. Klagholz, the state Education Commissioner. "The politics seem different. In Camden, they appear able to draft a legitimate set of education goals and pursue them and be fairly immune to political considerations."
 Other state education officials say the most important difference is an open and responsive leadership.
 "They're not always on the defensive and they are right up front about the criticism brought by an agency such as ours," said Dr. Louis Acocella, the Hudson County Superintendent, who oversees monitoring in the county. "In Hoboken, they were very open."
 Dr. Edwin Duroy, the Hoboken Superintendent, said too many struggling districts bog down on fixing the problems and do not move to more advanced goals.
 "We knew that was not enough," he said. "We needed to challenge our students because we knew they could do better."
 In their battle against takeover, Newark officials have often grumbled that the state does not understand the city's particular burdens.
 But Camden is New Jersey's poorest city; whatever Newark's problems, Camden has more of the same. Students in Camden, the state's fourth-largest school district, are mostly poor and increasingly diverse: mostly black and Hispanic but with a growing population of Cambodians, Haitians and Vietnamese. Their parents often do not have jobs (the city has a 22 percent unemployment rate) and their streets are unsafe (there are 34 violent crimes per 1,000 people, one of the highest rates in the state).
 The district's mobility rates are high -- 35 percent as a district, higher in some individual schools. That means that more than a third of Camden's students switch schools or districts from one year to the next.
 "They move and come and go and that creates nightmares for us," said Roy Dawson, Camden's Superintendent, especially when it comes to state-required testing. "It's not unheard of for us to have a substantial number of students in April that are youngsters we never really had the opportunity to teach, and they are now going to come and be part of our tests."
 Yet state education officials who can barely conceal their scorn for Newark are full of praise when they speak of Camden. One reason is that the system is relatively free of the mismanagement, financial irregularities and political interference that strangled Jersey City and also afflict Newark.
 "Quite simply, Camden's administration isn't under the control of any covert political machine," Mr. Klagholz said.
 Newark officials vowed to resist state control early in the monitoring process. In 1993, for example, members of a state investigative team were arrested when they tried to inspect an elementary school. Two months later the two sides held a 12-hour standoff over district records.
 But Camden officials accepted the state's criticism, said Dr. John Sherry, the state superintendent for the southern region and the former Camden County Superintendent.
 He said the system had taken care of most of the 130-odd directives listed by the state in its most critical report on the system. Lighting levels were brought up to par, leaking roofs were fixed, substandard classrooms were enlarged or shut down. Curriculum changes were accompanied by staff retraining; for example, because it was important for math instructors to teach more than simple computation, they took classes to reinforce their skills in complex reasoning and problem solving.
 "Each and every time those issues have been brought to their attention, they have been proactive in rectifying those situations," Dr. Sherry said. "It's clear to me that we have a district that is trying."
 Camden has five Comer Project schools, developed by James Comer of Yale University and based on the belief that parents should play a vital role in education. Comer schools have mental health teams that focus on emotional or family problems; they hold retreats for parents and teachers; they stress local school management and local control.
 At one Comer school, the Rafael Molina School in North Camden, an ominous-looking chain-link fence surrounded the asphalt parking lot, separating the school from the withering row homes across the street. But inside, the school was warm and brightly lit. In the computer room, second-grade students stared intently at their screens. Two teachers' aides made decorations in the parents' center, where parents can gather at any time for coffee or to plan events for the school.
 Dr. Sherry said the first time he visited a Camden school, "I thought I had entered the oasis in the middle of the desert."
 "I have spent time visiting in other urban centers," Dr. Sherry said. "I came back saying to myself, 'Thank God I'm in Camden.' "
 None of this is to say that Camden is problem-free. Its biggest problems have been low attendance and abysmal test scores, especially in math. Improvements in those areas have come slowly.
 In 1990-91, 9 of Camden's 34 schools had less than 85 percent daily attendance. Last year, every school but one met that standard.
 The district's overall test scores have risen steadily since 1991. But only 47 percent of eighth graders met or exceeded state standards in math on the 1994 Early Warning test. And only 33 percent passed all three parts of the test.
 Dr. Sherry said he was particularly concerned about the district's sixth-grade math scores. Scores for that test ranged from 50.6 in one school to 97.4 in another. The state standard was 86.6.
 Dr. Dawson said the district had tried to turn the attendance tide by hounding parents, juvenile court judges and social service agency workers to get students back into school whenever possible. It took hundreds of students from one school that had served primarily special-education children and put them into regular education classes.
 The district also created or expanded summer, weekend and after-school tutoring programs, and spent more time preparing students for the various standardized tests.
 Linnea Weiland, director of urban education for the Education Department, said Camden benefited greatly from money from the Quality Education Act, a $1.1 billion public school financing program passed by a Democratic Legislature in 1990. With the money, the district created all-day kindergartens in most elementary schools and opened a medical arts high school at a hospital.
 While it is still too early to say whether Camden will be certified this year, state officials are optimistic. So far, 17 schools have been examined, and all have passed, said Winifred L. Tillery, the Camden County Superintendent and a former assistant state commissioner.
 The district is eager for certification.
 "It takes away the stigma that those educators, those children in urban areas are not capable of doing whatever it is that is expected," Dr. Dawson said. "Everyone in every institution wants to be able to say, 'We're certified and we're doing the right thing.' "
 But even if Camden is certified this year, it will be only part way home. It will have regained its certification under the standards in effect at the time the system ran into trouble. But those guidelines have since been replaced by tougher standards, which the district will have five to seven years to meet.
 The new system uses more rigorous tests, focuses more on individual schools rather than districts, and tries to judge schools more on how its students fare than on how it gets the job done, Ms. Weiland said. The new system also focuses on students in the 4th, 8th and 11th grades rather than those in the 3d, 6th and 9th grades because nationally educators are coming to believe those grades are more crucial, she said.
 And even the tough new standards are considered the least a district should achieve. No good district will be satisfied because it has met state standards, said the Hoboken Superintendent, Dr. Duroy.
 "We accepted the criticisms, we accepted the challenge the state proposed and we met it," Dr. Duroy said. "But that was the beginning for us. We appreciate the state, and we want to keep it at a distance."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Wall Street Plan Worries Brooklyn Officials

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration's new plan to revitalize the real estate fortunes of Wall Street has provoked concern among political leaders and developers in Brooklyn that an enhanced market in lower Manhattan could imperil Brooklyn's downtown development.
 Despite the successful development that has taken place in downtown Brooklyn in recent years -- the $1 billion commercial and academic complex known as Metrotech Center is largely completed and what is done is fully occupied -- nearly half a dozen major development sites in the area remain vacant. In addition, the project to construct a hotel and office tower remains delayed, and the hope of developing more than 1.2 million square feet of office space at the proposed Atlantic Center has been placed on hold. 
 "We recognize the importance of economic development in the city, but the dynamic we don't want to see happen is to have Wall Street given a greater advantage, an advantage to the detriment of Brooklyn," said Robert B. Catell, president of Brooklyn Union Gas, the utility, which relocated its headquarters to the Metrotech complex. "Too much has been done here, too much has been invested, too much remains to be done."
 Administration officials, however, said such alarm was not merited. The Wall Street plan, announced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani this month, calls for sharp reductions in property and commercial rent taxes for companies that renew leases or move businesses to the Wall Street area, although they must be in buildings constructed before 1975. It would also ease restrictions on the height and bulk of new buildings.
 But Giuliani aides say that the tax benefits being considered for lower Manhattan were similar to those that have been extended to Brooklyn for years, and that the plan for Wall Street would bar the relocation of businesses from the other boroughs. Further, they contended that the long-term economic health of downtown Brooklyn -- just a subway stop away -- would hinge on a reinvigorated Wall Street real estate market.
 "The potential impact on downtown Brooklyn has been looked at, and the plan for lower Manhattan was crafted to protect Brooklyn's interests," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter. "In fact, a healthy downtown Manhattan was what made the success of downtown Brooklyn a possibility in the first place."
 Clay B. Lifflander, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, was even more blunt about Brooklyn's stake in the Mayor's proposal for Wall Street.
 "If downtown Manhattan dies, there will be no further expansion whatsoever in Brooklyn," said Mr. Lifflander, who helped draft the Mayor's proposal. "New York has to stop fighting with itself, stop cannibalizing itself. We have to have multiple options for keeping and attracting business. The borough distinction is interesting. It is not paramount."
 Downtown Brooklyn has benefited from more than $130 million in city, state and Federal funds for capital projects over the last decade, and profited from hundreds of millions of dollars in tax abatements. Those inducements -- including a 13-year exemption from real estate taxes for developers -- helped bring about the construction of the Metrotech complex, the building of the 19-story Pierrepont Plaza, and the relocation of financial industry tenants like Morgan Stanley & Company.
 Borough officials say the development in Brooklyn has added 15,000 jobs in the last five years, and they hope as many more new jobs will be created by the end of the decade.
 "I'm not against the plan for Manhattan, but there remain great pockets of need in downtown Brooklyn," said Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President. "The city has never properly or adequately promoted downtown Brooklyn as an option for preserving or attracting businesses. It's almost like we are at adversarial positions. And we don't want a gun at our backs."
 The unease concerning the Mayor's plan felt by elected officials and developers in downtown Brooklyn is deepened by the Mayor's interest in constructing express commuter trains to downtown Manhattan from the Long Island Rail Road terminus at Atlantic Avenue.
 Mr. Golden termed the plan "ludicrous," complained that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had recently removed the rehabilitation of the Atlantic Avenue terminus from its list of capital projects, and said that keeping the transportation hub for 140,000 daily commuters at Atlantic Avenue was crucial to the future development of Atlantic Center -- the proposed $530 million office, retail and housing complex in the surrounding area.
 Administration officials, though, said they were puzzled by the concern about connecting the Atlantic Avenue terminus with Wall Street, saying again that the effort to salvage lower Manhattan's prospects could only serve Brooklyn's long-range interests.
 "I suppose it is the nature of the political beast to have apprehension," said Deputy Mayor Reiter. "But we do not see this all as a threat."
 The principal players in Brooklyn, however, feel they might be at a critical stage in the development of downtown. Ground has not been broken at sites at 330 Jay Street and within the Metrotech complex, and the hotel project, Renaissance Plaza, has labored for years to attract major tenants. Many developers and local officials consider the hotel to be perhaps the most vital ingredient in downtown's economic expansion. It would be the first hotel built in Brooklyn in decades.
 Earlier this month, the Giuliani administration threatened to end the involvement of the hotel's developer, the Muss Development Corporation, unless overdue payments to the city were made and a financial plan for going forward with the 10-year-old project was presented. Josh Muss, president of the company, said this week that such a financing package was "going to happen very quickly."

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects Computer-Crime Indictment

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Declining to prosecute a computer-age crime with telegraph-era law, a Federal judge in Boston on Thursday dismissed an indictment against a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had been accused of operating a computer system used for distributing pirated software.
The student, David LaMacchia, 21, an electrical engineering and computer science major from Rockville, Md., was indicted in April. He was accused of using two of the university's computers as electronic bulletin boards where computer users connected to the Internet could trade illegally copied software. 
 Prosecutors said that while Mr. LaMacchia apparently did not profit from the trading, his operation was one of the largest hubs in a worldwide electronic black market that traded billions of dollars worth of illegally copied software each year.
Judge Richard Stearns of Federal District Court ruled that while Mr. LaMacchia's conduct might have been "heedlessly irresponsible" and had perhaps violated civil copyright laws, the young man could not be prosecuted under Federal wire-fraud felony laws without making criminal the conduct of "the myriad of home computer users who succumb to the temptation to copy even a single software program for private use."
"It is not clear that making criminals of a large number of consumers of computer software is a result that even the software industry would consider desirable," the judge wrote.
Tens of millions of personal computer users routinely copy software, often for legitimate reasons like emergency backups or transferring programs to new machines. But software industry associations say illegal copying deprives companies of as much as $13.8 billion in revenue each year.
Mr. LaMacchia was accused of operating the software repositories, known on the Internet as Cynosure, from November 1993 until M.I.T. shut down the repositories in January 1994. Donald Stern, the United States Attorney in Boston, said more than $1 million worth of illegally copied software, including popular games and business programs, had passed through the system during the weeks it was in operation.
Mr. LaMacchia, who the authorities said used the pseudonyms Grimjack and John Gaunt, was not accused of using the software himself or of profiting from the trading. Rather, Grimjack orchestrated the flow of software in and out of the systems and admonished its many anonymous users to keep the site's location on the Internet a secret.
Judge Stearns, saying "this case presents the issue of whether new wine can be poured into old bottles," suggested that it was up to Congress to draft new laws to deal with copyright issues in the computer software era.
"What the Government is seeking to do is to punish conduct that reasonable people might agree deserves the sanctions of the criminal law," he said.
But, he concluded, the Government erred in trying to use the criminal penalties of the wire-fraud statutes against what was, at most, a civil violation of copyright laws.
Mr. Stern, the United States Attorney, said prosecutors had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.
"I intend to raise with the Department of Justice whether it should file legislation explicitly dealing with willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software to remove any uncertainties," Mr. Stern said.
Harvey A. Silverglate, Mr. LaMacchia's lawyer, said the charges did not constitute a criminal violation of existing copyright law.
"So the Government has taken this old Federal wire-fraud law, which predates computer software, and has claimed they can recast this copyright case as a wire-fraud case and prosecute it as a five-year prison felony," he said. "If the court allows prosecutions of noncriminal activity under these circumstances, it sends a chill down the spine of anyone operating a computerized bulletin board system."

HEADLINE: Pataki to Freeze Nonessential Hiring

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
On the eve of the inaugural festivities in Albany, Governor-elect George E. Pataki yesterday made another round of appointments to the top level of state government and announced that, as one of his first acts as Governor, he would freeze "nonessential" hiring for the rest of the state work force.
 Mr. Pataki said the state's fiscal condition -- made worse by what he said is a $100 million hole in this year's budget -- prompted the need for the freeze. He said he planned to issue an executive order covering the 230,000-person work force in the first few days of his administration and could not predict when the state would begin hiring again. 
 "I would expect that given the magnitude of the fiscal problems we face, it could be for some time," Mr. Pataki said in a telephone interview, when asked about the possibility of a freeze. "I certainly would rather freeze hiring at the beginning and reduce the risk of layoffs than allow the state to continue to hire people and have to go through massive layoffs."
 An exception, he said, would be those workers necessary for the "health and safety" of citizens, but even those might have to be approved by budget officials, he said. The possibility of a freeze was first reported yesterday by The New York Post.
 The other exceptions are top officials to state agencies, authorities and commissions, and yesterday Mr. Pataki made another 10 major appointments and named four other people to key staff jobs.
 James F. Gill, 63, a Democrat and labor lawyer who headed the so-called Gill Commission on school corruption in New York City five years ago, agreed to serve for three months as director of the Office of Employee Relations. He said his job will be to negotiate this spring with the half-dozen state unions whose contracts are to expire. The job now pays $101,505 a year.
 Mr. Hill is the second official Mr. Pataki has appointed for only 90 days; the first was Mary E. Glass, named earlier this week as Commissioner for Social Services. Transition officials said that the two 90-day appointments do not reflect a difficulty in filling top jobs, although they concede that some prospects want more money than the state pays and that, given 20 years of Democratic rule, there is no great pool of Republicans with state-wide governmental experience.
 "We have coaxed them into the administration with specific goals and purposes in mind," Mr. Pataki said about the short terms of Mr. Gill and Ms. Glass.
 Among the other appointments, Charles A. Gargano, 59, the finance chairman for Mr. Pataki's campaign who helped raise $14 million, was named to be director of economic development as well as chairman of the state Urban Development Corporation. The job now pays $90,832.
 A long-time aide to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Gargano was from 1955 to 1984 a vice president and part owner of the J.D. Posillico Company, a construction company based in Long Island.
 During his tenure there, the Suffolk County District Attorney brought a civil racketeering suit against the company and two other construction firms. Mr. Gargano was not a defendant in the suit, which charged that the three companies were involved in fraud and payoffs in connection with the awarding of $1 billion in Suffolk County sewer contracts. The Posillico Company settled the suit for $315,000 without admitting any wrongdoing.
 A routine investigation of Mr. Gargano by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1988, part of his appointment by President Reagan as Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, resulted in no reports of wrongdoing at his Senate confirmation hearing.
 In total, Mr. Pataki has named 25 people to top jobs in the week before he is to be sworn in. In addition to Mr. Gill and Mr. Gargano, four other appointments require confirmation of the state Senate:
 *John L. Behan, a Republican Assemblyman from Montauk who lost both legs above the knees in Vietnam, was named director of the Division of Veteran's affairs. The job now pays $76,421.
 *Edward J. Muhl, who was the Insurance Commissioner in Maryland from 1982 to 1988, was named state Insurance Superintendent. The job now pays $90,832.
 *Edward Mercado, the former director of the Office for Civil Rights in the Federal Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, was named Commissioner of the state Division of Human Rights. The salary is now $82,614.
 *Peter W. Delaney, the administrator of the Westchester County Department of General Services, was named Commissioner of the State Office of General Services, a job that oversees state purchasing and properties. He is a friend of Mr. Pataki, and also lives in Peekskill. The job now pays $95,635.
 Four other jobs do not require confirmation:
 *Robert J. Bellafiore, a former Associated Press reporter and director of communications for the Business Council of New York State, was named press secretary. His salary has not been set.
 *Donna Arduin, a deputy in Michigan to Patricia A. Woodworth, the newly appointed budget director, was named deputy to the budget director. Her salary has not been set.
 *Donald G. Dunn, the former first deputy under the Republican Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, was named first deputy secretary to the Governor. This is a new position.
 *Louis R. Tomson, a lawyer and former general counsel to the New York State Dormitory Authority, was named deputy secretary to the Governor for Authorities. This is also a new position.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
A Forecast of Fewer Sows Sends Hog Prices Soaring

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Pork futures prices surged yesterday after an Agriculture Department report indicated that hog raisers were planning to reduce the size of their herds.
On other commodities markets, cotton and sugar prices also rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.29 point, to 236.64. 
 The Agriculture Department said Thursday that farmers planned to keep 3 percent fewer sows for breeding. That would mean fewer hogs for sale next summer, when demand is strong.
A large number of hogs coming to market this fall sent pork prices to 20-year lows, well under the break-even point for hog farmers, analysts said. "The U.S.D.A. surveyed farmers when hog prices made their lows and hog farmers had to be pretty discouraged at that time," said Dan Vaught of A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hogs for delivery next August surged 1.1 cents yesterday, to 44.70 cents a pound, while hogs for delivery in February dropped 0.125 cent, to 39.35 cents. February pork bellies gained 1.075 cents to 41.375 cents a pound.
Consumer prices for pork products will hold steady in 1995 as the packers pay more for hogs, predicted Robert Manly, president of the Smithfield Packing Company. "Supermarket prices never really went down as we approached the 20-year low," he said.
Cotton prices rose to a three-and-a-half-year high yesterday after the Agriculture Department said cotton sales for export soared last week. It said 510,000 bales of cotton were registered for export in the week ending Dec. 22, bringing the total since August to 2.38 million bales, a 68 percent increase from the similar period last year.
"We have had tremendous demand from overseas, particularly from countries that usually can depend on their own cotton supply like China and India," said Raphael Speck, senior vice president with Volkart International in Phoenix. "The whole world is coming out of a recession simultaneously, and people are starved for textiles."
On the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton for March delivery rose 0.49 cent to 90.35 cents a pound, the highest since May 23, 1991.
Sugar prices rose to a four-and-a-half-year high amid speculation about growing demand from China, traders said. The March sugar contract gained 0.28 cent, to 15.17 cents a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, its highest since May 3, 1990.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell In November

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in November for the first time in five months, the Commerce Department reported today, and analysts predicted further declines in 1995 as the effect of higher interest rates reduced demand.
 "It's clear this is the beginning," said David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers of America. "The housing sector is slowing." 
 Joseph Blalock, an economist with the Savings and Community Bankers of America, agreed, saying that in addition to higher rates, slower growth in 1995 would also contribute to the sale of fewer homes.
 Housing is one of the most interest-sensitive areas of the economy. Many other areas have yet to feel the effect of six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year.
 The United States Chamber of Commerce, for instance, said that its business confidence index shot up to 65.2 in December, the highest since its inception in May 1990.
"Businesses responded favorably to the robust but noninflationary growth in the economy," a chamber economist, Martin Regalia, said.
 The chamber said its bimonthly survey found substantial improvement in economic outlook, sales and employment expectations.
 But the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 2.5 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 693,000, down from a revised rate of 711,000 for October. It was the first decline since sales plunged 9.2 percent in June.
 The report also showed that the housing market was much weaker than previously thought in August, September and October. The October rate, for instance, had originally been estimated at 726,000.
 The weakening housing market was evident, too, in sales of previously owned homes. The National Association of Realtors said earlier this week that November sales dropped to the lowest level in 17 months.
 Many analysts have predicted a housing slowdown as mortgage rates rose. Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 9.18 percent in November, up from 8.93 percent in October and 7.15 percent in February, when the Fed began raising rates, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said.
 Still, job and income growth offset the higher cost for many home buyers, and others switched from fixed-rate mortgages to adjustable-rate loans with lower initial costs.
 Despite the November sales decline, analysts do not foresee a collapse in the housing market.
 Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, forecast that new-home sales would total 645,000 in 1995. Although that would be down from an estimated 675,000 this year, it would be well above the lows of 534,000 in 1990 and 509,000 in 1991, the deep points of the recent recession.
 The median sale price last month was $128,700, compared with $130,000 in October.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Slight Losses In Slow Trading Session

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against the German mark and the Japanese yen in light preholiday trading yesterday.
Trading was thin, with most participants having already closed their books for the year. In New York trading the dollar slipped to 1.5495 marks from 1.5527 marks on Thursday. It also edged down to 99.58 yen from 99.70 yen. 
 The British pound rose to $1.5647 from $1.5610, and the Canadian dollar recovered to 71.33 United States cents from 71.15 cents. The dollar fell to 1.3085 Swiss francs from 1.3125 Swiss francs on Thursday.
The Mexican peso has faded in importance for the currency market since the peso began to stabilize on Wednesday and President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon outlined a plan to end the country's financial crisis, dealers said. The dollar was quoted at 5.075 pesos yesterday, up from 4.875 pesos on Thursday.
Some dealers said yesterday that they expected the dollar to move higher next week in anticipation of a strong employment report.
"We're still creating jobs, which will help make the Fed raise interest rates," said Hillel Waxman, manager of currency trading at Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
Many dealers expect the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time since February when its policy-making committee begins meeting on Jan. 31. Higher interest rates often help a currency by attracting international investors to the increasing yields of bonds and bank deposits denominated in the currency.
The broad retreat in the value of the dollar on Wednesday "affords people better levels" at which to buy the dollar next week, said Jim Powers, senior currency dealer at Royal Bank of Canada in New York. The dollar suffered its biggest one-day loss against the mark in five months Wednesday, falling to 1.5410 marks in intraday trading as Mexico's financial crisis roiled United States markets.
Many traders had gone into 1994 expecting the dollar to rise on strong economic growth in the United States. But the dollar defied expectations, touching a record low of 96.12 yen on Nov. 2. The dollar also slipped to a two-year low of 1.4860 marks in intraday trading on Oct. 25.
For all of 1994, the dollar declined 10.9 percent against the mark and 11 percent against the yen.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Rebound Bolsters Investors In REIT's

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in real estate stocks have developed a case of whiplash this year.
 On top of three years of double-digit gains -- fueled largely by record low interest rates -- the stocks cruised upward in the first half of 1994 even when rates began to rise. Their strength belied the conventional wisdom that the category was sensitive to interest rates. 
 But the stocks soon slid into reverse. As a pattern of rising rates became apparent and new offerings of real estate investment trusts glutted the market, the total return on REIT's, which are pools of real estate or mortgages that trade as stocks, plunged 10.4 percent from June through November. That pushed the group to a 5 percent loss for the year, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts reported.
 In December, REIT's staged a strong rally. Now money managers and REIT financial analysts are pointing to the rebound as proof that the overall decline this year is nothing more than a long-overdue correction in a continuing bull market.
 At the least, the recent surge has eased some of the pain for investors. Real estate mutual funds, which buy REIT's, were the best-performing fund sector for December, rising 6.89 percent on average through Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund research firm in Summit, N.J. And one young fund, American Capital Real Estate of Houston, gained 9.3 percent. Over all, real estate funds were down 3.28 percent for the year through Dec. 30.
 Many financial analysts expect the rebound to continue for weeks as bottom-feeders troll for cheap shares. And for the longer term, they suggest the worst is over for many REIT's. That makes the sector attractive for investors seeking high income, diversification and maybe even a hedge against inflation.
 "We have seen the bottom of the REIT market, and it has been firming in the past few weeks," said James W. Williams, a senior real estate analyst and vice president at Prudential Securities in New York.
As of Nov. 30, the average yield on REIT's was 8.1 percent, compared with less than 3 percent for the basket of stocks in the S.& P. 500. The spread between those yields recently hit six percentage points, something that occurred only twice before, in the early 1970's and in 1990, Mr. Williams said.
 Furthermore, the commercial real estate market appears to be on the rebound after bottoming out in 1993, said Lee Schalop, a real estate analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities.
 But skeptics can be found. Frederick S. Carr, president of the Penobscot Group, a REIT research group in Boston, warned that the stocks could plunge to the depressed levels of November if rates rise again. He predicts that when REIT's do recover, a new generation of companies will lead the way.
 As promising stocks, he cited Developers Diversified of Moreland Hills, Ohio, which owns shopping centers mainly in the East and Midwest, and Post Properties of Atlanta, which develops and operates apartment complexes in the Southeast. Both companies have experienced management, proven assets, low debt and adequate capital.
 This year gave rise to 40 initial public offerings of REIT's, bringing the number publicly traded to 227, up from 66 in 1982. But the industry owns less than 2 percent of the nation's commercial real estate. "The market is still young," Mr. Williams said, "and we are early in the cycle of securitizing real estate."

An Attempt To Foul Out Underclass

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
DURING the University of Arkansas's drive to the national championship last spring, Coach Nolan Richardson used the winners' podium as a pulpit. He extolled the virtues of opportunity, and condemned college presidents bent on passing regulations he felt would have a disastrous impact on some women, many minority group athletes and low-income whites.
Eight months later, as college football enters its final weekend and college basketball shifts into high gear, the fierce tug-of-war over access to higher education by athletes has intensified. On Jan. 9, at the National Collegiate Athletic Association convention in San Diego, the membership will vote to adopt, rescind or modify new academic standards for athletes. 
 The new rule, Proposition 16, is scheduled to take effect Aug 1. The rule strengthens Proposition 48, which governs initial eligibility.
Under Proposition 48, incoming freshmen must achieve a minimum combined score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and earn a 2.0 average in a core curriculum of 11 courses.
The new rule increases the core curriculum to 13 courses, and establishes a sliding scale for grade-point averages and S.A.T. scores that requires higher test scores for students with lower grades. An athlete with a 2.5 average could have a combined 700 score; an athlete with a 2.0 would need a combined score of 900.
The controversy surrounding both regulations is the use of a cutoff on standardized test scores to determine whether freshmen can compete and, more important, receive an athletic scholarship.
On Thursday, a report issued by the McIntosh Commission on Fair Play predicted that higher standards would lock out a high percentage of otherwise qualified members of minority groups. The report criticized generations of N.C.A.A.-sponsored propositions (48, 42 and 16) for their "unethical reliance upon arbitrary test scores cutoffs instead of genuine measures of capacity to do college work."
According to the report, "Higher test scores are not the same as higher academic standards."
The McIntosh Commission is a Florida-based foundation that focuses on civil rights and environmental issues. The founder, Michael McIntosh, has a special interest in providing access to higher education for low-income student-athletes.
What makes standardized tests controversial and confusing is that they do not simply reflect what students learn in school, but also what students bring with them from home. All homes are not equal.
Critics complain that requiring a student-athlete to achieve a minimum S.A.T. score of 700 is not much to ask. That may be true, but only in a relative sense. It's like Michael Jordan saying, "It's just a dunk."
Richardson and the Black Coaches Association think that the new measures are aimed at black athletes. Actually, the rule may be a bit more specific in its reach. Proposition 16 is not "aimed" at the black athlete, but will affect a particular kind of black athlete: the playground talent, the inner-city player who attends a subpar, underfunded public school whose environment overwhelms the educational process. Proposition 16 is part of the momentum that will remove the so-called "ghetto element" from intercollegiate athletics.
It has become too messy. Resources in inner-city schools are being cut, the economic gap between haves and have-nots is widening and presidents have a business to run. Francis Canavan, an N.C.A.A. spokesman, said the association is attempting to balance two goals: "One of access and the other to avoid exploitation."
I suspect that if we follow the truth wherever it leads, we'll find that college presidents -- who bask in the glory of athletic success and fire losers -- want to put a fresh veneer on their sports programs:
Increase graduation rates by eliminating high-risk students from the mix. Bolster public image by selectively admitting a more attractive student-athlete. Doesn't have to be "white" necessarily; just from palatable middle-class and upper-middle class homes, private city schools or lush suburban public schools. Wonderful board scores. Passable jump shots.
Momentum for tougher rules, stricter guidelines, narrower passages to opportunity is mounting. Nolan Richardson will preach the gospel of opportunity this winter, but he may find that the congregation isn't listening.

Small Groups From Each Side To Resume Negotiations Today

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Talks to end the hockey lockout are expected to resume today, with small subcommittees from both sides to meet at an undisclosed site. It will be the first negotiation in the dispute since Dec. 17, when the two subcommittees met for the fourth time of that week.
Neither side would officially announce its bargaining lineup yesterday, the 91st day of the shutdown, which was ordered by Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League, in an effort to win concessions from the union in order to hold down salary inflation. 
 Each team has lost 24 games from its 84-game schedule and another 8 have been trimmed, unofficially. Earlier this week, Bettman told the union that the season must begin by Jan. 16 if a 50-game schedule and a full schedule of playoffs are to be completed by July 1. Owners have given Bettman the power to cancel the season if that many games can't be played by that date.
Since 10 days to 2 weeks of training camp will probably be necessary before beginning the season, it is reasonable to assume that the two sides have about a week to make a deal.
The new talks, at least at first, aren't expected to include Bettman or his counterpart, Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association. The larger bargaining committees, including those two and numbering about a dozen per side in some meetings, last negotiated on Dec. 6 in Chicago, where talks broke down after Bettman reintroduced the concept of a payroll tax.
The players have charged that the tax acts as a salary cap to discourage teams from paying high wages. They say they have already made enough concessions in other areas, including a rookie salary cap, arbitration and free agency to give the owners the "drag" they seek on pay.
During the last negotiations, the N.H.L.P.A. was represented by two of its lawyers, John McCambridge and Bob Riley. It is possible that they will again bargain on behalf of the union. Management was last represented by Jeff Pash, the league counsel, and Cliff Fletcher, the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Fletcher is expected to return from Hawaii this weekend, but Brian Burke, a senior vice president and director of hockey operations, is expected to replace him on the management side.

HEADLINE: Volunteers Have Cleaned Vacant Lots for Years

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Dec. 23 news article on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to allow corporations to advertise in vacant lots owned by New York City if they pay to clean the lots and turn them into parks and playgrounds: 
 Thousands of New Yorkers have been voluntarily cleaning city-owned vacant lots for years, at no cost to taxpayers. The costs have been entirely borne by New York-based corporations and a few foundations.
Among those who volunteer to wade through the garbage and rubble-strewn vacant lots are members of block associations, schoolchildren, church groups, Army Reserve units and participants in summer youth employment programs.
Special vacant lot cleaners include people who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes and are sentenced to hours of community service, prisoners of state correctional facilities, patients in drug rehabilitation programs, and police officers and members of police precinct community councils.
The city's new plan ignores the history and initiatives of my organization, its volunteers and its benefactors -- the corporate community -- while encouraging companies to lease vacant lots, develop them and install their name on the fence.
The city receives $292 million from the Federal Community Development Block Grant program. Yet it allocates only $10.4 million to the Department of Sanitation for cleaning vacant lots.
The city should allocate a larger percentage of its block grant to cleaning and fencing vacant lots and encourage corporations to direct charitable and advertising dollars to groups that use neighborhood volunteers.

HEADLINE: Empowerment Zone Will Spur South Bronx

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The designation of part of the South Bronx as one of three Federal Empowerment Zones in New York City (news article, Dec. 27) is more than just a chance for improvements at Yankee Stadium or an attempt to keep the Yankees in New York. The South Bronx empowerment zone will provide employment opportunities for a population desperate for jobs. 
 The Harlem River Transportation and Distribution Center and the Hunts Point Produce Cooperative Market are two local businesses whose expansion and growth will provide at least 2,000 new jobs.
The empowerment zone gives the city a chance to recapture part of the market that has gravitated to New Jersey in search of more competitive services. The Harlem River Transportation and Distribution Center is an enormous economic engine for the Bronx. Its inclusion in the empowerment zone is the jump start needed for the city to recognize that the South Bronx is growing to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
