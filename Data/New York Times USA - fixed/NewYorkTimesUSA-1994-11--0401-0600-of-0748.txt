HEADLINE: Spreading the Word in the South Bronx;
In a World Stripped of Luxuries, Mormon Missionaries Help Faith Take Root

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
Soon after arriving in New York last December, Kevin Mower sidled up to a young woman on the subway and tried to engage her in conversation.
His subject: Jesus Christ.
Her response: first, stony silence, and then this piece of advice: "Don't mix and mingle too much." 
 Mr. Mower never did pay much attention to her caution. Instead, the 20-year-old Mormon missionary and his colleague, Lance Kammer, have trudged countless miles through the South Bronx, spending 12-hour days seeking converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Dressed in neat suits and white shirts, the two elders look more like junior G-men, drawing wary glances as they travel along streets where idle youths laze outside bodegas, single mothers scurry into housing projects and shaky parents line up outside Family Court. Although they believe a child of God is behind every door they approach, getting that door to open is often difficult.
The church's worldwide outreach program with nearly 50,000 missionaries, 400 of them in the New York metropolitan area, is one reason why it has grown steadily, from about 900,000 in 1950 to almost nine million members. Much of that growth has come in Third World nations, especially in Africa and Latin America.
Although the church had been accused of racism in the past, when blacks were excluded from the priesthood, church officials said the growth in such areas is proof that they welcome nonwhites. Blacks were admitted to the priesthood in 1978 after the church's president, Spencer W. Kimball, said he had a revelation.
As a result, the faith has also taken root among disaffected Protestants and Catholics struggling to survive in communities like the Melrose section of the Bronx, where Mr. Kammer and Mr. Mower live and work. Church officials said that the Bronx and Manhattan produce about 50 converts a month.
At first glance, the sight of white, middle-class missionaries ministering to residents of a predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhood may seem incongruous, but scholars of the church say the appeal of the faith -- with its emphasis on self-improvement, community and family values and lay leadership -- has been consistent since it was founded in 1830 in upstate New York.
Richard Bushman, a history professor at Columbia and author of "Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism," said that just as Mormonism flourished among English workers who migrated to America, villagers who moved to cities and laborers who aspired to the middle class, it is now finding an audience among members of minority groups seeking to become part of the larger society.
"The Mormon church is helpful in taking middle-class, modern skills in an atmosphere where there is very little judgment or criticism involved," said Mr. Bushman, who is Mormon. "It has always had a primary appeal to the marginal individual and makes them mainstream."
The young missionaries of Melrose have come to know those margins well. "New York is dying for people who have a good ear and a good heart," Mr. Mower said. "I can say a few words, listen to somebody and do miracles."
Lillian Rivera was not looking for miracles few months ago when she first spotted some missionaries on Fordham Road. She paused to talk, she said, because she thought they were cute. But a first conversation led to more visits from the missionaries and more discussions about their faith.
"They made it fun to learn, and they were my age," said Ms. Rivera, who was raised a Jehovah's Witness. "Most of the things they said made sense. In other religions, they tell you something and you ask why it is and they say that's the way God presented it to me. Here, they explain."
They must have been persuasive: last September, she was baptized. And although her friends accused her of pulling an oddball stunt when she joined the church, she has come to shrug off their teasing.
"I just want to lead a calm life," said Ms. Rivera, a single mother of two. "I'm not looking for a man or anything. I have my children already. I just want peace of mind. Doesn't everybody look for that?"
She said she still did not understand the missionaries, how they could put their lives on hold, leaving behind family and not dating for two years. (The church encourages every 19-year-old man and every 21-year-old woman to do missionary work.) She was committed, she said, but not like that.
But Mr. Kammer never doubted her commitment, noting that she attends church regularly and contributes her tithe, as is customary. Now, he wants her to give a testimony at church, coaxing her to overcome her fear of public speaking.
"She lives the gospel in a quiet way," he said. "On the inside, she has really grown up."
The missionaries live the gospel, too, in this unlikely locale, where they are jolted awake by nighttime gunplay and where they can see young men selling and smoking crack on the stoop outside their apartment on Sheridan Avenue.
Their apartment is spartanly furnished: beds, dressers, a sagging sofa and religious posters. The only new items are piles of Mormon videotapes, books and tracts. On one wall, the Wall of Honor, they have nailed worn-out shoes and the charred remnants of ties they burned to mark the six-month point in their missions.
Mr. Mower, who is from Jerome, Idaho, and Mr. Kammer, who grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., said their time in the Bronx has given them an appreciation for the comforts they left behind and the neighbors they now embrace.
"It's a mystery to me, but the people here are wonderful," Mr. Kammer said. "There are a lot of humble people and a lot of people who have a strong belief in God."
In a world stripped of luxuries and focused on an unyielding drive to spread the word, both now say that what matters most is service.
"The poorest person in the world can find as much happiness as a rich man can," Mr. Mower said. "It's in the way you live your life and the service you give to others, not the things you get for yourself."
Trying to put people at ease, the missionaries often approach people with a smile and a quick pitch for the message of Jesus Christ and family happiness. They try, sometimes succeeding in the span of an elevator ride, to arrange an appointment to visit the person in his or her home rather than preach on the street.
"Preaching on the street, people can't feel the message in their heart," Mr. Kammer said. "Our message is conveyed by the spirit, and the spirit dwells in peaceful and comfortable situations."
He said only about 10 to 20 percent of their contacts continue after the first discussion.
One of those contacts was with Milton Bonilla, 19, who was baptized in Ecuador before his family moved to the Bronx. He and his sister, Ivonne, 17, often invite the missionaries to their family's cramped apartment for a home-cooked meal and religious discussion.
The missionaries have helped the family in turn, assisting Ivonne with her college application to Brigham Young University, the church's school in Provo, Utah. She said a glance out her window was all she needed to see that a brighter future lay elsewhere.
"The university belongs to the church and there are young people like me," she said. "Here, there are none. It's difficult here because no one shares your values."
Her brother credited the church with instilling in him a sense of service and confidence that led him to volunteer at a hospital for a year before being hired.
"I used to be the kind of person who never thought positive," he said. "In the church, I became more positive, and after a while it didn't matter if I got paid or not. I just loved helping out people. This is my payoff from God."

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: THE BUDGET;
Clinton Aide Criticizes G.O.P. Plans for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton's budget director said today that it was nonsense for Republicans to suggest that tax cuts would pay for themselves by stimulating economic activity. The director insisted that such cuts had to be offset by reductions in Federal spending.
The director, Alice M. Rivlin, said she feared that the Republicans taking charge of Congress would lead the nation into "a tax-cutting frenzy" that would increase the Federal budget deficit. She thus attacked an economic theory that has been an article of faith for many Republicans, including those who orchestrated the Republican takeover of the House. 
 Those Republicans contend that tax cuts would rejuvenate the economy and generate large amounts of new revenue.
Ms. Rivlin's comments, at a breakfast meeting with journalists, were the first sign of a political counterattack by the Administration, suggesting that the White House might actively resist a central element of the Republican agenda for the next Congress.
Ms. Rivlin said she worried that the Republicans would "throw fiscal discipline to the winds in the name of tax cutting, that we will have dishonest numbers and questionable budget scoring and that we will end up with a bigger budget deficit."
Reducing the deficit is one of the Administration's proudest achievements. For the year that ended on Sept. 30 the deficit was $203 billion, down $87 billion from the record set in 1992.
Ms. Rivlin expressed concern that the Republicans, having won control of Congress last week with promises to cut taxes for the middle class, would "give away the very hard-won fiscal discipline that we've had."
She expressed grave doubts about the merits of the tax cuts in 1981 that laid the foundation for the Reagan revolution and are regarded as a model by many Republicans who are taking power on Capitol Hill.
"I am not sounding the alarm on tax cuts per se," Ms. Rivlin said. "I am saying that tax cuts must be paid for. Tax cuts without spending cuts would increase the budget deficit and would be an irresponsible thing to do."
Republicans say they want to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget by the year 2002, but they have not specified what programs they would cut to achieve that goal. By their own estimate, the package of Republican promises known as the Contract With America would cost $148 billion over five years.
Ms. Rivlin said it was a delusion to imagine that tax cuts would generate sufficient economic activity to offset the loss of Federal revenue.
"We saw attempts to do this in the 1980's," Ms. Rivlin, a former president of the American Economic Association, said. "The allegation is that tax cuts don't cost revenue, because if you cut taxes, the economy would grow so rapidly that you would get all the revenue back, and therefore tax cuts are, in a sense, free. That nonsense goes by the name of dynamic scoring, and it's a license to bust the budget."
Later today, in a speech to an ecstatic conservative audience, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is in line to be House Speaker, defended his theory of economic and tax policy.
"There's no question that lower taxes and greater economic productivity to increase the size of the general economy do work," said Mr. Gingrich, who proudly described himself as a Reaganite. "In fact, in the Reagan years, we doubled revenue to the Federal Government while cutting taxes. We didn't lose revenue."
But Mr. Gingrich accepted Ms. Rivlin's invitation to cut Government spending along with taxes. "There's a lot of spending cuts we ought to make," he said. "We ought to make them both to be able to have tax cuts and because we want a smaller government."
To celebrate Republican control of Congress, Mr. Gingrich said, there will be "a very low-cost dinner on the night of Jan. 3 open to every middle-class working American" who can go to Washington. In addition, he said, in the first 100 days of the new Congress, Republicans will read their Contract With America at the start of each House session, and each Republican lawmaker may be given a laminated copy of the document.
Mr. Gingrich's audience, made up of people who had donated at least $1,000 to the conservative Heritage Foundation, cheered him lustily. Thomas B. MacCabe Jr., who owns a small business in Montgomeryville, Pa., said Mr. Gingrich's remarks were inspiring.
Beverly Danielson of Coral Gables, Fla., said, "It was fabulous." She particularly liked the defense of traditional middle-class values in contrast to the "liberal counterculture."
At her breakfast Ms. Rivlin focused on the arithmetic of the Republican platform. If taxes are cut without parallel cuts in Federal spending, she said, it will put "enormous upward pressure on interest rates."
"We're at full employment now or very close to it," Ms. Rivlin said, adding that this is a "singularly bad time" to cut taxes. "If you had a big tax cut right now and people were spending more, the inflationary danger would be much more real than it is now. You'd have rapid increases in interest rates and probably throw the economy into recession. In fact, something like that did happen in the 80's."
For years many Republicans have complained that the Congressional Budget Office did not take into account increases in savings, investment and productivity that might result from cuts in personal and corporate income taxes, as well as on capital gains. The Republicans have said they will revamp the estimating procedures to reflect such potential windfalls.
Ms. Rivlin said injecting such wild speculations into estimates was "a recipe for escalating the budget deficit, for busting the budget."
Mr. Gingrich said the House would probably vote on Jan. 19 on the proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. He predicted a smashing victory.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, met today with Republican leaders to discuss possible areas of cooperation. He and Ms. Rivlin said those included trade, welfare, regulation of lobbyists and limits on campaign contributions.

Gingrich Announces Preference
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- Representative Newt Gingrich announced today that he would support a longtime ally, Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, in a three-way contest for the No. 3 leadership position in the House.
Mr. Walker, who is beginning his 19th year in Congress, is running against Tom DeLay of Texas and Bill McCollum of Florida for majority whip. Representative Dick Armey of Texas faces no opposition in his pursuit of the No. 2 job, majority leader.
Mr. Gingrich's press secretary, Tony Blankley, said tonight that Mr. Gingrich, who is expected to become Speaker, would vote for Mr. Walker but not actively campaign for him.

HEADLINE: President-Elect In Brazil Aided By State Races

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In victories likely to strengthen the free-market mandate of President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the governors' seats in Brazil's three most powerful states went to his allies today, according to preliminary returns and voter surveys.
"Fernando Henrique Cardoso will emerge from today's voting as the strongest President of the republican era," Teodomiro Braga, a political columnist, predicted, referring to Brazil's century-old system of elected government. "Until today, no President elected by the people had the support of the majority in Congress and of the governors of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio, states that represent 55 percent of the Brazilian GNP." 
 Bolstering Mr. Cardoso's ambitions to keep Latin America's largest economy on a low inflation-high growth track through the end of the 1990's, voters have elected Cardoso supporters as governors in 8 of Brazil's 10 most populous states. State governors strongly influence state delegations to Congress.
After a decade of elections that produced legislatures hostile to Brazilian presidents, today's results were anxiously awaited by American stock market investors, company executives and exporters.
Betting that Mr. Cardoso would be inaugurated President on Jan. 1 with a strong congressional base, Americans pumped $1 billion into Brazil's stock markets this year, making markets here the fastest growing in the world. Next month, Sao Paulo's stock market is expected to surpass Mexico City's to become the largest in Latin America.
Around the world, Brazil now ranks third, after China and Mexico, for planned investments by American multinational companies, according to a new survey of company executives by Ernst & Young LLP, the American accounting firm. This year, Brazil is expected to receive $2 billion in foreign investments.
With Brazil's imports jumping by 17 percent during the first 10 months of this year, Mr. Cardoso has vowed to accelerate the trade opening by abolishing import licenses and bureaucratic obstacles that swelled Brazil's trade surpluses for 25 years.

HEADLINE: Clinton Devises New Guidelines On Arms Sales

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Making explicit a policy that has existed in practice for three years, the Clinton Administration is preparing new guidelines that will consider the health of the nation's military contractors when reviewing arms sales to foreign countries.
Such sales require approval from the United States Government, which has ruled on arms sales in the past based on whether they bolstered American foreign policy goals and strengthen regional alliances. Under a plan now before the President, a sale's benefit to the nation's shrinking military industry would also be considered. 
 With Pentagon orders rapidly declining, foreign sales now account for about 20 percent of American military contractors' business. Foreign sales are single-handedly keeping alive the M1-A2 tank line of General Dynamics in Ohio and the F-15 fighter plane lines of McDonnell-Douglas in Missouri.
Beginning with the Bush Administration, the Government has played an increasingly active role in lobbying foreign capitals on the behalf of American contractors. Washington pays some costs to field American weaponry at international trade shows. Embassy officials, who once were forbidden to promote United States arms, now hawk American-made military wares as aggressively as any other product stamped "Made in the U.S.A."
The new policy of making domestic economic consideration a formal part of reviews of arms sales is awaiting the President's signature; Mr. Clinton favors the approach. The President can adopt such a policy change by executive order.
The new policy was first reported today in The Los Angeles Times. White House and Pentagon officials emphasized today that foreign policy goals will still be paramount in guiding foreign sales.
"The basic reason for selling weapons overseas has been to advance our foreign policy goals," the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, told reporters today. "It is not to create jobs in the United States."
Arms-control advocates said the new policy would encourage global arms races and make already volatile regions like the Middle East even less stable.
"If we keep pumping out as many arms as we can, how can we go to the Russians and say, 'Don't sell to the Iranians,' " said Thomas A. Cardamone Jr. of the Council for Livable World Education Fund, a group that advocates arms control.
But Administration and industry officials dismissed such arguments. They insisted that there were adequate safeguards to prevent illegal sales or transfers to rogue nations.
"This doesn't mean we'll now start selling fighter jets to Iraq," said Joel L. Johnson, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group in Washington. "At the margin, it might mean making a call in one direction or another, or releasing a system a little earlier for export than before."
Since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, the United States' share of arms sales worldwide has increased to about 55 percent, from 25 percent. But that reflects more the decline in sales by the former Soviet republics than a sharp increase in total American sales, which have risen only slightly.

Long-Bond Yield Dips After Fed's Tightening

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders' fears of inflation.
By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed. 
 The central bank raised short-term rates three-quarters of a percent, a quarter-point more than many had predicted. Expectations were running high as the Federal Open Market Committee met to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.
While investors and dealers were expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points in the discount and Federal funds rates, they were hoping for something a little more aggressive -- and got it. The Fed lifted the discount rate that it charges banks for loans to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for money, usually overnight, to 5.5 percent.
With yesterday's increase, the Fed has now pushed short-term rates up 250 basis points since February in its quest to slow down the economy and head off inflation. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said he did not think the tightening was over yet. "The economic trends that prompted the F.O.M.C. to move today will still be quiet evident in five weeks, and as a result, I would not rule out another rate hike at the next meeting on Dec. 20," he said.
The 75-basis-point increase was the biggest since May 1981, when the Fed raised the discount rate by 100 points, to 14 percent. Inflation then was in double digits; at an annual rate, it is now less than 3 percent.
 Mr. Fine noted that yesterday's increase appeared to many in the financial markets to be a compromise between those on the committee who wanted 50 basis points and those who sought 100. "Unless the economy slows noticeably between now and the next F.O.M.C. meeting, it stands to reason that those who were willing to go 100 today would likely be just as willing to move again in December," he said.
Market analysts noted the list of options open to the Fed included increases of 50 basis points in the funds and discount rates, 75 basis points in both, 100 in both, or a split of 50 in the funds and 100 for the discount.
Alan Krol, a portfolio manager for Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., an investment management firm, said yesterday that even with the Fed's tightening process now nine months old, "We still don't have all the signs of inflation that everyone has alluded to."
Mr. Krol added, "We also think the issue has been and remains: Is the Fed in front of the curve or behind it?" His answer is that 50 basis points were already priced into the market and that the extra 25 points yesterday added to the Fed's credibility.
Before the Fed meeting, which ended around 1 P.M., traders' continuing concerns over inflation were heightened by two economic reports, higher-than-expected October retail sales and industrial production. Still, investors were reluctant to take any position before knowing where interest rates were headed and how fast, so there was little activity in the market.
Industrial production rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, after a revised decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in September, as capacity use rose to 84.9 percent in October from a revised 84.5 percent in September. Many economists had expected that industrial production on average would rise six-tenths of 1 percent, and that capacity would go up to 84.9 percent.
October retail sales rose 1.1 percent, the Commerce Department reported, or six-tenths of a percent without including autos. That was substantially ahead of economists' expectations of six-tenths of 1 percent over all and four-tenths of 1 percent excluding autos.

The Economy

HEADLINE: Guidelines For Classes On Civics Are Issued

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
National educational standards for civics and government were announced today, provoking less criticism than did the recently unveiled standards for American and world history.
Noting that only 37 percent of the electorate voted in last week's midterm election, some of the participants at today's announcement in a chamber at the United States Supreme Court saw a connection between the lack of civics teaching and the decline in what Thomas Jefferson called "enlightened people." 
 "The strength and vitality of American democracy depend on insuring that our young people develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions necessary to become informed and responsible participants in our system of self-government," said Charles N. Quigley, executive director of the Center for Civic Education, a nonprofit group that helped develop the standards.
Often it is assumed that civics is covered by history teachers, but Mr. Quigley described the subject as "one of the most neglected areas of education in the U.S."
He added, "Jefferson assumed we need an enlightened citizenry to run a democracy, but people need to have a road map in mind."
The civics and government standards were developed with financing from the Education Department and the Pew Charitable Trusts and are part of a broad national effort to set voluntary standards for what children should know in academic subjects by the time they leave 4th, 8th and 12th grades.
The standards were developed over more than a decade, with discussions among more than 3,000 scholars, teachers and others.
Under the standards, students are expected to discuss five major areas: what are civic life, politics and government; what are the foundations of the American political system; how does the government established by the Constitution embody the purposes, values and principles of American democracy; what is the relationship of the United States to other nations and to world affairs, and what are the roles of the citizen in American democracy.
The standards say that even kindergarten students should be able to provide a basic description of government.
"If citizens do not understand the political process and how to deal with it effectively, they may feel overwhelmed and alienated," the standards for grades five to eight say. Children in these grades should be able to explain what is meant by the public agenda and describe how it is set, including the role of special interest groups, the press, the courts and individual citizens, the standards say.
In grades 9 through 12, the standards say, students should know the meaning of citizenship, the rights it confers and the responsibilities it carries.
At this stage, the standards say, students should also be able to evaluate, take and defend positions on personal, political and economic rights and obligations, like obeying the law, voting, paying taxes and serving in the armed forces.
The standards announced today had a far more congenial reception than the recently unveiled voluntary standards for world and American history, which were criticized by both conservatives and liberals.
Today's standards, by contrast, were endorsed by groups as disparate as the National Association of Evangelicals and the American Federation of Teachers.
Voluntary national standards have also been established for math and the arts. The math standards were the first to be established, in 1989, and are being used in 40 percent of the nation's schools.


GRAPHIC: The Center for Civic Education has outlined what children from kindergarten through 12th grade shold know about government and politics. Here are excerpts:

Chart: "FOR EXAMPLE: New Lessons in Civics"
 The importance of limited government. To achieve this standard, students should be able to:
 Explain why limited government is important for the protection of individual rights, such as:
 Personal rights to choose their own friends, believe what they wish, enjoy the privacy of their homes and practice the religion of their choice.
 Political rights to express their opinions, vote, meet or associate with others and ask government to change laws they think are unfair.
 Economic rights to choose the kind of work they please and own property.
 
5TH-8TH GRADE
 Defining civic life, politics and government. To achieve this standard, students should be able to:
 Define and distinguish between private and civic life.
 Describe politics as the ways people whose ideas may differ reach agreements that are generally regarded as binding on the group.
 Describe government as the people and institutions with authority to make, carry jout, enforce laws and manage disputes about law.
 
HIGH SCHOOL
 How does the American political system provide for choice and opportunities for participation? Students should be able to:
 Explain the meaning and importance of freedom of the press.
Evaluate the role in American politics of television, radio, the press, newsletters, data bases and emerging means of communication, e.g., the Internet, faxes, electronic mail.
 Compare and contrast various forms of political persuasion and discuss the extent to which traditional forms have been replaced by electronic media.
 Explain how Congress, the President, and state and local public officals use the media to communicate with the citizenry.

HEADLINE: A Debate on the Greater Evil: Inflation or Chill or Pink Slips

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by the largest amount in years intensified a debate that focuses not so much on the amount of the rise but whether the Federal Reserve should have acted at all.
On one side are those who applauded the Federal Reserve's action, most of them on Wall Street. They are challenged by an unlikely coalition of manufacturers and labor leaders who charged that yesterday's increase would slow the economy too much, cutting back sales and eliminating jobs. 
 The word from Wall Street is that the economy is still too strong and that the central bank will have to raise rates again by early next year to control inflation.
"This increase is entirely justified, but it is not the last one in this cycle," said Henry Kaufman, a money manager, bond trader and economist in New York. "At some point in the next three months, they will have to act again. The economy is too strong to be greatly affected or slowed by the present level of rates."
Mr. Kaufman predicted that the key short-term lending rate controlled by the Federal Reserve, which now stands at 5.5 percent, would have to reach 7 percent before the economy begins to respond. Only then will there be a slowdown in auto sales, home construction, consumer borrowing and the numerous other activities that now keep the American economy growing briskly.
But for Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, yesterday's Fed move may prove to be the straw that breaks the back of the economy. And unnecessarily so, he argued.
"The Fed is fundamentally misreading the American economy," Mr. Jasinowski said. "They ought to get out from behind their desks and see what is really happening in plants and on factory floors across the country."
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. agreed. "What they are doing," said John Zalusky, an economist at the labor federation, "is coming down on the side of the bloody bondholders who don't want inflation to undermine the value of their bonds."
Just as industry and organized labor put aside differences to oppose a rate increase, Wall Street also closed ranks behind the Fed's action. Mr. Kaufman's sentiments echoed across the financial markets, silencing an internal squabble between those who had favored a bigger rate increase -- perhaps a full percentage point -- and others who had said that half a percentage point would be enough to slow the economy. Slower growth in turn reduces the risk of sharply rising prices.
David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street bond house, was in the camp that believed a half-point increase was enough to do the job for the moment.
"Alan Greenspan is starting to fall into a pattern," Mr. Jones said, referring to the Federal Reserve chairman. "He is analyzing the data slowly between increases and recognizing the possibility that the economy might be able to grow more strongly than in the past, without more inflation."
There have been six rate increases so far, spread out over the last 10 months.
Mr. Jones touched on a theme that increasingly concerns the Clinton Administration, as well as many economists outside Wall Street. Even some officials at the Federal Reserve are starting to question whether or not the economy has changed so profoundly that it has more capacity for growth without inflation than generally believed.
None of that wondering was evident yesterday. The Federal Reserve, in a statement explaining the latest rate increase -- the biggest since 1981 -- said its action was taken against "persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising resource utilization."
That means the economy is running out of workers, as measured by the nation's low 5.8 percent unemployment rate. Moreover, companies cannot increase their output of goods and services, as measured by the so-called capacity utilization rate, because it has reached a very high 84.9 percent through October.
The Federal Reserve acted on those statistics, preferring -- at least for now -- not to challenge the message embedded in them. The fear is that all sorts of shortages might soon develop, and these shortages will drive up wages and prices, making the inflation rate spurt.
The stakes, of course, are enormous. If the Federal Reserve manages to slow the economy prematurely out of excessive concern about inflation, unemployment will rise and people with jobs will have less leverage to get raises.
Some Federal Reserve policy makers, in off-the-record interviews, are beginning to wonder if the data tell an accurate story. Those doubts, however, have not yet reached the financial markets.
"If the Fed were to bet on the notion that the data was inaccurate, and the bet was wrong, then the inflation genie would get out of the bottle," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "So we can't afford to bet on that notion."
Like the Federal Reserve, the Clinton Administration is reluctant to challenge the official data. But economists at the White House and in the Treasury are exploring the possibilities that the American economy is capable of stronger growth than the 2.5 percent annual increase in economic output that many analysts believe is the maximum sustainable rate.
"We have had a lot of investment in the past several years, and particularly in the past three years," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers. Heavy investment in computers and machinery may have made the economy much more productive. "If that is true," she said, "then maybe we are underestimating the economy's potential."
Indeed, private industry's efforts to increase production through numerous efficiencies may give the economy enough extra output to avoid the shortages that bring higher prices.
"There is no evidence of capacity pressures," said Mr. Jasinowski of the manufacturers association. "The Federal Reserve's measurements are too restrictive."

HEADLINE: City Council Offers Plans On Budget

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Opening negotiations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over his plan to close a $1.1 billion budget gap with deep spending cuts, the City Council revealed a wish list of alternatives yesterday, including the creation of an authority to oversee recycling, an increase in taxi medallions and the consolidation of nearly a dozen of New York City's agencies.
The Council's plan also included charging more for licenses and permits, turning the Staten Island Ferry over to the state and eliminating 2 of the 12 paid holidays city employees now receive. The Council also proposed raising money by leasing the 79th Street Boat Basin, franchising Offtrack Betting parlors and selling air rights above city buildings, including City Hall, to real-estate developers to raise cash. 
 Council officials acknowledged that many of the proposals were unlikely to occur soon, if at all. The number of taxicabs, for example, has been fixed at 11,787 since 1931, and any changes in the industry would require months of probably contentious hearings.
The officials, however, said that the Council's plan would serve as a starting point for talks with the Mayor's office over its proposal to balance the city's $31.6 billion budget and offer long-term solutions to recurring deficits.
"A significant amount of this will require a commitment by the administration to reduce bureaucracy in government," said Thomas L. McMahon, director of the Council's finance division.
The Mayor's senior aide, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, said the administration would consider some of the proposals but needed realistic ways to cut costs immediately.
"In the short time we have this year, I don't know how you save money with consolidations right now," Mr. Powers said, adding that the Mayor's office would considerconsolidating agencies in future. "Right now, whatever we do, we have to come up with hard dollars."
The Council's budget plan came as its committees continued to hold public hearings this week on the Mayor's proposed cuts.
In all, the plan the Council offered yesterday identified $300 million in savings or revenues that could be used to avert some of what officials say are the most drastic elements of the Mayor's plan.
The report, however, did not list the proposed cuts the Council would resist, though officials have said it would try to reverse cuts in financing for soup kitchens, programs for the mentally retarded and civilians in the Police Department.
The Council has two more weeks to approve or reject the Mayor's modification of the budget that took effect more than four months ago, or to negotiate changes in it with the Mayor. The Council plans to take a vote on the Mayor's plan on Nov. 23.
Even though it has the power to reject the plan, the Council appears to have little room to maneuver, since its leaders agree on the size of the budget shortfall and the necessity of closing it without new taxes.
In its plan, however, the Council criticized the Mayor, saying that despite pledges to do so, his budget fails to improve the delivery of services. "In short, the across-the-board cutting method has caused services to be delivered poorly across the board," the Council said in a 35-page report outlining its proposals.
The Council proposed merging several agencies: the Mayor's Office of Operations with the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget; the Sheriff's Office with the Department of Finance; the Economic Development Corporation with the Department of Business Services, and the Landmarks Commission with the Department of City Planning.
The Council proposed creating a recycling authority to finance the city's recycling program by using the nickels from unredeemed bottle deposits. Creating the authority, like many others parts of the Council's plan, would require the approval of the State Legislature.

HEADLINE: Jackson Journal;
The Rich Are Different. They Can Afford Homes.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo.

 BODY:
In all the sweet-breathed valleys of the West, there is no designation more feared than being labeled "the next Aspen," a reference to the Colorado ski town where the rich gather like deer to a salt lick.
In mountain hamlets on the pivot between being a pleasant hideaway and a destination resort, people watch real estate prices like heart monitors. An uptick is welcomed, at first, but is soon followed by alarm, and then a full-fledged civic crisis. 
 So it is in Jackson Hole, where news that the average home is selling for $561,000 has caused a considerable amount of hand-wringing. On Halloween, a woman labeled her costume "affordable housing in Jackson." She was wearing a box.
Staring at the high ceilings inside the 51,000 square feet of the new National Wildlife Art Museum here, Ed Marston said, "If they had just added another few thousand square feet this could be a home in Jackson."
Mr. Marston, editor of "High Country News," a Western weekly, said the clutter of trophy houses in Jackson Hole gave him renewed appreciation for his home in Paonia, Colo. "It's a wonderful town," he said. "But luckily it's still rundown."
Shadowed by the hard shoulders of the Teton Mountains and carved by the Snake River, Jackson Hole can move even the most jaded of urban visitors to light-headed exuberance.
The air, at 6,200 feet on the valley floor, is perfumed with seasonal smells. Two national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, are neighbors. In the town of Jackson, there are wood-planked sidewalks, a new hospital next to the largest winter elk refuge in the world, and more than two dozen art galleries. For vertical enthusiasts, the Swiss Alps can hardly match the skiing here.
But for all of that, what Jackson now lacks are homes for teachers, firefighters, waiters, police officers and assorted others who earn their living serving people who come here to play or live on a grand ranch.
Surrounded by mostly poor counties in the boom-and-bust state of Wyoming, Jackson has taken on the look of a golden ghetto. The sunsets against the Teton Range are still free, unless the view is framed by timbers and close to a bathroom. This year one house sold for $4 million; another, with 13 fireplaces, is the talk of the valley. But the sheriff's department was unable to hire two recruits because they could not afford to live here.
At the Antler Motel, Clarene Law puts her 40 employees up in trailers and small cabins. It is the only way, she said, to hold onto the bed-changers, clerks and laundry cleaners who keep the motel running.
Other workers make 80-mile daily commutes over Teton Pass to places like Driggs, Idaho. In winter, the 8,249-foot pass is treacherous, and the commute has taken its toll. Mrs. Law said she had lost three hotel workers to death from car accidents.
From 1989 to the middle part of this year, the average price of a single-family home in Jackson Hole went up 38 percent a year, according to a study done by Jonathan Schechter, a management consultant. For the first six months of this year, the average selling price was $561,485, a 46 percent jump over last year's price.
While the boom has been good for some -- there are about 250 real estate agents competing for 900 or so sales a year, said Mr. Schechter -- it has raised property assessments -- and taxes -- to the point where many longtime residents have no choice but to sell, and it has caused a bit of a political revolt at the ballot box.
Residents of Teton County, which holds about 15,000 people, just voted to end a 2 percent tax on motel visitors. Because it hits tourists and spares the locals, the tax was thought to be a sure thing. But many people said they were angry that the money from the tax was used to promote Jackson.
A larger question is what happens when a town becomes homogenized by one economic group. In some ways, for the working poor and lower middle class, it may resemble the old company town -- with employees relying on their bosses for wages, food and housing. In other ways, it sets up sharp class conflicts, with new residents pushing for bans on trailer parks because they mar the view.
Jackson has a fledgling housing trust, which buys houses for the purpose of maintaining a base of moderately priced housing. The idea is to do for average folks what the Nature Conservancy does for wildlife -- establish a refuge, of sorts, off limits to further development. But so far there are barely a dozen units of housing in the trust.

HEADLINE: Space Telescope Leaves Scientists Puzzled About the Mass of the Universe

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
The Hubble Space Telescope looked deep into the sky and what it did not see has left cosmologists more mystified than ever about the unseen stuff out there, called dark matter, that may account for at least 90 percent of the universe's mass.
Astronomers using the orbiting telescope reported yesterday that their observations ruled out the possibility that dim small stars, known as red dwarfs, are plentiful enough to constitute much of the invisible mass. For almost three decades, this had been the most favored explanation by astronomers for the mass they could not see but could infer from gravitational forces shaping galactic structures. 
 The new finding seems to shift more of the burden of the search for missing matter from observational astronomers to particle physicists, who seek to explain the universe in terms of concepts drawn from theory and their atom-smashing experiments in powerful accelerators. Their current speculation is that the bulk of the universe may consist of strange hypothetical particles that have never been detected.
This setback in the search for the missing mass is the second time in a month that the repaired Hubble telescope has dealt a troubling blow to cosmologists' theories of the universe. Last month the telescope gave a measure of the expansion rate of the universe that implied its age could be as young as 8 billion years, even though its oldest stars have been measured as 16 billion.
In one of the new surveys with the Hubble telescope, astronomers showed that faint red dwarfs, which were thought to be abundant, are actually quite sparse in the Milky Way, Earth's galaxy. By extension, they must account for a negligible part of the cosmic mass.
Another astronomy team, working independently, determined that nature somehow does not favor stars with masses less than one-fifth that of the Sun. Few of these red dwarfs were observed in dense clusters where stars are born in profusion.
"Our results increase the mystery of the missing mass," said Dr. John N. Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who led one research team. "They rule out a popular but conservative interpretation of dark matter."
Such a theory appealed to scientists because it would mean that nearly all of the cosmic mass could be attributed to something they knew existed, the ordinary matter made of neutrons and protons that is found in dim stars, failed stars, giant planets and everything on Earth.
If the missing mass was not ordinary matter, then scientists were forced to consider exotic alternatives that existed only in theory. One alternative is dark matter composed mainly of hypothetical particles called WIMP's, for weakly interacting massive particles.
Dr. Bahcall said the new findings seemed to call out for some such radical solution to the mystery of dark matter. "This is a day for particle physicists to celebrate," he said at a news conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington.
Determining the nature and amount of dark matter is one of the fundamental issues of cosmology. Astrophysicists have recently proposed many creative recipes for dark matter being combinations of ordinary and exotic matter. Some observations have showed the presence of considerable amounts of invisible matter in ordinary form at the edge of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Experiments are under way to see if WIMP's or other exotic matter can be detected.
The validity of most cosmic theories depends on solving the mystery. The inflation theory, a modification of the big-bang theory, holds that there was a rapid expansion immediately after the initial gigantic explosion creating the universe, after which things settled down to a more sedate pace.
The inflation theory predicts that the universe should be precisely balanced between eternal expansion and eventual collapse. If dark matter exceeds a critical density, the added gravitational power would cause the universe to collapse in what is being called the "big crunch." If dark matter is more tenuous, the universe could keep expanding into nothingness.
Theorists suggested that the lowest mass stars should be the most prevalent in the universe, and so might provide a solution for dark matter. According to stellar evolution theory, stars as small as 8 percent of the mass of the Sun are capable of shining by nuclear fusion processes, though they would be too dim to be visible from Earth.
By being able to detect faint stars 100 times dimmer than those seen from the ground, the Hubble telescope's main camera was used to conduct a comprehensive census of red dwarfs in the outer region of the Milky Way, known as its halo. Dr. Bahcall's team concluded that these dim stars constituted no more than 6 percent of the mass of the galaxy's halo and no more than 15 percent of the mass of the galactic disk. Since the Milky Way should be much like most other galaxies, the scientists said, this census should be representative of the universe at large.
The other team, led by Dr. Francesco Paresce of the European Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, confirmed those results with its own observations of the globular cluster NGC 6397, a dense collection of several hundred thousand stars in the Milky Way.
Dr. Bahcall's results were described in detail in the Nov. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Dr. Paresce's report is to appear in a later issue of the journal.

HEADLINE: Bills to Lift 3-Casino Limit Clear Panels in Legislature

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Mayor James Whelan's protestations that enough is enough fell on deaf ears today as two legislative committees released identical bills that would enable Donald Trump to seek his fourth casino license here.
Mr. Whelan said that while Mr. Trump is the city's biggest employer and taxpayer and does an outstanding job of promoting the city and his properties, he also "has a record of attempting to limit competition from other casinos in Atlantic City." 
 "A fourth casino would not only add to Mr. Trump's dominance of the casino market," the Mayor said, "it would also strengthen his control of the rest of our town's economy."
Other objections were raised by David J. Satz, a lawyer representing six casino operators who oppose removing the present three-casino limit for any one owner. He questioned the wisdom of allowing greater concentration of the city's casino industry in the hands of an organization "that has witnessed all three of its properties go through bankruptcy in the past four years."
Senator Bill Gormley, the Margate Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the amendment to lift the three-casino limit "does not provide anyone a license, it provides an opportunity to apply for a license."
He said it would still be up to the Casino Control Commission to decide whether a fourth casino would give a licensee "undue economic influence."
Bradford Smith, the chairman of the commission, declined to take a position on the amendment but noted that new regulations will have to be written if the bill is enacted.
Nick Ribis, the chief executive officer of the Trump Organization's three casinos, did not testify, but outside the hearing room in the Atlantic City Convention Center, he called Mayor Whelan's remarks "the height of hypocrisy."
"His statement is a good reason why there is very little development in Atlantic City," Mr. Ribis said. "Instead of attacking the organization that pays the most taxes in the city, he should be getting rid of crime on the boardwalk and prostitutes on the streets."
The hearing today by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Assembly Policy and Rules Committee was originally expected to be a pro forma release of a 66-page overhaul of the state's 17-year-old casino law that would allow gaming casinos greater autonomy over strictly business matters while retaining safeguards intended to insure the integrity of the industry.
On Oct. 21, Assemblyman John F. Gaffney, Republican of Linwood, proposed the amendment to eliminate the three-casino limit, and it immediately became the focus of the hearing. It was added to the overall realignment of casino regulations today just before the two committees released identical bills for votes in the full Senate and Assembly.
Mayor Whelan and others said the amendment was inspired by Mr. Trump, its lone beneficiary. Only one other concern, Bally's, with two gaming halls, operates more than one casino in the city.
Mr. Whelan said Mr. Trump was to have purchased the Trump Regency, a hotel without a gaming license, from Chemical Bank over the summer but was unable to settle due to a lack of financing.
"By changing the rules now, we are providing a financial bailout for Donald Trump," the Mayor said.
Thomas P. Ballezzi, executive director of the Casino Association, which represents the city's 11 casinos, spoke in support of the original bill, which would eliminate redundant activities by the Casino Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement in the Attorney General's office, stretch out the period for relicensing casinos from two to four years and drop the requirement for background checks on people employed strictly in the hotel portion of a casino property.
But Mr. Ballezzi said he could take no position on the lifting of the three-casino limit since the member casinos are divided over the issue.
Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian, the chief sponsor of the original bill in the Assembly, said it would remove "stifling" regulations and enable Atlantic City casinos to meet the growing competition from outside the state. When the industry began in 1978, its only competition was from Las Vegas. Now, 22 states have casinos or riverboats offering gaming. He took no position on the amendment removing the limit on casino ownership.
No date has been set for a vote by either legislative house, Mr. Gormley said.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has taken no position on the legislation.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
News Staff Faces Layoffs At Journal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The Wall Street Journal told more than a dozen members of its news staff yesterday that they would be laid off as part of a cost-cutting move, the newspaper's managing editor said in an interview.
The layoffs were the first at The Journal since 1989, when the paper was being squeezed by the recession and the downturn in financial advertising that followed the 1987 stock market crash. 
 "This is a necessity that no one likes, but we move on from it," said Paul E. Steiger, the managing editor, who runs The Journal's news operations. He said 13 members of The Journal's news staff were being notified yesterday by supervisors that they would be laid off.
With recent declines in both circulation and advertising, the newspaper also said on Friday that it would close one of its 18 printing plants in December to make its printing operations more efficient.
The closing of that plant, in Oklahoma City, will mean a loss of 20 jobs for production employees, said Roger B. May, a spokesman for the paper.
Some people in the newsroom and some newspaper securities analysts said they were surprised that a drive to cut newsroom costs was so urgent that it would include layoffs, since a number of people already leave the paper every year. The Journal has a total newsroom staff of more than 470.
A memo sent out by Mr. Steiger to newsroom staff members said he regretted the need for the layoffs and noted that the 13 people being laid off included managers, editors and reporters.
Mr. Steiger's memo added, "Assuming no dramatic declines in economic conditions, I don't expect further such actions this year or next."
The Journal's circulation and advertising have fallen over the last year. Daily circulation totaled more than 1.7 million in the six-month period ended Sept. 30, down 2 percent, or 38,140 copies daily, from a year earlier.
The newspaper's advertising linage declined an average of 3.2 percent, for the first three quarters of the year from a year earlier.
People at the paper said the advertising decline affected The Journal especially sharply because costs have been rising rapidly in the newspaper industry as a whole, particularly for newsprint.
Inside Dow Jones & Company, the paper's corporate parent, some people at the company said, the newspaper is under financial pressure because, although profitable, its revenues are growing more slowly than its costs.
Dow Jones does not provide separate information on the financial performance of its publications. But revenues in its business publication group, the majority of which come from The Journal, climbed 3.7 percent for the first three quarters of the year, compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, Mr. May said. Operating income climbed 5.3 percent.
But for Dow Jones as a whole, revenues were up 7.4 percent, while operating profit grew 18.5 percent, Mr. May said.
"It's a case of aligning costs and revenues," Mr. Steiger said. "We've had to do a number of things to trim costs in all departments, including the news department."
Mr. Steiger said he felt confident The Journal's news division budget would return to modest growth soon.
But some employees were not so optimistic in light of the layoffs. "It's like a death in the family," one reporter said. "You feel bad for the people and you feel, maybe, it could be you the next time around."

HEADLINE: U.S. Industry Had a Surge In October

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
American factories, mines and utilities stepped up their operating rate to nearly 85 percent of industrial capacity in October -- a level that had not been reached since 1980 during the Carter Administration.
A strong increase in output, pushing against industry's ability to turn out additional products without raising prices, contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision today to raise short-term interest rates yet again in an attempt to restrain the robust economy. 
 Consumers, meanwhile, shoved $191.16 billion across retail counters last month, up a surprisingly strong 1.1 percent and providing another piece of evidence to those who contend that the economy needs additional braking to hold down inflation. Automotive and other goods that last a long time were in particularly strong demand.
"This is a very, very robust economy," said James E. Annable, chief economist for the First Chicago Corporation. "It's growing too fast."
All year long, the Federal Reserve has kept a close eye on the operating rate of industry. The gauge has proved a fairly reliable guide to economic overheating. At current levels, bottlenecks may begin to develop, increased costs can often be passed along to consumers, and companies may find they need to bid up wages to attract or hold workers.
The Fed, which compiles the figures on capacity use and output, said its moves today to raise short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point "were taken against the background of evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilization."
Other signs also pointed to a robust economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in a report today on manufacturing conditions in the Southeast, said that an index for prices paid by companies jumped to 48.4 last month from 41.2 in September while an index of prices obtained soared to 22.1 from 9.1.
Nationwide, the industrial utilization rate climbed four-tenths of a point, to 84.9 percent. That increase slightly surpassed the August pace to become the biggest jump since March 1980, when the economy had just passed a peak in the business cycle and was slipping into a brief recession.
The increase came after a decline in September, when the rate eased three-tenths of a point.
For factories alone, the step-up in operating rate was even more pronounced, rising to 84.6 from 84.1 and tending to confirm other recent data showing exceptionally high factory overtime as well as a growing number of manufacturing jobs. The October operating rate, the Fed's report pointed out, was 3.4 points above its 1967-93 average.
At the same time, pressure eased on mines and utilities, where output has been falling for months, partly because of unusually mild weather.
Output by the industrial sector, some 30 percent of the economy, surged seven-tenths of 1 percent last month after edging down one-tenth of 1 percent in September when an automobile strike curbed production. Assembly of motor vehicles held at a rate of 11.9 million last month but production of parts rose sharply.
Consumer goods other than motor vehicles and utilities rose four-tenths of 1 percent, continuing what the Fed called a sluggish pattern of recent months as output of appliances and other goods for the home slackened, probably reflecting higher interest rates. But output of business equipment, basic metals, construction supplies and other materials remained brisk.
The 1.1 percent gain in retail sales, reported by the Commerce Department, was not only larger than had been expected but also came on top of upward revisions for August and September. With last month's sales 7.5 percent above those of October 1993, John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services said that "retail sales have more momentum now than at this time last year, despite the rise in rates by the Fed."
Sales of durable goods, those meant to last three years or more, soared 2.3 percent over all, the department reported. Automobile dealers took in 2.9 percent more money; merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes took in 1.7 percent more and those selling furniture and other goods had a 1.5 percent gain.
"We're still seeing a pretty strong consumer sector," said Jeff Craitenberger, an analyst at CS First Boston.
In nondurables, a larger sector, sales were up 1.4 percent at clothing stores, 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores and three-tenths of 1 percent each at food stores and those selling general merchandise. On the other hand, sales at gasoline service stations fell nine-tenths of 1 percent while restaurants and bars had a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent.
From August through October, retail sales were 7.9 percent above the comparable 1993 period with no adjustment for inflation. Consumer prices rose 3 percent for the 12 months through September.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Fed Rate Increases Set Off A Strong Rally by the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against other leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year.
The rate increases were greater than what many currency dealers had expected and helped to assure them that the Fed was aggressively reining in inflation. Inflation erodes the value of American bonds and stocks held by foreign investors, thus discouraging the demand for dollars to buy such assets. 
 "The market is expressing the sentiment that the Fed will be ahead of the curve on inflation," Paul Farrell, trading manager at Chase Manhattan Bank, said.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose as high as 1.5575 German marks before settling at 1.5561 marks, up from 1.5438 marks on Monday. The dollar rose to 98.69 yen, from 98.29 yen on Monday.
The dollar has been under pressure in recent months -- particularly against the yen and the mark -- because of fear that the Federal Reserve had not raised rates soon enough to stamp out inflationary pressures. But currency traders said yesterday's Fed action went a long way toward reassuring investors.
The increases of three-quarters of a percentage point lifted the discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans -- to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge one another for overnight lending, to 5.50 percent. The new rates put overnight American interest rates clearly above comparable German rates, which are now around 4.88 percent, for the first time in around four years. Overnight United States rates are also well above Japanese rates of about 2.22 percent.
Mr. Farrell of Chase Manhattan said that should help increase interest in dollar-based fixed-income securities. "The rate hikes create a constructive investment environment for the near term and will attract foreign investors," he said.
The Fed's move widens the gap between interest rates on the dolllar and the yen, said Scott Pardee, chairman at Yamaichi International (America) Inc. "It puts a lot of pressure on those holding the yen against the dollar," he said.
Robert Hormats, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs International, said that other problems still plagued the dollar, including the large United States current account deficit.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3095 Swiss francs from 1.2945 francs on Monday. The British pound fell to $1.5725 from $1.5873.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber and Copper Prices Soar While Coffee Plunges

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber rose to its highest price in two months yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand from home builders stays strong even as interest rates go up.
On other commodities markets, copper rose while coffee plunged. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose 0.48 point, to 233.74. 
 Wholesalers and builders, who reduced lumber inventories in preparation for the seasonal winter slowdown, have been forced to pay higher prices as the pace of new housing starts holds steady in November. Even the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term interest rates yesterday is not expected to slow demand, analysts said.
"I don't believe that housing will slow down before the beginning of 1995," said Bob Book, senior lumber analyst with Quantum Financial Services in Chicago. "There's a mad rush by people to lock in their mortgages before rates go higher."
Lumber for January delivery rose its $10 daily limit to $347 for 1,000 board feet.
Demand has been so strong that builders are willing to pay higher prices for available supply. Lumber inventories at Western lumber mills have dropped 5 percent since Oct. 1, according to the Western Wood Products Association.
"The lumberyards are working on a just-in-time basis," said Bud Merrill, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., in Eugene, Ore. "The mills can ask a higher price when the buyers have got to have it."
Copper prices surged to a four-year high as demand from auto makers and other manufacturers continued to keep inventories low.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for December delivery rose 1.55 cents, to $1.2905 a pound, the highest since Sept. 7, 1990. Copper prices have risen 13 percent in less than a month.
Coffee prices plunged as traders speculated that the damage caused by frost and drought in Brazil might not be as extensive as crop reports indicated.
Last week, the Brazilian Government estimated next year's crop could be as low as 12.7 million bags, 28 percent below the United States Department of Agriculture's lowest estimate of 17.6 million bags.
"Everybody is trying to discredit the Brazilian crop estimate," said Oscar Schaps, a broker with the Hencorp Coffee Group in Miami.
December coffee fell 5.9 cents, to $1.7125 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, its lowest price since June 28.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
After two recent acquisitions, more software mergers are likely.

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher 

 BODY:
TWO deals do not a trend make, especially two with as little in common as Microsoft's $1.5 billion acquisition of Intuit last month and Sybase's $940 million acquisition of Powersoft this week. Still, investment bankers and analysts say they expect more software mergers, if not necessarily of this size.
Both deals filled specific gaps for the acquiring company. The Microsoft Corporation had a personal finance program, Money, but its market share was a fraction of Intuit Inc.'s Quicken. Sybase Inc. had applications development tools, but they were thought to lag behind those of its rivals in the data base management market, the Oracle Corporation and the Informix Corporation; in the Powersoft Corporation, it acquired the market's leading tool, Powerbuilder. 
 Though Quicken, which is used to balance checkbooks and perform other personal financial tasks, and Powerbuilder, which is used for creating complex custom software applications, appear unrelated, both products are about hiding technology. Quicken makes electronic banking as simple as filling in a check; Powerbuilder replaces the writing of endless lines of programming code with a visual tool based on pointing and clicking with a mouse and pull-down menus.
"Technology is being made available to a broader and broader set of consumers," including the less sophisticated, said James A. Davidson, co-head of mergers and acquisitions for Hambrecht & Quist.
The deals also reflect a market that is maturing and undergoing a natural process of consolidation, Mr. Davidson said. "Things are getting more and more volume driven," he said. "If you want to maintain revenue growth, you need to have a differentiated product, and you need to be perceived as a market leader."
The acquisition of Powersoft makes Sybase the market leader in software tools for developing client/server applications, which divide network computing tasks between large "server" computers and smaller "client" machines, typically desktop computers. They are commonly written to run on top of a relational data base management program, like Oracle or Sybase. The other major provider of client/server development tools, the Gupta Corporation of Menlo Park, Calif., discussed merger with Oracle earlier this year but was unable to come to terms.
Many others produce development tools, including Microsoft, which is hardly on anyone's list of acquisition candidates, and Borland International Inc., which probably would be but for a potentially costly copyright infringement suit brought by the Lotus Development Corporation. Many providers of older application development tools also have client/server products and could be merger or acquisition candidates.
"There are 30 strong applications development companies today, and three years from now, only 10 of them will be left," said Curt A. Monash, publisher of the Monash Software Letter. "There's a massive ongoing shakeout in application development tools, and some very good companies are going to go away," he said. "The software industry is finally large enough that there are economies of scale in development."
Several analysts reiterated buy recommendations on Sybase yesterday, saying the acquisition would strengthen it, though the deal is dilutive in the near term. Most also retained positive ratings on Oracle and Informix, citing the underlying strength of the data base management market. Several said that Gupta could be in play, but that it might also be stronger as the last independent tool provider for the client/server market.

HEADLINE: Pastrami on Rye, Hold the West Coast

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Nov. 13

 BODY:
Seeking the solace of salami and the balm of brisket amid the aftershocks of the 1993 earthquake, a long line of people gathered outside Nate 'n Al's, the venerable show-biz delicatessen here. When some customers grew antsy at the wait, a counterman reminded them that they had a choice: they could always go down the block to the Carnegie Deli.
The Carnegie Deli. In New York, the sound of those words would have been like chicken soup to shattered nerves. But something was evidently lost in transit between Seventh Avenue and 54th Street, site of the flagship Carnegie, and the corner of North Beverly Drive and Dayton Way, its West Coast outpost. At Nate 'n Al's that morning, no one even budged. 
 Today, the Venetian blinds at the Carnegie Deli here are pulled shut, and the glass door is covered with the greasy white paper normally used to wrap sandwiches too thick to finish. After several lean years, it became increasingly clear that this Carnegie couldn't cut the mustard. Two and a half months ago, it quietly closed.
The California Carnegie was the dream of a single man with a mammoth appetite, a more mammoth ego and a billfold more mammoth still: Marvin Davis, the oil billionaire who once craved delicatessen the way Wimpy craves hamburgers. Unimpressed with what he considered California's ersatz corned beef and pastrami and tired of shipping the real thing from New York in his private jet, Mr. Davis vowed five years ago to give Los Angeles "the best deli in the world." He then put $4 million of his money where his mouth was.
At the restaurant's celebrity-studded opening in July 1989, Carol Channing plopped a giant Styrofoam matzoh ball into a gargantuan bowl of chicken soup and, in lieu of the usual ribbon-cutting, Mr. Davis and his wife, Barbara, sliced a six-foot salami. Then, egg creams held aloft, they toasted a "new era of delicatessens" in California. When the Carnegie opened to mere mortals shortly thereafter, 2,000 people quickly ate it out of house and home.
But a chaotic beginning, staff shake-ups and a schism with the New York Carnegie changed all that. The crowds stopped coming, and the Styrofoam matzoh ball proved strangely prophetic: the Los Angeles Zagat Restaurant Survey was soon faulting Mr. Davis's establishment for "flat food" and "the worst chicken soup" in Los Angeles. "Marvin Davis should stick to the oil business," one surveyor sneered.
Milton Parker, the owner of the New York Carnegie and Mr. Davis's business partner until the two men fell out, said that even when the California Carnegie was open, Mr. Davis still had his personal pastrami shipped out from Seventh Avenue (not so, Mr. Davis said.) He expressed relief that never again would customers call him to kvetch about the Left Coast Carnegie.
In an interview, the 69-year-old Mr. Davis attributed the failure to everything from the death, in 1987, of Leo Steiner -- the genius behind the New York Carnegie and the man who convinced him to back the West Coast venture -- to earthquakes, riots, the economy and the decline of carnivorousness, particularly in California. Even a lifelong deli addict like Mr. Davis has recently, so to speak, gone cold turkey. "People didn't like fatty foods out here," he said. "If I had any pastrami or corned beef in the house, my doctor and my wife would kill me."
Yet, at Nate 'n Al's -- where Lew Wasserman, the mogul of Universal Studios, takes his grandchildren every Sunday morning, where comedians and agents, actors and groupies have congregated for half a century -- business is just fine. Indeed, others insist it was not acts of God and the invisible hand that did the Carnegie in, but acts of cooks and waitresses, designers and owners.
With its wraparound picture windows, expensive fixtures and valet parking, the place was too "fancy-schmantzy" to be a real Carnegie Deli, customers said. They griped that the countermen were inexperienced, reacting blankly to requests for hand-sliced pastrami or smoked salmon, and that the waiters and waitresses were too young and yuppified. Most importantly, the food was lousy, they complained.
"The first time it was unexceptionable, but I thought, 'Give them a chance; it's new,' " said David Sternlight of Pasadena, who was first in line on opening day. "The second time it was so bad I talked to the manager, who said he knew and would fix it. The third time, it was three strikes and you're out. The Carnegie in New York is one of my favorite delis, but here the food was just abominable."
Then there was Mr. Davis. Critics say he neither knew about restaurants nor would listen to those who did. Perhaps his worst mistake was moving in only a few doors down from Nate 'n Al's. "To put yourself up against the most beloved deli in Beverly Hills was stupid," said Merrill Shindler, a food writer and editor of the Zagat Survey in Los Angeles.
Mr. Davis, who Forbes magazine says is worth nearly $2 billion, hardly lost his shirt on the enterprise, more like a thread or a button. Mr. Davis said he did not know how much went down the drain, but suggested that it was, in the words of another New Yorker, Ralph Kramden, "a mere bag of shells."
The Beverly Hills Carnegie, said its first manager, Bobby Trager, started on the wrong foot: "We were over-hyped; we weren't ready to open up; we were owned by a multi-multibillionaire people didn't want to make even richer, and we came to L.A. as usurpers. We were resented from Day One, and we got buried. You can't take the Carnegie Deli and transplant it. It just won't work."
In fact, as Mr. Davis points out, his is not the only Carnegie to fail. In the last few years Mr. Parker has closed Carnegie satellites in Chicago; Secaucus, N.J.; Atlantic City; Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., leaving only the branch in Tyson's Corner, Va., still standing.
AT least until recently, the heavy-set Mr. Davis had been a world-class deli aficionado, a trait born during much-cherished childhood trips with his father to garment center delicatessens in Manhattan. An oft-told tale -- almost as well worn as the myth that he opened the Carnegie after being made to wait too long at Nate 'n Al's -- has him calling his wife from La Guardia Airport to say he was bringing back $1,000 worth of pastrami from the Carnegie, then calling again from Denver to report that only $600 worth remained.
It was not as if Los Angeles had no delis. In addition to Nate 'n Al's, there is Langer's (famous for its pastrami, but in a dicey neighborhood); Art's in Studio City (where, as they say, "every sandwich is a work of Art"); the Stage in Century City (from which Mr. Davis once ordered half a pound of nova, a pint of cream cheese and six bagels daily for his "early-morning nosh"); Jerry's Famous Deli (said to have the best chicken soup, but also serving "Chinese" and "Mexican" food), and Canter's on Fairfax, a slightly down-at-the-heels place with a good bakery.
But none satisfied Mr. Davis, who opened his checkbook and let some of his pals -- among them, Don Rickles, Sidney Sheldon, Jackie Collins, John Madden and Freddie Field, who wrote out a fake check on a piece of matzoh -- buy small chunks of the place themselves. Several partners had sandwiches named after them; the Don Rickles and the John Madden each had plenty of tongue, and Mr. Madden's also included baloney.
Other Davis pals, like Tommy LaSorda and Liz Smith were immortalized free. So was Mia Farrow, who lent her name to the bizarre combination of pastrami on white with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. And so were Mr. Davis's golfing partner, his lawyer and his doctor, whose sandwich was built around a comparatively healthful chicken breast sandwich. Dubbing delicatessen was a task Mr. Davis seemed to relish: once, he put a seller of a large block of Northwest Airlines on hold to review sandwich nomenclature with Mr. Trager. One combination -- corned beef and pastrami on bagel -- was the "Marvin Davis."
Not everyone was happy with the designations. Mr. Trager said that Norman Brokaw of the William Morris Agency was so indignant over being linked to liverwurst that he lobbied for a change to turkey. David Geffen had his own selection -- with avocado and sprouts, it was the closest thing to the "mashed yeast" plate Woody Allen ordered in "Annie Hall" -- but says he never ate one, nor even set foot in the place.
During frequent inspection tours of the Carnegie, Mr. Davis was very much in his element. "Here I am, a rich man; I've got business all over the world, and I'm standing here counting heads in a delicatessen," he laughingly told Jay Weston, a producer who writes a restaurant newsletter, shortly after the Carnegie opened. "I should have my head examined."
He brought in Mr. Trager, who ran the New York Carnegie for seven years and spent much of his childhood at Murray's Sturgeon Shop on the Upper West Side. But some things could not be so easily imported. Local health codes and the spacious, ritzy site kept Pat Kuleto, the noted San Francisco restaurant designer, from recreating the endearingly chaotic quality of the original Carnegie, as did the tendency of Californians to sit around forever.
"Everyone is looking for a power table in L.A.," Mr. Trager said. "You 'lunch' in L. A. In New York, you eat."
UNWILLING to pay high rent on an idle operation, Mr. Kuleto recalled, Mr. Davis opened too quickly, without a trained staff or liquor license. "Crank it up; I've put too much money in this thing!" he said Mr. Davis exclaimed. Then, convinced the New York Carnegie was gouging him, he decided to buy the raw materials directly from its suppliers. As he did, complaints increased.
"I told Davis it was not up to the standard of the other place," recalled Milton Berle, who said he was another investor. "Strangely enough, I went into Nate 'n Al's more than I went into the Carnegie, which I owned." (Mr. Davis denied that Mr. Berle had put money in the place. Or, as he put it, "Milton never invested 10 cents to see the Statue of Liberty dance.")
Another problem was the help. For decades, the saucy, sassy shtick of waitresses like Kaye Coleman has been as much a fixture at Nate 'n Al's as blintzes or latkes. At the West Coast Carnegie, their spots were taken by aspiring actors and actresses.
"Every day," Mr. Trager lamented, "I had to show them which was the pastrami and which was the corned beef."

Pittsburgh Approves Buyer

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 15

 BODY:
A cable television executive and his family have won the city's approval to buy the Pittsburgh Pirates, the city said today. John Rigas and five members of his family are forming a new entity to buy the Pirates. Rigas, from Coudersport, Pa., is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Adelphia Communications Corporation.
Talks with another potential buyer, the former Baltimore Oriole president Larry Lucchino, were suspended so he could concentrate on trying to buy the San Diego Padres. 
 A final sale price has not been agreed on, but the team's current owners were reportedly seeking about $85 million for the financially ailing franchise.
Mayor Tom Murphy said at a news conference late this morning that the city reached agreement with Rigas on Monday night on a new lease for Three Rivers Stadium, the terms of a loan from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and options that would keep the team in the city.

HEADLINE: Smoke, Not Substance, at APEC

 BODY:
The leaders of 18 nations who gathered this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Indonesia arrived with lofty talk of achieving a sweeping agreement to stimulate economic growth on the Pacific Rim, already among the most vibrant economic regions in the world. Their final communique enshrines a noble objective: free trade and investment by the year 2020.
Unfortunately, the APEC pledge fails to include a single substantive measure. The easy task is to commit to a vague goal a quarter-century away. The hard task -- apparently too hard -- is to take concrete measures that would challenge entrenched interests in each country. 
 The APEC countries call for free trade, but do not say if that includes services as well as manufactured goods. The participants call on APEC's industrialized members to achieve free trade 10 years earlier than the 2020 target for everyone, but does not say which countries would be included in the fast lane. Does that leave South Korea or China, for example, in or out?
Underlying the failure to produce a detailed agreement are fundamental differences among the group's members. The United States and Australia are both enthusiastic proponents of free trade, in part because both feared that the East Asian members might move without them. But Malaysia and others oppose free trade to varying degrees. Their problem arises in part from the fact that international trade rules, with one exception, prevent countries from extending preferential trade to each other unless they also extend it to every other trading partner. The exception applies only to countries that move all the way toward forming a free trade bloc -- like the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
The Asia-Pacific countries know that Congress is not about to approve another Nafta, especially if it includes low-wage bastions like Malaysia and Indonesia, without insisting upon rules about environmental protection and working conditions. That prospect scares many APEC countries out of tying themselves closely to the U.S. in a free-trade zone. The conference postponed dealing with fundamental difficulties like these for at least a year.
Even though it could not create a free-trade zone overnight, the APEC gathering could have made progress in specific areas. For example, the countries considered, but failed to adopt, a code to open up borders to foreign investors.
The trick for APEC is to turn the virtuous pledge into real progress. That will require aggressive action on small measures that would knock down tariff and non-tariff barriers. Free trade among Pacific Rim countries could then become something more than rhetoric.

HEADLINE: In Schools, Money Matters if It's Spent Wisely;
Nurture, Not Nature

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I write to offer a more hopeful perspective on the debate generated by the Charles Murray-Richard J. Herrnstein thesis on race and I.Q. (Education page, Nov. 9). 
 In 1964 and 1965, after eight-week summer transition programs at Dartmouth and Mount Holyoke colleges, 200 students, 14 and 15 years old, from low-income families (mostly black) entered some of our country's most competitive private secondary schools. They were chosen for motivation and demonstrated achievement, not I.Q. The purpose was to help them prepare to compete at our most selective colleges and universities. More than 8,000 youngsters have since participated in the program, called A Better Chance.
I have been revisiting those 1964 and 1965 integration pioneers, men and women now in their mid-40's. They include a research physicist, neurosurgeon, financial analyst, publisher and district court judge.
Thoughtful and articulate, they speak impressively about the value of caring teachers, traditional courses and high expectations; they speak about the nurturing of family and community; they speak knowledgeably about pressing social, moral and economic issues. In myriad ways, all strive to give back.
For the well-being of our society, it is as critical in 1994 as it was in 1964 that the Murray-Herrnstein thesis not prevail. The central issue is not I.Q., but rather how we can make good on a social contract that dignifies and respects the rights of every citizen, whatever the background, station or distinguishing characteristic.

HEADLINE: Leaders Agree On Free Trade For the Pacific

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOR, Indonesia, Wednesday, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The glow of Tuesday's victory of creating the largest free-trade zone in the Asia-Pacific region dissipated today as President Clinton and President Suharto of Indonesia clashed over the issue of Indonesia's much-criticized human rights record.
Mr. Clinton stated frankly that relations between the United States and Indonesia would not reach their full potential unless there was an improvement in human rights, a senior Administration official said. 
 The President "raised the issue in strong and forceful terms," Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters in an appearance before Indonesia's official human rights organization.
But Mr. Suharto, who has maintained authoritarian rule over the country for nearly four decades, was unreceptive.
Mr. Clinton welcomed the fact that Indonesia has begun a serious dialogue with the leaders of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia, and had begun to draw down its troops. But he suggested today -- as he said during his news conference on Tuesday -- that the people of East Timor should have more say over their own affairs.
Mr. Suharto replied that his Government is dealing fairly with a knotty problem of East Timor.
Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher refused to meet with Timorese students conducting a sit-in at the United States Embassy since Saturday to draw attention to their struggle for independence. Lower-level officials continued to maintain contact with the group and provide protesters with rice, water and medical treatment, according to a statement from the embassy.
Mr. Clinton said he welcomed the assurance of the Government that there would be no recriminations if the students left peacefully.
Leaders of 18 Pacific Rim nations emerged on Tuesday from a grand colonial-era palace to extol the benefits of open markets and investment in the dynamic Pacific region and to move toward creating the largest free trade zone in the world by the year 2020.
The leaders, whose nations represent more than half the world's economic output, ended a day of free-wheeling talks with a "declaration of common resolve" that went far beyond the vague vision of their meeting in an Indian long house on a windswept island near Seattle just a year ago.
Both President Suharto, the host, and President Clinton said on Tuesday that the gathering furthered the goals of the group, which includes countries from four continents with per capita incomes ranging from less than $1,000 to $30,000.
But the victory was undercut by three days of demonstrations in Dili, the capital of East Timor.
Despite the promise of Indonesian authorities today not to seek retribution, the squatters requested asylum in Portugal on Tuesday, and it was granted. They said they would not leave the embassy grounds until Mr. Clinton left.
The issue of human rights is so sensitive that journalists were instructed on Tuesday at a news conference with Mr. Suharto in Bogor to pose only questions relating to the economic forum. When asked how he planned to resolve the problem of East Timor, Mr. Suharto said there no time to answer the question.
Mr. Suharto kept the spotlight on trade. "In Bogor, we have set the course and the direction of a future cooperation in the Asia Pacific area in particular and in the world in general," he said.
President Clinton defined the success of the meeting in terms of what was in it for America, predicting that relaxing trade barriers would open new markets, make American goods and services more competitive, encourage sales abroad and create jobs at home.
"From the beginning of this Administration we have worked to create high-wage jobs and a high-growth economy for the 20th century by expanding our ability to trade with and do business with other nations," he said on Tuesday. "The Asia-Pacific is the key to the success of this strategy because it's the fastest-growing region in the world, with rapidly expanding middle classes who are potential American customers."
Despite his recent foreign travel, Mr. Clinton said he does not see himself turning into a foreign policy President. "I expect the lion's share of my work will continue to be done at home," he said, adding, "It's been somewhat more busy on the foreign front than I could have anticipated in the last few months."
Mr. Suharto and his 17 guests were outfitted in custom-made batik shirts in varying shades of brown, black, beige and ochre.
Their declaration commits the group, known as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, to develop a blueprint of what exactly free trade means -- whether it applies to goods or services or both -- and a road map to reach their goal when the leaders come together in Osaka, Japan, next year.
Developed nations like the United States and Japan agreed to end trade barriers by 2010, and developing nations agreed to follow suit a decade later.
Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mohamad Mahathir, long wary about the Asia-Pacific grouping and of American domination over the region's affairs, expressed strong concerns during the meeting about the declaration and said his country would proceed with trade liberalization at its own pace.
As if to prove him right about the risks of American dominance, the most prominent food vendors at a free restaurant set up for hundreds of journalists in the botanical gardens of Bogor were Wendy's, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin' Donuts.
There is a never-never land quality about a pledge 26 years into the future. And while Tuesday's declaration is politically significant, it is not legally binding, and has no mechanism for enforcement.
Still, by breaking the psychological barrier and setting a concrete goal, however remote, it creates a framework for "building block" agreements on issues like rules for customs and standards.
 The article also reversed the names of the Malaysian Prime Minister. He is Mahathir Mohamad.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE INCREASES INTEREST RATES BY 3/4 POINT; JUMP IS LARGEST SINCE 1981

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases. Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.
The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans. Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent. 
 While rising rates are intended to slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve's five previous increases, which began in February, have had mixed results. Some industries, like auto making, that depend on customers who need loans have had robust sales, while others, like home building, have begun to slow. Critics of the Federal Reserve say that interest rate changes take up to 18 months to show results and that the previous increases may yet do so.
The central bank today raised by three-quarters of a percentage point each of two short-term interest rates that it controls. Stocks, bonds and the dollar bounced up and down in value following the Federal Reserve's action but closed with little change.
The decision by the Federal Reserve came five hours after it reported that American factories operated at 84.9 percent of capacity in October, the highest level in nearly 15 years. When factories are working at top speed, production bottlenecks often occur and can lead to inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers. [Page D6.]
"These measures were taken against the background of evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilization," the Federal Reserve said in a statement.
The Clinton Administration responded to the Federal Reserve's action with restrained statements. Although President Clinton expressed hope this morning that Federal Reserve officials would "do their best to keep the recovery going," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the chief White House economic adviser, Laura D' Andrea Tyson, issued statements emphasizing the Federal Reserve's independence, avoiding any direct comment on interest rates while stressing the economy's overall health.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican scheduled to head the Senate Banking Committee next year, cautiously endorsed the Fed's move today. Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, warned that higher rates would hurt American workers.
Even before the rate decision was made today, more than 100 people from labor unions and community groups protested the anticipated increase outside the Federal Reserve headquarters, the first such rally against rising interest rates since the early 1980's.
A series of speakers pointed out that while the nation's unemployment rate may be relatively low now at 5.8 percent, 7.6 million Americans remain unemployed, while millions more are stuck in low-wage jobs.
The National Association of Manufacturers also criticized the move, contending that factories may have more capacity than Federal Reserve statisticians realize, given heavy corporate investment this year.
Alice M. Rivlin, President Clinton's budget director, warned today that more inflation might result if Congressional Republicans stimulated the economy by enacting tax cuts without matching spending cuts. That might push the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates. "It would certainly put enormous upward pressure on interest rates and the Fed would have to continue to raise rates," she said.
The Federal Reserve today acted on two rates. It raised its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 4.75 percent. And it raised the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4 percent. Both rates stood at 3 percent at the beginning of this year.
Big banks responded today by raising their prime rates to 8.5 percent from 7.75 percent.
Adjustable-rate mortgages are typically pegged to the interest rates on six-month and one-year Treasury bills, which had already risen in recent weeks in anticipation of action by the Federal Reserve today.
On the other hand, savers are clear beneficiaries of the higher rates. Since Jan. 1, the interest rates on one-year certificates of deposit have climbed to nearly 5 percent from about 3 percent, meaning that a $10,000 deposit held for a year would now earn an additional $185.
The Federal Reserve said that the vote to raise the discount rate was 7 to 0, meaning that both of President Clinton's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, Alan S. Blinder and Janet L. Yellen, supported the move. The Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the 7-member board and 5 of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve regional banks, determines the Federal funds rate. The committee will not disclose today's vote until Dec. 23, when it releases minutes of today's meeting.
In contrast to the Federal Reserve's last two interest rate increases, today's announcement had no indication that this would be the central bank's last such action for a while. But Wall Street economists said that the size of today's increase made it less likely that the Federal Reserve's top officials would raise rates again at their next meeting on Dec. 20, waiting instead at least until the following meeting on Jan. 31.
While the Federal Reserve has raised rates by a full percentage point in the past, most recently on May 5, 1981, Fed officials were unable to find any prior case today of a move of three quarters of a point.
The action appeared to represent a compromise between those officials most worried by inflation, led by J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and officials more inclined to wait and see whether the strong economic growth actually produced inflation.
Officials worried about inflation have pushed for big increases in short-term rates that would shock bond traders into believing that inflation is under control, thereby halting the upward creep in long-term interest rates. Mr. Broaddus successfully pushed last spring for the Federal Reserve to abandon its initial quarter-point increases in favor of half-point increases in May and August, and he is believed to have favored an increase of a full percentage point today.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, has said that the central bank should err, if at all, on the side of raising rates too much. It is easier to reverse an unexpected drop in economic output by lowering interest rates than it is to stop an inflationary spiral with higher rates, he testified last summer.
Mr. Broaddus and three other Federal Reserve regional bank presidents, all advocates of higher rates, will rotate off the open market committee at the end of this year. Three of their four replacements are believed to be more concerned about maintaining the current economic expansion and less interested in higher rates.
One of the Federal Reserve's biggest worries is that prices for commodities and some industrial materials, like plywood and ball bearings, have been increasing steadily this year. Consumer prices have not yet reflected these increases, mostly because labor accounts for two-thirds of the cost of consumer goods and wages have been rising fairly slowly this year.
But the Labor Department reported on Nov. 4 that average hourly wages had spurted up 8 cents in October, to $11.24. As a result, Fed officials worry about whether inflation will remain limited to commodity prices.
"I don't think that can last very long; it's going to have to show through or recede," Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Federal Reserve Board governor, said on Nov. 4.

HEADLINE: Maturing Jazz Industry Opens Convention Tonight

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
The Jazz Times Convention starts tonight, which means that tired-looking, cigarette-smoking people from all over the world will gather to talk about what they heard last night, what kinds of deals can be cooked up today and who is sitting in with whom and where. For the next four days, the convention becomes jazz's business paradise, with bookers, musicians, radio programmers, record company executives, agents, club owners and critics swarming like fish around a particularly fertile reef.
The convention started in Washington 10 years ago as a casual meeting of some of the disparate elements that make up the jazz world. It has grown into big business, with attendance up nearly 20 percent from last year. This year's version draws nearly 700 people from across the country, along with people from India, Sweden, Russia, England and more. In its success, its internationalism and its growth, the convention suggests that jazz is taking itself more seriously as an industry, and flourishing because of it. 
 "More people in the industry are becoming more professional," said Lee Mergner, the convention's director and the associate publisher of the magazine Jazz Times. "It feels like people have their business skills together. Marketing is taken more seriously now, and a much more structured organization is out there to promote the music in both the nonprofit and commercial world. I think the convention just reflects what's going on. We're becoming institutional, in a good way."
While there may be a new air of professionalism to the convention, it is clearly set up to lure people with the promise of a good time. Holding the festival in New York again guarantees that people who have come for music business will be able to escape from business to hear some of the best jazz in the world. And the convention itself is featuring performances by Eric Reed, Hubert Laws, Henry Threadgill, Jacky Terrasson, Tom Coster, Milt Jackson, Wallace Roney, Kenny Garrett and many more. And record companies have bought showcases to expose acts that are either little known or are the centerpieces of their roster.
"This is a great way to get a buzz going about our performers, since all of jazz's cognoscenti show up," said Bruce Lundvall, the president of Blue Note Records. "And the musicians get the added advantage of being heard by bookers and agents from all over the world. It's an amazingly effective way of spreading the word."
The convention's panels hint at what the jazz world is thinking about, and they cover everything from radio promotion and distribution networks to finding sponsors for festivals. One is called "Jazz in Cyberspace." Another is on the European jazz-festival circuit, while another is about selling and licensing recordings in Europe. One asks jazz critics to take a hard look at themselves, and other is a tribute to the guest of honor, Sonny Rollins.
But underlying all discussions for the last 10 years has been one theme: how to expand jazz's role in the marketplace. The convention facilitates the general promotion of jazz that most of the people in the industry share, whether from self-interest or love of the music or both. Schmoozing is the balm that allows the muscles of the industry to function smoothly.
"Jazz is in a position now that some other musics were in decades ago, right on the verge of being taken more seriously as a commercial force," said Mr. Lundvall. "There are three serious jazz magazines out there now, where there had been one only a short while ago, and virtually every major label has a jazz program, a situation I've never seen before. The Jazz Times Convention, is the first step in developing some kind of a marketing consensus within the industry. It also the only national forum jazz has, which makes it very important."
One of the convention's main achievements has been to draw together all the microcosms that make up jazz. The owner of a tiny, independent jazz label from Tucson, Ariz., can deal with a European manager or with the owner of a small club in Milwaukee. Because its economics have until recently been on a fairly low scale, fans have been able to be involved with jazz, giving it as a business a home-grown and idiosyncratic feel. But it is changing, becoming more centralized at major labels and at institutions like Lincoln Center. The change means that jazz may lose some of the individualism it has as a business; it also means that some musicians, with power behind them, will find themselves in a better position.
"Organizationally speaking, jazz has been all over the place as a business, and I think that the music is coming of age as a viable commercial form," said Jeff Levenson, Billboard magazine's jazz editor. "It's always been fragmented, and now out of economic necessity, a unified front is important. The convention makes me suspect that jazz is coming to a new maturity in how it treats itself in the marketplace. And given how much potential money there is in the music, that's important."
Some nighttime events are open to the public, including Mr. Threadgill tonight at 11 o'clock at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, and Rodney Kendrick, Bhaki Mseleku, Mark Whitfield and Django Bates and Human Chain at Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, East Village, on Friday night at 10.

HEADLINE: Assembly Speaker Voices Doubts On Pataki's Pledge to Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Starting to build a Democratic case against Governor-elect George E. Pataki's central campaign promise, the Assembly Speaker said today that it would be difficult to cut taxes as quickly and deeply as Mr. Pataki has pledged, and added that the Assembly Democrats might offer a tax-cutting plan of their own.
The Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said at a news conference in Albany that New Yorkers would "understand if, in fact, any tax cuts have to go slower than were promised in the campaign." 
 As that new front was opening in Mr. Pataki's future battle with the Assembly Democrats, the Governor-elect managed to keep alive a feud from the past. At a news conference today at his headquarters in Manhattan, Mr. Pataki said he still had not returned a congratulatory telephone call from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the gubernatorial campaign.
"The Mayor can reach me; he knows where I am, and if he wants to call, I'll be happy to speak to him," Mr. Pataki said. He added: "I have not gotten a call that I'm aware of from the Mayor during business hours here from 9 to 5."
Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said that Mr. Pataki had returned calls today to United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, New York City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and Public Advocate Mark Green. All had called Mr. Pataki during working hours, she said.
Mr. Giuliani, who said he called Mr. Pataki twice on election night, responded: "This whole subject is getting very silly. The fact is, governors and mayors work before 9 o'clock in the morning and after 5 o'clock at night. So maybe we should move beyond this telephone call and work on things that are of substantive benefit for the city."
Mr. Pataki also said today that he soon would announce the formation of transition committees to deal with specific topics, like the state budget and perhaps a possible takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, something Mr. Pataki has alternatively said he would look at and then has said he opposed. As reporters and photographers were ushered into a large office where Pataki advisers were meeting, Mr. Pataki joked: "Well, we've got plenty of time. We've got six weeks to redo a $64 billion government."
Mr. Silver's comments about the possibility of a competing tax-cut plan made it clear that the Democratic-controlled Assembly would seek to keep the Republicans from staking full ownership of the issue.
During the campaign, Mr. Pataki proposed a 25 percent cut in state income tax rates, a reduction that would cost the state $5.6 billion a year in revenues by the fourth year. He said he would pay for the tax cut by curbing the growth in state spending and through projected annual growth in state revenues of 6 percent. Even after learning that the state faces a projected budget shortfall of $4 billion next year, Mr. Pataki has remained committed to his plan.
Mr. Silver suggested today that Mr. Pataki's economic assumptions were too optimistic. And he said the most obvious routes to cutting state spending -- reducing the state's aid to schools and local governments -- would simply pressure local governments to raise property taxes.
Mr. Silver said the Assembly Democrats might propose an alternative plan, presumably less ambitious, and that it might involve taxes other than the income tax. The Democratic strategy would provide cover for upstate Democrats who may feel torn between competing political pressures -- the pressure to maintain loyalty to the Assembly's New York City-based leadership and the pressure to respond to the message sent last Tuesday by upstate voters, who sided overwhelmingly with Mr. Pataki.
When the newly elected Assembly convenes in January, 58 of the 94 Democrats will represent districts in New York City, where Mr. Cuomo defeated Mr. Pataki by comfortable margins. But 58 votes does not make a majority in the 150-member Assembly, meaning that Mr. Silver also must appeal to the 15 Democrats from the suburbs of New York City and the 21 Assembly Democrats from upstate, where Mr. Pataki clobbered Mr. Cuomo.
To take a purely obstructionist position toward tax cuts could put those Assembly Democrats at risk. One upstate Democrat, Assemblyman William L. Parment of Chautauqua County, characterized Mr. Silver's dilemma this way today. "Over the years the Assembly has been controlled by New York City liberals," he said. "Now I suppose the question is whether they can count on us upstate bumpkins to vote Democratic. Well, aw shucks, I don't know."

HEADLINE: Museum of Modern Art Ends Troubled Search for a Chief

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
The Museum of Modern Art announced yesterday that it had finally found a new director, after a sometimes messy 14-month search. He is Glenn D. Lowry, the 40-year-old director of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto and a specialist in Islamic art. He takes over on July 1, 1995.
Mr. Lowry is a surprise choice to succeed Richard E. Oldenburg, who announced in September 1993 that he planned to retire. Since then, several candidates had turned down offers from the museum, and the names of many others had been bandied about. Mr. Lowry's was not one of them. 
 The Modern's troubled search for its sixth director came to symbolize the difficulties museums across the country have had in finding people suited to the shifting requirements of the job, in which economic and managerial skills have increasingly come to outweigh the traditional visual and scholarly ones.
At the Modern, the world's pre-eminent museum of 20th-century art, the situation was more complex: on the cusp of a possible major expansion, it needed a fund-raiser and administrator, and, ideally, a scholar, but not one who would impose his, or her, tastes on the unusually independent group of curators. A new generation of curators, including Kirk Varnedoe, Peter Galassi, Margit Rowell and Terry Riley, had already begun to reshape the Modern, and to debate whether, and how, to redefine it for the next century.
The costly and time-consuming search that ultimately turned up Mr. Lowry actually began months before Mr. Oldenburg's announcement that he would retire, when the Modern's board said it would create the position of paid president, responsible for administrative and fund-raising duties, to share leadership with the director. The idea for such a president was scrapped with Mr. Oldenburg's decision to quit.
Several months of seeking for his successor among prominent directors, including Anne d'Harnoncourt of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, James Wood of the Art Institute of Chicago and Peter Marzio of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, turned up no one, and made the Modern's problems increasingly the subject of uneasy speculation in the art world about trustee conflicts and the desirability of the job there. Mr. Oldenburg agreed to extend his stay to the end of 1994, but his deadline was fast approaching and the search seemed stalled until Mr. Lowry's name surfaced.
Matters changed only in September when the Modern hired a new search firm, which quietly began to focus on young candidates who wanted the job, not solely on those people with long careers at other big institutions. Attention began to center on Mr. Lowry just a month ago, and even high-ranking staff members did not hear about him until this week.
Mr. Lowry brings to the post a background as a scholar and curator, but clearly not one whose area of expertise conflicts with that of anyone at the Modern. He has also had several years of directorial experience raising money and overseeing the construction of new buildings. That included a deeply acrimonious battle he waged with the Ontario provincial government, stemming from a $58 million project to expand the Art Gallery of Ontario.
Describing Mr. Lowry's appointment, Agnes Gund, the Modern's chairman, said: "He doesn't want to be a curator; he wants to be an administrator. So he won't be wishing he could do the shows instead of the curators. At the same time, he understands what a curator does. And he knew how to work with adversity in Toronto and raise money at the same time."
David Rockefeller, chairman emeritus and, with Ms. Gund, a co-chairman of the committee that looked for a new director, concurred: "It's sad we spent so much time looking at other people, but in another sense it was worth the time that it took. Both staff and trustees wanted someone with a passion for the arts, a scholar, if possible, and also a leader. Glenn has those things. And to raise $58 million in Toronto is the equivalent of many millions more in New York."
The Modern has been pressed for space from the moment it moved into its expanded quarters on 53d Street a decade ago. Lately it has been considering yet another expansion, next door or elsewhere, to accommodate its growing collection, particularly of large-scale contemporary art.
Referring to Mr. Lowry on a more personal level, Mr. Rockefeller added: "He's also basically comfortable in his skin and not threatened by other people. So he'll respect the curators but not be intimidated by them."
For his part, the trim, slightly graying Mr. Lowry said: "I hope I can be a catalyst for the different departments of the museum to work together, and to engage people here in an intense dialogue about art and the display of art for different publics. But I have no particular curatorial axes to grind."
Mr. Lowry was born in Manhattan in 1954, was reared in Williamstown, Mass., and graduated from Williams College there in 1976. He received a Ph.D. in art history from Harvard University in 1982, having written his thesis on Mughal architectural history. For two years, he served as founding director of Joseph and Margaret Muscarelle Museum of Art at the College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, Va., overseeing construction of the museum and raising money for it.
Between 1984 and 1990, he was curator of Near Eastern Art at the Freer and Sackler Galleries of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. With Thomas Lentz, he organized "Timur and the Princely Vision," a major exhibition of Persian 15th-century art. The show, and its catalogue, were notable not just for their focus on exquisite objects but also for their emphasis on placing those objects in a social and political context, an approach Mr. Lowry says he hopes to encourage in programs at the Modern.
One of his most important achievements was to help acquire for the Sackler the celebrated collection of Persian and Indian painting that the jeweler Henri Vever, a neighbor and rival of Cartier in Paris, put together at the beginning of the century. The collection disappeared in 1938. But in 1984, unbelievably, Mr. Lowry's French-born mother, Laure, who has no involvement in the art world, happened to overhear at a dinner party in Paris that it was in the possession of the jeweler's grandson, Francois Mautin. Mr. Lowry, at first skeptical of his mother's news, tracked down Mr. Mautin and got the collection.
From Washington, Mr. Lowry moved in 1990 to become director of the Art Gallery of Ontario, one of the largest museums in Canada, with a collection from the early Renaissance to the present, its strength in 20th-century and contemporary material. His appointment there, as a young American Islamicist, was a surprise, too, and he immediately faced big problems. Ground had already been broken for a 100,000-square-foot expansion and 200,000-square-foot renovation. But the project started to run way over budget. Meanwhile, partly because of a severe recession, the provincial government, which heavily subsidized the gallery, reneged on promises to increase the amount it gave each year.
Mr. Lowry was forced to lay off 250 people, from a staff of 450, and shut the gallery down entirely for seven months. His actions were called Draconian. But at the same time, he oversaw a fund-raising drive to cover the costs of the expansion and make the museum less dependent on public money, partly by turning the gallery's shops, publications and restaurants into more profitable operations.
The gallery finally reopened in January 1993, to widespread satisfaction, its collections completely reinstalled and its staff up to 300 people. Mr. Lowry then brought a highly popular traveling exhibition of works from the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia to the museum in September of this year, and under his tenure there were also shows of artists like Dan Graham, Michael Snow and William Morris.
After his appointment at the Modern was announced yesterday to the museum's staff, several curators there voiced their approval of his youth, energy, scholarship and ability to weather storms.
Mr. Varnedoe, chief curator of painting and sculpture, said: "One of the things that's most heartening is that he really wants to be a director. I don't think he's a frustrated curator."
Mr. Lowry is the first director of the Modern who comes to the job from another directorship. He is not, as it happens, the first Lowry to be director of the museum in its 65-year history. In 1972, Mr. Oldenburg took over after two brief and stormy directorships, one by John Hightower and the other by Bates Lowry, who like the incoming director, was not a specialist in modern art. His expertise was the Renaissance. He lasted less than a year. He is no relation, said the incoming director.

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: TRADE;
CLINTON PLEDGES TO PUSH FOR VOTE ON TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton and a parade of the fallen and the survivors in Congress vowed today to plow ahead with House and Senate votes on a world trade agreement after Thanksgiving despite some bipartisan opposition.
They argued that if the votes were put off until next year, the agreement, which took 12 years to negotiate with 123 nations, would certainly die. 
 Both White House and Congressional officials, including the Speaker-in-waiting, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said they believed that a deal would be struck with Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the future majority leader, that would ultimately insure passage of the accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But much negotiating remained, and all day, with a sudden frenetic energy, Clinton Administration officials led by Vice President Al Gore drew apocalyptic scenarios of what a defeat of the agreement would mean to the United States.
Using some of the more dire projections among the dozens of debatable estimates floating around Washington, they warned of billions of dollars in lost growth for the economy, lost chances to create tens of thousands of jobs and, perhaps most important to the White House, a loss of credibility abroad.
"We must pass the GATT, and we should do it right away," Mr. Clinton said in Jakarta, Indonesia, as he wound up a meeting with Asian leaders, who pressed him for assurances that the United States would not torpedo an agreement that America pioneered. "It is critical for U.S. leadership in the world."
To achieve passage of the agreement, Mr. Clinton finds himself in a particularly odd quandary: he must win the support of his newly emboldened Republican opponents, who are generally much greater advocates of free trade than is the President's own party.
"You have to imagine the Alice in Wonderland quality of this," said a senior Administration official who has sat in on many of the White House strategy meetings in recent days. "Here we are, trying to figure out how to get business leaders to put pressure on Republicans to vote for something Reagan championed and Bush almost implemented."
The Administration's hurried public relations campaign was reminiscent of its successful effort a year ago to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, an accord that is dwarfed in scope by the far more complex pact now before Congress.
The awakening at the White House was spurred in part by a letter to Mr. Clinton on Tuesday from Jesse Helms, the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who threatened not to cooperate with the President's foreign policy initiatives unless the vote on GATT was delayed until the new Congress convenes in January.
Today, at a rally for business leaders pressing for the trade accord's passage, Mr. Gore and Speaker Thomas S. Foley dismissed the threats of Senator Helms, whose home state, North Carolina, is heavily dependent on textiles, the one industry that could be most damaged by the tariff reductions mandated by the agreement.
"The question of delaying GATT is really an issue of whether GATT passes at all," Mr. Gore said. "It is abundantly clear that a delay of GATT would kill it."
Passage of the agreement seems all but assured in the House, where Mr. Gingrich has repeatedly expressed support for it. Indeed, in a letter to the President today, Mr. Gingrich pledged to work toward "a bipartisan majority" to achieve passage.
But its chances in the Senate are uncertain. A senior Administration official said today that he thought the agreement was still three to five votes short of the 60 needed under budget rules that require a three-fifths majority for any measure that would increase the Federal deficit; GATT would cost the Government several billion dollars in lost tariff revenue over the next decade.
The key to passage is Mr. Dole, the future Senate majority leader, who said again today that although he generally supported the agreement, he would insist that Congress get greater leverage to make sure that the new World Trade Organization created by the accord would not force unacceptable changes in Federal and state laws.
In essence, White House officials said, Mr. Dole is demanding some kind of mechanism that would enable Congress, barred by legislative rules from amending the agreement in any vote this year, to review American participation if it determined that the World Trade Organization was consistently ruling against United States interests.
"I'd rather fix it and do it this year," Mr. Dole said. "If we can't fix it, then we can postpone it."
The bill will be shepherded in the Senate by Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the current chairman of the Finance Committee, and by the Senator who will succeed him as chairman in the 104th Congress, Bob Packwood of Oregon.
"If Senator Dole is with us, we will pass this rather handsomely," Mr. Packwood said today.
Over the next two weeks, the White House is planning a series of events to press the cause of GATT, borrowing many of the techniques it used in the last-minute push that won the Nafta vote.
Mr. Gore; Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, and other officials will be pressing free-trade arguments with farmers, journalists and business associations around the country, a senior White House official said today. Former Presidents will be urged to write articles of opinion for newspapers or sign letters in support of the agreement.
The politics of the new Congress has so overwhelmed the trade issue on Capitol Hill that the details of the agreement itself have seemed almost lost. The accord is so vast -- 500 pages, supplemented by about 22,000 pages of tariff schedules and country-by-country regulations -- that almost no one who will be voting on it has read it. Estimates of how much it would benefit the American economy, if in fact it would, vary so widely that they are almost useless. "The fact is," said one Government economist working the numbers, "we are all shooting in the dark."
Mr. Clinton's aides say the complexity of the pact may work to their advantage, by keeping GATT from becoming as heated a topic as Nafta was. But the accord's opponents, who range from the consumer activist Ralph Nader to conservative Democrats like Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina to Republicans like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Mr. Helms, are raising numerous objections.
The first is that the accord will be voted on by a lame-duck Congress, populated in part by defeated members. Moreover, under a rule governing the voting, Congress can vote only up or down, with no amendments. Under some interpretations, that rule, called "fast track" in Capitol Hill parlance, expires next year.
That means that in the new Congress, Mr. Helms and others could open the bill to endless amendments, and each of the amendments would then have to be renegotiated with all of the agreement's member nations.
The second objection raised by opponents is that the agreement should actually be considered a treaty. If it were, it would require even more votes in the Senate -- a two-thirds majority -- although no vote at all in the House. That objection has been supported by Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard constitutional scholar.
The third issue, and the biggest one for Senator Dole, is the notion that the United States might be surrendering sovereignty to the new World Trade Organization. The fear is that American laws, like those that ban the importing of goods made by child labor, would be judged illegal under GATT. While the World Trade Organization could not order a change in Federal or state laws, it could authorize other countries to invoke sanctions against American products.
In reality, supporters of the accord say, there is little such risk: few countries would want to get into a sanctions war with the United States, and risk the loss of their own exports here.
The fourth objection is one now being seized upon by religious conservatives: language in the GATT implementation bill that, in their view, benefits what they call the liberal voice of the capital, The Washington Post.
The Post owns a controlling interest in a company that, under the bill, would receive a "pioneer preference" license from the Federal Communications Commission to build a new wireless telephone and computer network, using digital technology. The newspaper would be required to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to use the frequencies, but the religious right has flooded Congressional offices in recent days with faxes arguing that those sums are not large enough.

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: THE PRESIDENT;
White House in Struggle To Take Back the Agenda

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Inside an executive mansion fairly swarming with political advice-givers and abuzz with strategy, the burning question these days is not just what President Clinton will do with a Republican Congress, but what he will do with a Democratic White House.
It is also the toughest question. And a week after Mr. Clinton and his counsels lost command of the national legislature and any claim to a political mandate, they are still searching for an answer. 
 As the President wrapped up a Pacific Rim trade conference in Indonesia and flew to Hawaii tonight, his aides in Washington were trying to compile a concise list of initiatives with which Mr. Clinton could at once outpoint the new Republican majority, stake out his political philosophy and appeal to broad swaths of voters.
The aides have an abundance of suggestions. One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the list, which sounds more than vaguely like the Republicans', includes welfare reform, a modest health-care package, a line-item veto on Federal budget expenditures, term limits, campaign-finance reform and a tax cut for the middle class.
What the aides and the President lack is a consensus on which issues to highlight and, in some cases, even which positions to take. The Administration's explanation is that responding to a political sea change is a complex and arduous task, that Mr. Clinton has been abroad almost since Election Day, and that the best short-run strategy may be to see what Republicans toss into the legislative arena, and then to react to it.
But many Clinton advisers and friends also say that the rethinking at the White House is all the more hampered by internal difficulties. These people say that there are differences over whether to pursue a more centrist policy, uncertainty about the views and the role of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and even questions about the decisiveness of the President himself.

 In many ways these internal debates are nothing new to the Clinton White House, and most of the initiatives being revisited, and now reconsidered, are the same issues on which Mr. Clinton campaigned and won in 1992.
In principle, the debate among Mr. Clinton and his aides, who have frequently heard his views this week via long-distance phone calls, boils down to this question: Should the White House edge closer to the political center, or should it try to bolster its more liberal Democratic base?
The circle of advisers in this debate is wide, and the alliances among them are not always well defined. But White House aides and those who have talked with them say that in general the advocates of a more centrist position are led by aides like Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser; Jack Quinn, the chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore; Robert Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Mr. Reed's roots lie with the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group that Mr. Clinton helped found and once ran as governor of Arkansas.
Among those who favor a more traditional Democratic strategy are Harold M. Ickes, a deputy to the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, and David Dreyer, an official in the White House communications office who has a voice in political strategy. Mr. Ickes, a New York lawyer, oversaw White House strategy in the last campaign; Mr. Dreyer was once an aide to the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
Two of the President's senior advisers, George Stephanopoulos and Mark D. Gearan, are said to lie somewhere in the middle. Mr. Gearan was supposed to fly to Indonesia with Mr. Clinton but stayed behind to coordinate post-election strategy; Mr. Stephanopoulos went in his place.
Aides commonly assume that another highly influential adviser, Mrs. Clinton, leans to the views of Mr. Ickes. But even they are not so sure.
In Indonesia this week, as her husband said he was receptive to a Republican proposal for a Constitutional amendment on school prayer, Mrs. Clinton seemed much tougher. Mrs. Clinton said in an interview that there would be "real differences" between the White House and its rivals if Republicans truly took aim at social spending programs like Head Start or at gun-control measures.
"I'm not a political pundit," she said. But then she added: "I think the President has to stick with what he's stood for. He has to stick with his principles and protect the progress that's been made."
Some senior aides say that Mrs. Clinton's stewardship of health-insurance legislation last year was a principal reason that her husband became tagged as a big-government Democrat, and they expect her to take a less visible role in policy for the rest of his term.
But whatever the political leanings of advisers, aides say, the choice for Mr. Clinton is more subtle than a decision between old and new Denmocratic politics. Virtually all agree that the base of loyal Democratic voters is now so shrunken that it cannot insure Mr. Clinton's re-election by itself. The real problem, most say, is trickier: how to keep the party's liberal base happy and yet lure back former Democrats who left out of unhappiness with the party's liberal streak.
That is what the President accomplished in his 1992 campaign, in which he stressed broad themes like economic security, freedom from crime and the healing of social divisions that were easy for voters to embrace.
"The Clinton campaign in '92 was brilliant" in that respect, said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"The problem is that when governing, you have to make choices every single day," the strategist said. "It's one or the other. And you seem to be choosing sides."
In the view of many strategists from both sides of the debate, Mr. Clinton's seeming inability to choose sides has contributed greatly to his political undoing.
White House aides complain that the President has reduced the deficit, overseen sweeping free-trade agreements, established a program of national service and shifted Federal expenses to education and training, and gotten no credit.
But on issues that have excited voters -- homosexuals in the military, the appointment of aides like the civil-rights advocate Lani Guinier, or the removal of dictators in Haiti -- Mr. Clinton has tended to take firm stances on one side or the other, and then to retreat. His critics, as well as some supporters, say he has wound up only angering two segments of the electorate: the side that opposed his first decision, and the side that regarded him as weak when he deserted it.
In Washington, aides expressed hope today that Mr. Clinton would spend time in Hawaii resting and considering his political options. Nearly all of the top advisers who accompanied him to Indonesia -- including Mr. Stephanopoulos and John D. Podesta, the staff secretary -- were flying almost directly to Washington to join in the debate.
"The first answers have been relatively easy," said a senior White House official traveling with the President. "It's in the next set of questions and answers that things get a whole lot more difficult."

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The United States and Indonesia today announced $40 billion in joint projects over the next decade, even as President Clinton warned President Suharto that the relationship between the two countries would never reach its full potential unless he treated his people better.
At almost the same time that Mr. Clinton was chiding the Indonesian leader for his country's inadequate human rights record, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was witnessing the signing of 15 business deals that are part of the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy and will mean jobs for Americans. 
 By far the largest project is a $35 billion arrangement between Exxon and Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company, to develop a huge offshore natural gas field. [Page D5.]
Since May, when the Administration discarded its policy of linking preferential trade benefits to China with an improvement in its human rights performance, the Administration has argued that the best way to spread democracy and improve the way a country treats its citizens is through increasing trade, not curtailing it.
In his photo session with Mr. Suharto earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton was stone-faced, but in a speech to American and Pacific business executives he did not disguise his glee at the news of the business deals.
"I know that there is increasing wealth in Indonesia and throughout Asia, but where I come from $40 billion is still real money -- and we're grateful for the business," he said. The audience applauded.
Indeed, two cultural divides over human rights in Indonesia were on display today: one between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Suharto, the other between the foreign and economic policies of the United States
Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Suharto in the opulent Jakarta Palace showed how resistant foreign leaders can be when the President of the United States comes in and suggests -- however gently -- how things should be done.
And the differences among Mr. Clinton's Cabinet officials as they sought to explain their messages underscored the tension between the Administration's stated desire to export American values and the need to export American goods.
Meeting for more than an hour after a summit conference of 18 leaders from Pacific Rim countries, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Suharto that his treatment of his people would inhibit ties between the United States and Indonesia and rob him of the chance to flourish as a world leader, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said.
Mr. Christopher told reporters before meeting with Indonesia's Government-appointed human rights organization that Mr. Clinton had raised human rights "in firm and forceful terms."
"The relationship between the United States and Indonesia can never reach the highest levels if the people of the United States don't have confidence that there is an effort here to respect the human rights of all the citizens," Mr. Christopher said.
Mr. Suharto, who has ruled with an authoritarian grip since the mid-1960's, apparently was not moved.
When Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Suharto's dialogue with the people of East Timor, the former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia two decades ago, but said they needed more autonomy, Mr. Suharto balked, Administration officials said.
"He believes that the Indonesian Government is dealing with the issue fairly," a senior Administration official said.
Over all, Mr. Suharto's remarks on human rights, the official added, "were along the lines that have been previously expressed by the Indonesian Government."
Another senior official said: "Suharto didn't back down one inch. He gave well rehearsed answers that he is used to repeating."
Mr. Suharto learned early this year that he is unlikely to face penalties if he does not bend to Washington's wishes. Shortly after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Mr. Suharto in Jakarta that he had to do more on workers' rights if he wanted to retain his country's preferential trade privileges, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, abruptly suspended the Administration's review of the issue.
In May, the Administration severed the link between the trade benefits given China and its human rights policies. Since then the Administration has changed its thinking on the best strategy to modify behavior on human rights. The key, officials say, is not punishment but more trade and investment, which they believe will increase economic growth and help spawn a middle class with both consumerism and democracy in mind.
But the same officials acknowledge that the human rights situation in Indonesia has worsened in recent months with the banning of newspapers and magazines, more harassment of labor activists and new reports of torture by the military and police.
Along with the talk today about the need for Indonesia to do more on human rights was a message about the joys of trade. Indonesia is expected to spend more than $100 billion to improve its infrastructure by 2000, and the United States is determined to seize a large chunk of the projects.
Even as Mr. Clinton was mixing tough talk about human rights with happy talk about goals for free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, Secretary Brown was completing arrangements for 15 projects worth $40 billion.
This morning, seated next to Mr. Christopher as the Secretary of State criticized the Indonesian human rights record, Mr. Brown played good cop to Mr. Christopher's bad one. "Our strategy of commercial engagement, we believe, is the most effective strategy to have a positive impact on labor rights and human rights," he said.
To illustrate the importance of the economic component of the policy, Mr. Brown sat in on Mr. Christopher's meeting with the official human rights group and "was very persuasive in saying that we advance our commercial economic interests hand in hand with our human rights concerns," a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Suharto had hoped that as host of this year's meeting of the 18 leaders, known as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, he would focus attention on his country's economic progress and views on free trade.
Instead the focus was dimmed by demonstrations in Dili, in East Timor, and by a sit-in that began last Saturday at the American Embassy in Jakarta by 29 East Timorese who had demanded a meeting with Mr. Clinton or Mr. Christopher. Neither man nor any other senior Administration official has met with them.
Today Indonesian officials said that the Government was willing to allow the protesters to leave the country. Portugal has offered them asylum.
A number of Indonesia's major private rights organizations boycotted a meeting today with Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Stanley Roth, the senior Asia specialist at the White House, and Bowman Cutter, the deputy director of the National Economic Council.
A letter to Mr. Clinton, signed by leading private human rights groups, said, "Your unwillingness to meet with non-state actors in the pro-democracy movement seems to be part of the U.S. Government's inconsistency toward the improvement of human rights and democracy in Indonesia."

HEADLINE: Ukraine Votes to Become a Nuclear-Free Country

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Ukrainian Parliament put aside its longstanding reservations and voted overwhelmingly today to make their nation nuclear-free, removing roadblocks to carrying out two major arms control agreements.
In a move that the United States eagerly sought for some time, the Parliament agreed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which pledges its signers, with the exception of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to rid themselves of all nuclear weapons. 
 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union the Ukraine has been the world's third-largest nuclear power, with 1,800 warheads.
The Parliament placed a few conditions on the move, among them receiving assurances from the United States, Russia and Britain that they would respect Ukraine's borders and never use nuclear weapons against it. American officials said those conditions could be met easily and hailed today's vote.
"This is an immensely positive and welcome step," said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. "It is a very significant contribution to the security of the region and to the new independent state of Ukraine. It is also important for the national security interests of the United States."
Russia has said it would not put into effect the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which made deep cuts in long-range nuclear weapons, until Ukraine signed the nonproliferation treaty.
Both the Russian Parliament and the United States Congress have also said they were waiting for that to happen before taking up ratification of a subsequent arms accord, known as Start II. Taken together, the two treaties would slash the American and Russian stockpiles by two-thirds, so each country would have between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads.
Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have generally been favorably disposed toward aid to the Ukraine.
Over the last three years, both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have repeatedly pressed Ukraine to join the nonproliferation treaty, fearing that failure to join would sow discord between Ukraine and Russia. But until today, Ukraine's Parliament had delayed a decision, seeking to use their warheads as a bargaining chip for international respect, foreign aid and security guarantees.
President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine has spent the last few weeks urging his Parliament to ratify the treaty, warning them that his scheduled state visit to Washington next Monday and Tuesday would be under a cloud if this irritant to better United States-Ukrainian relations were not removed.
Before the Parliament ratified the treaty in a 301-to-8 vote, Mr. Kuchma told legislators today that acceding to the treaty was vital to improve Ukraine's international reputation.
"Ukraine today has no choice between being nuclear or nonnuclear," he said. "The process of world disarmament depends on our decision today."
Clinton Administration officials said Mr. Kuchma would be received warmly next week because of today's vote and because, after years of economic deadlock, he has taken bold and painful steps over the last month to remake Ukraine's economy along free-market lines.
Last January, Ukraine signed an agreement in Moscow with the United States and Russia in which it agreed to dismantle its missiles and send its warheads to Russia for destruction. Ukrainian officials said today that they have shipped 360 warheads to Russia and are ahead of schedule in destroying their stockpile.
Administration officials say Ukraine's decision to join the nonproliferation treaty is an important guarantee beyond the trilateral agreement to lock in its commitment to scrap its nuclear weapons.
During a visit to Washington, the Ukrainian Defense Minister, Valery Shmarov, told reporters that his country needed $50 million more in American aid this year to help build 2,500 housing units for deactivated soldiers and missile experts.
"It is not a big price for better security," he said.
One White House official said the Administration would look positively upon Mr. Shmarov's request, which comes on top of about $700 million in aid that the United States has pledged this year -- half in economic aid and half to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear arms.
With today's vote in Kiev, President Kuchma is expected to formally present Ukraine's accession to the nonproliferation treaty on Dec. 5 in Budapest at the summit meeting of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
At that session, President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Prime Minister John Major of Britain are also expected to provide Mr. Kuchma with the security pledges his Parliament is seeking. As part of its assurances, the United States plans to promise Ukraine, as it did in the trilateral agreement last January, that it would consult with Kiev if Ukraine is ever threatened militarily.
The United States, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus will exchange documents that formally make Start I take force. Under that treaty and associated documents, Kazakhstan and Belarus also agreed to eliminate their nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Court Blocks New Rule on Immigration

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Saying it raised serious Constitutional questions, a Federal judge today temporarily blocked California officials from enforcing the heart of Proposition 187, the much-debated immigration-control measure the state's voters overwhelmingly passed last week.
Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. of Federal District Court here found that the proposition, which would deny most government services to undocumented immigrants, might cause undue hardships and also might pre-empt law-enforcement powers reserved for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
 "I find that there is a balance of hardship that tips in favor of the plaintiffs," Judge Byrne said at the end of a two-hour hearing that had been called to hear complaints about the proposition filed by a number of civil rights and immigrant groups.
"There are serious questions," the judge added, "as to due-process violations, liberty interests and also property interests."
The proposition passed by a 3-to-2 margin at the end of a fall election campaign in which it emerged as the dominant issue. It would cut off schooling and nonemergency health care to undocumented immigrants and would require education and health officials to report to immigration authorities any person known or suspected not to have proper documents.
Immigration officials say California has more undocumented aliens than any other state, and California officials say the government services for them costs taxpayers more than $3 billion a year.
As illegal immigration has increased in California, so too has concern about its impact on the state's economy. This fall, that concern finally boiled over and angry state residents successfully petitioned to have the proposition placed on the ballot.
While Proposition 187 applies only to California, the impact of its debate and subsequent passage has been felt around the nation, particularly in Washington and in other states that have large numbers of undocumented immigrants.
Leaders of the proposition movement here say they will next try to force Congress to pass stricter immigration controls. They also say they will take their cause to other states with large immigrant populations, like Arizona, Texas and Florida.
Civil rights groups and immigrant advocates have vowed to oppose any efforts to spread the Proposition 187 movement. They assert that not only is the measure unconstitutional but that the anti-immigrant tide in California also stems mainly from hardships rendered by an economy that is weaker than that of most other states.
Judge Byrne's restraining order will run for 10 days. At the end of that period, the plaintiffs said they would begin legal proceedings to have the proposition permanently enjoined and then declared unconstitutional, a fight that lawyers on both sides said could last for several years or more.
"When you win a temporary restraining order, you're well on your way to the bigger victory," said Stephen Yagman, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. "The requirements for the first are much the same as the requirements for what follows. We've met the first."
Lawyers for the state argued in court today that the proposition sought only to solve a problem that the Federal Government had neglected. They said after the hearing that while the restraining order was in effect they would work to draw up plans to enforce the provisions of the proposition in case the restraining order is eventually lifted.
Judge Byrne instructed them not to publish or disseminate any of the plans.
Despite the court setback today, one founder of the Proposition 187 movement, Ron Prince, remained confident of eventual victory in the fight to save the proposition.
"We anticipated this," he said. "You're going to have pluses and minuses all the way. We'll continue to work -- and win."
In today's restraining order, Judge Byrne exempted two provisions in the proposition that increase penalties for manufacturing or using false immigration documents. He said those provisions raised no issues of undue hardship or constitutionality.
Defending Proposition 187 during the hearing, one state lawyer, Jon Ichinaga, argued that California would enforce the measure in a way that would be both constitutional and humane. "We believe that once our regulations are put into place, there will be no violations of due process," he said.
Mr. Ichinaga also argued that there was no reason to grant a temporary restraining order because it would be weeks, at least, before the state could draw up and use any enforcement measures.
Judge Byrne asked about an executive order issued by Gov. Pete Wilson that state officials first enforce the proposition by cutting off government services to pregnant women and nursing home patients. Mr. Ichinaga replied that the prenatal section would not go into effect for 60 days and the nursing care section would affect only undocumented immigrants applying for care, not those already under care.
A plaintiffs' lawyer, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union, countered that sick people and students were already being adversely affected by the proposition, even though it was technically not being enforced.
"People in this community, in large numbers, have stopped using services," he said. "We have surveyed 10 clinics that serve the undocumented in Los Angeles, hundreds of persons per day, and that population has dropped precipitously. We have the gravest of irreparable injury."
State lawyers denied that any injury was being done and urged Judge Byrne to permit the proposition to stand as the only effective instrument to halt the flood of immigrants across California's porous borders.
"The court has a responsibility, if possible, to find an interpretation of the statute that saves it," Mr. Ichinaga added.

HEADLINE: War on Kurds Hurts Turks in U.S. Eyes

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 10

 BODY:
As Turkey's war with Kurdish separatists has become ever more violent and uncompromising, the Government has faced a predicament: the more it succeeds, by its own accounts, the more it loses the tolerance of the United States and other Western allies concerned about its increasingly harsh tactics.
Now, the rift is deeper than ever. 
 The Turkish military says that this year it has killed more than 3,000 guerrillas from the separatist Kurdish Workers Party -- more than in any other comparable period in a decade of fighting that has now claimed at least 13,000 lives, including several thousand civilians.
Backing its troops with helicopter gunships and warplanes made in the United States, it has deployed more than 220,000 soldiers -- nearly half the army -- in its biggest campaign against the guerrillas, who number fewer than 20,000. And it has embarked on an effort to deny the insurgents supplies and support as winter sets in, hoping to starve, freeze and hound them into defeat.
The price, though, has been an unusual restriction on American military aid to this NATO ally, reflecting worries in Washington and elsewhere in the West over the jailing of elected Kurdish legislators and over reports that military tactics include a campaign to depopulate Kurdish regions through the forced evacuation and sometimes by the burning of hundreds of remote villages, just as Saddam Hussein once did in Kurdish northern Iraq.
But Turkey is a country that regards itself as a Western-looking democracy and, increasingly, the strains between those principles and what the military views as the dictates of war have led to a kind of dual national identity. In the wealthy west, the land looks to Europe; in the hardscrabble east, it plays by the harsher rules of a region bordering Iran, Iraq and Syria.
And the cost of the war -- estimates among Western diplomats range from $7 billion a year up -- is draining Turkey's debt-ridden economy so that spending on health and education has been cut.
Some 10 million to 12 million Kurds live in Turkey, mainly in the southeast. The basic issue in the war is the nature of the state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923. With their Marxist ideology and separatist aspirations, the Kurdish guerrillas collide directly with the founding notion of Turkey as a land unified by language, faith and national identity.
It is only in the last few years that the Government has acknowledged what President Suleyman Demirel called a "Kurdish reality." Any concession toward Kurdish ethnicity, like the use of the Kurdish language in broadcasting or education, meets with strong political and military opposition as an erosion of Ataturk's notion of the state.
"This trial is not about us; it is about the Kurdish identity and the Kurdish problem," said Hatip Dicle, one of eight elected Kurdish members of Parliament arrested this year on treason charges and accused of being fronts for the Kurdish Workers Party, known as the P.K.K. He was speaking at his trial, which is still under way.
The move against the legislators, including the banning of their political party, the Kurdish Democratic Party, reflects the Government's urge to deny the separatists any political legitimacy. But the crackdown has taken its toll among Turkey's allies.
In September the United States Congress suspended $38 million in military aid, one-tenth of the total, and ordered the State Department to investigate Turkey's record on human rights.
The campaign in the southeast, now centered on the snowy, mountainous uplands of Tunceli province, has increased Western fears that basic human rights are being ignored.
"In Tunceli, it is the state that is evacuating and burning villages," Human Rights Minister Azimet Koyuoglu said in a newspaper interview last month. "Acts of terrorism in other regions are done by the P.K.K. In Tunceli, it is state terrorism." In all, he said, 600 villages and 790 hamlets had been evacuated.
While he revised his views under pressure from the authorities, his words found much resonance among the thousands of villagers who have been forced out of their villages by troops.
"First they empty the villages, and then they burn them so the P.K.K. cannot seek refuge in them," said Kamer Genc, a legislator from Tunceli. In recent years, economic and military pressures have forced at least half of Turkey's Kurds to flee the war zone.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller says that when villages are burned, it is the work of guerrillas dressed as Government troops.
"The state does not burn villages," she told members of her True Path Party last month, arguing that since the local authorities in the southeast had authority to "evacuate" villages, there "is no need to clear these villages by burning them."
Such is the military's domination of Turkish war policy that the local military commander would not allow Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin to visit the area to look into reports that villages were burned last month.
The Kurdish Workers Party itself has a reputation for brutality, and many Western governments say it is a terrorist group.
Diplomats and human rights groups say the insurgents have killed villagers and burned down their homes to punish them for agreeing to take up arms for the Government as village guards. They have killed teachers sent to the region simply because they teach in Turkish, not Kurdish.
For several years now, as winter approached, Turkish officials have said that they were finally close to crushing the guerrillas. Then, in the spring, the war restarted. The current military campaign is intended to break the cycle.
"This year Turkey has had some successes," said a Western diplomat in Ankara. "But it has not come close to the military crushing" of the rebels.

Bond Prices Fall Despite Inflation Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Despite an increase in the Consumer Price Index that was smaller than expected, the prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the first time this week.
The report on consumer prices, a closely followed measure of inflation, sent long-bond prices up a half- point in the morning, but persistent fears that inflation could still accelerate quickly turned those modest gains into sharp losses by midday. 
 Adding to the day's negative tone was a weak dollar. There was also concern about more supply coming to a nervous market, as dealers looked ahead to the sales next week of new two-year and five-year notes.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 16/32 , to 9311/32 , for a yield of 8.09 percent, up from 8.05 percent on Tuesday, or a loss of about $3.44 for $1,000 invested in bonds.
Traders said they saw the selling as a sign that investors had little trust that the week's bond market rally could be sustained.
"Despite the bullish C.P.I., there remains a perception that the current economic strength will soon push inflation higher," said Greg Jones, senior economist for MMS International. "The market appears to be unable to push higher on a sustained basis without any evidence of a slowing economy."
"The inability of the bond to break through 8 percent on the ideal combo of aggressive Fed tightening and lower inflation does not bode well for the market," he added.
Nor does the heavy supply of new issues being offered. The Treasury said yesterday that in addition to selling $27.2 billion of three- and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction, it would sell $17.25 billion in new two- and five-year notes on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, because the week will be shortened by the Thanksgiving holiday.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's sales, dealers are offering the notes at prices to yield 7.22 percent for the two-year note, and 7.75 percent for the five-year issue.
Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist for NatWest Securities, who said he was a bear before it was fashionable in this cycle, said the timing might be good for bonds from technical and fundamental standpoints.
"Investors are so busy being bearish that they do not see the signs of a slowing economy," Mr. Canelo said. Among those signs, he said, has been the performance of the stock market, the best leading indicator of the economy.
"In past rate hikes, stocks have rallied because it meant that the economy was getting stronger and that was good for business," he said. "But this time, there was a muted response to the interest-rate hike, suggesting that the previous rate increases are beginning to take effect."
Mr. Canelo noted, for example, that the yield curve was flattening, which historically has come as the economy has begun to show signs of slowing.
Among the other symptoms of the cooling economy, Mr. Canelo said, are a slowing of money growth, a slower pace of job creation, a fall in consumer confidence for five months, a fall in business formation for six months and flat help wanted advertising since midyear.
"What's most dramatic is that the slowdown is here, and nobody is noticing it," he said.
In the municipal market, bond prices fell amid a lack of investor demand, as states, cities and agencies sold $1.8 billion of new securities, the most new issues in more than a month.
But investors showed strong demand for issues with high credit ratings. The New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation, one of the few issuers in the state with a triple-A credit rating, sold $261 million of water pollution control revolving fund revenue bonds in a negotiated offering managed by Bear, Stearns & Company.
Investors' demand was strong enough that some yields were lowered five basis points in several maturities. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The issues were priced to yield as much as 6.90 percent for one due in 2015.
Of the $1.08 billion of debt sold in the corporate market, the Household Finance Corporation sold $687 million of floating-rate notes backed by home equity loans in two parts, through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Some creative ways Republicans could deliver on the contract.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
FASTER than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, the new Congressional Republican majority is about to sweep away despised taxes, smash the pork barrel and balance the budget, all while leaping tall buildings in a single bound.
That, at least, is the promise of Newt Gingrich, Richard Armey, Phil Gramm and other "new" Republicans who have taken the election as a mandate for a conservative revolution. The real question is how far they are willing to go -- or can go -- to push an agenda that promises everything without explaining how it could be delivered. While numerous variations are possible, two core strategies seem most plausible. 
 Fudge the Numbers. The biggest obstacle to adoption of the fiscal provisions in Mr. Gingrich's "Contract with America" is the budget process.
Under reforms adopted in the 1980's, the estimated revenues and expenditures in the budget delivered to the White House must fit within the deficit targets. Van Doorn Ooms, a former House Budget Committee economist who now works for the private Committee for Economic Development, says "that somebody would have to come up with the budget cuts" to match the revenue losses in the contract. Republicans estimate those losses at $200 billion over five years.
One solution is to take a creative look at the numbers, applying what supply-siders call "dynamic scoring" to tax cuts. After all, only the Great Bean Counter in the Sky knows for sure whether capital gains breaks will lead to a blitz of productivity-inducing innovation.
By law, however, the estimates are made by the Congressional Budget Office using numbers provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. And both agencies are now dominated by sticks-in-the-mud inclined to equate dynamic scoring with the sort of smoke-and-mirrors accounting that got a lot of savings and loans in trouble.
That may not stand in the way. Rudolph Penner of Peat Marwick ran the Congressional Budget Office in the 1980's. He says a Republican majority could pack the budget office and the tax committee staff with allies, thereby giving a Republican budget the benefit of every doubt.
As a complement, suggests Stanley Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the Republicans might try "government on automatic pilot." They could cope with deficit nitpickers by writing legislation that would proportionately reduce social entitlement spending (other than Social Security) if the supply-side tax cuts failed to yield the expected bonanza.
If such legislation made it to the White House without the entitlement safety valve, President Clinton would face some unpleasant choices. He could veto the budget, risking blame for denying Americans all those painless tax breaks. From a purely partisan Republican perspective, this would be ideal. But while Mr. Clinton has on occasion risked the high road, it is hard to believe he would this time around.
Hence Mr. Collender speculates that the President would sign a supply-siders' budget, but counter it with a gambit. He would announce that as the budget law required he would sequester above-budget spending on entitlement programs unless Congress acted first. The idea, of course, would be to do what no Democrat has done before -- to pass the deficit buck to the Republicans.
There are some problems with this course. For one thing, Mr. Penner argues, it is far from clear that a majority of Republicans would go along with a supply-siders' putsch in the tax committee and the budget office. For another, Mr. Collender points out, "the bond market would go nuts" at the prospect of a flirtation with deja voodoo economics. Last but hardly least, it constitutes the sort of high-stakes political poker that is rarely played to the finish. So what's Mr. Gingrich's alternative?
Win a Few Easy Ones and Declare Victory. A balanced budget amendment -- even one that does not bite until the politicians responsible for passing it are long gone -- would surely be popular in talk-radio land. The Republicans could take the credit even if the President goes along. And if he opposes it, so much the better. Another idea is welfare reform that would cut total appropriations and leave it to the states to apportion the pain. This has the disadvantage of irritating Republican governors in the trenches and perhaps creating a few martyrs among the worthy poor. On the other hand, it would free a little cash to pay for a tax cut -- especially one designed to make maximum political waves with minimum immediate impact.
Consider the possibilities: individual retirement accounts with no tax deferral for contributions but no taxes on the payout, most of which would not occur until decades from now. Or what about child tax credits that are phased in over a decade or "neutral cost recovery" depreciation rules for business investment that would initially generate extra revenue but reduce taxes by tens of billions by the turn of the century. And there's plenty more where that came from.

HEADLINE: Offer Made At Gypsum Concern

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
The National Gypsum Company's chairman, C. D. Spangler Jr., offered yesterday to buy the company for $940 million, or $43.50 a share. But analysts ridiculed the price as far too low, and investors bid up the shares $12.0625, to $44.8125, in Nasdaq trading.
That price, however, represented a sharp increase from the $12.50 a share at which National Gypsum was valued 16 months ago, when the company emerged from bankruptcy protection. At that time, the senior creditors and the company's management, since replaced, told other creditors, including asbestos claimants, that the company was not worth a penny more. 
 National Gypsum, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., is the nation's second-largest maker of gypsum-coated wallboard, which is used mostly in houses. It credits its improved stock price to a rebound in the market for wallboard, as housing demand expands and industry overcapacity vanishes.
"It stems from a general improvement in the economy," a spokesman for the company, Alan V. Cecil, said.
The senior creditors, who ended up with most of the stock when the company emerged from bankruptcy, have now multiplied the value of their investments. The holders of $537 million in the most junior debt have less than 15 cents on the dollar.
The junior creditors said yesterday that the offer of $43.50 a share proved that investment bankers and former managers had underestimated the company's value.
"You can't imagine how it pains me every time I have to look back at this case," said Wilbur L. Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., who advised the junior creditors. Though a court approved the $12.50 share value, he noted that the company had improved its earnings by raising prices and cutting costs only after emerging from bankruptcy.
Mr. Spangler, a large North Carolina investor, began buying shares of National Gypsum a year ago and now holds a stake of 19 percent. In a letter to the company's board, he pointed out that he was offering a premium of 32.8 percent over Tuesday's closing price of $32.75.
But analysts sharply criticized his bid. Barbara Allen of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette called the $43.50 offer "mystifying and troubling."
"We will sell at $80," she said.
Last year, investment bankers at that firm, advising National Gypsum's former executives, vouched for a value of $12.50 a share.
Another dispute from the bankruptcy case could block the deal. The trustees for a $700 million fund to pay off asbestos-injury claims against National Gypsum have said recently that the fund might run more than $1 billion short, and that they may have to go to the company for more money.
In making his offer by letter yesterday, Mr. Spangler said the asbestos matters must be resolved to his satisfaction. The board plans to consider his offer soon and see if rival bidders emerge. Analysts said they feared that Mr. Spangler and LaFarge Coppee, a French cement company that holds 9.9 percent of National Gypsum and has pledged to vote with Mr. Spangler, could force the company to accept.
"I think it's a much better stock as a public company than as a buyout," said David Dwyer of Kidder, Peabody & Company. In view of the rising demand for wallboard and higher prices, the directors should accept no offer below $55, he said.
Mr. Spangler, who formally made his offer through the Delcor unit of Golden Eagle Industries, apparently his investment vehicle, declined to comment. His two main partners in the deal are Nationsbank and First Union, normally fierce rivals in North Carolina banking.
In his letter, he noted his disappointment with the decline in National Gypsum's stock price in the last eight months from a high of $52.75 in mid-March, which analysts attributed to fears that rising interest rates would choke off home building.
Mr. Spangler is one the largest shareholders of Nationsbank, with eight million shares. He is also president of the University of North Carolina system.
The banks' partnership -- "unprecedented," said W. Barnes Hauptfuhrer, a First Union investment banker -- reflects Mr. Spangler's influence in North Carolina. The banks have each agreed to put up $134.1 million for stock in the acquired company and as much as $187.5 million in loans. Mr. Spangler would contribute his own shares, valued at $168.4 million at the acquisition price, and a further $150 million.

HEADLINE: No Plans for Soon-to-Be Former Governor

 BODY:
It has come to this for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
"Governor Jim Florio called me yesterday," Mr. Cuomo explained to a radio interviewer yesterday about a call on Tuesday. "He says, 'So Mario, what's to be, here?' I said I think finally I'm going to have a legacy. Jan. 1, I don't have a place to live. I don't have a job. I'm going to be the first homeless, unemployed, former 12-year governor in the history of the state. By Jan. 9, I can picture myself all huddled, freezing on a cold pavement, you know, chilling my tush, telling some guy with a seven-day growth of beard, 'I don't want to go to your lousy shelter.' " 
 Mr. Cuomo was joking, of course. But eight days after his defeat by Governor-elect George E. Pataki, Mr. Cuomo still has not announced where he will live or how he will earn a living once he leaves office.
In the 30-minute interview on WAMC-FM radio in Albany, Mr. Cuomo also predicted that Mr. Pataki would have to break his campaign pledge to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years. "I would not give up on the possibility that the next Governor would come to see things a little bit differently in the course of being Governor," he said. "For example, I don't think it's realistic to believe that he can do the tax cut he said he would do in the campaign. That's not in the cards."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Thomson Will Buy Medstat for $339 Million

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Thomson Corporation, a Canadian company whose media empire includes The Globe and Mail in Toronto and American Banker, said yesterday that it would acquire a medical data provider for $339 million in cash.
Thomson will pay $27 a share for the Medstat Group of Ann Arbor, Mich., a developer of health care information data bases and related software. 
 Medstat, which will retain its current headquarters and management team, sells its products and services to both health care providers and payers, including hospitals, health maintenance organizations, insurers and self-insured corporations. The data are used to analyze insurance claims and costs.
The offering price is 57 percent higher than Medstat's closing stock price of $17.25 on Tuesday. Yesterday, shares of Medstat jumped $9.25, to $26.50, in heavy Nasdaq trading.
The deal reflects a growing interest in health care information providers. Earlier this year, Dun & Bradstreet and the Electronic Data Systems unit of the General Motors Corporation announced a joint venture in health care information services, and other large information providers like Equifax and McGraw-Hill have also expressed interest, said Jason Rosenbluth, an analyst with Volpe, Welty & Company.
"It's a huge perceived market, but not a huge market in terms of dollars right now," Mr. Rosenbluth said. "It's at an embryonic stage."
Thomson already has a presence in health care, with its Medical Economics Publishing and Medical Economics Data units.
Yesterday's deal would give Medstat more critical mass and improved distribution in a consolidating health care market, analysts said. Medstat's data bases would complement Thomson's products.
"For Medstat, this deal adds some clout," said Dirk Godsey, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. "Medstat lacked a big sales force with a position in the physician market. Thomson has the distribution channel but is constantly in the hunt for content; what Medstat represents is content."
Shares of Thomson were unchanged at $16.125 (Canadian), on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday.
The acquisition is the second announced by Thomson in the last three weeks. On Oct. 31 Thomson paid $465 million to acquire the Ziff Communications Company's electronic data base unit.
After announcing the purchase of Ziff's Information Access unit, the chief financial officer of Thomson, Nigel R. Harrison, said the company was considering other acquisitions.
For the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, Medstat had earnings of $7.4 million, up 45 percent from $5.1 million in the corresponding period last year. The company has about 500 employees, with offices spread across the United States, partly as a result of a series of acquisitions in the last few years.
"The strategic fit between the Medstat Group and the medically focused companies of Thomson offer real long-term potential to more broadly share information," Medstat's vice president of marketing, Vi Shaffer, said. "We wanted to align with a strong partner that shared our culture."

Exxon Leads Signers Of Indonesia Gas Deal

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation and Pertamina, Indonesia's national oil company, have agreed to develop one of the largest offshore natural gas deposits in the world.
The project, which Exxon says will eventually require as much as $40 billion in investment, was announced here today as President Clinton turned to business issues on his last day in Indonesia, after the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here. 
 With Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown presiding and members of the Indonesian Cabinet looking on, agreements were signed for a total of 17 projects involving United States companies. They ranged from construction of a 1.2-megawatt coal-fired power plant to the sale of aquatic weed harvesters to help clean Indonesia's waterways.
The Commerce Department put the value of all the American deals at $40 billion -- appraising the cost of the natural gas agreement at $35 billion, as much as $5 billion Exxon officials' estimate.
Mr. Clinton referred to the agreements in a speech to American and Asian businessmen here, as he reaffirmed his Administration's willingness to help United States companies land contracts throughout the world.
"I know that there is increasing wealth in Indonesia and throughout Asia, but where I come from $40 billion is still real money -- and we're grateful for the business," the President said.
Fritz Voigt, Exxon's vice president for gas, said at a news conference in Houston that it was too early to forecast how much the gas project would add to Exxon's earnings and revenue figures. He said that the project would not come on stream for eight years and that the terms of the sales contracts for the gas had not been fixed.
[In New York, Exxon's stock closed Wednesday at 60.625, up 75 cents for the day.]
The huge natural gas field, which was discovered in 1973, lies 140 miles northeast of Natuna, an Indonesian island about 700 miles north of Jakarta, the capital.
As Exxon officials described the project's complexity, huge steel platforms some as high as 60 stories, must be built offshore to extract the gas from the field, which lies 470 feet underwater.
The gas will travel by pipeline to a liquefied natural gas plant that will also be built on Natuna, an island 40 miles long and 28 miles wide. A marine terminal will be constructed on the island for supertankers that will transport the gas to markets like Japan and Korea, several thousand miles away.
Other American companies are expected to bid for some of the work.
Exxon Exploration, Exxon's local affiliate, and Pertamina expect to sell the liquefied gas almost exclusively in Asia. They are betting that major customers will be willing to sign long-term contracts at high enough prices to justify the huge investment, in which the first payoff will not be seen until 2002.
None of the gas is likely to be exported to the United States, Mr. Voigt said, because of the distances involved.
He added that he expected demand for gas in the Far East to double by the end of the century.
Once deliveries of liquefied gas start, it could help power the continuing growth of many Asian countries that are planning to build huge gas-burning power plants.
Among the other deals signed today, General Electric, Fluor Daniel, Combustion Engineering and Mission Energy were given contracts for various aspects of the construction of the 1.2-megawatt power plant, in which total American involvement will exceed $1 billion. California Energy said it would develop a geothermal energy project and Hughes Network Systems received a contract for wireless phone systems.
To some businessmen here, the salesmanship by the President and his Cabinet will yield far more tangible benefits than the vague declaration to create a free trading area by the year 2020 that was issued on Tuesday by the 18 nations that make up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC.
"APEC is very strong on atmospherics and very low on take-home value," said Harvey Goldstein, chairman of Harvest International, a consulting firm here. "But the relationship is important. When the President visits Indonesia, it provides leverage for American business."
Many of the contracts signed today would have been reached in any case. Asked what role the United States Government had in helping achieve the contract for the Natuna gas project, E. W. Young, a spokesman here for Exxon International, replied, "Fundamentally none."
Secretary Brown disagreed, saying that the Government pushed for Exxon during the years that it took to negotiate the complex contract. He said Mr. Clinton's visit provided an incentive for Indonesian companies to conclude the agreements.
"A lot of business people were worried that if they didn't get done today, there would be no deal," Mr. Brown said in an interview. "Many of the deals would get done anyway, but how long would they take? In many cases we have driven the completion."

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Barely Rose Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices barely budged in October, the Government said today, offering more evidence that inflation remains largely in check, despite signs of strong economic growth.
The Consumer Price Index rose one-tenth of a percent last month, following September's gain of two-tenths of a percent. The report followed by a day the decision by the Federal Reserve to make the largest interest rate increase in 14 years in an effort to fight inflation. The central bank raised key short-term interest rates on Tuesday by three-quarters of a percentage point -- its sixth increase this year. 
 Last month's overall gain in the price index was the smallest since prices posted a similar rise in April, despite higher October prices for health care and new cars.
A drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent in energy prices last month helped hold down the overall index. Food prices, which remained unchanged, also tempered the general advance. In September, energy prices also fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, while food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
The so-called core rate of inflaiton, which factors out the often volatile food and energy segments, showed a rise of two-tenths of a percent.
Economists stressed that the Fed's attempt to curb inflation was a pre-emptive strike. By taking some of the sizzle out of the recovery now, some say, the Fed will probably prolong the economy's ability to grow at a steady clip.
If Fed officials did not act now, "at some point they'd be forced to come in and slam on the brakes," James Glassman, senior economist at Chemical Securities, said. "That's what creates havoc. That's what triggers a recession."
Other data released by the Government suggested that the economy could strengthen further.
Americans' average weekly paychecks jumped 1.5 percent in October. The increase was the largest since a 2.3 percent gain in February 1982, the Labor Department said. In September, earnings showed a rise of seven-tenths of a percent.
The Commerce Department said inventories held by American businesses rose in September for a sixth straight month as businesses stocked goods for the holiday season.
Total business inventories increased five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $907.2 billion -- well above Wall Street economists' expectations of a rise of one-tenth of a percent -- following a gain of nine-tenths of a percent in August. Most of the inventory increase occurred at the retail level.
But business sales, which surged 3.3 percent in August, declined for the first time since July, dipping two-tenths of a percent in September. As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.40, from a record low of 1.39 in August. The September figure means that it would take 1.40 months to exhaust stockpiles at the September sales rate.
The consumer price figures showed inflation rising at a pace that was slightly slower than forecast. Economists on average had predicted that consumer prices rose two-tenths of a percent last month. Excluding food and energy, they expected prices to rise three-tenths of a percent.
"The recent data suggest that the Fed may indeed be ahead of the curve in its fight against inflation," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

G.O.P.'s Tax Cut Theory: Bonanza or Bust?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
With a conviction that approaches religious fervor, many Republicans hold that certain kinds of tax cuts would significantly strengthen the economy. People and companies would earn more money as a consequence, they say. And the taxes paid on that additional income would offset the revenue lost from the lower tax rates, completely or at least in part.
In the budget lexicon, this is what is called dynamic scoring. 
 But the practice is heretical to the members of the revenue-estimating fraternity in both parties who for years have been in charge of trying to figure out what the consequences would be of various proposals to raise or lower taxes.
Dynamic scoring is suddenly an issue because the Republicans, who won control of the House and the Senate in this year's elections, are determined to enact a spate of tax cuts, including tax credits for middle-income families and a lower capital gains tax rate. Under the current budget law, each tax cut must be offset, dollar for dollar, by an increase in other taxes or a spending reduction. So what the estimators say about the revenue effect of a tax proposal is crucial.
Over the years the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget and the staffs of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Congressional Budget Office have followed a forecasting system called static scoring to figure the potential effects of tax policy changes.
Under this system, estimators try to predict how individual taxpayers would change their behavior as a consequence of policy changes. For example, they try to figure how much cigarette sales would drop because of a higher tax on cigarettes. But they do not take into account the potential macroeconomic effect of tax changes, which means the effect on the nation's economy.
They assume the overall economy, and thus the number of jobs created and the level of interest rates and the size of the gross domestic product, will remain static.
Now, with Republicans running Congress, the budget fraternity may be confronted with dynamic scoring the way Pope Leo X had to face Martin Luther.
What worries many politicians and economists is that the Republicans will use dynamic estimates to show that their tax cuts would not cost the Government any money, or at least would not lose as much revenue as is shown by conventional forecasting. That theory is more or less what was followed in the early 1980's, when supply-side economics was in vogue during the Reagan Administration and the deficit soared.
Alice M. Rivlin, President Clinton's budget director, told reporters this week: "Tax cuts must be paid for. Tax cuts without spending cuts would increase the budget deficit and would be an irresponsible thing to do."
Republicans insist that they do intend to make spending cuts, though they have yet to identify which particular ones they have in mind. If the new Republican staff directors of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation adopt the dynamic method of calculation, fewer spending reductions may be necessary to meet the requirements of the budget law.
If such calculations prove accurate in the years ahead, it could be a bonanza for Americans. Not only would their taxes be lower, but they would also have to give up fewer Government benefits.
But if dynamic calculations prove wrong, serious consequences could result. Budget deficits could be higher than expected, scaring financial markets and leaving Americans worse off.
In the case of one of the top items on the Republican wish list -- a lower capital gains tax -- the use of dynamic scoring would make a substantial difference and the debate over the difference has been going on since the Reagan Administration.
The Republican staff of the House Budget Committee, using conventional calculations, found that over a five-year period the Treasury would lose $56 billion in revenue from a capital gains tax cut.
On the other hand, Gary and Aldona Robbins, economic consultants in Arlington, Va., whose work is closely followed by many Republicans, assessed a similar bill using a computer model that factors in their view of how the overall economy would respond. This showed that the capital gains tax reduction would increase growth by four-tenths of 1 percent each year and that Government revenues would grow by $126 billion by the turn of the century.
In other words, a cut in capital gains taxes would not only require no offsetting spending reduction but could also be used under the budget law to pay for other tax cuts.
But Robert S. McIntyre, director of the Citizens for Tax Justice, a research center that works closely with Democrats, studied the same data and concluded that to the extent changes in the capital gains tax had moved the overall economy at all, the effect had been detrimental.
The problem is that the strength or weakness of America's $5 trillion economy is the result of many factors. Opinions differ over how much weight to give the size of the tax on capital gains, or any other factor.
That is why conventional economic wisdom says that the macroeconomic effects of tax changes should not be taken into account in budget calculations. "It's the safest approach," said Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm. "What's most important is to do it in a way that won't make things much worse if you're wrong."
But Norman B. Ture, a tax policy official in the Reagan Administration who is now president of a research center called the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, argues that it makes no sense to ignore reality.
"The only thing you can say for sure about static revenue estimates," he said, "is that they are certainly wrong. You know that tax changes have some effect. Why not work to find a way to make estimates that at least are less wrong?"

After a 55-year absence, Maxwell House coffee embraces the Times Square market again.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MORE than five decades after advertising for Maxwell House last overlooked Times Square, the coffee brand will drop back into the neighborhood.
General Foods USA, which markets Maxwell House, plans to unveil an extravagant neon billboard -- the type that makers of outdoor signs call spectaculars -- on New Year's Eve, during the hullabaloo greeting the arrival of 1995. The ad will join others on the exterior of the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway; it will be erected on the building's 46th Street side, around the corner from gaudy, glitzy billboards for Eastman Kodak and Hertz. 
 Maxwell House's second sign in Times Square, measuring 40 feet high by 60 feet wide, will echo the first, which according to company records stood from 1928 to 1939 about a block north of Duffy Square. The traditional touches include the brand's longtime slogan, "Good to the last drop."
The high-tech touches will include a translucent, three-dimensional coffee cup, 20 feet in diameter, and the rendering of Maxwell House's familiar final drip in a neon cascade to simulate an endless descent -- an eternal drop, as it were, ever falling, ever good.
The Maxwell House comeback is emblematic of the changing Times Square ad landscape. Improvements in the area's economic and physical health are helping to transform the lineup of marketers planting, or replanting, their brands' banners there.
During the 1970's and 1980's, when Times Square's bleak, shabby appearance discouraged visitors and residents alike, signs for American household-name products were supplanted by billboards promoting Japanese and Korean brands like Canon, Goldstar, JVC, Minolta, Samsung and Sony. They were lured by the international approbation for Times Square's image as the colorful "crossroads of the world," which still gleamed despite its dimming domestically.
But now, as the neighborhood's fortunes seem on the ascent, companies based in this country -- including Gap Inc., Hertz, Jockey, Kodak, Levi Strauss, NBC and Sara Lee -- are demonstrating a new, or renewed, willingness to associate themselves with Times Square.
Not only is Times Square "the heartbeat of New York," said Ann Marks, Maxwell House's vice president for marketing at the General Foods USA unit of Kraft General Foods in White Plains, "it's a national focal point."
And many of the brands whose signs are illuminating Times Square "are classic American brands," she added, "and that's what we consider Maxwell House." The coffee was introduced in 1892; it was New York's top-selling brand by 1925 and, Ms. Marks said, it still is (though nationally it is outsold by Folgers).
George Stonbely, president at Spectacolor, the New York company that specializes in spectaculars and is designing Maxwell House's, said: "The American companies see that the kind of presence they can have for their products and services in Times Square is unique. You can't get that tremendous size and impact on TV."
"It's no secret Times Square was really in the doldrums for many years," he added. "But starting with the Marriott Marquis in 1985, the area has gone through a boom. And the signs parallel the re-emergence of Times Square as a great entertainment center."
Spectacolor will lease and maintain the sign, which is being built by the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation in New York, the constructor of many spectaculars like the recently dismantled neon Joe Camel billboard for Camel cigarettes.
Neither Ms. Marks nor Mr. Stonbely would disclose the cost of the Maxwell House sign. But millions of dollars are required to build such a sign, lease the space under a multiyear contract, operate the sign and maintain it.
One difference between the old and new signs is that while the Maxwell House name and the "last drop" slogan will be back, the word "coffee" will be absent, perhaps on the premise that after 55 additional years of consumers' exposure to Maxwell House marketing, it would be redundant.
Plans for the spectacular's unveiling include a live radio broadcast, Ms. Marks said, reminiscent of the initial lighting of the first sign. That took place during a live broadcast of a radio program sponsored by Maxwell House and featured the brand's founder, Joel Cheek.
The plans also call for giving out free cups of Maxwell House to the New Year's Eve revelers, she added, in connection with a fund-raiser to assist the homeless and the charitable organization Habitat for Humanity.
For those who insist that Maxwell House is not their cup of coffee, the brand's sign won't be the only java jive in Times Square.
The Maxwell House spectacular will be across the street from a huge painted coffee cup that emits mock steam to promote the Eight O'Clock brand of bean coffee sold at supermarket chains including A.& P. That sign is on the southeast corner of 46th Street and Seventh Avenue.

HEADLINE: Mort Pye Is Retiring as Editor Of Star-Ledger after 31 Years

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

 BODY:
Mort Pye, editor of The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey's largest daily newspaper in circulation, will retire at the end of the year, the paper announced yesterday. He will be succeeded by James P. Willse, former editor and publisher of The Daily News.
Mr. Pye, 76, has had one of the longest runs in the nation as a top editor of a major daily newspaper, arriving in the newsroom at The Star-Ledger in 1957 as managing editor and holding the post of editor since 1963. 
 In his 37 years at The Star-Ledger, the paper went from a weak position behind the prestigious Newark Evening News -- which folded in the early 1970's -- to a far-reaching power in the New Jersey economic and political landscape. It is ranked as the 14th largest daily and the 12th largest Sunday paper in the nation, with circulation approximately 456,000 daily and about 686,000 on Sunday, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
Known for long work hours that rarely took him out of the newsroom and into public view, Mr. Pye said yesterday that age was finally overtaking his zest for the job.
"Next year I will be going into my 77th year, and I feel I no longer have the energy and stamina to continue operating the way I have in the past," he said in a statement. "Therefore, I have concluded it's in my best interest -- and the paper's -- for me to retire."
For Mr. Willse (pronounced WILL-zee), taking over the profitable and smooth-running Star-Ledger will be a sharp departure from his tenure at The Daily News, when the tabloid fought for survival in a series of changes of ownership, circulation declines, labor strife and revolving-door news staffs.
Donald E. Newhouse, the president of The Star-Ledger, called Mr. Willse "the ideal person to succeed Mort as editor of The Star-Ledger," adding, "He has the experience, the breadth of knowledge and the ability to work with people to continue and carry forward Mort's work."
Mr. Pye's wife, Florence, is a member of the Newhouse family, which owns The Star-Ledger.
Mr. Willse, 51, will be watched closely to see what changes he may envision for the New Jersey paper. It gives blanket coverage of sports, politics and statewide news, with 15 bureaus throughout New Jersey, though civic leaders in Newark have complained that it does not pay enough attention to the city.
"It's not a particularly exciting newspaper to read; the writing is still basic oatmeal," said John Kolesar, the former managing editor of The Camden Courier-Post.
Mr. Pye was sent from The Long Island Daily Press, another Newhouse paper, to Newark in 1957, when the city was still a prosperous business and manufacturing hub. At the time The Star-Ledger was regarded as a scandal sheet with a small staff and primitive production.
Over the years, he raised staff and circulation, built a new plant in Newark and, after a racial riot in 1967 set off white flight from the city, he pushed circulation far outside its traditional Essex County base.
He championed the arts and exerted the influence of the paper, at the same time working behind the scenes, in a long campaign for a sports complex in the Meadowlands. The complex eventually drew New York's two professional football teams across the Hudson. He also delighted in taking meandering weekend car trips around the state, checking out possible travel-page stories and circulation opportunities.
His name -- "Mort" to his staff -- and soft-spoken telephone voice were familiar in the state's power circles, but it was unlikely most readers of Mr. Pye's newspaper could name or identify its editor, such was the low profile he maintained over the decades out of the public eye.

HEADLINE: Thinking as the Fed Thinks

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
After yesterday's benign inflation report -- consumer prices edged up a minuscule one-tenth of a percent -- even more people were left scratching their heads over the Fed's big interest rate increase on Tuesday. What on earth, many asked, were Alan Greenspan, the moderate Republican who serves as Fed chairman, and Alan S. Blinder, the liberal Democrat who is vice chairman, thinking?
It is certainly true that there are few signs that inflation is a problem now. The broad measures of prices generally look quite reassuring. Producer prices, as well as the consumer prices that the Labor Department reported yesterday, have been rising slowly. [Page D6.] 
 Even taking into account last month's spurt in hourly earnings of production workers, wage gains are generally moderate. And productivity of the work force is growing a bit faster, on average, than it did during the 1970's and 80's.
But what the people at the Federal Reserve are worried about, many economists said yesterday, are a number of problems just below the surface that could lead to higher inflation sometime within the next year. That helps explain why the Fed decided to raise the two short-term interest rates it controls by an exceptionally strong three-quarters of a percentage point.
"Looking backwards, inflation is so well contained that it makes the Fed's move look extraordinarily aggressive," said Laurence H. Meyer, president of Laurence H. Meyer & Associates in St. Louis, who is neither a Wall Street economist nor a zero-inflation hawk. Still, he added, "I don't think it was crazy,"
Here's why. For starters, prices are not quite so well behaved as the Fed critics would like to believe. Commodity prices are rising rapidly and the crude-materials portion of the Producer Price Index, which fell five-tenths of a percent over all last month, has recently been heading higher. That is not always a sign that the price of finished goods bought by retailers will necessarily rise faster, but it often is.
Other data show factory capacity is becoming tight. At 85 percent, capacity use is a point or two beyond the 82 or 83 percent typically associated with rising inflation. If more people want to buy cars but the supply of cars is not rising apace, for example, prices tend to go up.
The most compelling cause for concern, many analysts believe, is that the economy is operating at full employment or maybe even past that point. Full employment does not mean everybody who wants a job necessarily finds one in a reasonable period of time. It simply means a rate below which inflationary pressures start to build.
That threshold, experience and studies suggest, may be about 6 percent, give or take a few tenths. Not only is unemployment now 5.8 percent, but growth is also sufficiently rapid to drive it down further.
"We're just a little bit on the other side of safety," Mr. Meyer said. "If you believe that full employment is 6 percent, and you understand the economy is growing 3.5 to 4 percent, then you can understand the Fed's action. They've got to slow the economy down to 2.5 percent growth or below."
Wait a minute, aren't we in a new economy? After all, there are more temporary workers, more flexible production, more foreign trade. All that, according to critics of the Fed, means that tighter labor markets do not necessarily translate into broad inflationary pressures.
The structure of the economy, however, does not change that quickly. Compared with the 1950's, 60's, even the 70's, there may have been big shifts. But as recently as 1988 or 1989, the unemployment rate was 5.3 percent (5.8 percent on today's measure). At that time, the rate of consumer and wage inflation was rising by a half to a full percentage point a year and commodity prices were climbing even more rapidly than today. That was certainly no rerun of the inflationary 1970's, but it was enough to set off alarm bells at the Fed and in the bond market.
In the late 1980's, most of the forces that were supposed to prevent inflation from breaking out were also present: military spending was shrinking, fiscal stimulus was absent, low-wage workers were having a hard time and big corporations were starting to eliminate layers of middle-management employees.
To be sure, freer trade and intense global competition are holding down price increases. But those factors were present in 1989 as well. Indeed, these days, import prices are rising more rapidly than domestic prices as a result of the weaker dollar.
Wall Street, of course, is always worrying about inflation. But on Main Street, the anti-inflation hawks in the financial markets seem out of touch with the real world.
Pressed by the bond market, the Fed appears to be excessively concerned about holding the line on inflation, according to a number of officials representing manufacturers and labor unions. Most working Americans might well prefer a little more inflation -- say 4 percent -- if that would mean unemployment could go as low as 5 percent.
The experience of the high-inflation years of the 1970's and early 80's, however, suggests that is impossible. Once unemployment drops below 6 percent or so, inflation does not just stabilize at a new, higher level, it keeps accelerating.
The Fed is also struggling to cope with the consequences of its previous actions. Even though the current state of the economy looks remarkably good -- with robust growth and low inflation -- there is plenty of evidence that the Fed is now making up for what it regards as mistakes it made earlier in the recovery. When the economy was slow to emerge from recession, the Fed pushed short-term interest rates below the rate of inflation and held them there for two years to give the economy an extra kick.
"They bought the story that pervaded the financial markets that we were on the brink of a double or triple dip and they eased excessively in response to those fears," said Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
The Fed kept policy expansive in 1992 and 1993 at the very moment, hindsight shows, when the economy was gathering steam. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing and autos were starting to recover. And the Fed's underestimation of the economy's strength continued well into this year as the central bank kept forecasting that its interest rate increases that began in February would slow the economy sharply and lead unemployment to level out above 6 percent.
In fact, the exact opposite seems to have happened. There is little evidence that the Fed's actions, at least those before Tuesday's big move, have done much to dampen the expansion. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, for example, shows that most upper-income households, after steadily scaling back plans to buy homes, cars, and appliances early this year, have regained most of their enthusiasm for shopping.
Led by Mr. Greenspan, the Fed's attempts to prevent an acceleration in inflation obviously carry risks, namely of a recession. That may be particularly true today because the central bank cannot necessarily rein in inflation as easily as it might have been able to if it had acted sooner.
Still, the potential benefit of keeping inflation low is a longer expansion. "This means this expansion could go on longer and means there is no reason for us to have a downturn in 1996 and 1997," said Wayne D. Angell, a former Fed governor who is now chief economist at Bear, Stearns.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Yields Some Ground Gained on Rate Increases

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar lost ground against most leading currencies yesterday and traders cited profit taking after Tuesday's strong gains.
Currency traders rushed to buy dollars on Tuesday after the the Federal Reserve's sharp increases in short-term interest rates reassured them that the Fed was committed to fighting inflation. Higher interest rates tend to bolster the value of a currency. 
 But the dollar's momentum faded yesterday as traders cashed in on the dollar's rise against the German mark and the Japanese yen in the last two weeks. A selloff in the United States bond market further undermined the dollar.
"The dollar kind of ran out of steam," said Robert White, senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank. "The bond market has not reacted as positively as some people had thought."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5506 marks from 1.5561 marks on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 98.34 yen from 98.69.
Peggy Reed, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York, said the interest rate increases on Tuesday showed "the aggressive nature of what the Fed is willing to do in order to prevent an inflation situation from taking hold."
But the Fed did not indicate on Tuesday that the rate move would be the last in a while, she said, which created uncertainty in the markets about whether inflationary pressures had eased sufficiently to forestall additional increases in the coming months. Inflation erodes the value of American bonds and stocks held by foreign investors, thus discouraging the demand for dollars to buy such assets.
While the dollar weakened against most European currencies, it strengthened somewhat against the British pound after a report dampened expectations of an increase in interest rates.
The British Government reported yesterday that its chief inflation index rose by one-tenth of 1 percent in October from September, pushing the annual inflation rate up to 2.4 percent -- its lowest level since 1991. The pound has been stronger since the Bank of England last raised interest rates in September.
In New York, the pound slipped to $1.5723 from $1.5725. The dollar fell to 1.3045 Swiss francs, from 1.3095 francs on Tuesday.

Traders Can't Shuffle Their Decks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 16

 BODY:
A group of high-profile men gathered here this week to try to plot their separate courses for next year, but a large amount of their attention has been focused, figuratively at least, on coming events in Washington. They're not politicians but general managers of major league baseball teams.
"Right now there's so much that people don't know," Terry Ryan of the Minnesota Twins said. "You don't know what route you're headed. I'm sure we will not be getting the answers here. The people working in Washington with Mr. Usery will tell us." 
 Ryan, one of five rookie general managers at the annual meetings, referred to the negotiations that will resume Thursday in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Va. As the first order of business, under the watchful eye of Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, the owners' bargaining team is supposed to give the players' labor representatives a new proposal.
Although they won't send their coveted salary-cap plan into oblivion, leaving it instead on a corner of the bargaining table, the owners will present the players with an alternative proposal, this one outlining a luxury tax on payrolls that soar above a certain level.
It's another method of trying to control salaries, which is the owners' stated aim, and the players, after studying the figures for a couple of days, are expected to react to it the way they have to the cap they want no part of.
The general managers, of course, want to know what kind of economic system they will be working under, whether they will have limits on their payrolls or have to pay the tax assessor. But they also are eager to learn which players may be eligible for free agency and whether they will have to endure salary arbitration early next year. The existence of arbitration could affect their thinking on tendering contracts to some players by the Dec. 20 deadline.
Agreement or not, they should have their answers by a month from now. That's about the time the owners, if there is no agreement, are expected to declare an impasse in negotiations and impose their own rules in place of those in the expired collective bargaining agreement.
Until one or the other happens, though, the general managers forge ahead in whacking their way through an uncharted thicket.
"We're kind of treading water till this new system is in place," Dan Duquette of the Boston Red Sox said. "Most general managers are waiting to see what the new agreement will mean."
"We're all walking on eggshells," John Schuerholz of the Atlanta Braves said.
"Coming in as a new general manager," added Doug Melvin of the Texas Rangers, another of the rookies, "you want to be aggressive, but now you have to be a little cautious. Without knowing the system, it's a lot tougher than normal."
The absence of rules, however, never could inhibit general managers from talking trades; they talk trades whatever the circumstances, whatever the location. They haven't made any, but these meetings generally have been more about talk than action.
"I thought it would slow down the conversation, but I don't detect that," Bob Quinn of the San Francisco Giants said, after the morning business sessions broke up today. "Everybody is operating under a speculative mode and making their plans accordingly. We're still talking trade. Much of it depends on the service time of the players involved, but basically it's been business as usual, only on a more speculative basis."
Walt Jocketty, the St. Louis Cardinals' rookie, noted that the only safe trade to make right now would be the swap of a signed player for a signed player. "You have to be careful," he said. "You could lose someone."
He referred to the possibility that a new system could create a new class of free agents. In their June 14 proposal, the only one they have made, the owners said that players with four and five years of major league service could become free agents. The existing eligibility requirement is six years.

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY;
Playing the Numbers Game, Ownership Style

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
In an extraordinary group rant yesterday morning, the National Hockey League's assembled general managers expressed the usual arguments in unusually strident tones. They used sarcasm and anger to convey their frustration with the players union and portions of the news media who are skeptical when the 26 teams say they lost a total of $37.6 million last season.
Only a radically altered collective bargaining agreement, with restrictions on wages, can save the remainder of the already-damaged season and the future of the business, they said. Soon, they may hold their collective breath until they turn blue, or they may huff and puff and blow the league down. 
 They pleaded their case to the news media and told reporters to believe them on faith. They said they were insulted when asked to provide public documentation for their claims. Their numbers are none of your business, they said, although they use them to justify a 47-day lockout that has already wiped out at least a quarter of the season.
Glen Sather of the Edmonton Oilers said that Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the union, is "calling us all liars.
"I don't think Mr. Goodenow has really been negotiating in good faith," Sather said. "I think he wants to force us into a situation where we can't have hockey this year."
Would it bolster management's case, Sather was asked, if the league makes its finances public?
"As far as I'm concerned, yes, I'd like to make everything public so that we can get this thing over with," Sather said. "You imply these numbers aren't real. That's the same story I get from the players."
He said lying about finances can cause legal trouble.
"You think I want to go to jail?" Sather said. "We've already got one guy who's in this league going to jail." He was referring to Bruce McNall of the Los Angeles Kings, who this week was charged with financial felonies.
Sather then amended his intentions on disclosure. "I wouldn't want to make the numbers of our team public to all you guys," he told the assembled reporters. And Lou Lamoriello of the Devils said he would keep his ledgers private, too.
"Quite frankly, I don't think it's any of your business," Lamoriello said. "I don't want my books out there." Lamoriello also said, "If you think we don't want to be playing hockey, something's wrong with you."
Many executives, especially Harry Sinden of Boston, said repeatedly that the league has leveled with the union on finances. But John McCambridge, a lawyer for the union, said this isn't exactly true.
"They have given us compiled revenues, but no profit and losses statements, no expenses and no idea of which teams are losing or making money except for the Rangers," he said. "They told us the Rangers didn't make money last year when they won the Stanley Cup. No one believes that."
Ken Baumgartner, a vice president of the union, said that he was weary of "attempts to discredit Bob Goodenow" and that "if Bob is loathed that much, he must be doing a good job." Baumgartner noted that Alan Eagleson, who was ousted in favor of Goodenow and is under indictment on labor racketeering charges, appeared at the Hall of Fame ceremonies Tuesday in the company of Bill Wirtz, the powerful Chicago owner.
"What's wrong with this picture?" Baumgartner asked.
Back at the hotel, Sinden scoffed at the latest union proposal to restrict the contract rights of rookies, saying it's like giving a canoe to someone in a desert. Sinden also questioned the credentials of Marty McSorley, a union vice president who called the most recent player proposal a significant compromise.
"Marty McSorley, as far as I know, has been a player all his career," Sinden said. "Glen said McSorley started out these negotiations as an economist. He didn't realize McSorley was an economist. And I didn't realize he worked as a G.M. somewhere along the line."
Gary Bettman, the commissioner, said the specific figure on losses wasn't important. "Whether it's $37.6 million or 50 or 30, it's not as important as the over all health of this business," he said.
Bettman has proposed that an accounting firm audit the books and present its report to the players association. The union will soon counterpropose that an investment bank assess the same numbers.
When the conversation turned to player-sponsored exhibition tournaments, such as the three-night event in Hamilton, Ontario, last week, Bettman expressed skepticism over the announced attendance of more than 43,000.
"Despite the announced attendance, the building was half-full," Bettman said. When someone said "Gary, does that mean you don't trust union numbers?" Bettman smiled and replied: "That's what people tell me who were there. I would have announced what they announced also."

HEADLINE: The Children of Guantanamo

 BODY:
What a difference three months make. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, has been safely re-elected as Governor of Florida. Fidel Castro is again preventing his people from setting out in rafts, and a U.S.-occupied Haiti is no longer sending forth masses of terrified refugees. As a result, the refugee question has cooled as a political issue in Florida and the Clinton Administration is testing the waters for another refugee policy U-turn.
For 28 years Cuban refugees arriving in the U.S. were automatically admitted under a double standard that distinguished them from other people fleeing government oppression and economic collapse. But in August the Clinton Administration began intercepting Cubans at sea, taking them to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and proclaiming that they would never be admitted to the U.S. 
 Pressed by Cuban-American groups, Mr. Clinton is considering allowing Cuban families with children under 17 quarantined at Guantanamo to enter the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. That category includes close to a third of the 24,000 Cubans housed at the base.
Humanitarian treatment of refugees is in the best American tradition. But admitting the Cuban families would raise a serious issue of fairness. There are 230 Haitian children under 17 housed at the same Guantanamo base. Are their families not also entitled to humanitarian consideration?
One crucial difference, of course, is that a repressive Haitian government is no longer in power, while one is in Cuba. But under law, the Haitians at Guantanamo are in exactly the same situation as the Cubans. Both groups said they feared going home. They still say so. Washington refused to uphold or even properly hear their claims, because certifying those claims would have allowed them to come to the U.S. Instead it said: If you feel unsafe you may stay at Guantanamo, but you may not come to the U.S. Both groups have lawsuits opposing this policy. Mr. Clinton is ready to relax that rigidity for the Cubans but not the Haitians.
Under existing policy, Haitians and Cubans can voluntary agree to return home and apply for visas to the U.S. from there. In that case, the Cubans would have much better odds of getting admitted. Under the agreement reached between Washington and Havana in September that ended the flow of raft people, opportunities for Cubans to win legal admission to the U.S. were greatly expanded. Up to 26,000 Cubans will be allowed in next year.
Yet while many of the Haitians formerly housed at Guantanamo have voluntarily returned to Haiti since the military regime was ousted, very few Cubans have done so. The simplest, most humane solution would be a one-time admission of all Cuban and Haitian families now at Guantanamo. But it is also possible for the Administration to make a principled distinction between Haitians, who can now return to a much freer country than they left, and Cubans, who still cannot. However, the long history of the political and racial double standard applied to Cubans and Haitians puts a special burden on the Administration. If it makes a distinction now, it must convincingly show that it is following fair and objective standards -- that it is not simply reacting to the political power of Cuban-Americans, and the powerlessness of the Haitians.
The conditions now prevailing in Cuba and Haiti are obviously different. But the humanitarian issues raised by Cuban and Haitian children in Guantanamo are not.

HEADLINE: Misplaced Fears About the Fed

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision this week to raise interest rates in order to ward off inflation was, as expected, criticized from all corners. Manufacturers warned that higher interest rates would drive up costs and drive away consumers. Labor unions predicted layoffs. Politicians feared disgruntled voters.
The Fed, these critics argued, ought not to slow down the economy when inflation is low, seven million Americans cannot find jobs and tens of millions more cannot find work that pays good wages. Besides, they complained, driving up interest rates amounts to an unfair assault on vulnerable workers and an unseemly giveaway to rich bondholders. 
 Economic forecasting is primitive, so no one can prove the critics wrong. Perhaps the rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point -- the sixth rise this year and the largest in more than a decade -- is unnecessary. Worse, it may be unwise, possibly tipping the economy into recession about the time the 1996 Presidential campaign gets under way. But the Fed presumably took all these factors into account and, after carefully sifting the data, has settled on a prudent course.
One indication is the unanimous vote. The policy was approved even by Alan Blinder -- recent Clinton appointee, unapologetic liberal and self-proclaimed "inflation dove" who, as an academic, opposed tight monetary policies more often than almost all his colleagues. What Mr. Blinder and the other Fed members noted was that the economy grew more than 4 percent over the past year. That pace is well above the rate, 2.5 percent, that most economists believe the economy can sustain. The 2.5 figure comes from adding growth due to increases in the labor force (1.0 percent) to growth due to productivity gains (1.5 percent).
The Fed also noted that its five previous rate hikes have not slowed the economy very much. Even the automobile sector, which should react quickest to rate hikes, is still expanding. The economy is creating about 200,000 jobs a month, which exceeds the number of entrants into the labor force so that unemployment has steadily fallen.
Indeed, the economy is operating close to capacity. Factory output is at record levels. Further growth will not produce many more jobs but could generate more inflation. If the Fed were to sit back and wait for inflation to spurt, it would then have to clamp down hard. That is what it did in the early 1980's, triggering the worst recession since the Depression. Chairman Alan Greenspan is committed to imposing modest restraint now in order to ward off harsh restraints later.
The charge that Mr. Greenspan's policy is unfair is weaker still. True, higher rates will drive up the cost of car loans and home mortgages. But the impact on families will be less feared: many of them will profit from higher interest payments on bank savings accounts, retirement and pension funds. Nor is the rate hike undiluted good news for wealthy bondholders; bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
American workers, especially low-paid ones, are understandably restless and apprehensive. Their wages have stagnated for two decades. But the villain is not the Fed but weak productivity. The biggest threat to vulnerable families would be for the Fed to let inflation rise, victimizing pensioners and others living on fixed incomes, and then tackle it by throwing the economy into recession. Unemployment hits low-paid workers hardest.
That would be worse than unfair. It would be cruel. So far Fed policy has produced steady, if unspectacular, growth without a pickup in inflation. That is no small achievement. Indeed, the muted responses to the announcement by Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, and Laura Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, indicate that, as much as they hope for robust growth, they recognize that the Fed is proceeding responsibly.

HEADLINE: Let the Democrats Act More Like Democrats

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The 1994 Republican landslide occurred because a small group of swing voters voted more Republican than they usually do. To recover, the Democrats must deal not only with the anger of those voters, but with the apathy of the 10-times-larger group that didn't vote. 
 Both groups shared a common viewpoint: that government doesn't work. The nonvoters said, "Then why vote?" The swing voters said: "Then why pay for it? At least the Republicans will cut taxes."
To win back any percentage of either group, the Democrats must ignore the advice to act more like Republicans. Instead, they must act more like Democrats.
The Democrats should stop telling people that things are going well or are on the mend. They are not. Real personal income for all but the wealthy continues to fall. Corporate and government downsizing have turned job security into an oxymoron. United States manufacturing continues to head overseas. Center cities continue to decay. Health care remains in crisis. Racism and other forms of discrimination continue to threaten our society's fabric.
The Democrats should propose and fight for programs to address these issues, modifying or abandoning those that have failed. President Clinton talked about some of these during the Presidential election, but excepting health care, he made proposals on few of them.
The proposals should be simple, direct and not consensus-producing. For instance, the tax structure rewards companies that move overseas and encourages excessive downsizing, helping to put millions out of work. The very rich pay far too small a percentage of the tax burden; the middle class pays too much.
We cannot produce a consensus on changing these things, but we can produce a broad movement behind proposals that address inequities if we keep them simple, don't back off or pretend they're good for all.
The Democrats should be unified in support of their proposals, as the Republicans were this year.
The Republican agenda fails to address the fundamental problems in the lives of average people. While there may be temporary tax or short-term economic changes, the long-term trends of deindustrialization, center-city collapse and increasing disparity between the rich and everyone else will continue.
Unless the Democrats fight for the changes people need, the swing voters and nonvoters will continue to believe that government can't work and will continue to desert the Democrats.

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: TRADE;
New Status Puts Dole in Crosscurrents on GATT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The phone is ringing endlessly at Senator Bob Dole's offices in Kansas and on Capitol Hill, but not just with congratulations for his new status as majority-leader-in-waiting.
Barely nine days after he was swept to a victory even he did not predict, he is caught in the cross-currents as Republican party leader and nascent statesman, as potential Presidential candidate and as a free-trader with second thoughts about the popularity of free trade. 
 It is not a happy place to be, especially when the argument is over an international agreement that everyone says will have a vast but unknowable effect on the fate of the world economy and that is so staggeringly dense -- four volumes costing $145 at the Government Printing Office -- that no one knows anyone who has actually read it.
"I wouldn't want to be Bob Dole," said Jerry Junkins, the chief executive of Texas Instruments, who is the head of a business lobbying group, the Alliance for GATT Now, that is trying to push the wavering Senator to support the agreement, which would cover 123 nations.
"Boeing is big in Kansas, and so are the farmers," he said, ticking off others with longstanding ties to Senator Dole who stand to gain from the agreement. "But he must be thinking about other things as well," he suggested, things that include primaries in New Hampshire and Iowa that are only 18 months away.
The vote on the world trade agreement, which will be taken up by a lame-duck session of Congress after Thanksgiving, has suddenly become the crucial first test for Senator Dole, who is currently the Senate minority leader. He is trying to convince President Clinton that unlike Representative Newt Gingrich, who is soon to be Speaker of the House, he is interested in compromise. He is trying to look like a statesman.
At the same time, Mr. Dole is feeling the heat from the right wing of his party, which would happily hand Mr. Clinton an embarrassing international defeat. And he has to decide whether to side with the growing numbers in his party who, after five decades of unquestioned support for free trade, now join many Democrats in arguing that it is a code word for destroying middle-class jobs and surrendering American sovereignty to an ominous-sounding group of anonymous foreign judges called the World Trade Organization.
Faced with so much pressure from so many sides, Senator Dole has done what he usually accuses the White House of doing on foreign policy issues: He has waffled. He likes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he keeps saying, because it will force America's competitors to lower their tariffs, to stop government subsidies of companies that compete with American industry and to to extend copyright protection to including computer software, sound recordings and movies, all strong American exports.
But he has problems, he keeps saying without being too terribly specific, with many provisions in the legislation. This afternoon, as Senator Dole traveled in Minnesota on what his office called personal business, his staff was putting together a modest list of changes that, in the words of one negotiator in the process, "will give him a way to protect himself politically."
The White House concedes that without Mr. Dole, the trade agreement is dead. So, Administration officials, in the first taste of the next two years, went out of their way today to say that they were sure that whatever Mr. Dole wanted Mr. Dole would get.
"I'm fairly confident at this point," said Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, who is negotiating with Mr. Dole.
The main issue continues to be finding a way for Congress to monitor the new World Trade Organization on a sustained basis and maintaining the threat that the United States could pull out of the agreement if the new group of international arbiters repeatedly rules against American environmental or labor laws, or other regulations for imported goods.
"This is an agreement that goes back to the Reagan and Bush years, and it has never been a partisan issue for Senator Dole. I'm sure we can work through any problems he has."
But Mr. Dole's problems with the trade pact have less to do with the agreement than the polarizing issues that lie just beneath its surface. Many in the Republican Party say last week's election was a landslide because they finally won over white high-school educated males whose incomes have stagnated in the past decade. They are the workers most hurt by free trade rules that allow in greater foreign imports. And they are the ones who are least likely to move to the new industries -- in high technology and in service industries -- that the Administration believes will continue to be the cutting edge of America's export drive into world markets.
But GATT is overwhelmingly supported by Mr. Dole's core constituencies, the people who are likely to finance any Presidential bid. More than 250 agricultural groups have backed it, convinced that European and Japanese farmers will be hurt far more by the tariff reductions than they will. The aircraft industry, led by Boeing, has been the most vociferous in favor of the agreement, because it limits foreign governments from subsidizing their own aircraft industries.
Mr. Dole is left to conduct an elaborate dance, not wanting to be blamed for the doom of a 123-nation agreement, and not wanting to appear to turn his back on those suspicious that their incomes and jobs are being sacrificed by a set of free trade principles.
It is a particularly difficult two-step because support for the pact will place Mr. Dole and President Clinton on the same side of the free trade issue -- just as the President is trying to get maximum political mileage out of his arguments that Asia and Latin America will be the source of millions of new jobs for Americans. It is a theme the President hit this week in Indonesia and will again next month in Miami, at a summit of Latin American leaders.

HEADLINE: Russians Grouse (at U.S. Embassy)

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Russians are once again complaining about long lines, red tape and bone-chilling rudeness from petty bureaucrats.
Only now they maintain that such typical Soviet-era indignities are rampant in the consular section of the American Embassy. 
 Ordinary citizens, and even a few journalists and former dissidents who have sought tourist visas to the United States, are increasingly indignant over what they describe as rude and humiliating treatment by American consular officers. The United States Embassy retorts that 80 percent of all visa requests here are granted and that the complaints reflect the Russians' misunderstanding of American bureaucracy and immigration law.
But the conflict is also a reflection of the new kinds of cultural clashes that have surfaced now that the grand ideological divide between the former superpowers has narrowed. Russians, accustomed to being treated by American diplomats as cherished allies in the struggle against the Communist Government, are now shocked and offended to find themselves treated no differently from Mexicans, Filipinos or Irish.
But even many American residents -- and a few United States diplomats -- complain that the American Embassy in Moscow has failed to adapt to the post-Communist era, remaining in some ways as insular and bureaucratic now as it was when under siege from a Communist Government. Paradoxically, as Russian society grows more free-wheeling and open, the suburban-style red-brick fortress America in central Moscow seems all the more impregnable.
The latest incident occurred earlier this month, when Sergei A. Kovalyov, a former anti-Soviet dissident who now is chairman of the Russian Parliament's human rights committee, picketed the embassy to protest a friend's visa denial.
In an open letter in Izvestia to the American Ambassador, Thomas R. Pickering, Mr. Kovalyov said his friend, Georgi P. Grigorenko -- son of another well-known dissident, the late Pyotr G. Grigorenko -- was denied a visa to visit his dying stepmother because the consular officer thought he might immigrate.
"The Communist authorities did not allow Georgi to go to the States to his father's funeral," Mr. Kovalyov wrote. "Now the U.S. consular service is doing the same."
Embassy officials said he should have called the political section first, where officers would have been more likely to recognize his name, and would have intervened.
Mr. Kovalyov replied that he tried to reach the one political officer he knew, but was not put through. Finally he telephoned a well-connected friend in Washington, who called Clinton Administration officials. Mr. Grigorenko was issued a visa the next day.
"I spoke to two consular officers and neither had ever heard of Grigorenko," Mr. Kovalyov said. "It's like a Russian diplomat at our embassy in Washington not knowing Martin Luther King."
Mr. Kovalyov's outrage proved embarrassing to an embassy staff that believed the visa controversy had been finally put to rest. This summer, the issue had reached a boiling point after a journalist, Yevgeniya Albats, wrote an article in Izvestia about the "humiliating" and "insulting" treatment she received when seeking a visa to the United States. "It was like being in a Soviet store in the middle of the 80's," she wrote.
The article caused such a stir that the Ambassador wrote a letter to Izvestia rebutting the article and explaining the consular section's constraints, which include having to interview as many as 500 applicants a day. But privately, embassy officials were dismissive about the accusations of uncouth behavior. One high-ranking diplomat said scornfully, "The Russians should know; they are connoisseurs of rudeness."
Most employees are housed in a red-brick embassy compound of condo-style apartments. The compound has its own basketball court, video store, bar, gym, football field, barbecue pits, post office and grocery store -- a kind of suburban American biosphere. Residents can easily avoid contact with Russian society, and many do.
The staff is large, with several new departments like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Agency for International Development, but it is difficult to gauge how much it has grown over the last five years. The embassy personnel office was unable to supply the total number of employees.
All officials declined to be identified by name, because, they said, on-the-record interviews must first be cleared in Washington, a process that can take days and sometimes weeks.
Embassy officials said that their employees are exhausted and overworked, and that much time is tied up receiving Congressional and State Department delegations. Most employees keep 9 to 6 hours, and unlike the British and Finnish Embassies, the American Embassy closes for Russian holidays as well as American ones.
And while officials denied any discourteous behavior, in the aftermath of the criticism, the number of consular officers on duty was increased from three to six. An express line was also created.
The friction is partly a result of the inevitable antagonism between civilian petitioners and Government bureaucrats; there is rarely much joie de vivre in a motor vehicle registration line. But there are also peculiarly Russian-American misunderstandings. Many Russians complain that they are asked to state their income out loud. Ms. Albats wrote that such a question in Russia was as "indecent as in the States asking a stranger what kind of sex he prefers."
A 58-year-old employee of the Academy of Sciences, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used, said she was asked her income by a consular officer who was impatient, rude and never looked up from her desk. "We were used to that style in Soviet days," she said, "but we don't want to see it from America."
Russians often believe that a letter of invitation is the key prerequisite for a visa, but Congress mandates that the State Department presume that all applicants are potential immigrants and screen for ties, such as property or family, that would prevent someone from staying on in the United States. Most visa interviews are disconcertingly brief, lasting four or five minutes at most.
"A two-minute interview is tough," one diplomat said. "but in Mexico City, people are lucky to get 15 seconds."
The ultranationalist politician Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who toured the United States recently, did not undergo the embassy's scrutiny. The decision to issue him a visa was so sensitive that it was handled in Washington.
When the Texas millionaire Robert S. Strauss became Ambassador in 1991, he opened his doors to American business people, giving them his ear and granting them access, for a fee, to the embassy gym and cafeteria. Since then Mr. Pickering, a former naval officer and a career diplomat, has sought to limit the access of non-embassy Americans. Sometimes, the measures can appear a touch churlish: This Halloween, for the first time, non-embassy children were banned from trick-or-treating on the compound.
Many Americans, particularly in Moscow's growing business community, are as aggrieved as Russians by an institution they consider their own.
"The embassy is behind the curve in making the transition from a political/defense focus to an economic focus," said Richard Conn, managing partner of the law firm Latham & Watkins. "They don't seem interested in helping business. Ironically, our embassy is one of the last vestiges of the Soviet bureaucracy."

HEADLINE: Bishops Assail Rule Hostile To Immigrants

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops urged today that greater emphasis be placed on Federal immigration policies rather than relying on punitive local measures like Proposition 187 in California, which denies illegal immigrants nonemergency medical, educational and social services.
In a statement issued on the final day of their annual fall meeting, the bishops said the taxpayer frustration that fueled passage of Proposition 187 established an intimidating tone that could foster "harassment of persons who may look or sound 'undocumented.' " What was needed, they said, was a rational discussion of Federal policies that regulate legal entry into the United States. 
 "In seeking to cure social and economic ills, this proposition strikes at the most vulnerable among us -- children, the sick and the needy -- without addressing the larger social and political causes for the problems, especially at the Federal level," said the statement issued by Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, who is president of the bishops' conference.
In contrast to their statement on immigration, the bishops seemed intent on avoiding even the perception of political partisanship regarding school prayer. Congressional Republicans have said they support passage of a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to prayer in public schools. Archbishop Keeler, who was recently designated a Cardinal, said he would have to see the wording of any such amendment before taking a position on it.
But he suggested that ways be found to teach "basic moral values" in public schools.
The bishops' statement on immigration echoed a theme sounded several times this week during the conference: government's responsibility to help the poor. But the bishops also sought to portray the church as willing to help at home in times of need, noting that the church was already the nation's largest provider of charitable services.
The bishops were intent on sending a clear message of their disappointment in the negative tone that has dominated the nation's immigration debate. But Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles said earlier in the week that since half the nation's illegal immigrants entered the United States on temporary visas, the Government should develop better tracking mechanisms to prevent these visitors from overstaying their visas.
The California measure was a harsh and ineffective response, the Cardinal said. He also said that the church was considering fighting the proposition by filing friend-of-the-court briefs in legal challenges.
"I think some of the individualism of the 1980's really stuck," he said. "What we lost in the country was a sense of the common good."
Responsibility to communities, especially youth and the poor, was a recurring concern this week as the bishops urged a "moral revolution" against violence in American society, affirmed their belief that health care was a basic right and cautioned against welfare reforms that would limit or deny people government-financed social services while expecting charities to extend their care of the needy.
Focusing on a major source of that care, the bishops today also issued a revised set of directives to provide moral guidance to Catholic hospitals in an age of new technologies, increased demand and institutional partnerships.
The directives, which took six years to complete, reaffirm and clarify church teachings on topics like life-sustaining measures, partnerships with secular institutions and access to health care.
"This document reiterates that health care is a basic right," said the Rev. Tom Kopfenstein, a moral theologian who served as a consultant to the committee that drafted the guidelines. "Justice has become a medical, moral issue."
With a nod to the changing economics of health care and the drive for hospitals to join institutional networks, the directives say that under some conditions, Catholic hospitals could enter partnerships with hospitals that provide services that contradict church teaching, like artificial insemination. Approval for any such move would have to come from the diocesan bishop, the guidelines said. And even then, the Catholic facility must not participate directly in prohibited procedures.
While maintaining opposition to euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide, the directives allow for the administration of painkillers that might hasten death; they also say that patients may refuse medical treatment that has no appreciable benefit.

HEADLINE: For Utilities, New Clean-Air Plan

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Opening the door to a lower-cost method for reducing "greenhouse" gases that contribute to global warming, two big electric utilities have made a first-of-its-kind deal to trade air pollution allowances.
The agreement, scheduled to be announced today by Niagara Mohawk, serving upstate New York, and Arizona Public Service in Phoenix, is the first in which the right to emit one type of pollutant is being swapped for another. 
 Even more significant, part of the deal involves using a portion of the million-dollar proceeds from a tax break to finance experiments in reducing climate-warming emissions outside the United States.
At first, the experiments will be modest. One reportedly high on the utilities' list is a plan to generate electricity in India with waste heat from sugar refineries that now just goes up the stack. Another is reforestation in Mexico, where Arizona Public Service is already building strategic alliances with electric utilities.
But the experiments could deliver immense benefits in the future. Almost all of the cheapest opportunities for reducing emissions of gases that are warming the atmosphere lie outside North America, Western Europe and Japan. Modernizing electricity production in China, for instance, offers one of the best prospects because the economy there is growing so rapidly, requiring China to burn enormous amounts of coal in highly inefficient power plants. An even simpler way to control emissions would be to repair leaks in Russia's poorly maintained natural gas pipelines, which spew methane into the atmosphere.
Government officials aware of the utility deal say it may point to a better way of meeting Washington's expected obligations under future international agreements to limit global warming.
The utility deal, by demonstrating the advantages of going abroad to reduce greenhouse gases in the least expensive way, also could open the way eventually to an international trade in pollution allowances.
"If we are going to deal with climate warming efficiently," said Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, "there will have to be international trading in which Western countries get credit for reducing emissions elsewhere."
The Clean Air Act of 1990 put a cap on utilities' emissions of sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of fuel burning that contributes to acid rain. But it allows utilities to meet their obligations by buying emissions "allowances" from other companies.
This market-based approach, the Environmental Protection Agency says, is already saving rate payers $400 million to $600 million a year. It works because one utility that finds a cheaper way to cut emissions can profit by doing more than the law requires, selling the right to pollute to another utility that would have found it more expensive to achieve those reductions itself.
Arizona Public Service can easily meet the requirements of the law in its own territory because it earlier agreed to pay for equipment to reduce the haze above the Grand Canyon. In the process, it is reducing sulfur emissions.
Niagara Mohawk is also in good shape because it relies on huge amounts of nonpolluting hydropower to meet the needs of its customers.
But both Arizona Public Service and Niagara Mohawk have a separate obligation to contain climate-warming gases, which for the most part consist of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The utilities signed the Clinton Administration's Climate Challenge Accord in April 1994, a voluntary agreement to do their part in meeting America's international treaty commitment to keep emissions of greenhouse gases under the levels produced in 1990. William E. Davis, the chief executive of Niagara Mohawk, says the company hopes to demonstrate that its method offers a better approach than "command and control regulations by Congress."
Niagara Mohawk expects no difficulties in hitting its greenhouse gas target. But Arizona Public Service does: "Demand for power in our service area is growing at double the national rate," said O. Mark DeMichele, the chief executive of Arizona Public Service, and "power consumption is already three years ahead of projections."
The Arizona utility thus needed help, which was forthcoming from Niagara Mohawk. Under a deal brokered by the Environmental Defense Fund, the New York utility agreed to absorb 1.75 million tons of Arizona Public Services' obligation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in return for 25,000 tons of sulfur dioxide allowances.
Since Niagara Mohawk has no foreseeable need for the sulfur allowances it is reaping, the utility plans to donate the allowances to a nonprofit group (as yet unnamed), which will retire them permanently. Niagara Mohawk still benefits because it will be able to claim a corporate income tax deduction of about $150 a ton. "Northeast Utilities did precisely the same thing, donating sulfur allowances to the American Lung Association," said Joseph Goffman, senior lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund.
Utilities have been exchanging sulfur dioxide allowances for cash for some time, both in private agreements and through a commodities exchange maintained by the Chicago Board of Trade. The price of the allowance, however, has remained below earlier expectations.
The Climate Control accord deliberately offered utilities maximum leeway in meeting emissions reduction targets -- anything from insulating houses to subsidizing electric cars. The deal between Arizona Public Service and Niagara Mohawk shows that American utilities may be able to fulfill their obligations even more cheaply by finding foreign sources of pollution that they agree to clean up.
The Department of Energy, which has been not-so-quietly urging such experiments, plans to help by amassing a data base to be used for arranging international trades and verifying compliance.
The deal does have a few weak spots. This is not a free lunch for everyone: Some of the money to finance the experiment is coming from taxpayers in the form of deductions for the sulfur emissions. More is coming from rate payers and stockholders, since the utilities could choose instead to sell their extra sulfur allowances for a profit rather than donating them to charity.
But Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, defends the deal as a very cheap lunch. "Market solutions to environmental problems," she said, "will always be cheaper than direct regulation. And the utilities are anxious to play."


GRAPHIC: Two utilities have found a formula for turning each company's environmental strong suit into a benefit for the other, in a deal brokered by the Environmental Defense Fund. One gets a low-cost way to meet a commitment on greenhouse gases; the other gets a tax break that will pay for conservation projects. In the process, air pollution will be reduced in the United States and abroad.
 
1. THE SWAP
Chart: "A Novel Deal to Reduce Pollution"
 Niagara Mohawk transfers to Arizona Public Service credit for 1.75 million tons of reduction in carbon dioxide emissions required under a voluntary agrement many utilities have with the Department of Energy. In return, Arizona Public Service transfers to Niagara Mohawk j25,000 tons worth of sulfur dioxide allowances under the Clean Air Act's acid-rain program.
 Thw swap relieves Arizona Public Service of an obligation to find ways to reduce its own plants' emissions of carbon dioxide.
 
2. THE DONATION
 Instead of using or selling them, Niagara Mohawk donates the sulfur dioxide allowances to an environmental group (yet to be named) that will retire them, meaning no other polluter can use them. Niagara Mohawk gets a tax deduction for their market value of approximately $3.75 million.
 
3. RECYCLING THE MONEY
 Niagara Mohawk spends the value of the tax benefit - about $1 million - on conservation programs, including projects in its service area and in countries like Mexico and India where emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide can be reduced at lower cost than in the United States.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Drops First Time in Four Months

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The housing industry, until now mostly immune to rising mortgage rates, began to succumb in October to higher loan costs as new home construction fell for the first time in four months.
"It suggests that after eight months, the housing market may be reacting to higher rates," said David Lereah, economist for the Mortgage Bankers of America. 
 "The market has not collapsed," said Tommy Thompson, president of the National Association of Home Builders, "but it has peaked out and is starting a trend of continued downward movement."
The Commerce Department reported today that housing starts dropped 5.2 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million, the smallest since June, when they plunged 8.9 percent, to 1.37 million.
The volatile multifamily sector, which includes apartments and condominiums, posted a 4.8 percent gain, to a 282,000 rate, following a 6.3 percent decline in September.
But the interest-sensitive single-family sector -- 80 percent of new housing -- fell 7.4 percent to a 1.14 million rate, the lowest level since severe weather stalled construction last winter.
Thirty-year mortgage rates, which were below 7 percent a year ago, have risen since February when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to forestall inflation and averaged 9.19 percent this week.
There were also these signs Thursday that other economic sectors remained robust despite earlier rate increases:
*The Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 5,000 last week, the fourth decline in five weeks and the biggest in nearly two months.
*The National Association of Realtors said existing-home prices rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter to $111,000.
*The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its index of regional business activity fell to 30.5 from 33.2 in November, but it showed increases in jobs and the average workweek, and most indications of future economic activity rose.

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Only weeks ago, French conservatives seemed certain to win next spring's presidential elections. Now, in a turnaround that could cheer American Democrats after their drubbing last week in mid-term elections, France's Socialists again have a chance.
Strangely, the Socialists themselves did little to achieve this. Rather, in what might also sound a warning to American Republicans, the Socialists have bounced back because French voters are now beginning to blame the right for what is wrong with France. 
 A Socialist, Francois Mitterrand, is still President, but conservatives have run both Government and Parliament since parliamentary elections in March 1993. Today, increasingly judged by their own record, the conservatives can no longer count on bitter memories of the last Socialist Government to help them.
Ideology seems to have little to do with this change of mood. Rather, many French feel that the country is still drifting, that the political establishment remains more interested in its own welfare than that of France. As a result, whoever is in office risks facing their wrath.
Last year Prime Minister Edouard Balladur inherited an economic recession, but he repeatedly promised that France would be on the road to recovery by now. But the economy remains sluggish, with unemployment still at a near-record 12.7 percent of the work force.
Then there is corruption. Two years ago, it was the Socialists who were besieged by corruption scandals. Now it is the the conservatives' turn. In recent months, three members of Mr. Balladur's Cabinet have resigned after coming under judicial investigation for corruption, and one is even in jail.
But the conservatives have perhaps most harmed themselves by putting on an extraordinary display of vicious infighting over who should be their presidential candidate next year. Until recently, with the political right set to win, the nomination battle was even more important than the election.
Now, however, the conservative vote is threatening to splinter, with the power struggle between Prime Minister Balladur and the leader of his own Gaullist party, Jacques Chirac, badly dividing the Cabinet and tearing apart the conservative coalition that holds 80 percent of parliamentary seats.
For this, Mr. Balladur is at least partly to blame. Mr. Chirac nominated him to become Prime Minister last year with the idea that he would pave the way for Mr. Chirac's own bid for the presidency. Instead, Mr. Balladur became more popular than Mr. Chirac and set his own eyes on the Elysee Palace. This month, Mr. Chirac declared his candidacy; Mr. Balladur will only announce his plans in January.
Other coalition members, including former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, are also thinking of entering the race. Two men further to the right, Philippe de Villiers, who leads an anti-European party, and Jean-Marie Le Pen of the extreme rightist National Front have already declared their candidacies.
Suddenly, haunted by how they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections, won by Mr. Mitterrand, the conservatives are desperately fighting their reputation for being a "losing machine."
In contrast, the Socialists, who in the past have shown their own penchant for internecine warfare, have united around Jacques Delors. And they plan to sit quietly until January when the former Finance Minister steps down as head of the European Union's executive commission.
Mr. Delors has not yet accepted the nomination, but everything suggests he will. This week, he said he would only do so out of a sense of duty, but his remarks coincided with publication of a book of interviews with him that had every appearance of a draft campaign platform.
"The traditional left represents only 40 to 45 percent of the electorate," he said in a television interview, "so we need to conquer new voters, to inspire the young and less young to make the necessary changes in our society."
His strength is that, having spent the last decade at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels, he enjoys respect in France without having become too familiar. On the other hand, having never run for major office here, he has little experience in the rough-and-tumble of campaigning.
The Socialist strategy, then, is to keep him out of the race as long as possible, to reinforce the image of a serene statesman without personal ambition while leaving the public to focus its attention on the spectacle of the battling right.
The latest polls say Mr. Delors is already running neck-and-neck with Mr. Balladur and is comfortably ahead of Mr. Chirac.

HEADLINE: Loan Arranged at Rockefeller Center

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Rockefeller Center Properties, the public company that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, said yesterday that it had arranged to borrow $225 million, averting what had been a looming financial crisis.
The deal does not affect the company's more fundamental problem: that Rockefeller Center's owner, the Rockefeller Group, which is controlled by the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan, does not have enough money to make the payments on the mortgage and may default on the loan. 
 Rockefeller Center Properties is a real estate investment trust whose only business is to hold the mortgage on Rockefeller Center. Yesterday it said it had reached a tentative agreement to sell $225 million in long-term debt to Whitehall Street Real Estate Limited Partnership, a fund managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Whitehall will also receive warrants and stock appreciation rights, allowing it to buy the equivalent of 19.9 percent of the company's shares at $5 a share.
Shares of Rockefeller Center Properties fell 37.5 cents, to $4, on the New York Stock Exchange, an all-time low.
In 1985 Rockefeller Group, then owned entirely by the Rockefeller family, took a $1.3 billion mortgage on the property, which is bordered by Fifth Avenue, Avenue of the Americas, 48th and 51st Streets. The money was lent by Rockefeller Center Properties, which raised $750 million selling stock and $550 million selling bonds.
In later years, the real estate trust bought back some of those bonds, borrowing money by selling short-term commercial paper. The repayment on that paper had been guaranteed by two letters of credit, one of which was set to expire next month and the other, which expires next June.
With banks largely unwilling to renew the letters of credit, the company faced a liquidity squeeze unless it found other financing. That is the reason it gave Goldman, Sachs the equity warrants on top of the interest.
Goldman, Sachs also received the right to appoint one member to the company's board. Claude M. Ballard Jr., a limited partner of Goldman, Sachs, is chairman of Rockefeller Center Properties' board, but he was not involved in the negotiations regarding the financing, said Stephanie Legget Young, a spokeswoman for Rockefeller Center Properties.
Goldman, Sachs was the initial underwriter of its stock in 1985. Kidder, Peabody & Company has been the investment banker for Rockefeller Center Properties.
In 1989, Mitsubishi Estate, Japan's largest property company, entered into the first of two transactions in which it bought 80 percent of Rockefeller Group for $1.4 billion. The real estate market in New York has since crashed and the rent that Rockefeller Group receives is substantially less than its costs.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
SONY, STRUGGLING, TAKES A HUGE LOSS ON MOVIE STUDIOS

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 17

 BODY:
After months of optimistic statements, the Sony Corporation today became the latest Japanese company to acknowledge serious problems with a landmark American investment, announcing that it was taking $3.2 billion in losses on the value of the Hollywood studios that it acquired only five years ago.
In a surprise announcement, Sony said that because of poor box office results, a wave of executive resignations and rising costs, it could never hope to recover its investment in the studios, Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures, and was reducing their value on its books by $2.7 billion. 
 Sony said the studios also suffered $510 million in additional losses in the three months from July 1 through Sept. 30, because of the cancellation of movies under development, the settlement of lawsuits and the payment of huge sums to departing executives. Sony added that it had no choice but to sink even more money into the studios if it ever hoped to make them profitable.
The quarterly loss of $3.2 billion that Sony announced today is one of the largest reported by a Japanese company. But, to put it in perspective, it fell well short of the loss of $8 billion announced by the International Business Machines Corporation for the second quarter of 1993 and the record loss of $21 billion posted by the General Motors Corporation in the first quarter of 1992.
Still, it was a humbling admission for Sony and a stark symbol of the reversal in fortunes for corporate Japan. Sony, known for its innovative exports like the Walkman and video camcorder, had been at the head of the elite Japanese companies that poured money into the United States.
When Sony paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures in late 1989, Americans feared that these overwhelmingly competitive companies, the engines behind Japan's huge trade surpluses, were taking control of the cream of the American economy. The anxieties grew when the Mitsubishi Estate Company bought control of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company acquired MCA Inc., which owns Universal Pictures.
The flood of investments, which included other trophies like Firestone, the tire company, and the Tiffany building, eased after 1991, when the Japanese economy entered a deep recession. Now, time has borne out those experts who had argued that many of the Japanese companies overpaid for what were in many instances ill-considered investments.
Earlier this week, it was disclosed that Mitsubishi Estate and its partners may be about to default on the mortgage on Rockefeller Center. And several weeks ago, the American executives of MCA, which is profitable, reportedly threatened to quit and leave the company rudderless if Matsushita did not either sell them the company or grant them autonomy.
Other Japanese companies in financial distress have been forced to unload well-known properties at big losses, from the Pebble Beach golf club in California to prestigious hotels in Hawaii.
Some Japanese investments succeeded, but usually when the companies stuck closely to businesses they knew well and built the properties themselves, like the American auto plants built by Honda and Toyota.
Sony, however, had always considered itself a cut above, with its innovative electronic gadgets and flair for garnering favorable publicity. The acquisition of the studios was seen as a bold attempt to marry Sony's expertise in producing electronic hardware with the "software" that ran on the videotape and CD players. Sony also acquired record and television production companies.
That was one reason today's announcement sent a grim message to the financial markets. Several analysts said they felt misled by Sony, because it gave no hint of the dire condition of its movie studios before dropping today's bomb.
"It seems like a realistic step, but I found the way it was handled highly irritating," said Joseph Osha, an analyst here with Baring Securities. "The real problem was that even after all this, they didn't articulate a clear vision for the movie business."
The Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating agency, said it was considering lowering the rating on $7 billion of bonds issued by Sony. It said the write-off "raises questions as to the severity of the problems of the picture segment and calls for a reassessment of Sony's overall business profile and long-term strategies."
The announcement was made after the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed today. But on the New York Stock Exchange, where Sony is traded in the form of American depository receipts, the price fell $3.25, to $55.25, today.
Sony also reported that in the three-month period that ended on Sept. 30, it enjoyed an increase of 3.7 percent in sales, to $9.93 billion, from the corresponding period a year ago. Its music and electronics businesses produced positive results, Sony said, but the huge losses from movies produced an overall net loss of $3.2 billion during the period.
The company has suffered a string of box office disappointments and outright disasters recently. They include "Last Action Hero," "I'll Do Anything" and "Lost in Yonkers." Its latest movie, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," also threatens to turn into a disaster, grossing less than $18 million so far on production costs of $40 million to $50 million.
Several analysts said the biggest problem for Sony was that it was unable to manage its acquisitions. "The purchase itself was not necessarily a mistake, but they didn't know how to run it properly," said Yoshiharu Izumi, the analyst here with UBS Securities.
The difficulties began almost from the moment Sony made its purchase. Shortly after, it hired two successful film producers, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, to run the studios.
Legal disputes about their contracts with rival companies forced Sony to pay an astounding price estimated at about $700 million for their services. Despite the cost, Mr. Peters left not long after, and Mr. Guber departed last month, with the studios widely understood to be in trouble.
Sony invested several billion dollars bringing in more executives, paying a handful to leave, rebuilding some of the studio properties and introducing new technologies. Even so, its studios now rest in last place among the large Hollywood companies, in terms of market share.
In a statement, Michael P. Schulhof, president of the Sony Corporation of America, characterized the move today as the product of a "strategic analysis." But he did not say much about the strategy, except that it would involve reducing costs at the studios and an attempt to recapture some of the market share it had lost.
The company felt compelled to add in its announcement, "Sony's enthusiasm and commitment to its motion picture, television and video businesses is undiminished."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Survey Helps Push Bonds Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell modestly yesterday, as the Commerce Department's report that housing starts were down for the month of October failed to soothe investor concern about faster growth and accelerating inflation. A weaker dollar also weighed on the market.
Bonds initially made modest gains on the housing report, but the potential for gains was limited as a survey by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve of general business conditions in its region showed continued strength in economic growth. 
 The 30-year bond fell 10/32 of a percentage point, to 93 1/32 , for a yield of 8.12 percent, up from 8.09 percent on Wednesday. On the other hand, short-term bill rates were mixed.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said, "The market remains convinced the economy is still very strong and that there are signs of upward pressure on prices, and even though the Fed may not raise interest rates further this year, investors believe the central bank will need to raise rates further next year."
Mr. Johnson pointed to yesterday's Philadelphia Fed report as one of many signs of upward pressure. Even though the manufacturing sector showed a decline from the surges in October, the report said, manufacturing activity was still robust and upward pressure on prices had not faded. "So the bond market is nervous, and nervous for good a reason," Mr. Johnson said.
Other nagging problems, Mr. Johnson added, are that foreign investors are backing away from the American market because rates are becoming more attractive elsewhere. Secondly, there is concern about the political standoff in Washington. "One of the big worries is that we are going to be facing higher deficits in the future, because while we get the tax cuts easily enough, we will not get the offsetting spending cuts, which are difficult to make," he said. "If you're looking for something to worry about, there is plenty."
Perhaps the most worrisome data coming out of the Philadelphia Fed survey, other analysts said, were the continued rise in delivery time for manufactured goods to reach the consumer level, which may indicate inflationary bottle necks developing.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International said the market could not shake this bearish trend because investors were worried about the economic rate of growth and had not yet seen any significant slowdown. "The market wants conclusive evidence that it is slowing," she said.
Ms. Rupert also cited the coming supply of new paper next week as a source of some market irritation. The Treasury will be selling $55.45 billion in bills and notes during a holiday-shortened week. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 7.26 percent, up 5 basis points from the previous day; the five-year note was at a price to yield 7.79 percent, up 4 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The market has already lost nearly a point since the Fed's interest rate increase on Tuesday, making it the third consecutive time this year that bonds have failed to sustain a rally after such a rise. "This last one was the shortest of the three," Ms. Rupert said. "It lasted a day or two."
Late in the day, when speculators realized that the long bond was not going to make new lows in this latest downturn, some rushed to cover short positions, sparking a small rally in the afternoon, halving the day's losses.
Short-covering occurs when speculators sell borrowed securities in hope of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
In the municipal market, where demand for bonds has slacked amid mutual fund redemptions, prices in the secondary market fell for the second consecutive day.
And in the day's largest offering, Virginia, one of five states still rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, sold $225 million in general obligation bonds through competitive bidding won by CS First Boston. In an indication of good investor interest, the bonds maturing in 10 years were priced to yield 6 percent, about 8 basis points lower than other similarly rated bonds.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drifts a Bit as Dealers Await Report on U.S. Trade

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday in quiet trading.
Many currency dealers were awaiting today's report on the United States trade balance. A decline in the American bond market also weighed down the dollar yesterday. The dollar surged on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve raised the two short-term interest rates it controls. But both bonds and the dollar have since sagged. 
 "We got that pop in the dollar when the Fed raised the rates, but trading has been pretty lackluster over all since then," said Paul Alley, a trader at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "The dollar really doesn't have a lot of direction and momentum on its own so we have been watching the bond market."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.5522 German marks, from 1.5506 marks on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to 98.30 Japanese yen from 98.34 yen.
Alfonso Alejo, senior proprietary trader at Sakura Bank Ltd., said that the bond market's weak performance suggested continued investor uneasiness about inflation, which was preventing the dollar from building on its rally earlier in the week. Inflation erodes the value of American bonds and stocks held by foreign investors, thus discouraging the demand for dollars to buy such assets.
Today, the Commerce Department will report on the United States trade balance in September. Economists expect the report to show a slight narrowing in the trade gap to $9.5 billion in September from $9.74 billion in August.
"If the trade report come in close to expectations it's going to be kind of a nonevent," Mr. Alley of Long-Term Credit Bank said. But an unexpected widening of the trade deficit -- particularly the gap with Japan -- could send the dollar lower against the yen, he added.
Traders fear that growth in the trade gap will lead to a glut of dollars as exporters from Japan and elsewhere seek to repatriate their profits by selling dollars for yen.
In other currency trading yesterday, the British pound slipped to $1.5710, from $1.5725 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.3055 Swiss francs from 1.3095 francs, but rose to 5.3285 French francs from 5.3265 francs.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Orange Juice Prices Jump; Cotton and Oil Also Climb

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Orange juice prices jumped on commodity markets yesterday after Brazilian producers raised prices.
Other commodity prices gained. Cotton rose to five-month highs amid signs that a large United States crop would be absorbed in the face of reduced world supplies, while crude oil jumped amid rising demand from refiners. Lumber prices retreated. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose 0.80 point, to 233.65. 
 Brazil's orange processors raised prices of orange juice concentrates yesterday to $1.30 a pound from $1.15 in expectation that a report today from the Brazilian Association of Citrus Exporters would confirm that the orange crop in the Sao Paulo state had been damaged by frost. The state grows 90 percent of Brazil's orange crop, the world's largest.
The move led traders to bet the crop estimate might be closer to the 250 million boxes of oranges predicted by some growers than to the range of 270 million boxes to 282 million boxes predicted earlier this season by the United States Department of Agriculture and Brazilian agriculture authorities.
On the New York Cotton Exchange, frozen concentrated orange juice for January delivery rose 4.75 cents, to $1.19 a pound, its highest price since Oct. 12, 1993.
Crude oil surged amid optimism that demand would pick up as refiners race to make enough heating oil for the winter and produce sufficient supplies of a new grade of gasoline to meet a Government deadline on clean-air requirements.
Crude oil for December delivery, which expires today, rose 28 cents, to $17.65 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Cotton rose to the highest price in five months amid hopes any excess from a record cotton crop in the United States this year will be absorbed by demand from abroad.
Smaller-than-expected crops in Pakistan, India and China could lead to higher exports of American cotton.
Cotton for December delivery rose 0.45 cent, to 74.85 cents a pound, on the cotton exchange, the highest price since June 22.
Lumber prices fell back on concerns that higher interest rates would dampen the housing market. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that housing starts dropped 5.2 percent in October.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, January Lumber fell $4, to $349.50 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The King Must Die

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
"Why do we want to kill our Presidents?" A doctor asked me that the other day, and left me wondering whether there is something about the American system, or the American psyche, that now makes the Presidency a hopelessly vulnerable institution.
"With the exception of Reagan, who was sui generis," he said, "we have cut off every President for nearly 30 years: Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush. Now it looks as if the same will happen to Clinton. 
 "We don't just say they failed at this or that. We say they failed as human beings, and we seem to get satisfaction from that idea. There's almost a glee about it: 'Boy, he really was terrible.' "
With each of those Presidents one can find a fault that led to his undoing. Lyndon Johnson dug us into the disaster of Vietnam. Richard Nixon was responsible for the lies and abuses of Watergate. And on and on.
Vietnam and Watergate, moreover, had lasting effects on the institution. We ceased to believe Presidents, to assume their good faith. The press became hostile, and has remained so. It did not give Bill Clinton even a brief honeymoon.
President Clinton, too, has inflicted many wounds on himself. From Zoe Baird to Lani Guinier, from Bosnia to prayer in schools, he has repeatedly failed to stand on principle.
But the doctor's point was that something larger is going on. Whatever the mistakes of this President or that, we want to find some fundamental, personal flaw in the man. Is that so?
What is undoubtedly true is that we expect far too much of the Federal Government nowadays. In this vast country, we think Washington can and should prevent local street crime. We expect it to repair family life, and make sure our incomes rise.
And the President is the great symbol of the national Government. We lay on him almost the personal burdens that King Henry V felt the night before the battle of Agincourt in Shakespeare's play: "Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children and our sins lay on the King!"
At least since the New Deal, we have had this romantic notion of what Presidents ought to do for each of us. Asking for the impossible, we are bound to be disappointed. And as in a failed romance, we turn bitterly on the one who has failed us. So the theory might go.
Now we are evidently returning to the pre-New Deal political system, Congressional Government. However much resolve President Clinton can summon up, the legislative agenda is likely to be set by the newly dominant Republicans in Congress. It is there in Newt Gingrich's "Contract With America," and no one should doubt the seriousness of his intention to carry it out.
Will the planned Republican measures fulfill our expectations? Mr. Gingrich has taken some welcome procedural steps, such as shaking up the House seniority system. But what about the substantive problems?
The rise in illegitimate births, especially among teen-agers, is one. Will a denial of welfare benefits to illegitimate children -- the idea being discussed by Republicans -- solve the problem? Will poor teen-age girls change their sexual habits if the Government takes their babies away and puts them in Gingrich orphanages?
Or crime. Longer sentences and more prisons have not affected the level of crime noticeably so far. Will even more savage policies turn the growing population of young men without hope into good citizens?
The economy is the problem causing the most profound discontent among Americans. Real per-capita income has been stagnant or declining for years. The rich have grown dramatically richer, while the middle class struggles to keep afloat.
Some of the Gingrich Contract's economic ideas are appealing: the $500 tax credit per child, for example. But the huge cost of the various proposed tax cuts would make the deficit balloon or require cuts in Social Security, Medicare and like entitlements on a similar scale. Will such a package ease American frustrations?
The concern is not an idle or a partisan one. Frustrated expectations can in time exact a heavy cost in politics. They can turn people against the whole idea of representative government. Unless political leaders begin to talk honestly about the limits of what they can produce, the present cynicism and anger may become dangerous.

HEADLINE: Unfettered By Party, He's Set To Govern

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRUNSWICK, Me., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Maybe it was his insistence that he didn't "need to be governor" that most endeared Angus King to Maine voters.
This is a state, after all, with a fondness for mavericks, and this was a political season that favored outsiders. 
 So here was Mr. King, who had gone from legal services lawyer to public television talk-show host to multimillionaire businessman, offering himself as a sort of "people's choice" candidate, neither Republican nor Democrat, saying yes, he could best lead the state, but no, he wasn't going to be one of those career politicians.
He won, if narrowly, and as of January will be the only governor in the nation affiliated with no political party. He succeeds John R. McKernan Jr., a Republican, barred by law from seeking a third term.
At home here the other day, Mr. King was talking about the narrow margin of his victory in a four-candidate field in which he won 36 percent of the vote. Inasmuch as he beat the Democratic front-runner, former Gov. Joseph Brennan, by just 7,000 votes -- or 2 percent of the total -- anything may have made the difference, he said.
It certainly did not hurt that he had been endorsed by the novelist Stephen King, a staunch Democrat from Bangor. "Stephen King is a Maine icon," said Mr. King (but not a relative of the Governor-elect).
Maybe it was his appearance at 25 county fairs, from Blue Hill to Fryeburg to Farmington. Or, in keeping with the anti-insider sentiment of the voters, it may have been the last television debate, in which Mr. King closed by saying that Thomas Jefferson had instructed that his epitaph refer to him as the author of the Declaration of Independence, not as President. What matters is not your title but what you accomplish, Mr. King, who had already pledged that he would never run for any other office, told the audience that night.
"The next day," he said, "I was at Bath Ironworks shaking hands, and this very gruff guy, a welder, shook my hand and said, 'Nice Jefferson quote.' "
The election season's disdain for career politicians was particularly strong in Maine, where bickering between Democratic and Republican state legislators, along with a big budget shortfall, forced the government to shut down for two weeks in 1991.
Mr. King's only political experience was a two-year stint in Washington in the 1970's, as a counsel to Senator Bill Hathaway, a Maine Democrat. He says he has evolved from traditional liberal to "compassionate pragmatist," and describes himself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. He likes to quote Winston Churchill: "If you're not a socialist when you're 20, you have no heart. If you're not a conservative when you're 40, you have no head."
At 50, Mr. King took a rare day off from campaigning in September to attend a Rolling Stones concert with his 41-year-old press secretary, Dennis Bailey, who is the lead singer in a local rock band, the Van Gogh-gos.
While he remains loyal to the Stones, Mr. King left the Democratic Party in 1993. "Democrats are a mainframe in an age of P.C.'s," he said. "They don't get it."
He himself happens to be on line.He fields questions from voters over the Internet, and while campaigning he wrote a book, about his vision for Maine, on a lap-top computer that he carries in his car. He also has a computer in his kitchen, which doubled as an annex to his campaign headquarters in a former Arby's restaurant. (Spotting the big Angus King sign on top, hungry tourists kept coming in last summer and asking for the Angus King special.)
Like countless candidates elsewhere this year, Mr. King stumped on an anti-bureaucracy platform. He promised to make Maine more friendly to business and, deriding the bitter competition between the parties here, adopted the slogan "partnership, not partisanship." He says his priorities include creating jobs in this state with a chronically high unemployment rate and closing a $200 million gap in a budget that always seems to be running a deficit.
A graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School, Mr. King began his career as a legal services lawyer in Maine before going into business (and later moonlighting as the host of a public affairs program on public television in Maine). Last year he made $12 million on the sale of a company he had founded, Northeast Energy Management Inc.
While he spent nearly $900,000 of his own money on the campaign, he does not seem to have poured any of his profits into the modest two-story house he shares with his wife, Mary Herman, a former lobbyist, and their 4-year-old son, Benjamin.
"We put vinyl siding on the house," said Mr. King, sitting in a living room with well-worn furniture. "That was our big splurge."
The Governor-elect, who has three grown sons from a previous marriage, said he had no plans to move his family into the Governor's Mansion in Augusta, a 30-mile commute from Brunswick. He does not want to take Benjamin away from his best friend, 4-year-old Harry Swan, he said.
That sort of attitude fits right in with a Maine culture steeped in the self-sufficiency of lobstermen, potato farmers and loggers. Politically the state has an independent tradition dating from 1820, when it split off from Massachusetts. Mr. King will be Maine's second independent governor in 20 years, the last being Jim Longley.
"In Maine," Stephen King said, "people have shown this traditional tendency to say 'I smell fresh air' and not slam the window shut."
One of Mr. King's first post-election duties will be to mingle with Republicans and Democrats alike at a gathering of governors and governors-elect this weekend in Greenbriar, W.Va. If nothing else, he said, "I'll be able to caucus by myself."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Angus King, the independent who was elected last week to be Maine's next governor, referred incorrectly to the site where governors were gathering over the weekend. It is is not a town but a resort, in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.; its name is spelled Greenbrier.

HEADLINE: $15 Million Tax Break Keeps Viacom Jobs in New York

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
After a promise of $15 million in tax incentives from the city and a game of musical chairs in two New York office towers, Viacom Inc. has completed plans to expand in midtown Manhattan, more than doubling its office space in two of the four buildings it occupies.
The new space, about 750,000 square feet, means that Viacom will keep 4,450 employees in New York, with the expectation that 2,500 more jobs can be added in the next 15 years. Although the entertainment and communications conglomerate never threatened to move its headquarters out of the city, it had considered moving 1,600 clerical and administrative jobs to New Jersey before the incentive package was offered in October. 
 "The city came forward with a package of incentives that made it economically possible for us to stay here," said Carl D. Folta, a senior vice president of Viacom.
Viacom, which owns the cable networks MTV and Nickelodeon as well as Paramount Communications, is expected early next week to sign a 15-year lease for 500,000 square feet, or 11 floors, at 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street. Its Showtime subsidiary already has offices in the building. It is also adding another seven floors to the 28 it occupies at 1515 Broadway, a 54-story building at 44th Street that bears its name. The company's Simon & Schuster subsidiary last year renewed its leases for six floors at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, at 48th Street.
The new offices do not represent a total expansion for Viacom, since some of the space will be occupied by employees who are to move in the spring from the Paramount building at Columbus Circle, which is being acquired by Donald Trump for mixed use.
When the ink dries on all the deals, Viacom will occupy about 1.6 million square feet of New York office space in three buildings.
When Viacom acquired Paramount in March, a 450,000-square-foot building in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., came with it. Early on, the plan was to move a significant portion of Paramount and Viacom support staff, about 1,600 people, as well as some studio space into that building. City officials project that, had Viacom gone ahead with those plans, the city would have lost $821 million in annual economic activity, including expenditures by the company and its employees and about $18 million in city taxes. Now Viacom plans to sell that building.
"The incentives the city offered really made a difference," said Martin Turchin, the lead broker representing Viacom.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offered the $15 million tax incentives to Viacom last month, just as a border war broke out between New York and Connecticut when that state lured the Swiss Bank Corporation from New York City with an incentives package.
At the time, the Mayor said the Viacom offer was similar to those made to six companies over the first 10 months of his administration, to retain a total of 30,000 jobs in the city.
"When one of the world's largest entertainment companies decides to make its headquarters here into the next generation, they are strengthening and enhancing the city's reputation as a place where the world does business," Clay B. Lifflander, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday.
Brokers say that Viacom has agreed to annual rents that start at more than $30 a square foot, the market rate for Times Square buildings, so that in rent alone the corporation will be paying millions of dollars a year.
Accommodating Viacom has not been easy. At 1633 Broadway, much of the space Viacom will occupy is currently occupied by Deloitte & Touche, a large accounting firm, which had been looking for sublet tenants for much of its space. The Paramount Group, the German real estate company that owns 1633 Broadway (no connection to Paramount Communications), has agreed to take back the lease and rent the space directly to Viacom, providing the firm can move out ahead of schedule.
The building at 1515 Broadway is almost fully occupied. Viacom has been negotiating with four tenants, offering undisclosed incentives to get them to move elsewhere. One has already moved, and the Urban Development Corporation, the brokers say, is near an agreement to give up 100,000 square feet at the top of the building. Two other tenants are still negotiating.

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: TRADE;
White House Warns of Market Jolt if Trade Pact Is Defeated

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Raising the stakes in the Administration's effort to round up votes for a world trade agreement, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned today that its defeat could have "a very negative effect on the financial markets of this country."
 The prediction was a high-risk strategy for the White House: it sets up a prophecy that could become self-fulfilling if the 123-nation trade accord fails to get through Congress. 
 But other Administration officials agreed that the warning Mr. Bentsen gave in a meeting with supporters was legitimate and that lawmakers should know that the financial health of the country might be at stake.
 With four working days left before Congress reconvenes in a special session to take up the agreement, White House officials continued today to express optimism that they could coax the likely Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, to declare himself in favor of the pact. Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said today that "we've had some very good talks," adding, "I'd love to have this resolved by the beginning of next week."
 But one of the floor managers of the bill, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is in his last days as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sounded a note of caution. "I'm glad the White House thinks there is no problem," he said, but added that he viewed the agreement as still in "considerable jeopardy." "It is not done, and it won't be until the President meets with the principals in Congress."
 Officials in Mr. Dole's office said that they were negotiating with Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, on side agreements that would allow Congress to review actions taken by the World Trade Organization, the body that would be created by the accord to police world trade.
 Opponents of the accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, argue that the organization would undermine American sovereignty and could ultimately force participating countries to weaken consumer protections, health regulations or other laws judged impediments to imports.
 Mr. Kantor dismissed such fears today, arguing that the United States could withdraw from the trade agreement at any time, with six months' notice. "This sovereignty issue is a scarecrow," he declared.
 But while the Administration expressed confidence that votes were moving its way, it did not act like that was the case.
 "It's crunch time," Mr. Bentsen told a group of supporters of the trade accord today at one of the pro-GATT events sponsored by the Administration that have become a daily ritual. "I don't want to see us the day after the final vote saying 'if we had just tried harder, but we came up one vote short.' That just must not be the case." Mr. Bentsen has been leaning heavily on his former colleagues in the Senate.
 Earlier in the day, commenting on the Republicans' call for a tax cut, Mr. Bentsen declared that the Administration, like the new Republican majority, favored a middle-class tax cut next year. But he quickly added that any such tax cut could not be allowed to worsen the Federal deficit.
 On GATT, the White House plans a series of events over the next few days to drive home its message -- that a Congressional defeat would humiliate the United States and undercut its foreign policy, that it would cost new jobs and billions of dollars to the economy, and that partisanship should not interfere with an agreement that was supported by both the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
 But, in relation to GATT, the warning about a negative reaction in the financial markets is new, although it is a page drawn from the successful campaign a year ago to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 A similar prediction was made earlier this week in testimony before a Senate committee by Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker, but was dismissed by opponents of GATT as a scare tactic by a supporter of the trade accord.

HEADLINE: 12 Die as Arafat's Police Fire on Palestinian Militants

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GAZA, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat's police force opened fire for the first time on Palestinian protesters today, killing at least 12 people and wounding as many as 200 in street battles that raged for hours across the Gaza Strip's main city.
The police said an officer was also killed and 10 others were wounded when two police cars were set on fire. 
 It was by far the worst internal violence since Palestinian autonomy began six months ago in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, and some Islamic radicals opposed to Mr. Arafat warned of a brewing civil war. But leaders of the main Islamic group, Hamas, sought to allay such fears, saying they would work to keep Gaza from tearing itself apart in bloodshed.
Nonetheless, the rioting and shooting shocked Gazans, and potentially it was a devastating political blow to Mr. Arafat in his efforts to show that he and his struggling self-rule government command the allegiance of a majority of the Palestinian people and are capable of maintaining order.
Israelis and Palestinian moderates expressed concern about the possible consequences for their soon-to-resume peace talks to expand Palestinian authority beyond Gaza and Jericho to encompass the entire West Bank.
On Gaza's streets, Mr. Arafat was a reviled figure today, denounced by Palestinians regardless of political affiliations as a traitor and collaborator with Israel.
"I supported Arafat before, but now I hate him," said Jamil Kafarneh, a social worker who stood with protesters at one of the scenes of serious clashes, Palestinian police headquarters, formerly Israel's main prison here. [Page 8.]
A young man nearby shouted, "Arafat must hang for this!" and an older Palestinian, referring to the executed Romanian leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, said, "Arafat is worse than Ceausescu."
The street fighting produced a one-day casualty figure that was higher than in all but a few instances in the years-long Palestinian uprising against Israel, known in Arabic as the intifada. That worst day of the intifada was Oct. 8, 1990, when Israeli police officers killed at least 17 Palestinians during rioting at Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem.
In the Gaza battles, many of those wounded were shot in the head and chest, and so the death toll could climb.
What appalled and enraged many Gazans was that this time it was their own forces, not the hated Israelis, who had taken aim on stone-throwing protesters. It was a mirror image of uprising scenes that had vanished in Gaza in May, when the Israeli Army withdrew from Palestinian towns and refugee camps after a 27-year occupation.
The Palestinian police blamed Islamic extremists, saying that radicals were looking for a fight and that officers had fired in self-defense. A police statement said extremists had fired first from the main Gaza City mosque, where the turmoil began just as Friday noon prayers were ending.
But there was no independent confirmation of that charge.
Witnesses said the roughly 200 helmeted police officers on hand had started the shooting, to break up a planned rally to denounce Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority and his self-rule agreement with Israel.
But the witnesses also said the shooting came after stones were thrown at the police by some among an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 worshipers at the Palestine Mosque. They became angry when officers pulled down loudspeakers that were to be used in the rally. At first, witnesses said, officers shot in the air, and then they fired into the crowd.
However the incident began, the authorities apparently decided to respond firmly in a showdown with Islamic groups and their supporters that had been building for weeks.
That was also the view of an Israeli negotiator with the Palestinians, Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who said on Israel television, "I assume that Arafat reached the conclusion that it's either him or them."
The resulting clashes were ferocious, spreading quickly from the mosque to the police headquarters, another police post and to Shifa Hospital, where most of the victims were taken. All these locations lie in roughly a one-square-mile area of central Gaza City.
Rioting also spread this evening to Rafah, at the southern end of the coastal strip, where youths beat up a video-shop owner and smashed cafes and a movie theater. Dozens of youths marched on an Israeli Army checkpoint near the isolated settlement of Netzarim, where three soldiers were killed last Friday by a suicide bomber from the Islamic Holy War group. As the young Palestinians approached, soldiers pulled back to avoid a confrontation and watched as their outpost was set on fire.
Calm returned tonight. But from noon until well after sundown, Mr. Arafat's officers fired thousands upon thousands of bullets from automatic rifles to suppress angry Gazans whose weapons were stones. Most of the firing was in the air, in a vain attempt to scare off the protesters.
But often enough the police took dead aim. And the streets of Gaza City echoed for hours with the staccato of gunfire and the wails of ambulance sirens.
"They're acting like the Jews!" an old man screamed about the police as he watched a heavily bleeding youngster being carried from an ambulance into the Shifa Hospital emergency room, so overtaxed that some victims were treated on the bloodstained floor.
The comparison with Israeli behavior during the occupation was made by many people. Some saw Israel's hand in the episode, insisting that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had phoned Mr. Arafat and ordered him to carry out what Hamas in a statement called a "massacre."
"This was all done on the orders of Rabin and Clinton," a young Gazan said as he watched a doctor tend to a relative who had been shot in the back.
At Shifa Hospital, the rage against Mr. Arafat was almost palpable as ambulances and private cars pulled up every few minutes and, for long periods, even every few seconds, ferrying the wounded.
"All the time Arafat talks about democracy," said Iyad Kassem, an unemployed laborer. "Now we see how democratic he is."
The Palestinian police fared no better. When a wounded officer was brought to the hospital tonight, staff workers had to push back a surging crowd that was ready to grab the man from a stretcher and beat him.
Despite the anger, there were signs that Gazans were trying to keep the situation from spinning out of control.
At his offices along the Mediterranean shore, Mr. Arafat summoned his security chiefs to a strategy-planning session. There was no public comment, however, from him or his aides.
Hamas, while expressing outrage over the shootings, urged calm. In fact, the clashes at police headquarters, which lasted more than three hours, did not subside until Hamas leaders urged people over loudspeakers to go home. In short order, the large crowd dissolved.
"Hamas is very concerned that there be no civil war among Palestinians," said Sayed Abu Musameh, a leader of the militantly anti-Israel Hamas, whose formal name is the Islamic Resistance Movement. The rioting today, he said, was the produce of "rage against Israeli attacks and the way the Palestinian Authority is dealing with the people."
But Mr. Arafat's faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization, Al Fatah, issued a statement tonight in Gaza warning Hamas and Islamic Holy War that they were "crossing the red line" with attacks on the Palestinian Authority that "harm national unity."
Raising the specter of possible new clashes, Al Fatah said it was on "full alert" and would resist "conspiratorial plans on behalf of foreign parties." That was apparently a reference to Iran.
There was clear embarrassment on all sides over scenes of Palestinians battling Palestinians. People tried to block television cameramen from recording the clashes, and hard-eyed men who seemed to be security agents ripped the film out of at least one photographer's camera.
Three Palestinian journalists -- two photographers for The Associated Press and Reuters and a cameraman for Reuters Television -- were among those wounded by gunfire, two in the hand and one in the shoulder. It was not clear if the wounds were by chance or if police officers had aimed at the journalists.

U.S. Blames Lack of Benefits
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (Reuters) -- The United States attributed clashes between Palestinians in the Gaza Strip today to a lack of concrete benefits from the peace process and urged the P.L.O. and donor countries to fulfill their commitments.
"Today's events have sent a warning signal that more must be done to bring the Palestinians equal tangible benefits of peace," said the chief State Department spokesman, David T. Johnson.
At a donors' conference last year, some 40 nations pledged $2.4 billion, but much of it has failed to arrive amid complaints from donors that the P.L.O. is not accounting for how it spends the cash.
United States officials said earlier this week that another conference was scheduled in Brussels for Nov. 29-30 to plug a gap in financing of start-up costs for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho.
"We believe the P.L.O. has got to demonstrate that it can live up to its responsibilities and its commitments," Mr. Johnson said. "The international donor community must also live up to its commitments."

HEADLINE: Judge Rules Against System To Subsidize Hospital Care

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 18

 BODY:
For the second time this year, a Federal judge has sustained a challenge to Connecticut's system for subsidizing hospital care for poor patients, jeopardizing $150 million in Federal Medicaid grants to the state.
Judge Alfred V. Covello of Federal District Court here ruled Thursday that a 1974 Federal law covering employee benefits programs pre-empts the state system, which taxes hospitals and insured patients to cover the costs of hospital care for the indigent and the uninsured. 
 Under Medicaid provisions adopted in 1991, states that raise money to finance care for those groups are entitled to a 50 percent reimbursement from the Federal Government.
The decision is the latest of several conflicting rulings in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey that could affect states' abilities to regulate health care costs. The cases all revolve around the question of whether the Federal law on employee benefits plans bars states from controlling hospital costs and imposing taxes and surcharges on hospital services because it would force employee plans to shoulder costs that do not directly involve their members' health care.
The United States Supreme Court is to hear arguments in January in a case involving New York State that could address this question. In that case, insurance companies have maintained that state-imposed surcharges on some hospital services for some insured patients violate the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or Erisa, which governs employee-benefit programs. They maintain that the law prohibits the states from regulating such programs, and that the law says that money paid into these plans can be used only to benefit their members.
New York has maintained that this is too broad an interpretation of the Erisa law.
While the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled against New York State earlier this year, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled the opposite way in New Jersey in 1993, saying that the Erisa law should not pre-empt state control.
In Connecticut today, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state would appeal Judge Covello's decision and seek a stay, pending the Supreme Court decision in the New York case. He described Judge Covello's summary judgment as a "sweeping pre-emption of states statutes by Erisa" and warned that "it would create damaging obstacles to effective and meaningful health care reform at the state level."
The case was filed by the Connecticut Hospital Association, which represents 31 hospitals. It argued that the state's 6 percent sales tax on hospital services, an 11 percent tax on hospitals' gross receipts and a cap on hospital revenue violated the Erisa law.
Susan Shimelman, the state's budget director, said that the taxes raised roughly $300 million, and that about the same amount would be redistributed to hospitals based on the number of patients they served who were uninsured, underinsured or on Medicaid.
Under this program, she said, "the inner-city hospitals are the net winners, and those hospitals that one might classify as suburban are generally contributing more than they're receiving."
Ms. Shimelman said the decision places the state's efforts to assist ailing inner-city hospitals at risk, as well as jeopardizing the $150 million the state receives from the Federal Government for conducting such a program.
William J. Doyle, the Hospital Association's lawyer, said, "If they're going to keep providing this money, they're going to have to find a different way to do it."
When New Jersey was faced with a similar decision in 1992, the state decided to use surplus money from its unemployment insurance fund to finance charity care, while deregulating hospital prices. Although an appeals court later reversed the ruling that forced the change, Kathleen A. Brennan, the acting director of the state's Healthcare Financing Program, said New Jersey had not returned to taxing hospital services.
She noted that the state was about to run out of surplus funds and was looking for other ways to finance the program.
But in Connecticut, there appears to be no surplus funds to draw upon.
"The choices are not going to be real pretty," said State Representative Joseph D. Courtney, co-chairman of the Legislature's public health committee.
It is not clear whether Judge Covello's ruling will take effect immediately or whether the hospitals will continue to pay the taxes until the Supreme Court issues its decision, expected in the spring of 1995.
This is the second time this year that a Federal judge has struck down provisions of the state's program to provide financing for uncompensated care.
In March, Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Federal District Court in New Haven ruled that similar measures were in violation of the Erisa law. That case, filed by District 1199 of the New England Health Care Employees Union, prompted the Legislature to modify its program, replacing strict price controls on hospital services with a revenue cap.
But Judge Covello ruled that the changes did not substantially affect the original ruling, as the taxes remained in place. "Statutes that have a substantial economic impact on Erisa plans, causing such plans to either increase costs or reduce benefits, are pre-empted by Erisa," he wrote.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Trying to Make the Numbers Add Up

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HERNDON, Va., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Bargaining representatives for major league baseball players continued to crunch numbers today and into the night to see if there is any room for negotiations on a new tax system team owners have proposed in hopes of ending a strike that has shut down the game for more than three months.
The union said the numbers in the owners' proposal were too punitive, but that they would continue to study the framework of the plan to see if there was room for discussion. For their part, the owners said they believe they are moving closer to the players' desires by tabling the concept of a "hard" salary cap, meaning a rigid one that would, according to the union, artificially limit salaries. 
 These new round negotiations, which will enter a third day at a suburban hotel here Saturday, remain cordial. But much work remains. That was evident in the descriptions of just what is transpiring at the table.
On Thursday, the owners proposed a tax designed to benefit the low-income clubs by taxing any club that crosses a payroll threshold of $34 million. They called their offer significant.
The players, who struck on Aug. 12 and had not witnessed any significant change in the owners' posture until Thursday, did not embrace the idea. Especially unsettling to the players are the numbers, which they say could stifle clubs' spending and therefore hold down player salaries.
Still, the players did not reject the framework today. They explained that they do not yet know enough about it. They also said that they do not yet know if that framework can, with some major or minor tinkering, be made into something all parties can use to end what has become the longest work stoppage in professional sports history.
"The numbers they plugged into their taxing system produces punitive rates -- that's clearly the case," Gene Orza of the Players Association said after a night of crunching numbers with the union's economists and before a two and a half hour negotiating session.
"It's obvious the numbers they plugged into their system will not fly," Orza continued. "The question is whether or not the system itself provides the basis for further discussions."
The answer to that question could come as early as Saturday morning. "It's very encouraging that we're going to continue to meet," said John Harrington, the managing partner of the Boston Red Sox who heads the owners' negotiating team. "Hopefully, we'll see a response and a counterproposal from the union tomorrow."
The second day of discussions on the tax proposal were conducted under the watch of Bill Usery Jr., the mediator called into the three-month-old baseball strike by the Clinton Administration. In the session, the players raised a number of questions and, Orza said, met with a "lot of good answers."
Then, Harrington said, "When the answer to the numbers evolved, that led to philosophical discussions on how the numbers shaped up."
Harrington also said that philosophical barriers were crossed, namely, he said, "the dropping of the hard cap. Not just abandoning it, but pulling it to the side."
It is a process that isn't guaranteed to end Saturday, or even Sunday because, said Donald Fehr, head of the union: "You have to gather information, you have to evaluate it, you then have to make sure you can duplicate what they did. If you can't, you don't understand what they did. Or they don't understand what they did, one of the two. That process has to go on as long as it has to go on. And it's not over, yet."
There is an indication that the discussions are medicinal in themselves. "They are being more candid," one person in the room said of the owners, whose proposal and interpretations were expanded on by the Phillies' Dave Montgomery and the Braves' Stan Kasten today. "In the past, we didn't have any discussions. At least now they're giving an effort."
The owners, while answering questions on the tax, also still have on the table the salary cap, which they first proposed June 14. However, it has been revised and, at least for now, pushed aside by the tax discussions.

HEADLINE: For the Young, Bright and Bored;
Long Island School Rescues Youngsters in Academic Limbo

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON STATION, L.I.

 BODY:
Barbara Reiser felt pleased with her son Brian's new school after a teacher called last month with the results of the boy's first math test.
He had failed.
"Brian had never really been challenged in school before," Mrs. Reiser said. "But now he can't coast. It's a great learning experience for Brian. I expected him to be beside himself. But he handled it really well." 
 Brian is a 12-year-old who had become so bored at the public school he once attended that he would laugh at the textbooks. "Look, Mom," he would sometimes say at the start of a school year, "it's the same book I had last year only with a different cover."
But before Brian got lost in academic limbo, his parents enrolled him in the Long Island School for the Gifted, one of a few private schools in the nation whose classes are tailored to address the needs of bright children whose needs are not being met by the public schools.
The school, which requires I.Q.'s of at least 130, was founded in 1980 by Carol Yilmaz and a group of parents like her whose children found school boring and unchallenging. Mrs. Yilmaz's daughter Robyn, for example, had begun to sour on school by first grade because she was so far ahead of her peers.
Today, Robyn is a Harvard graduate, and the school her mother founded is flourishing, with 225 students. Last month, the school earned a rare distinction when two of its graduates were named the only New York State Advanced Placement Scholars for 1994. To be considered, a student must complete at least three college-level courses in high school. The two graduates of the school completed more than 10 such courses.
Mrs. Yilmaz sees the awards as confirmation of the critical role the school has played in cultivating the potential of the so-called gifted child.
"Every child deserves a good education," said Mrs. Yilmaz, who is now the school's director. "And gifted children need educations that challenge their unique abilities."
At a time when an increasing number of revenue-strapped school districts across New York State are eliminating programs for the gifted, schools like the one run by Mrs. Yilmaz are becoming alternatives of last resort for many children and their parents.
"The fact that districts are reducing programs for the gifted indicates that they don't see them as necessary as other programs," said Dr. David J. Irvine, who coordinates such programs for the State Department of Education. "That's why they are more vulnerable to changes in the economy."
Some parents and educators have long argued that classes for intellectually talented children are unnecessary, promote elitism and deprive other classes of brighter students.
In addition, critics say the special classes are merely a way to keep middle-class children in the public schools in places where students from poorer families, often black and Hispanic, predominate.
But advocates of such programs contend that intellectually talented children often become bored in mainstream classrooms and never develop the kind of good work habits that would help them get ahead.
Of the 40 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade nationwide, about two million can be classified as gifted, according to estimates by the Federal Department of Education. People who are considered gifted possess a wide range of talents, including I.Q.'s that are approximately 30 points above the average of 100.
"Many of these kids really need to be challenged in a special way in order for them to grow," said Roberta Tropper, the principal of the School for the Gifted. "But many people have this perception that gifted children don't need any special help because they already have an advantage. And that's just wrong."
Mrs. Yilmaz said that early on, Robyn felt frustrated with her schooling.
In nursery school, she was asked to color in letters with crayons even though she could already read. And by the first grade, Robyn knew how to multiply and divide while the rest of her class was learning to add and subtract.
"The school is really the product of a lot of frustration," Mrs. Yilmaz said. "That's why I can understand the anguish that so many parents feel in seeing their children not being challenged and becoming underachievers."
The school opened modestly, with 14 students inside the classroom of a synagogue in Freeport. Today, it shares a building with a branch of Adelphi University and has kindergarten through ninth-grade classes. Yearly tuition is $5,600 to $6,700, compared with the average annual per-pupil spending of $10,941 in public schools on Long Island and $8,556 statewide. The school has managed to keep tuition low by holding fund-raising drives and paying its teachers far less than the median for Long Island teachers of $62,898 a year.
Students are assigned to classes on the basis of their understanding of a subject rather than their age. So a child might be in a fourth-grade class for one subject and a fifth grade for another.
There are between 4 and 15 students in each class. They study advanced topics at a younger age than at other schools. In kindergarten, for instance, children are taught Spanish and science.
School officials take great pains to dispel the stereotype of these talented children as bookish and insulated. But the students display a decidedly academic flair, from humming along with the classical music that echoes through the hallways to discussing articles from newspapers that are handed out each day in homeroom.
A class of fourth graders seemed perfectly at ease probing the concept of positive and negative space during a recent lesson in contour drawing.
"I get it," Henry Mathies said, interrupting his teacher as she tried to explain the concept. "Can we start drawing now?"
Many parents say that their children would simply flounder without such a thought-provoking environment.
Consider the case of Carol Eisner of Lloyd Neck, L.I., who enrolled her 12-year-old son, Gregory, in the school five years ago. He had shown remarkable ability from early on, a boy who by age 3 could recite the lines in about a dozen storybooks.
"He would just say the words and turn the pages like he was reading," his mother said. "But he really wasn't reading. He had just memorized the stories from all the times we read to him."
He also developed a knack for math between the ages of 3 and 4. In a favorite drill, he would have his parents quiz him with math problems as they traveled in the family car. "Give me numbers," he would shout to them from the back seat.
But his intelligence seemed to become stifled when he began first grade at a public school.
One telling episode involved his refusal to complete several problems on the first page of his math book as his teacher had instructed him. Instead, Gregory did the harder problems on the last page.
Rather than encourage him, the teacher reprimanded Gregory.
"I just thank God we found the right school for him," Mrs. Eisner said. "Otherwise, he would have been lost."
Similarly, Brian Reiser, the boy who came to the School for the Gifted this year, had been complaining about school since fourth grade. To him, the subject matter had become painfully repetitious.
"The third grade was probably the last year I learned a decent amount of stuff," he said. "In the fourth grade, we basically reviewed what we learned in the third grade. And in the fifth grade, we reviewed what we learned in the fourth grade. There were some new things, but not enough."
His mother didn't know what to do. "I was at wits' end," she said, recalling Brian's occasional but emphatic collect phone calls from school. "He kept nagging and nagging."
But now he finds school stimulating and enjoyable. He has turned his math scores around by doing something that wasn't as necessary before: studying. "I've never really liked school," Brian said. "But this place is great -- for a school."

HEADLINE: Market Loses Ground; G.M. at 52-Week Low

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market drifted lower yesterday with trading distorted by the expiration of options, known as "double witching." General Motors, a leading stock, also drifted lower and established a new 52-week low, capping a nearly monthlong decline.
But bond prices were stable, and the dollar rose, helped by news of a narrowing of the United States' trade deficit with Japan. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.79 points, to 3,815.26, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.10 points, to 461.47. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.17 points, to 764.67.
Only four stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where there were 801 advancing stocks and 1,422 decliners.
Days when different kinds of options expire simultaneously are known as either double or triple witching, depending on how many kinds of options expire, because of the mischief they are said to prompt.
On these days, prices have bounced wildly, and trading volumes have surged enormously, as traders have scrambled to use or lose options to buy or sell stock. But the very expectation of mischief has tended to breed restraint, so market distortions have moderated in recent years.
Yesterday, for example, the Dow swung only 42 points from its lowest point to the highest, and that action was extended over more than three hours. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average with 362.7 million shares changing hands, but only 25 percent above this year's average of 290 million shares.
In addition, the closely watched trade deficit figures were released yesterday, but the report affected the currency markets more than the stock market. The overall United States trade deficit widened 4.6 percent, to $10.1 billion. But a 7.4 percent narrowing of the deficit with Japan to $5.4 billion helped the dollar, which rose to 98.56 Japanese yen in New York trading, from 98.30 yen on Thursday.
Most interest rate-sensitive stocks fell following Tuesday's increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The Standard & Poor's auto index, continuing a nine-month decline, fell to its lowest point of the year, 200.3.
General Motors, despite a meeting with analysts on Thursday, fell enough yesterday to establish a new 52-week low of 37 1/2 before closing at 37 3/4, down 3/4.
Bank stocks dropped, too, amid concern that rising interest rates would hurt profits. Citicorp fell 5/8, to 43 3/8; Chase Manhattan fell 1/2, to 35 1/2, and First Chicago fell 1, to 47 1/4.
Still, some groups rallied. Biotech stocks rose in the wake of Amgen's agreement to acquire Synergen, which prompted speculation of further consolidation in the biotech industry. Amgen fell 3/16 , to 56 7/8, while Synergen rose 321/32 , to 91/32 . Cephalon rose 1 1/2, to 9 1/4; Systemix rose 1 3/4, to 14 3/4, and Chiron, which is in talks to sell part of the company to Ciba-Geigy, was up 2 3/4, to 78 1/4.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.19 points, to 252.30, and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.09 points, to 444.04.
Of the Dow industrials' 30 component stocks, 19 fell, led by Goodyear Tire, which slid 1, to 33 3/4. Of the S. & P. 500's component stocks, 318 fell, led by General Motors.
The most active stock, at 7.6 million shares, was the initial public offering of the Sports Authority Inc., a sporting goods-chain, which closed at 24. It is the second unit of Kmart to be sold to the public; Officemax went public earlier this month.
In Tokyo, stocks were lower yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 34.01 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 19,302.56. The Nikkei was up 18.2 points for the week.

HEADLINE: What Turkey Gives in Return for U.S. Military and Foreign Aid;
Arming Genocide

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Deadly Gifts to Greece and Turkey" (editorial, Nov. 13): 
 This century has experienced more acts of genocide than any other period: the Turkish extermination of the Armenians in Anatolia, followed by the genocide of the European Jews by the Fascist alliance, and near genocide in Bosnia, Rwanda and Iraqi- and Turkish-occupied Kurdish territories. These acts of mass extermination have coincided with the invention, introduction and sale of Western-made weapons.
 The more weapons are introduced anywhere, the more likely are war and genocide. This is particularly true for Turkey. Except for a minor contribution of troops in the Korean War, the weapons the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has supplied to Turkey have been used primarily against its own population. For example, the military coup in 1960 by Gen. Cemal Gursel led to the execution of the civilian Prime Minister, Adnan Menderes, and his foreign, interior and finance secretaries.
 NATO-supplied arms were used in the conquest of the Republic of Cyprus and its forceful partition. They are continually being turned against the Kurdish people, who have occupied southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq for thousands of years. These acts have been made possible by contributions from NATO and, more particularly, the United States.
 Turkey suffers from inflation of nearly 2,000 percent. Fresh drinking water is scarce. Transportation, housing, health, employment and safety are at a crisis level. How will the introduction of thousands of tanks and hundreds of fighter planes help anyone other than the ruling military oligarchy?
 And what does the United States have to gain by emboldening one of the most ruthless security organizations in existence? We need to consider what such shortsighted policy will do to the trust accorded the United States as a civilized country when we ask other countries to refrain from using or developing nuclear weapons and reduce their conventional weapons.
 How can I, a Kurd, ask my people to overlook the suppression and torture of 15 million Kurds in Anatolia, expedited by American-contributed weapons, and only pay attention to the few truckloads of canned foods sent to the 2 million Kurds in their native reservation in Iraqi-occupied Kurdistan?

HEADLINE: Fed's Vote in September

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted 11 to 1 against raising interest rates at their Sept. 27 meeting, even as they saw signs that inflation might accelerate next year, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
"The ongoing inflow of information on the performance of the economy continued to indicate a significant potential for higher inflation down the road," the minutes said. 
 Indeed, the Fed's policy makers decided at their most recent meeting on Tuesday that short-term interest rates needed to be increased for the sixth time this year to keep inflation in check.
Still, the central bankers concluded at the September meeting that the slow growth of the nation's money supply meant inflation was unlikely to accelerate immediately.
While policy makers on the Fed's Open Market Committee did not raise rates in September, they took the technical step of voting for a shift toward favoring higher rates rather than stable rates.
The only dissenting vote was cast by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., who urged an immediate rate increase that would respond to "signs of increasing price pressures and rising inflationary expectations," the minutes said.
The minutes show Fed policymakers were apprehensive that inflation might soon accelerate. "The risks of some rise in inflation rates probably had increased," the minutes said. And Mr. Broaddus said there was an additional risk: "A delay in implementing some monetary policy tightening would incur a substantial risk of a further increase in inflationary expectations."
Even so, the minutes show, other members of the policy-making committee were unsure whether earlier interest rate increases were already cooling the economy enough to keep prices from accelerating.

HEADLINE: September Trade Gap Widened

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The United States' trade deficit widened in September as a vigorous domestic economy drew in a rising tide of imports while export sales ebbed, the Commerce Department said today.
The gap between overseas sales of American-made goods and services and the value of all imports widened 4.6 percent, to $10.1 billion, from $9.7 billion in August. Exports fell, while imports, led by record purchases of foreign oil, increased for the fifth consecutive month.
"We're still an economy spending more than we're producing," said Robert Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. The widening came in part because the United States economy is growing much more strongly than the economies of Europe and Japan.
The deficit with Japan, however,shrank 7.4 percent in September to $5.4 billion -- the lowest since $4.4 billion in May. Japan regularly accounts for more than half the United States' total annual trade deficit, and the deficit with Japan has often been cited by the Clinton Administration in its efforts to open Japanese markets to American products.
The United States' trade deficit with Western Europe also narrowed, to $1.56 billion in September from $1.62 billion in August.
But the trade deficit with China surged 8 percent, to a record $3.5 billion. The deficit with Canada, the United States' biggest trade partner, grew to $1.45 billion, from $954 million in August.
Total exports weakened in September by five-tenths of 1 percent, to $59.67 billion.
Among exported goods, the Commerce Department said, sales were down in September for industrial supplies and materials and for a range of consumer goods as well as cars and parts.
Imports increased for a fifth consecutive month, rising three-tenths of 1 percent, to a record $69.8 billion. Imports of foreign-produced oil jumped to a record 261 million barrels in September from 241 million barrels in August. The previous record was 249 million barrels in June.
Lynn Reaser, an economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the trade report showed the vigor of the economy. But she said that it also pointed to a leveling-off in the big monthly deficits with Japan and suggested that the trade picture should improve for the United States in 1995.
"I believe over the next year our export growth will begin to outstrip import increases," she said.
Accelerating recoveries in Japan and Western Europe should add buying power in those markets for goods that competitive American manufacturing industries will be in a position to supply.
Talks are currently under way in Tokyo on Japanese proposals to cut regulations that critics contend stifle trade opportunities in fields ranging from agriculture and financial services to auto parts and trade.
The Clinton Administration is also pushing for approval of the GATT world trade agreement, which, the Administration says, would open new export opportunities.
In September, the deficit in merchandise alone widened to $14.6 billion from $14.1 billion in August. The surplus on services was up to $4.5 billion, from $4.4 billion in August.
During the first nine months of 1994, Commerce Department officials said, the total deficit in goods was running at an annual rate of $148.8 billion. At that pace, the 1994 deficit would rank second to the record annual gap, which was $152.1 billion, set in 1987.

Mexico Trade Increases
 DALLAS, Nov. 18 (Special to The New York Times) -- United States exports to Mexico rose 21.7 percent, to $37.5 billion, for the nine months since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect Jan. 1, the Commerce Department reported today.
Imports rose 22.8 percent in the first nine months of the year, to $35.7 billion, but the trade surplus with Mexico, at $1.8 billion, was virtually unchanged.
"Nafta is working for the United States," Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown said today. "It provides a concrete example of the benefits of free trade."
Mr. Brown said that increased exports to Mexico were responsible for 130,000 jobs, and that Congressional passage of the world free trade agreement would multiply such benefits. Opponents of the North American pact, however, say that the Administration has understated the resulting job losses.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Narrower Trade Deficit With Japan Helps the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most leading currencies yesterday after a report showed that the United States trade deficit with Japan narrowed in September.
Despite a widening in the overall trade deficit to $10.1 billion from $9.68 billion, the imbalance with Japan slipped 7.4 percent, to $5.4 billion in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday. 
 A smaller trade deficit with Japan means that Japanese exporters have fewer dollars to sell for yen when they repatriate profits.
The deficit with Japan has also been a source of concern for many investors because they fear that the Clinton Administration may try to shrink it by seeking a lower dollar, which would make make imports from Japan more expensive.
In trading in New York, the dollar rose to 98.56 yen, from 98.30 yen on Thursday.
Although the trade gap with Japan is narrower, it is still large. Japan regularly accounts for more than half the annual trade deficit of the United States. The gap has put pressure on the value of the dollar, which is still near its record low of 96.42 yen, set in intraday trading on Oct. 25. Several currency dealers said yesterday that the news that Sony was writing $2.7 billion off the value of its American movie subsidiary suggested that the conglomerate might be selling yen for dollars.
"The view is that when Sony made their investment in Columbia Pictures they would have hedged it by buying yen," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "So if they're eliminating $2.7 billion off their books they would be unwinding that hedge."
But several traders said the possible fallout from Sony's financial difficulties was an excuse used by some traders who had taken a more positive outlook toward the dollar after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
The Swiss franc, meanwhile, fell on rumors of an imminent cut in official Swiss interest rates. A denial by the Swiss National Bank failed to support the currency. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.3185 Swiss francs, from 1.3055 on Thursday.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.5548 German marks, from 1.5522 on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.5655 from $1.5710.

HEADLINE: Treasuries End Mixed On Slow Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in lackluster trading yesterday.
The bond market received support from strength in the dollar and option expirations, analysts said. An attractive price of 97 for a December bond option helped underpin a late morning rally that pared the worst losses of the session. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond came off earlier lows to finish unchanged at 921/32 for a yield of 8.12 percent. Prices of shorter-term maturities were unchanged to slightly lower.
Concerns about the ability of the market to absorb next week's large supply of new two- and five-year notes weighed down prices yesterday. Lukewarm demand for the notes in when-issued trading has prompted dealers to squeeze yields a little higher to generate interests.
A two-year note was offered yesterday at a price to yield 7.28 percent, while the yield on a five-year note was 7.81 percent. Both notes were up a couple of basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. The Treasury plans to auction $17.25 billion in two-year notes on Monday and $11 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday.
The market received a small lift from a stronger dollar, which makes bonds more attractive to foreign investors. The dollar gained yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit with Japan narrowed in September.
But the overall trade deficit widened 4.6 percent for the month. The fear among investors is that the widening gap between United States imports and exports could drive the dollar lower, discouraging foreign investors from buying American bonds.
Some market analysts said yesterday that the market appeared due for an upturn. Bond prices fell on Thursday and Wednesday, and some say the market is becoming oversold. But any rally will be limited because investors continue to cash in on every uptick in the market.
Robin Mesch, chief analyst for fixed-income products at Thomson Research in Portland, Ore., said investor interest on the long bond had been been piling up at a price to yield 8.13 percent, or 9226/32 , in the cash market. "The market has run into congestion, and I anticipate there will be a massing of buyers at around that level," Ms. Mesch said.
"Next week, I think you'll see some directional movement initiated from a price of 9621/32 in futures trading," she said. "The time is ripe for the market to test one extreme of the trading range. But I think those gains will be capped at a price of 9818/32 for a yield of about 7.99 to 8 percent."
In the municipal market, where tax-exempt mutual funds have been hit with shareholder redemptions because of the rise in interest rates and loss of value, mutual funds continued to sell bonds to raise cash, causing bonds to slump for a third day.

HEADLINE: BANKING;
Trust Officers' Mission Broadened by New Law

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks 

 BODY:
IN literature, as in life, trust officers have been characterized as the most conservative of creatures, unwilling to take even minor risks with the money they manage. Tales abound of family assets that were depleted by inflation or of investments that far underperformed the financial markets.
In their defense, trustees have long said that they are hamstrung. A large body of law makes preservation of capital -- and thus risk avoidance -- their primary objective, explained Isabel Miranda, director of the trusts and estates department at Citibank in New York. 
But change is coming. On Jan. 1, the Prudent Investor Act takes effect in New York, which joins more than a dozen states in broadening the trustees' mission beyond capital preservation. The law was heavily promoted by corporate trustees and estate lawyers, who find clients increasingly concerned about investment performance.
"It's a major milestone," said Mary B. Lehman, managing director of private advisory services for the New York City office of the Bankers Trust Company. "Trustees will now be able to act like regular money managers."
The new law instructs the trustee to invest with an eye toward overall return, instead of limiting the trustee to the safest investments with the least chance of capital loss. Blue- chip stocks could be supplemented by small-company shares, for example.
Investments like stock options or international stocks may also be used. These vehicles, while risky in and of themselves, may actually reduce the volatility of an overall portfolio by rising when other holdings decline. The suitability of such investments will be based on the needs of the beneficiary and on the prevailing economic climate.
The law will no longer protect the trust officer who remains narrowly tied to bonds or bank deposits if those investments are likely to erode the value of the trust during a period, say, of high inflation.
Ms. Lehman said beneficiaries could now demand that trustees develop an investment strategy that met their needs -- not just one that preserved principal.
As an example, she cited a trust established for a widow and her two children. If the widow's primary need was income, the trust might have invested primarily in bonds to generate income while preserving principal. Under the new law, the longer-term needs of the children will have to be considered, requiring some assets to be devoted to growth investments.
The law does not go far enough for some. Trustees cannot normally be threatened with dismissal simply because their performance falls short of some benchmark.
"Why should they knock themselves out for performance when they have the assets locked up?" asked Standish Smith, the founder of Heirs, a group based in Philadelphia that advocates greater rights for trust beneficiaries. Heirs would like beneficiaries to be able to change fiduciaries for competitive factors like performance and fees. Right now, most state laws make such changes onerous unless egregious acts can be shown.
Without the threat of competition, corporate trustees will not be motivated to hire the high-priced talent needed to make trusts into strong performers, Mr. Standish said.
But he applauds the New York law as a step in the right direction, suggesting that beneficiaries should write or call their trust officers, alerting them to the change and letting them know the kind of strategy they would support.
Ms. Miranda agreed. "If a family really wants an aggressive strategy and we can document that fact," she said, "we can do a lot more. We can even use derivatives."
Not in all cases though. The wording of the trust document can take precedence over the new law, said Arlene Harris, a lawyer with the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in Manhattan. If the trust creator specified a strategy, like maximizing income over growth, the trustee is still bound to comply.

The United States trade deficit widened by 4.6 percent in September. Imports increased for the fifth consecutive month. But the deficit with Japan -- which accounts for more than half of the overall deficit -- narrowed by 7.4 percent. [Page 41.]
Skoda is trying a bold experiment in auto production in an effort to improve quality and cut costs. The Czech company is giving suppliers their own place inside the assembly plant. The method takes the "just in time" system, which is widely used in auto assembly plants in Japan and the West, a leap forward. [41.]
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned that the defeat of the world trade agreement known as GATT could have "a very negative effect on the financial markets of this country." [11.]

British Aerospace sweetened its offer for VSEL to $905 million, seeking to defeat G.E.C. in the takeover battle. [44.]
R. H. Macy will close the venerable I. Magnin specialty chain ahead of its merger with Federated Department stores. Nine of the Magnin stores will be put up for sale and the rest will be converted into either Macy's or Bullock's outlets. [44.]

The Economy
Curbs on certain derivatives are being prepared by regulators from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The regulations would be the first to require certain sellers of derivatives to determine whether these potentially volatile financial securities are suitable for their customers. [41.]
 
Markets
Stocks faded as options expired and shares of General Motors fell to a 52-week low. The S.& P. 500 index dropped 2.09 points. [42.]
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged. Bonds were helped by the dollar but were hurt by concerns over a large supply of new notes coming to market next week. [45.]
The dollar strengthened against other currencies, bolstered by the narrowing of the United States' trade deficit with Japan. [53.]
Crude oil prices declined ahead of an OPEC meeting next week. Analysts expect the meeting will not lead to a reduction in global supplies. Coffee prices fell, while sugar climbed. [53.]
 
Your Money
Flexible spending accounts have survived, remaining a way for the typical family to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Some employers had feared the accounts would be eliminated in an overhaul of the nation's health care system. [38.]

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Macy to Close I. Magnin Specialty Chain

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Getting ready for its merger with Federated Department Stores next month, R. H. Macy & Company said today that it would close the venerable I. Magnin specialty chain by putting nine of its stores up for sale and converting the remaining four into either Macy's or Bullock's outlets.
Federated apparently rejected an 11th-hour $40 million bid for the entire chain from Jerry A. Magnin, whose great-grandmother founded the flagship store in San Francisco in 1876. That store is one of the nine to be sold. 
 Federated contends it can generate higher proceeds by liquidating Magnin's inventory and selling the sites -- which are either in hard-to-obtain downtown locations or high-end malls -- than by selling the ailing chain intact, Mr. Magnin said in an interview.
He said a revised bid for the remaining nine stores would be impractical. "You have to own it all or nothing," said Mr. Magnin, who owns two Ralph Lauren Polo Stores in Los Angeles. "I don't think there is any value there once you run a going out-of-business sale. It ruins your credibility."
He made the offer to save 2,000 jobs and to preserve a business he maintains is viable and an institution, which passed from family hands in 1944.
Carol Sanger, a spokesman for Federated, declined to comment on the offer.
After reviewing Magnin's prospects, Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that a high-end specialty operation was inconsistent with the aim of the company to expand its core department store businesses.
In addition, he said, Magnin "is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the combined company's bottom line in the future."
Yet, Macy's last-ditch effort to revive California's premier specialty retailer, known for its high-priced designer salons and elegant ambiance, showed progress.
Last year, Macy's closed five underperforming Magnin sites and tried to broaden the clientele by adding cutting-edge designers. Revenue rose to $329 million in 1993, compared with about $275 million the year before.
At its peak in 1990, Magnin had 31 stores in five states and revenue of $440 million.
"It's the death of the dowager empress of luxury retailing in the West," said Alan Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report, an industry newsletter.
Magnin has fallen upon hard times in recent years by straying from California, where profits were stretched too thin as the chain lost economies of scale in apparel buying and advertising. In addition, the chain failed to attract younger customers.
Moreover, Magnin's old-world customers, who still spend more on Chanel than any other brand, began to defect. The chain has lost market share to larger rivals like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Federated intends to convert the Magnin stores in Palm Desert, Woodland Hills, Palo Alto and Walnut Creek, all in California, to Macy's or Bullock's.
The remaining nine stores are to be sold piecemeal or as a group. These include at least two gems. The flagship San Francisco store in Union Square is a local landmark with a cathedral-sized ceiling. And the recently refurbished Beverly Hills site on Wilshire Boulevard, adjacent to Rodeo Drive, is sandwiched among Saks, Neiman Marcus and Barneys.
The Magnin catalogue is to be folded into Federated's existing direct mail business.
The sites "make a great opportunity for a retail player to make an acquisition and create a franchise in California in one fell swoop," said Joseph B. Rubin, a managing director of Kenneth Laventhal & Company, which represents some creditors in the Macy bankruptcy proceedings. He gave no estimate of what price the stores might fetch.

HEADLINE: What's New York The Capital Of Now?

BYLINE: John Tierney writes the Big City column for this magazine.

 BODY:
The classic New York Answer to the question is, of course, the world, but these days it sounds a little dated. When I hear it, I think of Dick Falk, who used to work in a dingy office above Times Square and billed himself as Broadway's greatest press agent. He loved to boast that he was the model for Sidney Falco, the 1950's P.R. man played by Tony Curtis in "Sweet Smell of Success," and it was hard to decide which was more endearing: that he wanted to associate himself with one of the most reptilian characters in the history of film, or that his boast was a blatant lie.
When I met him, three years ago, he was 79 and his business had dwindled to a few clients, among them a "psychic to the stars" and an actress named Suzie Sunshine. One afternoon, as he was in the process of being evicted from his office, he sat at his desk in front of his manual typewriter showing off yellowed Walter Winchell columns and explaining his world view.
"To me, 42d Street is the most beautiful street in the world!" he declared with a booming voice and a straight face. "It's the center of the earth, and I'm it! I'm actually 42d Street!" 
 At first I dismissed this as preposterous even by Falk's standards, but later a more frightening possibility occurred to me. Maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he was 42d Street. Maybe Dick Falk, sitting there reminiscing, was the essence of New York in the 1990's: short on money, living on old glories, stuck with obsolete technology, oblivious to the local decay and blind to the forces elsewhere that are killing the city's traditional industries.
The port that created the city and became the world's busiest now handles less freight than Houston or the Port of South Louisiana. Tokyo has far surpassed New York as the home of the world's largest corporations. Most of the factories that made New York the manufacturing capital of America have closed. The country's richest businessman operates from Seattle, and Los Angeles has as many writers and musicians as New York does. People around the world get much of their news from Washington and Atlanta; when the information highway arrives, they'll get even more entertainment from Hollywood and Silicon Valley than they do now. New York is trying to lure the masses back to 42d Street -- the city has been reduced to virtually bribing Disney to open an outpost -- but for now, Dick Falk's beautiful street is a strip of porn shops, vacant storefronts and empty theaters. This he called the center of the earth?
No, it doesn't look like the capital of the world anymore -- until you consider the alternatives. What other landmark could another city's publicist point to as the planet's hub? The Tokyo Stock Exchange? CNN Center? The intersection of the Hollywood and Santa Monica Freeways? That would take even more gall than Dick Falk had. Some people argue that the concept of a capital is obsolete in the age of Internet and Federal Express -- that new communication and transportation technology is replacing the old hierarchies with diffuse networks. But that argument ignores the history of urban civilization. Long before modems and airplanes, there were technologies that revolutionized the flow of information and goods to the provinces: the Roman Empire's roads, the printing press, postal services, the telegraph, railroads, the telephone. Yet the capital cities just kept getting bigger and more important. In the 1980's, despite the personal computer, more workers than ever crowded into the central business districts of New York, Los Angeles, Frankfurt and London.
These workers complained about the crowding -- urban dwellers always have -- but it was the crowding that brought them there. New York's congestion makes possible what economists call "agglomeration," a process that concentrates talent in the most densely populated cities. Thanks to its density, even a decaying New York has remained the national or world capital of, among other things, advertising, art, book publishing, classical music, dance, diamonds, fashion, finance, foundations, law, magazines and newspapers, management consulting, media conglomerates, museums, opera, restaurants, corporate takeovers and theater. Manhattan's infrastructure may be crumbling, but it still has the buildings and the subways to sustain a population density that no other American city will ever be able to match. On a typical weekday, 3.4 million people occupy the 10 square miles between 61st Street and the Battery.
You could call New York the capital of crowding, but that term suggests forced unpleasantness, when in fact New Yorkers willingly pay a premium to work and live in densely populated neighborhoods. They know that more people means more possibilities as well as more problems. A better term would be one that connotes the salutary effects of having people and places close to one another: the capital of propinquity.
Propinquity, manifest in the world's most famous skyline, remains New York's greatest asset, but it's not enough to guarantee the city's future. Hong Kong, Tokyo, Lagos and Bombay are crammed with people and buildings, yet none of these cities have the international influence of New York. These cities, as well as past world capitals like Rome, Paris and London, lack the other great asset of New York -- a quality that made the city grow and will have to be revived if New York is to sustain itself. The best way to understand this quality is to go back to its origin, three centuries ago. It was then that Manhattan achieved its first distinction -- as the capital of profanity.
IN 1654, A GROUP OF 20 JEWISH REFUGEES from Portuguese Brazil sought shelter on Manhattan, much to the displeasure of the colony's leader, the Calvinist Peter Stuyvesant. It was bad enough that the island already had Lutherans. Now, he complained, there were "blasphemers of the name of Christ" whose "customary usury and deceitful trading with the Christians" threatened to "infect and trouble this new colony." He sent word back to Amsterdam asking for permission to banish the Jews. But there was a problem.
New Amsterdam, unlike Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia, was not founded by religious visionaries. The Dutch West India Company did not send its ships on a sacred mission to establish a city upon a hill. It was financed by private subscribers with a profane motive. The guiding principle was that a colony should "tend to the benefit of the subscribers," and some of those subscribers in Europe happened to be Jewish. They reminded the company directors in Amsterdam of the "immense and great capital" they had sunk into the company's shares. The Protestant directors listened to their investors, considered the possible revenue to be gained from additional settlers in the colony and denied Stuyvesant's request. In fact, they informed him, they were sending more Jews to settle Manhattan. "The message was clear," Oliver E. Allen writes in his history, "New York, New York." "Commerce took precedence over conformity, profits had priority over vague and disputable moral principles. Money was the ultimate measure."
The Dutch lost control of the island the following decade, but New York's essential profanity endured. In the 1690's, it became the capital of piracy, thanks to a corrupt British governor's willingness to let pirates bring booty from around the world to sell to the town's cooperative merchants. (Captain Kidd had a mansion on Pearl Street.) Moral orthodoxy was impossible to impose on a diverse population with no homogenous upper class. New Amsterdam had been cosmopolitan from the start -- in 1643, a visiting missionary reported that the 500 settlers spoke 18 languages -- and the conquest by the British produced longstanding tensions between the Dutch merchants and the new rulers. One result was the first newspaper war. Opponents of the governor, upset by the official newspaper's biased coverage, started a rival paper that mocked the authorities. Its publisher, John Peter Zenger, was prosecuted for libel, and his acquittal in 1735 was the world's first major court decision affirming freedom of the press. New York was becoming the capital of free speech, and not only in print. The infamous New York street talk was also taking shape, as John Adams noted during a visit in 1774.
"They talk loud, very fast, and all together," Adams wrote in his diary. "If they ask you a Question, before you can utter 3 Words of your Answer, they will break out upon you, again -- and talk away." He complained that "with all the Opulence and Splendor of this City, there is very little good Breeding to be found," a common lament among the upper classes of Boston and Philadelphia. They could comfortably look down on New Yorkers as unruly, money-grubbing provincials during the 18th century, when Boston and Philadelphia were the largest and most sophisticated cities.
But New York did have its own advantages: an enormous harbor and the commercial instinct to take advantage of it. In 1818, a shipping line revolutionized transportation by introducing America's first regularly scheduled service to Europe, and in 1825 the Erie Canal linked the port with the heartland. The year before the canal opened, Gov. De Witt Clinton predicted that the city "will in the course of time become the Granary of the western world, the emporium of commerce, the seat of manufacture, the focus of great moneyed operations and the concentrating point of vast, disposable and accumulating capital." Except for the part about the granary, he wasn't wrong.
The port was profanity (and propinquity) at its finest: next to the docks, along South Street, were the offices of merchants, who continually spotted opportunities nearby for what we now call synergy. They used the profits from shipping to establish banks and insurance companies. They constructed and provisioned their own ships, making New York the capital of shipbuilding and meatpacking. New Yorkers dominated the cotton trade by offering loans to Southern plantations, and as the cotton passed through New York they used it to manufacture cheap clothes for sailors and slaves, thereby establishing the garment industry. The ships brought Europe's news to New York before anyplace else, so New York became the capital of the industry that relayed the news to the rest of the country.
New York was the nation's financial capital by the 1830's, and the manufacturing capital by the 1860's, which served only to reinforce its standing as the capital of bad taste. As Mark Twain summed up the reputations of the nation's leading cities: "In Boston they ask, How much does he know? In New York, How much is he worth? In Philadelphia, Who were his parents?" New York's old money tried to maintain standards, but new money triumphed, both in Edith Wharton's novels (the old guard was forced to socialize with the nouveau riche) and in real life.
The defining moment for New York society came in 1883. Mrs. Astor, the socialite who determined New York society's 400 members, decreed the Vanderbilts ineligible for her annual ball because they were new railroad money. Mrs. Vanderbilt retaliated by planning a larger ball in her larger mansion, shrewdly using a new social weapon: media buzz. Advance publicity in the newspapers made the ball an event every young woman in New York, including Mrs. Astor's daughter, wanted to attend. Mother made the ultimate sacrifice: Mrs. Astor went up Fifth Avenue in her carriage and sent her coachman into the Vanderbilt mansion with her calling card, and society was permanently profaned.
New York became the home of cafe society, its membership determined by gossip columnists, nightclub owners and fashion designers. Money or celebrity was enough to qualify any newcomer for the aristocracy. With new money eventually came culture, too. When the Vanderbilts were excluded from boxes at the Academy of Music, they and their friends built the Metropolitan Opera. (Andrew Carnegie built his own hall.) The shift in the nation's cultural capital was personified by William Dean Howells, the country's leading man of letters. In the 1880's, he left the Atlantic in Boston to write for Harper's in New York, and he wrote a novel, "A Hazard of New Fortunes," about this experience. In it, a crude, swaggering New York publisher sadly shakes his head when an erudite New Englander proposes editing a national magazine from Boston. "Wouldn't do," the New Yorker says. "You might as well say St. Louis or Cincinnati. There's only one city that belongs to the whole country, and that's New York."
New York was a new kind of cultural capital, one not dominated by universities or by the national institutions of European capitals. It was run by commercial interests that catered to popular tastes across the country. It was open to any new idea that turned a profit: new kinds of vaudeville and Broadway shows, new music from Tin Pan Alley, new magazines like Time and new media like radio and television. The city itself offered artists proximity to one another along with a large, rich, cosmopolitan audience that welcomed innovation. New York was one of the first cities in the world to embrace Wagner's operas. When modern art was shunned by the old guard at the Metropolitan Museum, it was championed by commercial galleries and by millionaires who built rival museums.
After World War II, with Europe in ruins and America ascendant, even a nonpublicist could comfortably call New York the world capital. It lacked the physical charm of Paris and London, but it offered propinquity; it lacked their social graces, but its profanity welcomed newcomers. In the early 1960's, Tom Wolfe visited London and reported on a new phenomenon he called the mid-Atlantic man. Ambitious New Yorkers had traditionally learned sophistication by going to the old-world capital, but now the process was being reversed. Ambitious Londoners were aping New York manners and embracing the city's vulgarity in order to escape the provincial snobbishness of Britain's class system. These mid-Atlantic men would go to horrendously expensive lunches at the Four Seasons, emerge onto 52d Street and marvel at the hideous new office towers: "Not a good building in the lot, but jaysus, the sheer incredible yah! -- we've-got-it money and power it represents. The Rome of the twentieth century -- and, because wealth and power are here, everything else follows, and it is useless for old England to continue to harp on form. The platter of the world's goodie sweets tilts . . . to New York."
In retrospect, that moment looks a lot like New York's zenith. Thirty years later, if you go to the Four Seasons for lunch you will find New York's publishing elite complaining about the city's decay, moaning about the death of the book, marveling at the money and power of Hollywood. But before you take their laments too seriously, before you write New York off as a capital, you should consider a question: Why are they still paying horrendous prices to have lunch here?
WHEN TECHNOPHILES envision the death of capital cities, a future in which urban dwellers flee to the Rockies and happily telecommute to a small central office in an Atlanta suburb, they're describing a possibility that has pretty much existed for decades in the book-publishing industry. There is no longer any technological requirement for publishing to be in New York. The industry originally flourished here because New York was a manufacturing center and a transportation hub. Harper & Brothers became the country's leading publisher in the last century after the Erie Canal reduced shipping costs and enabled the firm to undersell regional publishers. But eventually, thanks to other forms of transportation and rural printing plants, New York's publishers found it cheaper to print books elsewhere. They could have economized long ago by moving their headquarters and letting editors rely on a perfectly adequate information highway for transmitting manuscripts: the postal service.
Yet today, New York is still home to 6 of the 10 biggest American book publishers, and New York publishers generate nearly half of the industry's revenue. The reason is to be found at the Four Seasons or at Michael's on West 55th Street, where literary agents and editors convene at lunchtime to see who is eating with whom. Technology may make it possible to process digital information in the Rockies, but there is more to business than digital information. Editors want to do more than process manuscripts. They want to gossip and hear new ideas and demonstrate that they have the expense accounts and the status to merit good tables. New Yorkers make fun of articles about power lunches and diagrams of who sits where at restaurants -- but they read them.
New York is the capital of lunch, and leaving the capital can be risky, as William H. Whyte discovered. Whyte, the author of "The Organization Man" and "City: Rediscovering the Center," spent 16 years on city streets watching and filming urban propinquity -- analyzing, for instance, the way business lunches would end with the participants loitering outside the restaurant, idly chatting with one another and with acquaintances who strolled by. He wondered how much economic sense it made to sacrifice that kind of spontaneous interaction. Over the past two decades, he looked at 38 companies that had fled New York, and he made two interesting discoveries.
One was that the firms' new suburban locations, supposedly chosen purely for the economic benefit of the company, nearly always happened to be conveniently close to the chief executive officer's home. The other discovery was that these firms' economic performance in the decade after the move was significantly worse than that of comparable firms remaining in New York. The companies had found bigger offices in the suburbs, Whyte concludes, but had lost something more valuable: word of mouth.
"Increased communications and travel have not obviated face-to-face interchange; they have stimulated it," Whyte observes, citing the growing number of business conferences and workshops being organized. "Many meetings are convened at airport motels, which shows you how far people will go to be face to face. But the city is still the prime place. It is so because of the great likelihood of unplanned, informal encounters." To maintain urban spontaneity, Whyte believes that a city sidewalk needs at least 1,000 pedestrians per hour -- a density that many older American cities' downtowns can no longer sustain. But New York still has sidewalks that attract 10,000 pedestrians per hour.
"Talented people want to be near other talented people, and the miracle of New York is that it has the physical compactness to make that possible," says Peter D. Salins, the director of Hunter College's urban-planning program and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "We've inherited an incredible physical endowment that's not going to go away. There's a well-established economic literature on what's called central-place theory, which explains why the leading businesses and most talented people are concentrated in the city with the greatest density. There are exceptions -- the oil industry is in Houston and movies are in Los Angeles to be near the production centers -- but once a city becomes the core, it's hard for people to secede. They can't suddenly decide that Houston is the new accounting capital or Atlanta is the new advertising capital."
Cities in the South and the West have eroded New York's dominance of many industries and professions, and companies have for years been shifting manufacturing and back-office work out of the city, but New York remains a capital for those who depend on getting information first and making deals. The nation's 3 biggest media companies are in the city, and 9 of the top 15 are in the New York area. New York has two of the three largest newspapers, and it generates nearly half of the magazine industry's sales revenues. The city is home to the three leading television networks and to new cable networks like MTV, USA, Lifetime and A&E. The media need to be near Madison Avenue, the world's advertising capital, which has 4 of the world's top 10 agencies and generates more than 40 percent of America's advertising.
New York has 5 of the Big Six accounting firms, 7 of the nation's top 10 management-consulting firms and more lawyers employed at leading law firms than any other city. Wall Street handles nearly half of all the securities traded publicly in the world. New York is no longer the home of the world's biggest banks -- most of them are in Tokyo -- but its bankers are the world leaders in innovation. The hostile takeovers of the 1980's were examples of the city's vintage profane style: the triumph of upstart bankers and lawyers from the wrong schools whose ungentlemanly tactics offended the traditional white-shoe firms.
All of this commerce has produced the country's greatest concentration of wealth -- the city's 30 richest people have a combined worth of more than $45 billion -- and the wealth continues to buy culture and glamour. New York has displaced Paris as the capital of the art and fashion worlds. It is the international creative center for dancers and choreographers. As an opera capital, New York ranks with Milan and Vienna. The Metropolitan Opera, like Broadway and other New York cultural institutions, is continually criticized for being too conservative; it's true that much of the innovation in the performing arts takes place in the provinces. But the innovators who want to be certified still have to come to New York to be properly judged. New York has the biggest audiences, the most influential critics and the most demanding standards. As a city crammed with striving neurotics trying to be noticed and willing to excoriate any rival, it is the capital of attitude.
To an out-of-towner, this often translates as the capital of obnoxiousness -- or at least the co-capital with Paris. But New Yorkers, unlike Parisians, have traditionally promised newcomers a chance at full citizenship rights: anyone with talent can have just as much attitude as the natives. That promise is why the city has attracted the terminally ambitious -- why Madonna, when she wanted more than Michigan had to offer, bought a one-way ticket to New York and told the cabdriver who picked her up at the airport, "Take me to the middle of everything." (True to Dick Falk's cosmology, he dropped her off on 42d Street.)
This isn't the unconditional promise on the Statue of Liberty about welcoming the huddled masses. A better symbol for New York would be a statue of a bouncer in an Armani suit standing outside a nightclub, surveying the huddled masses behind the velvet rope and deciding who has the style to be admitted.
The night brings out the primal urges for society and glamour that draw people to cities. During the day they might be happy alone with a computer in the Rockies, but a night of celebration is by definition a night on the town. It requires lights and crowds, which is why couples pay for the view from the Rainbow Room, why masses endure the horrors of Times Square on New Year's Eve and why New York is still the international capital of 1 A.M.
Unfortunately, you can also be sure that when it's 1 A.M. in New York, there are people here who want to be anywhere else. They are lying awake listening to car alarms and wondering if the panhandler at the corner takes home more pay than they do. They are thinking that New York has become the capital of aggravation. They are considering joining the hordes of New Yorkers who during the past decades have left the city in disgust. During the 1980's, only the enormous number of immigrants kept the city's population from shrinking.
The exodus from New York has been blamed on the same problems that have been hurting other old cities: highways in the suburbs, the international shift in manufacturing jobs and national social problems like drugs and crime. Certainly, these factors have hurt. But New York is not just another city. It has lost factories, but it's still the center of some of the fastest-growing industries in the world. It still has flourishing businesses and affluent citizens who want to stay in the center. Detroit can blame others for its plight, but the capital of the world created its own problems. Three centuries after Peter Stuyvesant, New York finally got religion.
The city;s spiritual regeneration began with Fiorello La Guardia, the Mayor who enjoyed attacking slot machines with a sledgehammer. He was elected in 1933 to rid the city of Tammany Hall and the likes of Jimmy Walker, the genial gambler and adulterer who had recently resigned as Mayor during a municipal graft scandal. Mayor Walker had been a believer in laissez-faire government. He often didn't get to the office until noon, and he dismissed criticism of his high salary by explaining: "That's cheap! Think what it would cost if I worked full time." La Guardia never stopped working to promote his moral agenda, his vision of the city upon a hill: "I dream! But my dreams rest me. Sometimes I see the City of Tomorrow. . . . I see a city with no slums and little poverty. It will be a reality someday."
His city was not the emporium of commerce celebrated in the 19th century -- La Guardia disdained the city's greedy capitalists. The City of Tomorrow required selfless public servants. La Guardia built the nation's first housing project, took over the subways from private companies and established welfare programs and job programs. To pay for a budget deficit and the expanded municipal work force, he instituted a sales tax -- just 2 percent, but a tradition was born. Over the next five decades, his vision became the city's moral orthodoxy: where there is darkness, let there be government. The capital of profanity became the capital of civic piety.
Large numbers of the nation's poorest and least employable were attracted by the offerings of this capital, and these new New Yorkers were tended to by a new priestly class that went on expanding even after the city stopped growing. New York's population today is lower than it was in 1960, but the number of municipal employees has nearly doubled, and they are so busy doing social work and enforcing regulations that they have had to cut back on details like cleaning streets and educating children. The national perception of New York as the epitome of urban problems isn't entirely accurate -- its crime rate, for instance, is lower than many other cities'. But New York has earned its reputation as a capital of high taxes, generous welfare benefits, public-housing expenditures, elevated union wages, unrepaired bridges, abandoned and dilapidated buildings, neglected parks and corporate flight. In the past three decades, as the tax burden has nearly doubled, the number of Fortune 500 headquarters here has shrunk from 130 to 30. Business executives are becoming reluctant even to visit New York. The city is a logical place for national business gatherings, but the number of conventions has been plummeting because of high hotel taxes.
For many people, the city has become the capital of inhospitality. Just like Peter Stuyvesant, today's moral guardians have an innate bias against anyone new and unfamiliar. The city offers subsidies to big established businesses that threaten to leave, but it taxes small new ones to the hilt and discourages entrepreneurs with mandarin regulations. It guarantees cheap housing to longtime residents but leaves newcomers to fend for themselves in a housing market ruined by price controls. Rent regulation is the quintessence of modern New York piety -- social justice through the outlawing of greed -- and it has been the greatest physical disaster in the city's history.
Before such regulation was instituted in 1943 -- at La Guardia's urging -- New York's housing stock had been among the world's finest, built and maintained by landlords who often had to compete fiercely for tenants. After rent regulation, they stopped building, stopped taking care of their buildings and walked away from 500,000 apartments. As a result, neighborhoods have been ruined and there has been a perpetual housing shortage, which economists cite as a textbook case of stupidity. "Next to bombing," says Assar Lindbeck, the chairman of the Nobel Prize committee for economics, "rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique so far known for destroying cities, as the housing situation in New York City demonstrates."
But give New York credit: It is still somehow standing. It has had the astonishing capacity to survive its own good intentions. Most other welfare states have collapsed. For all that its government has done to discourage newcomers, the city still attracted more legal immigrants last year than any city in the country. True, many of them came here because they had little choice -- the quality of life and the taxes were even worse in their native countries -- but their arrival keeps New York's profane tradition alive. Immigrants not only shake up the old guard with their new ideas, they export New York's culture home. They turn New York into a capital of salsa and Zairian music, and they create a market in other countries for New York's fashion and media industries. These are the kinds of links that will be crucial if the city is to remain a world capital.
In some ways, New York's prospects today are just as promising as they were when the Erie Canal was built. Then, when Europe was dominant, it prospered by being the most European city in America; now, when the buzzword is global markets, it is the most cosmopolitan city in the world. Then it dominated crucial industries of the industrial age; now it dominates crucial industries of the information age. Then it was an upstart city trying to lure talent away from established capitals; now all it has to do is persuade them to stay. Then its inhabitants were renowned for their boorish ingenuity; now, despite all the economic growth and innovation on the West Coast, New York's reputation for hustling is still intact. The difference between the coasts was summed up in a lament from Waylon Jennings: "Too Dumb for New York City, Too Ugly for L.A."
At the moment, Los Angeles is the only city with the potential to replace New York as the world capital. It has the entertainment industry and its proximity to Asia's burgeoning economies. But Los Angeles's growth is slowing -- economists now doubt an earlier projection that it would eventually surpass New York in population -- and California's taxes and regulations are threatening to make it an even more righteous place than New York. Then there are the earthquakes. And even its car culture has become less fashionable. Los Angeles's television producers have returned to New York for the setting of 6 of the country's top-rated dramas and situation comedies. The most popular attraction in Los Angeles now is a shopping promenade designed with the revolutionary look of . . . a city street!
New York already has plenty of those streets, and if they weren't so unpleasant and expensive most people would probably prefer them to the imitation. Today, the idea of restoring basic amenities to New York can seem more utopian than La Guardia's vision, because the city has to contend with so many entrenched interests: the people hired for the City of Tomorrow are not about to give up their jobs easily. But today's politicians are at least promising to make radical changes, and it would be a mistake to underestimate New York's resilience. In 1972, when Johnny Carson moved the "Tonight" show to Burbank, he said that new technology was rendering New York's appeal obsolete: "People are so much more sophisticated. They get live programs from all over the world, by satellite. So you're not going to impress them by broadcasting from New York. Those days are over." Three years later, one of the most successful shows in television history began with the announcement, "Live from New York, it's 'Saturday Night'!"
And 20 years later, the "Tonight" show itself was relegated to second place by a show broadcast from Manhattan. David Letterman's persona obviously had something to do with his victory, but it probably helps that he's broadcasting a few blocks from Dick Falk's old office. It really does look like the center of the earth some nights -- or at least a lot closer to it than Jay Leno ever gets. Letterman sits in front of the New York skyline; Leno sits in front of a vista of glass buildings promising all the glamour and romance of a suburban office park at night. Letterman can walk out the door to find a crowd on Broadway; Leno can walk out to a parking lot. New York will never be the capital of convenient parking, nor will it ever be the City of Tomorrow, but it will always be the kind of place where a native of Indiana can prosper by finding himself next door to two enterprising merchants from Bangladesh. Propinquity and profanity, thy names are Sirajul and Mujibur.

HERE'S HOW THINGS work at the Center of the Universe, also known as New York City:
 
LET'S SAY A REPORTER FOR a certain New York newspaper rushes back from Florida with a story that the First Lady, before anyone ever heard of her, had a real talent for playing the horses. Seems that in one day alone, with just a minor bit of counseling from her husband's political pals, she turned a $100 bet into $1,000 and then, in a year, she had a $1 million bonanza to finance the start of their campaign for the White House. The reporter's editors think that's a helluva yarn and run it at the top of their front page. 
 So Rupert Murdoch comes home late from a dinner party and finds the early edition of this paper with his doorman and glances at page 1 during the elevator ride up. Wow! He quickly calls his paper, now going to press, to say that much as he dislikes copying news from youknowwho this is too good to ignore; let's give it a ride even if we can't get a picture of her at the track; just be sure the other tabs and the London papers don't have track pictures either -- and then use a photo of her studying what could be a tout sheet through thick-rimmed glasses.
When Dan Rather wakes up next morning, a few blocks away, he finds the story on his breakfast tray in both mass and class papers and figures it's dynamite, really big. He decides that the way to build on it creatively is to persuade the White House that it's not a fair story until they have a chance to explain and fill in the background. He tells his producers to plan for a four-minute segment, but to get someone on the President's staff to answer whether this was a one-time fluke or a secret habit of the First Lady's; whether she paid taxes on the million; who were the unnamed advisers and what did they get out of it -- and, by the way, are any of her favorite horses still running somewhere so we could shoot them in time for tonight to get some live action?
AT DAVID LETTERMAN'S morning gag conference over on Broadway and 53d, they think the story is perfect for the Top 10 tonight: the top 10 reasons why the First Lady couldn't do it a second time ("The Secret Service won't let her into the stables" or "Her bookie won't risk doing business at his new desk in the Justice Department"). They figure that Leno is sure to come up with a gag or two, but never 10!
Simultaneously, at Ogilvy & Mather, over on West 49th, they're wondering whether the First Lady would give a direct endorsement to a favored client -- the Hialeah track -- or how to phrase a question for her next news conference that would at least get her to mention Hialeah on tape. They're saying she really liked the agency's stuff in her husband's last campaign, so it's not such a long shot.
And at Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, at West 54th Street, they're plotting out a public relations campaign to keep the story alive: anything about the joys and profits of betting would sure please the New York Racing Association and might even attract some new clients.
Camilla Nickerson, the very hip fashion editor of Vogue, senses the excitement about the story while lunching at the Royalton. She puts out a rush call to photo agencies: the First Lady in jodhpurs please -- at any age -- to go with the quick production out at Belmont of a 10-page spread of jockey silks transformed for evening wear. Ralph Lauren offers her a billowy blouse that can be adapted for the shoot; Isaac Mizrahi promises a full line of designs in 48 hours.
That night, one of Vogue's messengers discreetly calls Hong's sweatshop down on Canal Street and next morning Hong's summons two dozen extra pieceworkers to turn out knockoff blouses and matching peaked caps, in all sizes, so they'll be ready to supply department stores just as Vogue hits the stands. A contingent order from Bloomingdale's ("The blouses can't be direct copies of any shown by an American designer. . . . ") arrives that night.
NOW WORD OF A new wrinkle in fashions flashes back uptown, to Macy's and Saks, to the Fashion Institute and all the silk goods dealers in the West 30's. The blouse makers alert other garment shops: the jockey silks will need appropriate pants and a new line of skirts. The streets between Fifth and Seventh Avenues throb with joy at this unexpected explosion of orders, not only from domestic suppliers but also exporters and foreign buyers in town for the annual fashion shows over in Bryant Park.
So down on Wall Street, they're puzzled for a few hours over the quick 3-point jump to 24 1/2 in the stock of Federated Department Stores. But when the gain holds through the day, the big brokerage houses uptown figure it out; Merrill Lynch's overnight forecast of an extra lift for the clothing industry throughout the United States stimulates an even stronger rally in the better retail stocks. The buzz at all the exchanges downtown -- that consumers are shedding their last inhibitions in time for Christmas -- sends other stocks soaring and even brings some signs of stability for bonds.
BACK IN ROCKEFELLER Center, the editors of Business Week doubt that the London and Tokyo traders really understand the sudden boom in New York, but the sudden optimism everywhere seems worthy of a cover story. The magazine's explanations are fairly wide of the mark ("The weak dollar seems finally to have made all American goods competitive again, although economists would have expected such a phenomenon to reveal itself more gradually. . . . A good share of the credit, therefore, must be assigned to the President, whose persistence in pushing for approval of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs [GATT] promises rich rewards for all the industrial economies.") -- but some kind of explanation is the imperative in journalism.
A block away, at Time, they also guess GATT but they think GATT's a bore and grope for a different angle: the President has sunk so low in public esteem that maybe now is the time to signal the start of his dramatic recovery; this week's remarkable economic news is sure to lift his approval rating and may soon restore his clout in Congress. It'll work as a Time cover, the editors decide, so long as the caption, "Comeback Kid," is hedged with a question mark. The cover will show the President, wearing green and white jockey silks, astride a donkey soaring above the White House. The story will start, "In a sprint worthy of a thoroughbred. . . . "

HEADLINE: What's New York the Capital of Now?: Reinvention;
At the Corner of Permanence and Change

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP; David W. Dunlap writes about real estate and gay life for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE CABLE BUILDING STANDS AT THE JUMbled intersection of Greenwich Village, SoHo and the East Village, a juncture it commands with self-assured stateliness. Behind its calmly imposing facade, however, is a hive of cultural, entrepreneurial and political activity.
Among the 140 or so tenants renting studios or offices there are the kinds of people who are shaping the post-industrial city: artists and architects and activists, record producers and magazine publishers, set designers and graphic designers and robot designers. Whit Stillman, the independent film maker, has his office there, as does Charlotte Sheedy, a literary agent whose clients include Lani Guinier and Marilyn French. What they like about the place is the offbeat tenancy, the communal spirit, the pliant spaces and decent light within, along with the feel of the surrounding neighborhood -- all of which adds up to being in a vital building in a vibrant part of New York at a dynamic time. 
 The Cable Building, which opened at the northwest corner of Houston Street and Broadway in 1893, is an industrial-era structure that has managed to transcend its moment; not only by being an important historical artifact, but by being well situated and adaptable. Like so many of New York's buildings, it has remained young by remaining usable.
Its builders would scarcely recognize the products and services that make up the Cable Building's economic profile today. But they would have no problem understanding why it endured.
When the building opened, The New York Times noted that the floors were "especially adaptable," given their exceptionally large area, bright lighting and absence of partitions. Designed by McKim, Mead & White, the Cable Building began its life as the nerve center and musculature of the short-lived Broadway cable-car system. Steel cables, turned by huge steam engines, emerged from the basement and ran along channels under Broadway down to Bowling Green and up to 50th Street. Streetcars gripped these moving cables through a slot in the street and were towed along at up to 30 miles per hour.
These "long yellow monsters," as Stephen Crane called them, were faster, more dependable and more humane than the horse-drawn cars they replaced. Their heyday was shortened by the development of electric trolleys, however.
In 1901 the Broadway line was electrified. But the building itself was spared obsolescence. It was given a second life at the turn of the century by apparel makers and the flood of European immigrants they employed as cheap, semi-skilled labor. Yiddish, Italian and Spanish could be heard above the din of machinery within the building's thick walls. Perhaps only once in eight decades did their frenzied work come to a halt, on an afternoon in March 1958 when the lobby was pressed into service as a temporary morgue for the bodies of two dozen garment workers who were killed in a flash fire next door.
There were still milliners, handbag makers and a lingerie manufacturer in the Cable Building when Neil Cooper arrived in 1980, with his then-one-year-old Reachout International Records, known as ROIR. The company was devoted to the new music scene that emerged in the clubs and lofts of lower Manhattan in the late 70's, and it released albums by James Chance, Lydia Lunch and 8 Eyed Spy, the Fleshtones, the New York Dolls and Suicide. The building remains a place to be for record company people: Black Rose Records, a dance-music label that was founded by Tony Rose and Jeanette Smith, has its office there.
Artists and art dealers also began leasing space in the building. Keith Haring arrived in the early 1980's. He had a studio on the fourth floor and an office on the seventh floor, which he covered in Day-Glo graffiti. Art and fashion found each other in the 80's, and not surprisingly the building's tenants at that time came to include Details magazine and the fashion designer Giorgio Sant'Angelo, whose couture showroom was in a basketball-court-sized converted penthouse atop the building.
If any single tenant is responsible for keeping the Cable Building on the map in the 1990's, it is Joseph Saleh, who opened the six-screen Angelika Film Center five years ago, after clearing the basement of huge gears, trusses and leftover cable from 100 years earlier. As a landlord in the 1970's, Saleh had noticed the influx into the city of young, childless, college-educated couples, and it was these New Yorkers he set out to lure with a mix of foreign-language films and independent American movies. Stillman's "Metropolitan" was shown at the Angelika before its commercial premiere in 1990. He shot several brief scenes for "Barcelona" in Room 808 of the Cable Building and held the opening for the film downstairs earlier this year.
Besides being home to so many cultural enterprises, the Cable Building houses not-for-profit political groups like the Empire State Pride Agenda, a statewide organization that lobbies on behalf of gay and lesbian New Yorkers. The building is also something of an incubator for young businesses like NAFT International, which designs, installs and maintains computer graphic systems. The company had a single employee three years ago. Now it has 35.
And so a steady electronic hum has come to replace the rumble of steel cables and the racket of sewing machines. But everyone is still working too hard.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Supreme Court to Rule On Frequent Flier Miles

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DO airlines have to keep their promises to the millions of members of their frequent flier plans? And what if they don't?
While the all-American response may be "see you in court," the answer did not appear nearly so simple in an argument before the United States Supreme Court this month. In American Airlines v. Wolens, the Justices have agreed to decide whether airlines can be sued for consumer fraud or breach of contract in connection with retroactive changes in the value of frequent flier miles. 
 Since there is no provision of Federal law permitting lawsuits of this kind against airlines, any such suits would have to be brought in state court under state law. And that is the problem facing some four million members of American Airlines' AAdvantage program, the industry's pioneer frequent flier program.
The four million were members of the program between 1981, when it started, and 1988, when American suddenly announced that travel using frequent flier miles would be subject to blackout dates during holiday periods and to capacity controls limiting the number of free seats available on popular flights. Crying foul, several members brought a class-action lawsuit in the Illinois state courts seeking to recover the diminished value of their accumulated miles. The Illinois courts have permitted the suit to go forward.
But the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 pre-empts state laws that have the effect of "relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier," a provision the Justices interpreted broadly just two years ago when they ruled that state Attorneys General had no authority to regulate the airlines' advertising of air fares under state consumer fraud laws. Those regulations "related to" air fares and services, the Court said. So does state regulation of frequent flier plans, American is arguing in its Supreme Court appeal, asking the Justices to throw the lawsuit out.
American and its allies in the industry portray this case as a watershed that will determine the economic viability of frequent flier programs. Without capacity controls, "frequent flier programs would simply become too expensive," American told the Court in its brief. Industry-wide, frequent flier miles were redeemed last year for some 11 million award certificates.
But no matter who wins at the Supreme Court -- and from the argument, it appeared quite likely that the Justices would keep at least a portion of the lawsuit alive -- the airlines are highly unlikely to walk away from the programs, at least not until someone comes up with a better idea for building passenger loyalty.
"Frequent flier programs are integral and necessary to the airlines even if they have to some extent become victims of their own success," Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, said in an interview. The monthly consumer-oriented publication keeps track of frequent flier developments.
"Without frequent flier programs, there's only one other way for an airline to compete, and that's price," Mr. Petersen said. If American loses this case, he said, airlines might become more careful in making changes in their programs, offering more "plain vanilla" and fewer innovations.
Caution has already set in, propelled by market considerations as well as the fear of lawsuits. USAir has given its frequent fliers months of notice for the increase from 20,000 to 25,000 miles it will require beginning Jan. 1 for a round-trip coach flight within the continental United States and Canada.
United Airlines specifies in its frequent flier literature that changes "may affect the value of the mileage or certificates already accumulated" and that members "may not rely on the continued availability of any award or award level" -- disclaimers that did not prevent disgruntled frequent fliers from suing United in Illinois, where the case is currently pending in trial court.
During the argument on Nov. 1, the Justices barraged the lawyers with questions and were noticeably engaged by the case. Although the Court's public information office would not say, it was hard to resist the conclusion that at least some of the Justices are among the 30 million members of frequent flier plans, or at least know someone who is.

HEADLINE: Getting Through the Maze Of Mortgage Insurance

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
LIKE many first-time home buyers, Sandy Murphy undertook a crash course on the mortgage market before closing the deal. In books, newspaper articles and meetings with his mortgage broker, he learned about loan-to-value ratios and lifetime caps. He also scrutinized amortization tables and pondered the pros and cons of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans.
"It's a little overwhelming," said Mr. Murphy, a civil engineer from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. 
 Few aspects of Mr. Murphy's tutorial, however, were as complex as mortgage insurance.
"People don't know much about it," said Paul S. Marshall, a professor of management at Widener University in Chester, Pa., and an expert in real estate finance. "Their mortgage brokers or bankers will simply tell them when they need it, and the borrowers are generally happy just because they can qualify."
Mortgage insurance -- a product that has, for the most part, grown steadily in popularity in the last five years -- should not be confused with home insurance, which protects an owner's property in cases of fire, flood or other calamities. Rather, mortgage insurance shields either the lender or the borrower, depending on the type of policy, against default, death, disability and even downsizing.
Caveat emptor: Mortgage insurance is not always needed, even when a borrower has little money for a down payment. Moreover, it's costly; homeowners, who are generally unaware of alternatives, pay thousands of dollars for some policies.
"It's quite expensive and probably rightly so," Mr. Marshall said. "It's not so much a case of borrowers' being ripped off, as there is a lot of risk in low-down-payment loans to lenders and insurance costs money."
By far the most common type of mortgage insurance is private mortgage insurance, or P.M.I. Lenders usually require borrowers to accept P.M.I. if they make a down payment of less than 20 percent. Generally, the policies can be rescinded when the loan-to-value ratio, also known as the L.T.V., falls below 80 percent, or, conversely, when the borrower has at least 20 percent equity in the home.
Unlike the other lesser-known forms of mortgage insurance -- mortgage life, mortgage disability and mortgage unemployment -- P.M.I. protects the lender rather than the borrower in case of a default. In other words, if a borrower defaults on the mortgage payment, the borrower still loses the home. Private mortgage insurance reimburses only the lender for any loss incurred in taking back and selling the home.
The amount of private mortgage insurance in effect has more than tripled in the last three years, spurred in part by the refinancing boom of 1992 and 1993; many home buyers who refinanced found that their loan-to-value ratio had, because of the recession, increased to more than 80 percent, and they were forced to buy P.M.I. if they wanted a lower rate on a new mortgage.
The increase in private mortgage insurance also reflects a recent surge in first-time home buyers, many of whom are still struggling to make even a 10 percent down payment, largely because home prices, even with the declines in the early 90's, had increased sharply in the inflationary 70's and early 80's. Private mortgage insurance was also less common in the 70's and 80's because a larger percentage of the home sales were trade-ups.
"We have seen our P.M.I business increase threefold in the past 12 months from 5 percent of originations, primarily due to the first-timers," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of Homerica Mortgage Corporation, a mortgage broker and banker in Harrison, N.Y., and Westport, Conn.
Premiums for private mortgage insurance vary depending on down payment size and the length and type of mortgage. Generally, the larger the down payment, the smaller the premium. Premiums, usually, are also lower for fixed-rate and 15-year mortgages than for adjustable-rate mortgages and 30-year loans.
The premium, for example, for a mortgage with 10 percent down might be as low as 0.40 percent of the total loan in advance (or as high as 0.65 percent) and 0.34 percent each subsequent year until the loan balance falls below 80 percent of the home's value. Thus, someone who puts $10,000 down, borrows $90,000 for a $100,000 home and has a policy that calls for 0.40 percent to be paid up front will pay $360 in mortgage insurance at closing, and $306 a year, or $25.50 a month, until the loan balance falls below $80,000. With 10 percent down on a $100,000 home, a 30-year mortgage with an 8 percent interest rate and zero appreciation, it will take about 9 years and four months to amortize the loan to 80 percent. That means the borrower will pay $3,114 in insurance until the policy can be canceled.
IF a home's value appreciates 3 percent a year, someone with the same loan will have a loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent in three years and two months. During those three years, though, the borrower will pay $1,278 ($360 plus 36 monthly payments of $25.50) in private mortgage insurance. Such an amount may seem minuscule and the accrued costs may appear manageable, but even paying $1,278 for P.M.I. over three years can be a pricey proposition if a borrower considers that the premiums are, essentially, interest payments on money they are borrowing until they have 20 percent down.
"It's like buying real estate with a credit card," Mr. Marshall said.
How? The $1,278 is the equivalent of a 4.26 percent annual premium paid over three years on the $10,000 the borrower lacked for a down payment. Add that 4.26 percent to the 8 percent or 9 percent on the mortgage, and the total annual interest being paid while the policy is in effect tops 12 or 13 percent. Worse, P.M.I., in most cases, is not tax deductible, unlike mortgage interest.
"If you really must have that house but don't have the cash for a down payment, I would suggest trying every other alternative first before paying the bank what amounts to an outrageously high price for borrowing a few extra grand," said Marc Eisenson, publisher of The Banker's Secret Bulletin, a newsletter in Elizaville, N.Y., that specializes in mortgage financing.
"And that includes asking parents or other relatives or taking the cash value out of a life insurance policy and, of course, continuing to rent until you have the full 20 percent saved up."
James H. Hunt, an actuary with the National Insurance Consumer Organization, a research group based in Alexandria, Va., did just that when his daughter bought her first home. "I lent her $15,000, which was the amount she needed to have 20 percent down and escape P.M.I.," he said.
Private mortgage insurance becomes even more costly if the lender, as it often does, requires payments until a homeowner has accumulated 25 percent in equity. Lenders are also not required to notify borrowers that they can drop P.M.I.; cancellation of a policy is done only at the home owner's request.
Moreover, lenders in some states, like Connecticut, may keep P.M.I. in effect as long as they like, even, theoretically at least, for the life of the loan. Though many lenders in these states usually allow cancellation of private mortgage insurance if there is 20 to 25 percent equity in the home, they sometimes also look at other factors and keep the policies in effect. For instance, a homeowner who has 25 percent equity but has a history of late payments or just lost a job may find their lender unwilling to drop P.M.I.
Another catch: Equity of 20 or 25 percent often has to be built up through loan payments rather than appreciation. And either way, home owners will have to pay for an appraisal to cancel the policy.
"While P.M.I. is often rumored to end when your equity reaches the 80 percent level, that's not carved in stone, and it's not automatic," Mr. Eisenson said. "It's probably going to be up to you to make sure the policy gets canceled, and it may not be easy."
Borrowers may also find that insurers may delay or deny a P.M.I application even after the mortgage application has been approved by the lender. Indeed, about 10 to 20 percent of P.M.I. applications are rejected, according to industry estimates.
Rejections aren't always because of a borrower's finances, either. Mortgages on co-op studios are often rejected by private mortgage insurers because they represent a higher risk of default.
So, with all the negatives associated with P.M.I., why would anyone buy it? Usually, they are borrowers who don't have the 20 percent down payment or a friend or relative who will lend them the money, and they are perhaps overeager to buy a home.
Mr. Murphy, who bought a $304,000 three-bedroom colonial on a quarter-acre in downtown Fairfield, Conn., with 10 percent down, said he didn't want to borrow the balance needed for a 20 percent down payment, and continuing to rent wasn't appealing.
"I had read an article in The Times about a couple who were considering doing that and investing the difference," he said. "We thought about that a little, but with the baby on the way and rates going up we were somewhat motivated to buy."
There are other alternatives, though. Aside from staying put and saving up the 20 percent down payment or getting a friend or relative to help, the next best way to circumvent private mortgage insurance may be to have the seller finance part of the down payment. This generally only works, though, if the seller is desperate and the buyer puts at least 10 percent down.
"HAVING the seller take back part of the mortgage is definitely something that's good to do if the buyer doesn't have 20 percent," Mr. Lublin said.
(In Mr. Murphy's case, this wasn't practicable. "The seller was being relocated, and they were just going to turn the house over to a relocation service," he said.)
Yet another way is to find a lender who self-insures mortgages with less than 20 percent down; these loans are sometimes called "no P.M.I." mortgages. Such loans carry higher interest rates for the life of the loan, but if a buyer is planning to be in the home for only a few years, and the seller won't finance part of the down payment, it may be cheaper than carrying private mortgage insurance.
These loans, however, usually require unblemished credit, verifiable income, low-risk properties and a firm "28-36," meaning that the borrower must have housing debt of less than 28 percent of monthly income before taxes and total debt of no more than 36 percent.
"I try in any way possible so that they don't have to pay that insurance," said Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a mortgage broker based in Manhattan. "It is very expensive, and I don't think it is cost-effective if there is another way."
FOR borrowers who feel they have no choice but to take private mortgage insurance there are different types of P.M.I. policies. The traditional policy requires an upfront fee that can be as much as 1.35 percent of the total loan for a very low down payment and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages. A newer type of policy, though, called "monthly P.M.I.," does not require the upfront fee. The rate on the monthly P.M.I. policy, however, is higher. (Both types of private mortgage insurance usually require two months escrow at closing.)
Mr. Murphy, who took out a $274,000 mortgage, chose monthly P.M.I. for his "10-1" loan, a mortgage that has a fixed interest rate for 10 years and then adjusts annually thereafter. He will pay 0.52 percent instead of 0.34 percent for a comparable traditional policy, and his premiums will amount to $1,424.80 annually ($118.73 monthly) instead of $931.60 ($77.63 monthly).
He is, though, saving $1,781 in P.M.I. upfront costs that would have been paid at closing. So, the total amount he is paying in private mortgage insurance will be less with the monthly P.M.I. at least until sometime between the fourth or fifth year of the mortgage, when the traditional policy would become less expensive.
"We are planning to prepay our mortgage to build up our equity to 20 to 25 percent fairly quickly," Mr. Murphy said.
A less common form of paying P.M.I. and avoiding the high initial costs involves borrowing the upfront money and paying it back by adding it to the mortgage principal. The main benefits of this method over "monthly P.M.I." is that the interest being paid on the borrowed money is tax-deductible, and the monthly payments are no higher than with traditional P.M.I. The main drawback is that the payments on the up-front money continue for the life of the loan; they do not end when the P.M.I. policy is canceled.
"No one wants to put money up front," said Keith Kantrowitz, president of Power Express, a mortgage banker in Great Neck, L.I. "Everyone wants to get in as cheap as possible."
"A lot of people are short upfront money, particularly first-time buyers," he added.
Though private mortgage insurance is the most common form of mortgage insurance -- it's become almost synonymous -- there are other forms, and they are quite different.
Mortgage life insurance, for example, pays off a mortgage when a borrower dies, so that the decedent's heirs get to stay keep the home. Like P.M.I., these polices appear inexpensive; premiums are as low as $30 a month (for nonsmokers in their 30's) on a $100,000 mortgage and are simply added to the monthly mortgage payment.
For most people, though, a mortgage life policy is as costly as P.M.I, if not more. Further, other types of insurance can usually achieve the same result at far less cost. "Those who can qualify for inexpensive term life insurance should forget about mortgage life," said Mr. Hunt of the National Insurance Consumer Organization.
Even so, mortgage life remains somewhat popular as a niche product; in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, $42.3 billion of coverage was in effect, according to the American Council of Life Insurance, a trade organization in Washington, D.C.
That number is dwarfed, though, by the size of private mortgage insurance coverage; $136.9 billion worth of P.M.I. policies were written in 1993 alone, according to the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, another trade organization in Washington.
The amount of mortgage life insurance has also been shrinking in recent years. Several reasons, including a weak real estate market, at least until 1993, and less interest from borrowers, are often cited.
Some insurers, however, claim that the statistics on mortgage life insurance as collected by the American Council of Life Insurance are misleading, and that the product is actually growing in appeal.
David F. Steppat, a spokesman with Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company in St. Paul, Minn., which sells mortgage life insurance, said that the policies were a good buy for "certain segment of the market."
"GENERALLY, the people who buy mortgage life are buying small amounts of insurance -- our average policy is in the mid-50's range," he said, adding that many term life insurance polices have a minimum $100,000 coverage.
He also noted that many mortgage life insurance policies do not require physical examinations, which is often not the case with term life insurance.
"We are trying to make insurance available to people who wouldn't have access to insurance otherwise," Mr. Steppat said.
Mr. Steppat added that similar insurance polices can be written to pay off a mortgage in cases of disability rather the death. "Disability is a much greater risk than death for most people," he said.
Aside from mortgage life and mortgage disability, there is also insurance that protects a homeowner from losing his home in case of involuntary job loss. But mortgage unemployment insurance, which is not yet available in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, is a fairly new product. The first policies were written about four years ago. The cost: about $15 a month for a $1,000 monthly mortgage payment.
Phillip L. Chapman, president of Morgard Inc., an insurance agency in Rosemont, Pa., that offers the policies, said the insurance would generally cover mortgage payments for up to 12 months. "It's not intended that you can stay off work for the rest of your life and it will pay off your house," he said.
 
KINDS OF MORTGAGE INSURANCE
 
Private Mortgage Insurance or P.M.I.
Description: Insurance required by most lenders of borrowers who make a less than 20 percent down payment. Protects the lender in case of a default by the borrower. Premiums are included in mortgage payments and generally continue until home equity of 20 percent or 25 percent is established by the borrower.
Benefit: Allows the purchase of a home with a low down payment.
Drawback: Though the premiums are small, they can continue for several years and amount to thousands of dollars. Borrowers usually have to notify policy issuers when the equity has increased to a point at which the insurance can be canceled. Sometimes home appreciation is not taken into consideration when calculating home equity.
 
Mortgage Life and Mortgage Disability Insurance
Description: Policies that pay off a mortgage if the borrower or a co-borrower dies or becomes disabled. Generally bought at closing or shortly afterward from an insurance compnany or the lender, acting as a broker.
Benefit: Allows heirs to keep possession of a home without the burden of mortgage payments. In many cases, no physical examination is required. Policies cover small amounts generally not insured by other types of insurance.
Drawback: For mortgages of more than $100,000, a term life insurance policy or private disability insurance for the amount of the loan outstanding is often less expensive.
 
Mortgage Unemployment Insurance
Description: Policies make mortgage payments to the lender for up to a year if the borrower or co-borrower becomes involuntarily unemployed.
Benefit: Eases a major burden during a time of personal financial hardship.
Drawback: Payments generally last no longer than 12 months. Not available in many states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Lower Manhattan B.I.D.'s Chief;
A Politically Savvy Leader Jumps In Swinging

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
OFFICIALLY, lower Manhattan's much ballyhooed Business Improvement District will not be up and running until Jan. 1. But someone forgot to tell that to Carl Weisbrod, the group's new head.
Ensconced in temporary offices across from Battery Park, Mr. Weisbrod, fresh from the leadership of the city's Economic Development Corporation, is already chipping away at downtown's travails. 
 He has exacted a promise from Peter E. Stangl, head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to consider extending commuter railroads to lower Manhattan. He is readying plans for a downtown software-industry center. He is setting up programs to beef up sanitation and security throughout downtown, even though he concedes that those are secondary issues in the area.
"It's like the Giuliani administration tackling quality of life," Mr. Weisbrod said. "It makes a visible, concrete point."
Few downtown afficionados argue with Mr. Weisbrod's goals. But the question remains: Is he the one to achieve them?
His fans -- and there are many -- point to his successes in keeping companies like Morgan Stanley from leaving New York, his experience with revitalizing Times Square, his ability to manage people and his intimate knowledge of the political process.
"In his public-sector life he was always part of the solution, not part of the problem," said David W. Singleton, senior vice president of J.P. Morgan & Company and chairman of the Downtown/Lower Manhattan Association committee that hired Mr. Weisbrod for his new post.
"He has demonstrated a terrific ability to mediate between the private and public sector," added Richard L. Schaffer, the Commissioner of City Planning under Mayor David N. Dinkins and now a professor.
Skeptics, however, suggest that on Mr. Weisbrod's watch New York overpaid to keep companies that would never have left anyway; that Times Square's improvement has been agonizingly slow; that he ignored community sentiments when he arranged for more than 30 acres of city land to be used for a new tennis center. And they worry that his lack of private-sector experience means he may be destined to make bad mistakes.
"Carl has never had to deliver services in a real-time way," said one city official. Others have been critical of the benefits Morgan Stanley was able to win from the city as part of its decision to remain.
Such criticism irritates not only Mr. Weisbrod, who notes that his deals never involved cash handouts, but simply put a brake on tax growth for companies that stayed; it also irritates his former bosses.
"Carl doesn't have business experience, business sense?" asked an incredulous Edward I. Koch, who was Mayor through much of Mr. Weisbrod's public career. "My administration was very business-oriented, to the annoyance of the radical left. And whatever task Carl was assigned, he completed."
David Dinkins, whose subsequent administration had a quite different political thrust, is equally effusive.
"What he did for me was amazing," Mr. Dinkins said. "He got the United States Tennis Authority to spend millions to build a center that the city will own and can use 11 months of the year. Would people rather they did that in New Jersey or Atlanta?"
Many business leaders accept Mr. Weisbrod as of their ilk.
"I negotiate with tenants to stay in my buildings, he negotiates with companies to stay in the city," said William Rudin, the prominent New York developer. "We both must understand the corporate mentality."
Those are pretty strong endorsements for someone who, in his youth, might have taken intimations of business savvy as an insult.
A NATIVE New Yorker, Mr. Weisbrod went through public schools in Queens and spent the 60's attending Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations and New York University Law School.
"I really got caught up in the politics and social change of the decade," said Mr. Weisbrod, who turned 50 last month.
He went to work for Mobilization for Youth, a forerunner of the National Legal Services Corporation, representing squatters, welfare recipients and other indigents. He successfully sued the city so many times that, in classic make-the-troublemaker-monitor fashion, he was recruited into the Department of Relocation under Mayor John V. Lindsay.
Since then, Mr. Weisbrod has brushed up against many private-sector issues and people, picking up their attitudes and techniques. What he doesn't know, he asks about.
"Too often, city officials with no business expertise turn for advice to those with even less expertise," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, an executive director of the Edward S. Gordon real estate brokerage. "Carl always reached out for thoughts from industry."
And he acted on those thoughts. He transformed the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement from an agency whose sole purpose was rooting out Times Square pornographers into one that would deliver services throughout midtown. He consolidated the Public Development Corporation, the Department of Ports and Trade and the Financial Services Corporation into what is now the Economic Development Corporation. He pared the new agency's staff by 25 percent, yet continued to recruit professionals from business schools and to dismiss people who were not performing up to snuff.
"I turned E.D.C. into a true meritocracy," Mr. Weisbrod said. "I tolerate human error, but not repeated human error."
To be sure, the E.D.C was never bound to hire and fire by civil service seniority rules. And it did not need myriad signoffs to buy equipment, something that Mr. Weisbrod concedes made it easier to implement E-mail and otherwise computerize the agency.
"I've never had to run organizations where I was stuck with rigid, bureaucratic rules," Mr. Weisbrod said. "I'm not sure I could stand it."
Perhaps because of his distaste for bureaucracy and petty politics, Mr. Weisbrod has wafted comfortably between administrations, businesses and other oft-warring constituencies. A lifelong Democrat, he not only moved easily from the feisty Koch administration into the more-laid-back Dinkins administration, but he also seems to be segueing smoothly into dealing with the current Republican administration.
"They are receptive to ideas for the best of reasons," Mr. Weisbrod said. "They recognize that lower Manhattan contributes a half billion dollars in real estate taxes each year and is vital to Manhattan's health."
Mr. Weisbrod's ability to stay out of the political fray does not surprise his friends and former colleagues.
"CARL has always known how to bridge worlds," said Rosina K. Abramson, president of the Queens West Development Corporation. Added Jane Henig Orlin, a project manager at Cushman & Wakefield and a former project manager for the city: "Carl had political savvy, but he was never a political hack."
That difference should serve him in good stead, other former colleagues note.
"Carl is a big-picture person, someone who can understand the strengths and weaknesses of the lower Manhattan area, not just of a building or a block," said Barry F. Sullivan, the former deputy mayor. "And he is an excellent negotiator -- he really hears what his opponents are saying."
Mr. Sullivan points to Mr. Weisbrod's success in keeping Unicef in New York as an example of that listening skill.
"Carl realized that they kept harping on the fact that New Rochelle would give them their building," Mr. Sullivan recalled. So Mr. Weisbrod negotiated a deal in which Unicef takes title to its United Nations-area building at the end of a 30-year lease.
Such successes are sources of considerable pride to Mr. Weisbrod. And in a sense, they are also the reason he decided to leave government service.
"I accomplished what I'd set out to do," he said. And, of course, there was a quintessentially private-sector motive as well. "I wanted more money."
No quibble on that last statement. Mr. Weisbrod won't talk salary, but he is making considerably more than he made with the city. But in fact, he did not accomplish everything he set out to do.
Mr. Weisbrod, his wife, Jody Adams, and their 11-year-old son, Billy, live in a three-bedroom co-op on Roosevelt Island and he has been trying to get the city to extend ferry service there for more than a decade.
"Now he's even trying to get the Queens West ferry to stop at Roosevelt Island," chuckles Ms. Abramson, who once headed the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation.
Ms. Abramson sounds unpersuaded. Some things, it seems, even savvy negotiators cannot accomplish.

Price Slump Energizes the Condominium Market

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
CONDOMINIUM units in Connecticut, at the bottom of a slump that pushed prices down to as little as half their original value, are now so attractively priced that for the first time in five years they are selling briskly.
A growing population of single men and women, empty-nesters, first-time home buyers and investors seeking an alternative to meager returns elsewhere have set the market on fire. 
 "One of my clients bought five units in one complex and he has bid on four more in another," said Robert McCarthy, a broker at William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford. The client, a corporate executive and 30-year resident of Stamford, declined to be identified. "He is getting a 12 percent return on his money," said the broker.
Typically, a $50,000 one-bedroom unit can be rented for $850, with common charges and taxes totaling $350 a month. "If you can pay cash for the unit you will make a $5,000 to $6,000 annual profit," said Mr. McCarthy. "You can lease to a Section 8 tenant and the Government will guarantee rents of $950 a month. Rentals are very hot."
The Federal Section 8 program provides rent subsidies to the elderly, the disabled and other low-income tenants.
"For the past three months the market has been excellent," said Peggy Doepper, a senior manager at William Pitt. "We have units up to $500,000, but those most in demand range from $150,000 to$250,000."
More than 1,700 units were sold in Fairfield County through June 30, up from 1,300 in the same period in 1993, according to statistics compiled by The Commercial Record, a Connecticut business publication. In all of 1987, the year of the stock-market crash, there were 4,504 sales recorded, and by 1989 the number had dropped to 2,987.
Developers for the most part are not building new, but rather picking up bargains among foreclosed projects that were approved by town boards and only partially completed or never built at all due to the recession.
One new project in Stamford consists of 16 town-house units with one-car garages now being framed out on Seaside Avenue. They will sell for $152,000 to $155,000, an extremely low price for the area, and they are clones of a venture on Hope Street where the same developer, William Joerman, built and quickly sold 13 1,100 square foot units last year.
He does not advertise, but depends on walk-ins and curbside signs. His buyers are mostly singles who find that after making a down payment of 10 to 20 percent their monthly costs are 10 to 20 percent lower than renting.
OF the more than 400 units he built and sold in the city since 1971, only one unit was resold in the last five years. Today, he said, "small studios and one-bedrooms that I sold for $50,000 to $60,000 are available in foreclosure for $15,000 to $20,000."
"I've become my own competition," he said. "But generally people prefer new construction and the new units are air-conditioned with gas heating and fireplaces."
John J. Ginter 3d, developer of the 88-unit Stamford Landing completed on the waterfront in 1985, sold 13 residential units for a total of $2.7 million in the 90 days that ended on Nov. 7. Ten units were priced at $200,000 or under.
The mixed-use project contains 220,000 square feet of offices where an occupancy rate of at least 85 percent is maintained; 130 sold-out boat slips; a quarter mile of public boardwalk; a fishing pier and 88 residential condominiums that originally sold for $250,000 to $550,000.
Eight years ago, when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 forbade writing off real-estate losses, investors stopped buying.
"We went into rentals and leased about 20 units," said Mr. Ginter. The complex was kept afloat through the recession by a readjustment of loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took over the financing after the developer's bank was foreclosed, and by commercial and residential rentals. Eighteen 1,450 and 1,550-square-foot residential units are still available at $180,000.
Carl Kuehner, a New Canaan developer, has sold 19 newly built town-house units at Apple Blossom, a 5.6-acre complex on Tamarack Avenue in Danbury. Thirteen more units priced from $140,000 to $164,000 are under construction. Located close to I-84 and one-half mile from Candlewood Lake's beaches and marinas, each air-conditioned 2-bedroom unit has a fireplace, garage and all kitchen appliances.
In New Haven Mr. Keuhner has finished off 39 partially completed 2-bedroom town house units acquired at an F.D.I.C. auction, and he is offering them at $60,000 to $80,000.
"We have condos that were originally bought for $90,000 selling below $25,000," said Marilyn Bremser, manager of the Pitt office in New Milford, a Litchfield County town that is growing rapidly with people from Fairfield County looking for less costly housing.
"Some of the units had $70,000 and $80,000 mortgages," she said. "The banks took a real hit, and they have become very wary. They look for other assets now and they attach them. You can't walk away from a bad real estate investment today. If you do you will wait two years before a lender will even consider you again."
Russell and Dale Manjoney Barton, husband and wife developers in New Milford, bought Quarry Ridge, a 28-acre foreclosed project on Mygatt Road in Washington last December for just $635,000. There were 10 units priced up to $300,000 in three nearly completed buildings when the former developer declared bankruptcy in 1991.
THE Bartons finished the existing units, built four more in a new building and will complete the additional 20 units in the original plan. Prices for the units, all with two bedrooms, range from $159,900 to $179,900 and sizes from 1,500 to 1,720 square feet. Common charges and taxes average around $285 a month.
The two-story colonial- and ranch-style buildings with cedar clapoard siding and wood-burning fireplaces are set atop a ridge with spectacular views across the Litchfield hills.
The project was approved during a brief period from 1984 through 1987 when zoning permitted condominium development in Washington for the first time. Dismayed by a surge of applications that threatened the rural character of the community, the town rescinded the permissive zoning in 1988.
Quarry Ridge was the only project to survive because it was already under construction. Permits for the other developments expired when the developers were unable to obtain financing.
Dr. Leonard Gelella, a New Milford dentist, moved into Quarry Ridge this year. "I liked the bucolic, country setting," he said, "and it's only 10 minutes from my office. The quality of construction and the price were good. A few years ago my unit was listed at $100,000 more."
In spite of its damaged reputation, condominium development in the state, according to John Knight, professor of real estate at the University of Connecticut, is as viable as it was in the 70's and 80's. "People get together later and stay together less," he said. "Condos continue to offer a lifestyle for single people and couples with minimum maintenance and a sense of security from living in a cluster."

HEADLINE: At Work;
The Work-Family Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
IT was the early 80's. Money, fast and lots of it, was in. Yuppies grazed expensively. The Italian Peg Perego stroller would soon become the most expensive form of transportation most New Yorkers, at least, would ever purchase. True, the recession of the early 1980's shook the confidence of a plethora of white-collar professionals, many of whom suddenly found themselves rocked back and in need of new careers. And true, "having it all" was becoming a dubious goal, as women, especially, found it difficult to juggle the multiple lives anyone with a family and a job has. Even a decade ago, predownsizing, the demands of work made it virtually impossible to do much more than shoehorn a private life, including spouses and children, into gaps in the work schedule. The pioneering companies that went looking for support services for their employees found few options.
"It was a simple landscape: a desert," remembers one executive on a tape put together by Work/Family Directions, the Boston-based consulting firm, to observe the beginning of its second decade of purveying the work-family ethic to corporate America. A decade ago, Work/Family began scouting out child care providers in its clients' local communities, gradually building an infrastructure of referral services around the country. 
 To say that from a simple service was born a vast empire is probably overstating the case slightly. But the business has grown from $2 million in contracts in its first year, in 1983 -- the 10th anniversary celebration is belated -- to $44.2 million in revenues last year, initially on the strength of a menu of family referral and advocacy services, from help with adoption or after-school care to help with an elderly parent. Work/Family Directions now does more consulting than referring, offering management training and employee seminars as well as contract research through its scholarly arm, Rodgers & Associates.
These may seem like the kinds of services a company would jettison to cut costs, but that apparently is not happening. Ironically, the work-family equation -- that flexibility and support equal productivity -- seems to be dovetailing quite effectively with the antihierarchical, employee empowerment strategic direction more corporations are going these days.
All this puts Fran Sussner Rodgers, Work/Family founder and president, on the crest of a wave that took a long time to build but that surely must be a pleasure to ride. Years ago she learned, as all work-family advocates must, to talk the counterintuitive talk of the bottom line to companies, making the argument for family-oriented programs on the basis of improved productivity rather than improved moral fiber. "I consider myself a pragmatist," Ms. Rodgers said. "I don't think about should. I think about reality." The reality, she acknowledged long ago, is that companies are in business to make profits and consultants must live and die with that.
But the reality also is now that most companies can take the temperature of the work force and find signs of malaise. A survey released last week by Massachusetts Mutual, the insurance company, reports that employees feel committed to their employers but believe employers are not committed to them in return. Forty-one percent say their employers expect them to perform an unreasonable amount of overtime. And nearly half say their jobs intrude on family commitments. Given the mutating corporate landscape, a declining pressure on employees in the near future seems unlikely. "People are feeling overwhelmed by change," Ms. Rodgers said.
BUT, she said, increasingly companies are coming to accept that they must offer tradeoffs for such former "perks" as job security, pay raises and expanded benefits.
In this "environment of constant change," as the subtitle of a recent Work/Family report has it, such a tradeoff might be a company commitment to keeping employees employable by nurturing their skills. But companies also seem to be taking more seriously the work-family argument that employees who can balance their commitments at home and at work are employees who will retain their loyalty and willingness to work hard.
That is largely because Ms. Rodgers can legitimately position work-family as a paradigm for the lean, mean 90's organization. Programs have never cost much, in part because their proponents often come from a nonprofit or social services background where low funding expectations are the norm and "value added" is a way of life.
"Work-family is feisty, creative, nonbureaucratic, all the things corporations say they want," Ms. Rodgers said. "The field has evolved to empower, to get people to solve their own problems. This is what people say the future should be like."
 
 
 
PICKING THE KIDS OVER THE BOSS
 A NEW survey of working Americans paints a picture of a tired and financially strapped labor force -- and one unwilling automatically to put work before family. Nearly 70 percent of those surveyed say they feel "very committed" to their employer, but nearly half report that their jobs interfere with their family commitments. Many employees resolve the conflict in favor of their children: three quarters said if asked to choose, they would pick a child's event over an important function at work; two-thirds said the choice would be an easy one to make.
Researchers for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company randomly surveyed 1,021 adults in September and October. Among the other findings:
* A third of those responding say they are having trouble paying their monthly bills.
* Three-quarters are having trouble saving for their children's education.
* More than half are having trouble saving for retirement.
There was no mention of a longing for a cooler economy.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
The Fed Wants to Make One Thing Perfectly Clear
So the Federal Reserve did raise rates again -- by three-quarters of a point, the most since 1981. The right move? Many had doubts. Complaints ranged from the polite ("misreading the American economy," "extraordinarily aggressive") to the less polite (the Fed "is coming down on the side of the bloody bondholders"). After all, the latest reading on consumer prices showed just a 0.1 percent rise. But economists, it seems, have this odd formula that equates "full employment" with a 6 percent jobless rate. Anything less (it's now 5.8 percent) means we're "running out of workers." Put another way: workers get this funny idea that there are plenty of jobs around, and (gasp!) demand more pay. The result: demon inflation. The short view, of course, would dictate putting people to work. The Fed's taking the long view -- correctly, one hopes. 

Global Thinking on Pollution
In many ways, Americans can float above the world's problems. Famine and genocide don't interrupt the backyard barbecue. When it comes to pollution, though, no nation is an island. This truth was much in evidence in a deal last week in which two utilities -- Niagara Mohawk and Arizona Public Service -- agreed to a swap involving the right to pollute. This "market" approach, though distasteful to those who feel people should tidy up their own nests, is much in favor these days. But this deal has a new twist: a utility will "donate" pollution credits, essentially retiring them, and use the tax break to experiment with cutting emissions in places like China and Russia. Those nations are so far behind on pollution controls that they offer cheap cleanup opportunities. And the whole world gains.
 
In Thin Air, Can It Be Libel?
Aha! Did the wizards who thought up the Internet think of this one? Yes, all this instant gratification is great -- you hurl words into a place called cyberspace (take a left at "Star Trek"), and instantly people everywhere can read them. But can you slander someone with impunity? Does all accountability vanish? These are not, alas, hypothetical questions, for Prodigy has been sued for libel because someone posted a message accusing the investment firm Stratton Oakmont of criminal activity. Lawyers don't know what to make of it, for these are uncharted legal waters. How, after all, can you monitor instant communication? Prodigy agreed in court last week to try to track down the culprit, but the larger problem remains.
 
Solar Power: It's Back
Remember solar power? That pipe dream of the dreamy-eyed counterculture practically vanished from serious discourse -- it was just too costly. But guess what: it's back. Enron, the big natural gas company, plans to build the nation's largest solar-power plant in Nevada -- a plant that could provide enough power for a city of 100,000. What's more, it says it can produce that power at competitive rates. How? Simple: when no one was looking, it got a lot cheaper to wrestle the sun's energy to the ground.
 
Art Deco. Gd Loc. Nice Vus.
Rockefeller Center looks so timeless, it's such a bedrock of the Midtown landscape, that it's startling to discover what a mess its finances are. It used to be simple: the Rockefellers owned it. But five years ago the family shocked the Daughters of American Ownership by selling control to a Japanese company called Mitsubishi Estate. The family scored a triumph of the "sell high" philosophy -- it got $1.4 billion for 80 percent of a building that, in a weak market, is now worth a paltry billion. And that's the problem. The mortgage is $1.3 billion, rents are down, the complex is losing money -- and the owner might default on that mortgage.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
A Spendthrift Economy
As one economist put it, "We're still an economy spending more than we're producing." The result, of course, is that America's trade deficit keeps growing -- last week came word that with imports rising and exports easing, that gap hit $10.1 billion in September. One surprise, though, was that the deficit with Japan -- normally the core of the problem -- actually shrank. And it shrank with Western Europe, too. But the deficit with China surged 8 percent, to a record $3.5 billion.
 
Sony Flunks Hollywood 101
Well, Hollywood didn't become a subsidiary of Japan Inc. after all. It's old news that Sony really blew it when it bought Columbia and Tristar. For complex reasons, it had to pay a superstar's ransom -- a surreal $700 million -- for the services of two mere humans, the producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber; both have since flown the coop. And many of its films -- think, say, of "Last Action Hero" -- have been disasters. Still, last week's news was a shocker: Sony took a $2.7 billion writeoff on the studios, for a $3.2 billion quarterly loss -- one of the biggest ever for a Japanese company. The explanation seems to be that such "trophy" acquisitions were just too far afield from what Sony knew best. A costly lesson in Hollywood economics.
 
In Indonesia, Trade Wins
President Clinton was safely on the far side of the world last week while Republicans were measuring the Capitol for drapes. And, as often happens abroad, he faced a tough choice at one stop -- do you go for the big trade deals or harp on human rights? In Indonesia, he tried the latter, but proved less adept at the harp than the saxophone. For even while President Suharto listened, unflinching, to Mr. Clinton's human-rights warnings, their two nations announced $40 billion in joint projects over the next decade. The bulk of that is a $35 billion deal in which Exxon will help develop a huge offshore natural gas field. The rationale, as it was with China: more trade equals better treatment for citizens. . . . Speaking of trade: President Clinton vowed to push ahead with votes on a world trade agreement after Thanksgiving. The incoming Congress is not expected to be too receptive to the pact.
 
COMPANIES
 
Miracle on, Uh, Main Street?
Now here's a catchy plot: a Santa who swears he's the real thing, working at a department store that parades giant animal balloons through Manhattan. The store's name, of course, is . . . C. F. Cole. Huh? Yes, it's "Miracle on 34th Street," the '94 model (it opened on Friday). So why did Macy's sit this one out? The Macy's party line: the original 1947 film is "a one-of-a-kind classic." Another possibility: a subplot about the store's financial problems hit too close to a nerve. Now, of course, Macy's loses both ways: the film will inevitably remind audiences of Macy's woes, but Macy's doesn't get all that publicity. The store passed up an "incredible opportunity," said one observer.
 
Which Is the Real Con Ed?
The two faces of Con Edison: "Environmental criminals" who fouled local waters, said Richard Brodsky, an environment-minded New York State Assemblyman. Victim, said Con Ed -- equipment failure was the culprit. Wherever the truth lies, last week Con Ed agreed to pay a $9 million fine for discharging oil and other nasty stuff into New York Harbor and allowing waste to be dumped into sewers. Not just once, the state said, but hundreds of times from 1984 to 1991. The real question is, what now? "We'll be checking," Mr. Brodsky promised.
 
Pickup Safety: G.M. Strikes Back
The battle rages on over those G.M. pickups whose fuel tanks do/don't (pick one) turn them into death traps. Transportation Secretary Pena says the six million trucks -- sold from 1973 to 1987 -- pose unreasonable fire risks, that General Motors put "sales ahead of safety." But last week G.M. filed suit to stop his attacks, saying the Government was indulging in "retroactive rule making." Since the trucks met the safety standards of the time, the auto maker argued, they could not be called unsafe now. That's a point. But Transportation officials countered that actual safety, not rote standards, is the proper yardstick. That's a point, too. So stay tuned. Hearings are set for Dec. 6, unless G.M. heads them off.
 
Wishing Can Make It So
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just say, "That stock should be higher" -- and suddenly it was? Well, if you have enough shares, it seems, it's possible to do just that. Last week Kirk Kerkorian said that he would push Chrysler's board to raise the share price -- by raising dividends, buying back shares, splitting the stock, whatever. And lo and behold, the stock jumped more than $3 in a day, and the volume was huge. Mr. Kerkorian, who already owns 9 percent of Chrysler and is talking about buying more, saw his investment soar $100 million in a day. Of course, Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, has different ideas -- he wants to sock some cash away for the next drizzly day in Detroit. But as Mr. Kerkorian pointed out, he has about 30 times as many shares as all the directors combined. In other words: He speaks, Chrysler listens.

Cranberries. Sweet Potatoes. Ostrich.

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE 

 BODY:
ANYONE who says the American economy has lost its vim and vision doesn't know a thing about ostriches.
 The lanky birds with Barbara Bush eyes have set off a speculative boom. Lawyers, realtors, antique dealers: all are plunking down up as much as $40,000 for a pair of the flightless birds, convinced that on a Thanksgiving not too far off, their fellow Americans will be carving ostrich legs. 
 "It's the meat of the 21st century," said Chuck Ball, executive director of the American Ostrich Association in Fort Worth. "Every day more people are learning that ostrich makes good eating and a great investment."
 Just seven years ago, a few dozen people in the United States were raising few hundred ostriches; today, the American Ostrich Association has 3,600 members and there are anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 birds in the country. Mr. Ball said his group is adding 70 members a month. They are investing tens of millions of dollars, opening ostrich ranches, forming ostrich partnerships and buying into ostrich mutual funds -- even though the only demonstrated demand for ostrich meat comes from a few exotic restaurants, the kind that serve rattlesnake and wild boar.
 "Getting in on the ground floor means taking a leap of faith," said David Stocking of Joliet, Ill., who quit his job as an accountant in April to open an ostrich ranch with his wife, Sherry. "People say I have my head in the sand, but I'll be laughing last and best."
 
The Scam Business
 Not everybody is laughing. A Florida outfit called U.S. Ostrich Corporation was shut down this year after it was accused of bilking 1,300 investors out of $3 million. Investigations by the State Securities Board of Texas recently led to the indictments of two concerns for fraud after they collected $174,000 from retirees by promising them big money in the ostrich business.
 "Every time a product seems hot, the con artists move in to prey on people's greed," said Stephan Hodge, the Indiana Securities Commissioner, who has shut down eight ostrich scams in his state. "When you tell people they're going to make 200 or 300 percent, a lot of them are going to take the bait no matter how fishy it smells."
 Just how the eight-foot-tall birds from Africa became promises of the American Dream has a lot to do with cows. Since the word went out about those artery cloggers, investors have developed lucrative and volatile markets in various low-fat meats like buffalo, venison, alligator and even kangaroo.
 The leader of the ostrich pack is Tom Mantzel, 47 years old, of Fort Worth. After making a fortune in the oil business, he founded the American Ostrich Association in 1987. In his folksy Texas drawl, he'll tick off a dozen reasons why ostriches will take flight, then say, "I'm talkin' your ear off, aren't I?" -- and tick off a dozen more.
 He says that ostrich meat is lower in fat and calories than chicken or beef; that ostriches eat less, produce more and need much less land than cattle; that ostrich leather is coveted around the world, fetching about $600 per bird; that the feathers, eyelashes even toenails have lucrative commercial uses.
 "Some people say it's a fad, a scam, a pyramid scheme," Mr. Mantzel said, sounding slightly wounded. "But were not talking chinchillas, shetland ponies, Vietnamese pot belly pigs, pet rocks, and all those other things ad infinitum because at the end of the day we have a product people want."
 Mr. Mantzel said that Europeans, especially the Swiss, Belgians and Austrians, want ostrich meat, and eat 100,000 pounds a year. As to whether Americans will find the birds finger-lickin' good, it's hard to say, partly because for now ostriches are worth more alive than dead.
 An ostrich carcass goes for about $750 today, but a fertilized egg sells for about $850. A yearling pair costs $9,000 to $14,000, and by the time they are ready to breed, at about 3 years, a mating pair runs up to $40,000. Many old-timers have made a fortune selling birds to newcomers, but most people agree that the bubble will have to burst and prices will plummet.
 Then what?
 Jeffrey Nathan, the chef and co-owner of the New Deal Restaurant and Garden in Manhattan, which specializes in game, said ostrich "tastes wonderful, like flank steak." (Mr. Nathan serves thin slices of ostrich in a Madeira sauce with caramelized pearl onions and chanterelles.) He believes that the meat may become quite popular but doubts it will be a household staple because, like other low-fat meats, it requires precise preparation.
 "A housewife could destroy it," he said. "It has to be rare or medium rare, or it will be so tough a knife won't cut it."
 As ostrich owners look to the future, they can look back, to the turkey. Until the 1930's, it was a rare and exotic bird highly valued for its colorful plumage. Then some visionary decided that it tasted good.
 Of course, along the way, something called Thanksgiving was made a national holiday.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Taxpayers Are Angry. They're Expensive, Too.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICANS believe that their Government wastes vast wads of cash on pork-barrel highways, naval bases in the landlocked home states of important Senators and handouts to an ungrateful underclass -- and that wiping out all this would balance the budget.
After the election of 1994, few Republicans or even Democrats deny that the voters have a point. 
 But like most truths, this one is not absolute. Sure, Congress is a certain soft touch. But the biggest beneficiaries of the benefits mandated by law are not grifters or crack addicts or well-connected defense contractors: they are mostly average folk, like you. Or me.
Direct aid to the Government-certified poor -- food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families with Dependent Children -- totals about $140 billion a year. That is roughly what the Government spends on Medicare, providing services to the elderly at roughly one quarter of their actual cost.
And payments to the poor add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle class and wealthy: deductions for retirement plans, the deduction for home mortgage interest and the exemption of health-insurance premiums that companies pay for their employees.
 
Don't Touch
 Perhaps more important, most tax breaks and payments to the well-situated are practically exempt from the debate over controlling expenditures.
There are some arguments in favor of this. Cutting Social Security and tax-deferred retirement plans could push some of the elderly below the poverty level. Curbing the mortgage interest break would devalue homes and crimp sales.
And politically, the principle known in budgetese as "means-testing" seems a dead letter. Republicans and Democrats alike say they won't seek limits in the largest entitlement, Social Security, although a large share goes to people who live in relative comfort. When Mr. Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin, floated the idea of limiting some popular middle- and upper-class tax breaks, like the mortgage deduction, Republicans pounced on the Democratic "tax-and-spend" philosophy, and the White House disavowed her.
Some experts say that ignores the Willie Sutton law of accounting: to balance the budget, you go where the money is, and the money these days is put mostly in the hands of people who are not poor. "My view of life is, you rule out taxes and Social Security and most Medicare, and you're not serious" about balancing the budget, said Charles Schultze of the Brookings Institution, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Carter. "I don't care what you say. You're not really playing the game."

GRAPHIC: Graphs: "Taxpayers Are Angry. They're Expensive, Too."
New that Republicans control Congress, there will be some pressure to fulfill one of the promises of the "Contract With America" -- a balanced budget. Back in the early Reagan years, balanced budget promises were accompanied by stories of welfare mothers buying vodka with food stamps. Now the watchword in welfare reform. Either way, the implication is that cracking down on the poor will bring about big savngs.
 But once budget committees start looking at Ferderal costs, both indirect payments and in monet the Government doesn't take in through tax breaks, they'll find that there are precious few poor people's programs to cut. The bulk of the money goes to the politacally potent middle class.

How the Union Joined the South

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
"HERE'S to the land you tore out the heart of," went the song by the folk singer Phil Ochs during the bloody battles over integration in the South. "Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of."
 Three decades later, as the Republican Party Chairman, Haley Barbour of Mississippi, does his endless, homespun spin over his party's historic election sweep and conservative legislative agenda, it can be argued that Mississippi and the South have taken another route. Instead of finding another country, they have taken over this one. 
 The conservative tide overflowed the banks of the Potomac and the Hudson as well as the Mississippi and the Chattahoochee. But last week, as the President from Arkansas let the soon-to-be House Speaker from Georgia know he could be receptive to school prayer, it was clear that the economic and demographic trends that have characterized the South for decades have now turned into a cultural and political juggernaut as well.
 Indeed, think of a place that's bitterly anti-government and fiercely individualistic, where race is a constant subtext to daily life and God and guns run through public discourse like an electric current. Think of a place where influential scholars market theories of white supremacy, where the word "liberal" is an epithet, where the harshest forms of law-and-order justice, including the death penalty, are politically all but unstoppable.
 That has always been the South. For now, it seems to be the nation.
 Indeed, almost everything in the current political and cultural climate, particularly House-Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich's campaign to paint Democrats as enemies of "normal Americans," reflects the moral universe of traditional Southern politics.
 "Southern politicians, particularly George Wallace, have always understood the importance of creating a moral force to your argument and you do this by creating an enemy; we're the good people, they're 'the other,' " said Dan Carter, a history professor at Emory University. "The South has always had a long tradition of this, not just in terms of race, but in terms of a general conservatism. You see a lot of that in the nation now."
 Given the volatility of the American mood, only the most exuberant Republican could be confident the current political alignment will last. In fact, few doubt that the current conservative march could falter if the Republicans are eventually seen as the party of, say, Jesse Helms, Phil Gramm and Pat Robertson, and too tied to hard-right stances on issues like abortion. Already, some Republicans fear that Mr. Helms's harsh comments on President Clinton and Mr. Gingrich's campaign for school prayer may not sell so well outside the South.
 To some extent, the South's political fortunes have risen as it has become less distinctive and more like the rest of the nation. And to some extent, what's happening in American politics is less a uniquely American phenomenon than one that mirrors conservative, nativist political trends around the world.
 Still, three decades after the brutality of the civil rights era turned the South into something close to a pariah region, at least four forces have made the nation's politics and culture increasingly look like those of the South.
 The first is the continuing economic expansion that has made the South the nation's most populous region, with all the political clout that comes with it, and the one attracting the most new residents. Second is the evolution of race from a distinctly Southern issue to a thoroughly national one. Third is anger with government and an edgy, anxious mood that have made the historic Southern distrust of government -- and a fixation on the past -- strikingly contemporary.
 Fourth is the degree to which the shift of white voters from the Democratic to the Republican party, more than any other single factor, has provided the ballast for the Republican takeover of Congress. In the process, it has propelled Southerners from a conservative minority in a largely liberal Democratic Party to positions of leadership in a staunchly conservative Republican one.
Throw it all together and you get the ultimate triumph of the Republican strategy born during the Nixon era. Looking at the political leanings of the South, Attorney General John Mitchell predicted presciently, if prematurely, that "this country is going so far to the right you're not going to be able to recognize it."
 There is a long, tangled history to all this, dating back perhaps to the end of Reconstruction, the last time that Republicans ruled the South.
 The historian John Hope Franklin, at Duke University, notes that the North and South made their peace not at the Civil War's end but after Reconstruction, when both agreed that the South could pursue its own course on race as long as the North could exploit its resources.
 "The South didn't win the war, but it won the peace," Professor Franklin said. "It's been going in that direction ever since."
 Still, it was not until the civil rights revolution extended beyond the South, in the 1960's, that race became a major issue outside the South. Since then it has become an insistent strain just below the surface of the nation's politics, suffusing explosive issues like welfare and crime with a powerful racial charge, much as race always defined the politics of the South.
 "As race has escaped from the South and become nationalized, it has become the hot-button issue in American life," said Julian Bond, the former civil rights leader who now teaches at the American University and the University of Virginia. "You don't have to join the Christian Coalition. Race is such a hot button you don't even have to push it for it to go off."
 To many liberals, race is the hidden force behind the conservative surge and the dark side of the nationalization of Southern politics. After all, much of the South's traditional hatred of government stems from the war over slavery and the Federal Government's enforcement of desegregation a century later.
 But just as the nation has always veered back and forth, from seeing the South as a place of nitwits and racists to an American Eden of piety and down-home values, the South's current influence is about more than race. In fact, it remains to be seen whether that influence will reflect the angry, send-them-a-message South of George Wallace and Ross Barnett, or a place that for all its tortured history has often been anchored by a sense of continuity and faith that the nation seems to be desperately seeking.
 At the very least, it is no longer looking at the South as a place with problems of race and poverty somehow apart from the rest of the country.
 "I was asked recently to write a chapter for a book on 'the end of the South as an American problem,' " said John Egerton, a writer in Nashville. "I said I could do that in my sleep. The South isn't an American problem. America is an American problem."

Funny Things Happen On the Way to a Treaty

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF ever anyone needed evidence that the politics of international trade defy every rule of logic and partisanship, consider the past seven days.
 Donning colorful batik in Indonesia, President Clinton claimed his latest victory in commercial diplomacy, as the leaders of Asia agreed to free trade in the Pacific, sort of, by the year 2020. Of course, it was an accord with some of the world's premier protectionists, and as soon as the cameras wandered off, Mr. Clinton's summiteers quickly noted that this was a declaration of "common resolve," not a binding agreement. After all, argued the Chinese and the Malaysians, among others, 25 years might be a little hasty for a radical notion like opening their markets. 
 Back at home, the world's biggest and most specific trade accord in history -- 22,500 impenetrable pages, mandating $744 billion in tariff reductions scheduled to start in less than 45 days -- was in danger of running aground in Congress. Conservative Democrats, who have never liked free trade, were allying with mischievous Republicans, who see a chance to humiliate Mr. Clinton on a world stage, even if it means passing up a gigantic tax cut. Suddenly realizing it does not yet have the votes for passage of an agreement that once seemed like a sure thing, the White House went begging the new Republican leadership, led by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, to save an accord begun under President Ronald Reagan. For a dozen years, it has been the United States that has pressured every country that seemed interested in scuttling the agreement, warning that they would become economic outcasts if they let parochial interests prevail over the growth of the world economy.
 "The immediate trade problems are back here, not in Jakarta," growled Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is trying to scratch together enough votes in the Senate to pass GATT. "But try getting anyone to notice."
Over the past year the Administration tried desperately to keep anyone from noticing GATT. Its fear was that if anyone ever seized on the 123-nation agreement, there could be a repeat of last year's battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement. That battle split the Democratic Party and brought Mr. Clinton into conflict with labor unions that could hear, through Ross Perot, jobs being sucked to Mexico.
 For a while the strategy worked. None of the scary tales surrounding Nafta have yet come true. Stung by its defeat last year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has said not a word about GATT, even though it is the Godzilla of free-trade accords. In Nafta, opponents talked of swarms of low-paid Mexican workers; in GATT, they warn about some vague loss of American sovereignty to a board of international trade judges called the World Trade Organization. "These are not issues that resound much beyond Washington," said Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative. "In comparison this should be easy."
 It isn't. While no one can establish that Nafta hurt the Democrats in the election, free trade's constituency seems to be diminishing. Mr. Clinton has, more than any other President in modern history, used his office to argue the case that free trade means growth and jobs. But there is little evidence he is winning converts beyond the Boeings and Microsofts of the world, and other big or high-tech businesses who constitute America's competitive advantage.
 Conservative Democrats have never believed the stuff about the new economy, especially if they are from states with old industries like textiles that have far more to lose than to gain. "Free trade is the new Vietnam policy," argued Senator Ernest L. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is trying to torpedo GATT. "You destroy your economy to save the world."
 
The Flip Side of Free Trade
 What is new is that Mr. Hollings is being joined by the Republican right wing, which sees a chance to win over dismayed, high-school-educated white men who have little chance of being integrated into Mr. Clinton's vision of a new economy of high-tech exporters. While Mr. Clinton has rightly claimed that the economy is producing new jobs by the millions, 2.2 million workers have lost their jobs in recent years, and any job found is often lower paying. "The flip side of free trade is that you have to face up to the fact that some people lose out, and you have to help them," said Labor Secretary Robert Reich. But money is short.
 So Mr. Dole, who seems to hold GATT's fate in his hands, spent the past week on the fence, his heart singing the praises of free trade, his pollsters warning that he has to think about New Hampshire and Iowa, where his Presidential ambitions will get their first tests. Even a few of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers are urging the President to pare back the ambitious free-trade schedule of the next few weeks, and to avoid making promises to Latin American leaders he will meet in December who want their countries to become part of Nafta. "The timing is not ideal," a top White House economic adviser said.
 But there is no pulling back possible on GATT. The new rules in the treaty -- about tariffs, protecting intellectual property, lowering barriers to services -- are the foundation of Mr. Clinton's free-trade vision. So GATT is not about economics but about credibility.
 "This is like the vote on the League of Nations or the Marshall Plan," Vice President Al Gore warned. "Should Congress fail, history will frown upon us."
 By then, of course, it will be 2020, and there will be free trade in Asia.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
An Ignorance of Africa As Vast as the Continent

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
FOR any American living in this city of gleaming skyscrapers and seamless asphalt highways, there is bound to be at least one encounter with another countryman who, roughing it elsewhere on the continent, says of Abidjan: "Of course, that's not really Africa."
 By the same token, many American blacks who have spent time in African countries find themselves contending back home with the wide-eyed inquiries of friends or strangers who have never visited but see Africa as an idealized spiritual home of brotherhood and democracy. 
 As commonplace notions like these suggest, and because of the distance imposed by geography, if not by a conflicted history, Africa remains a projection screen for both the most blinkered prejudices and the wildest fantasies. For many Americans, the "real Africa" is a blurred concatenation of game parks, starving infants and genocidal warfare -- or it's a Disney-fied cradle of civilization.
 Neither vision, of course, approaches the reality of a continent of some 50 nations and 800 million souls that encompasses everything from the unfulfilled potential of giants like Zaire and Nigeria to the improbably hopeful, newly minted realms like South Africa and Eritrea. The sweep of the continent provides enough material to bolster any pride or prejudice.
 The rose-tinted version of this continent was recently paraded in Ghana at the first convention of the Nation of Islam held outside the United States. One speaker after another described Africa as a place whose problems could almost all be explained by divisions sowed among blacks by whites bent on despoiling and pillaging the land.
 "We were navigating the oceans when Europeans still thought the world was flat," said one speaker, Rahbee Ben Israel, leader of a black Jewish sect who attributed Africa's problems to what he called a "famine of truth." The message of his lecture, like many others during the convention, was that the mere awareness of the continent's past greatness would set blacks free.
 Such exaltation of Africa's past, which has enjoyed a certain vogue in recent years in the United States, has come under attack from many African intellectuals. At best, the oratory and cant are viewed as a time-wasting diversion from the work of economic development. At worst, it is regarded as intellectual scaffolding that obscures the failings of many African leaders and justifies authoritarian tendencies in the name of cultural originality.
 "The Africa of nationalisms has exhausted its resources," the Cameroonian sociologist, Axelle Kabou, wrote in an influential book, "And What If Africa Refused Development?" one of several recent works by African intellectuals deploring the glorification of the past by Africans in everything from poetry to political science.
 In post-independence Africa, Ms. Kabou's book argues, the political use of negritude, which celebrates blackness, helped feed dictatorships like that of Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko with its jackboot ideology of "authenticity" that outlawed Western business suits and Christian names, and expropriated, then bled to death foreign-owned businesses in the cause of national sovereignty.
 
Many Preconceptions
 What preceded independence, and its attendant isms, and still lingers is a viewpoint much more pervasive and arguably more damaging than any excesses since. This Africa is the Dark Continent where the popular imagery runs from Edgar Rice Burroughs's fanciful white ape man to chronic, unchecked tribal massacres to the twin stereotypes of savagery and backwardness.
 It is true that 18 of the world's 20 poorest countries are in Africa, and that the continent is the hardest hit by AIDS and famines of biblical proportions. However, it is equally true, but less well known, that a score of African countries have emerged from one-party dictatorships in this decade, and many of them are thriving. Countries like Ivory Coast and Botswana, Zimbabwe and Ghana often complain that the image of Africa that prevails in the West negates nations like theirs struggling effectively with the challenges of development and democratization.
 This thinking is particularly true in the United States, which lacks the familiarity with Africa that European countries have from generations of colonial involvement.
 "This continent offers some of the most profitable opportunities for investment anywhere," one frustrated World Bank official said recently, complaining about the indifference of American business toward serious efforts at reform in countries like Zimbabwe and Ghana. "But how do you get people in the United States to think about investing here when the only thing they know about Africa is Rwanda?"
 If many black Americans have been seduced by Afrocentrism's romanticism, it is clear that even among these Americans, lack of interest, misapprehension and even repulsion are common.
 "When I first came to Africa in 1981 on a tour with a group of friends," said Emmett MacDonald, a black American record producer who lives here, "some of our mothers came to see us off and offered to buy us tents to sleep in and cases of Coca-Cola so that we would be sure to have something safe to drink. For a lot of black Americans there is still a kind of shame that attaches to Africa because of all the images out there."
 For the Europeans, who played a decisive role in shaping boundaries and exploiting the continent's vast mineral resources, Africa remains a distinctive grid of cookie-cutter countries, each with its own colonial language, each belonging to a putative sphere of Western influence. But for the Americans, particularly filmmakers, writers and other shapers of the popular culture, the continent is still a forbidding, almost undifferentiated land mass, stripped even of the cold war shadings that supposedly enabled them to distinguish the good guys from the bad.
 
Alarmist Jumbles
 Africa, unlike many other regions of the world, is routinely given the broad brush in the American press. Many Africans complain that even serious writing, like the widely discussed article, "The Coming Anarchy," by Robert Kaplan, which appeared in The Atlantic Monthly earlier this year, makes an alarmist jumble of Africa that betrays American prejudices while trying to explain the continent's realities.
 "Each time I went to the Abidjan bus terminal, groups of men with restless, scanning eyes surrounded my taxi, demanding tips for carrying my luggage," writes Mr. Kaplan, who argues that thuggery is sweeping the third world, filling the void left by vanished ideological struggles.
 "The tragedy is that he will mislead a lot of people, and be used by others for dubious purposes, and it will be West Africa that suffers," an editorialist wrote in West Africa, a regional magazine, replying to Mr. Kaplan's work. "But this will not be the first time that different parts of the region have been used as passive foils for the psychoses of others."
 Mr. MacDonald, the record producer, took another view. "For Africa, it is like the world doesn't recognize that there is parallel chronological movement," he said. "Either we overcompensate and boost it by invoking the past, or we just write it off as one big poverty-stricken phantasm."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Fine-Tuning With a Hammer

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHEN for the first time in a decade, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a startling three-quarters of a percentage point last week, there was hardly a murmur of protest from the White House or Congress. And for an obvious reason: America's factories and offices are running at full tilt, much faster than the talking heads were predicting just a few months ago.
 But lurking behind the near-consensus that it is time to rein in the economy is the disquieting reality that Washington has come to rely exclusively on the Fed to buffer the ebb and flood of economic tides. And while the institution generally gets high marks from economists -- "It's hard to fault monetary policy in the last decade," said Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard -- there is, arguably, a substantial price to be paid for leaving it all to the gnomes. 
 For one thing, Government's increasing reliance on monetary policy is a symptom of the paralysis of the nation's budget-making process. If this was such a dandy moment to reduce private spending by crunching credit, it should have been an even dandier moment to kill two economic birds with one stone -- reducing private spending by raising taxes or by cutting Government spending, and thereby trimming the deficit as well.
 To put it another way, instead of making it harder for private interests to borrow, it might have been nice to make it harder for the Government to borrow. "This year should have been the year the budget went into surplus," laments David Hale, an economist at the Kemper Financial Group in Chicago.
 For another, the interest-rate increase represents the political triumph of single-minded inflation-fighters over those who would prefer to balance the risk of inflation against the risk of pushing the economy into decline. And the threat of another recession is probably greater than most Americans (including President Clinton) imagine.
 "We've barely begun to feel the effects of the 2 1/2-percentage-point interest-rate increases initiated in February," warned William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University.
 The case for a solid jolt in interest rates was not hard to make. While it is true that inflation is showing only faint signs of kicking up, the rates of unemployment and factory output have both hit levels that did lead to higher prices in the 1970's and 1980's. It came as no great surprise, then, that both Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, neoliberal academic economists appointed to the Fed by President Clinton, voted for the increase last week.
 What was a little surprising, at least given the rhetoric of the 1992 Presidential campaign, was the failure to see the current boom as a time to take another whack at the Federal deficit. In a Keynesian world of active fiscal policy, government budgets are supposed to counter the natural cycle in business activity by raising people's purchasing power in lean economic times or cutting it during periods of robust growth. A "neutral" budget policy would be one in which the budget was balanced as the economy approach full capacity.
 Keynesian economics is out of fashion in the sense that few experts still believe Washington has the political or economic savvy to change the Government's fiscal stance in a timely way. One reason Keynesian economics fell into disfavor is that the results take so long to show up that few politicians have faith in the theory.
 But the idea that deficit cutting is less of a problem during economic booms is still alive and well. Indeed, the Clinton Administration was divided over the wisdom of the President's deficit-reduction plan in 1993 because some very respectable economists feared it would push a wobbly economy into recession. Nobody, of course, believes the economy is wobbling now.
 Mr. Friedman thinks it would have been a fine time to reduce the budget deficit once again, freeing more economic resources for private investment that would increase long-term growth rates. "It was a lost opportunity," he concluded wistfully.
 Another, subtler concern is that dependence on the Fed to fine-tune the economy is itself risky.
 The worry here is not that Congress and the White House have forsaken the role they assumed in the 1960's and 1970's, when they used the power to tax and spend to smooth the bumps on the economic road. Even economists who believe that such strategies offered a reliable means of changing consumer and investor behavior acknowledge that timing was a problem. The gaps between deciding on a plan and putting it into action were so long that the business cycle often turned before the policy was in place.
 What is arguably a worry, though, is that the Fed's priorities differ from those of officials who face the electorate at regular intervals.
 "The Fed is paid to uphold the purchasing power of the dollar, period," concluded Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs International. But without the older correctives of taxing and spending, the Fed is the only game in town and its agenda, inflation-fighting, is the only one that matters.
 
Delayed Effects
 Of course, the Fed is regularly obliged to justify its policies to Congress. But there is a catch: While the Fed can turn interest rates on a dime, it takes a very long time to realize the consequences. Mr. Nordhaus notes that the latest economic models suggest it takes 15 to 18 months to feel the brunt of changes in monetary policy. And that implies that the long upward march in interest rates that began last February are only beginning to be felt.
 This is probably not a great concern to a majority of Fed governors who would apparently prefer to err on the side of price stability, taking the chance that excessively tight money will push the economy into recession -- as it apparently did in 1990.
 Nor, suggest Mr. Hale, is it a great concern to the more conservative members of President Clinton's economic circle, who share the Fed's bias and in any case would rather face the political repercussions from rising unemployment in 1995 than in the election year of 1996.
 But it might well concern Americans who, in spite of being employed in record numbers, sense that their jobs are always on the line.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Few Fan Sparks as Cuba Smolders

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
ONE morning late in the summer exodus that became a spectacle of Cubans' desperation under Communist rule, a compact, 40-ish woman marched down a rocky beach near this city to where a group of would-be refugees was fashioning a raft from scrap lumber and old inner tubes.
"Why should we leave?" the woman demanded suddenly, stopping the work cold. "If we are going to risk our lives in the sea, letting the sharks eat us, why not die fighting against the ruler? Did we not fight against Batista when he had a big army? Why can we not fight against Fidel, when he is killing us by not giving us food?" 
 Throughout the sweltering Cuban summer, such eruptions of dissent led many students of the island's politics to suspect a turning point in people's willingness to confront the Government, at least in order to escape it: State-owned boats were hijacked, even after at least 33 people were killed when one of them was sunk by the authorities as it tried to get away. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people rioted against the security forces near the Havana sea wall on Aug. 5. More than 30,000 people fled in rafts, many of them railing openly about the regime as they left.
 Weeks later, however, the bold woman of the beach, who said she had just quit as an officer in the Interior Ministry, was asking softly that her name not be published. Over thimbles of strong coffee in a tiny, concrete-block apartment, she despaired that the power of President Fidel Castro's security apparatus might never be broken.
 "What I fear," she nearly whispered when a young daughter had left the room, "is that I will not live to see the end of this."
 
Nothing to Burn
 It was easy enough to see what kept the summer's sparks from catching: There was no tinder. Leaders of the small political and human rights groups that constitute the island's dissident movement were still trying to telephone one another about the riot when security forces rounded them up for brief detentions. Catholic Church leaders criticized the sinking of the hijacked ferry, then fell virtually silent. Priests of the growing Afro-Cuban and Pentacostal sects would hardly have thought of speaking out. Disaffected revolutionaries like the woman on the beach found themselves stirred but with nowhere to go.
 As the season turned, the country's mood changed. The rafters disappeared, their impulses stilled by an American promise that at least 20,000 people would be allowed to emigrate to the United States legally each year. Shortly afterward, the tumult of their departures gave way to new, Government-sanctioned farmers' markets and preparations for the free sale of other goods ranging from brooms and beer to plastic sinks and homemade coffee pots.
 Such developments were not likely to change the minds of people who opposed the Government. With prices in the free markets well above what many Cubans could afford, they hardly sated the country's hunger. But whether or not they signal any end to Cuba's devastating economic decline that began with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, some of those who were fed up spoke of things getting a little easier for the first time in memory.
 "You know what a free market is?" a gnarled man of 65 asked as he sold straw hats at a weekend fair in the town of Santo Domingo, near the center of the island. "You have a cow, you want to kill it, you kill it! The way things should be."
 Even to the extent that Cuba's tentative experiments in economic liberalization succeed in releasing pressure by making food and other goods more available, they carry an obvious political cost. The Communist Party is ceding its monopoly control of material rewards. Like other Cubans, the mid-level army officers and apparatchiks whose status sometimes means little more than an extra bag of groceries, must fend for themselves in the harsh capitalism of a teeming black market. The ideological firmament of a generation is slowly cracking.
 "The educated me to be like Che, to think like Che, as a real Communist," a 34-year-old man named Juan said, referring to the revolutionary hero Ernesto (Che) Guevara as he explained why he had quit as captain in the Interior Ministry a few weeks before. "Everything has changed. We did not struggle all that we did to end up like this. The men who are running this country now are not real Communists."
 Still, it is hard to imagine what a man like Juan might see in, say, Elizardo Sanchez. A former political prisoner, Mr. Sanchez has a reputation abroad as a thoughtful, even courageous advocate for human rights, a careful moderate in extreme circumstances. But he is not much of a politician, and he has few illusions about what kind of movement he might lead.
 "I always thought Cubans were very brave and tough," he said. "But that is really the legend that we have for ourselves. What these 35 years of Castro have showed us is that we are a peaceful people, a people better suited for receiving tourists than for combat."
 
The Visa Valve
 Whether immigration pressures might threaten Mr. Castro as they did his counterparts in Eastern Europe will likely depend on the success of the immigration agreement that Cuba signed with the United States Sept. 9. But it is doubtful that even 20,000 visas will be enough for those who would like to leave, particularly if the Clinton Administration retracts its vow that the Cuban refugees will no longer be admitted automatically into the United States. And with the political-control mechanisms of the Government and the faith of some revolutionaries eroding, the question is perhaps not whether there will be more sparks, but what they might ignite.

HEADLINE: INSECURITY FOREVER;
The Rise of the Losing Class

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHEN Karl Marx described an increasingly miserable and exploited working class, he never imagined that his oppressed workers might someday include Ivy League M.B.A's tossed out of $200,000-a-year jobs.
 But a changing economy is gradually linking highly educated managers and technicians with high-school- trained assembly-line workers and office clerks. The link is in their common place in an increasingly competitive economy that no longer values workers as much as it once did. What they share, public opinion polls show, are feelings of uncertainty, insecurity and anxiety about their jobs and their incomes. 
 A class consciousness may be emerging from this shared anxiety -- an awareness among millions of Americans that they occupy the same unsteady boat, even if they are doing well in high-paying jobs. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, giving the phenomenon a name, describes "the anxious class" as "consisting of millions of Americans who no longer can count on having their jobs next year, or next month, and whose wages have stagnated or lost ground to inflation."
 But the growing sense that people of different levels of salary, education and skill may be victims of the same economic forces lacks two crucial elements of class consciousness as the term has historically been used: a class vocabulary and a class enemy. The traditional adversaries -- big business, owners of capital, managers -- are no longer viewed that way.
 Instead, business is seen as also a victim, caught in a global competition that forces cost-cutting and layoffs. That sort of thinking showed up in focus group sessions and follow-up interviews with 2,400 workers of various levels of income and skill for a soon-to-be released study directed by Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, and Joel Rogers, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Wisconsin.
 
'My Boss Is Trying'
 "They tell us, 'My boss is trying hard, but there is nothing he can do, either,' " Mr. Rogers said. "That does not mean they don't see their employer as often unfair and cruel. But then they say he does not have the ability to protect them, which is much different than saying, 'He could protect me if he wanted to but he chooses not to.' "
 It is this forgiving attitude toward management that distinguishes today's unhappy workers from their forebears. If the boss were the target, it would be easier to know what to do: People might take action in groups. But public opinion polls show that while Americans are increasingly angry about their economic insecurity, neither business nor the forces that make companies so hard on workers are the targets of this anger. It is directed instead at government, immigrants and the poor, among others.
 The 1994 electoral uprising suggested that if there is a class enemy it is an ill-defined political class, a combination of government and media that are seen as imposing their social and cultural views on an alienated populace. But this modern populism, unlike the 19th-century movement that provided the name, sidesteps the main source of discontent: the economic changes that define America's new anxious class.
 "You would think that in a free enterprise system, there would be more criticism of its warts," said Florence Skelly, vice chairman of DYG Inc., a polling company founded by Daniel Yankelovich. "Instead, we say that government should be run more like a business. And we deal with the boss by ousting the Congressman."
 The anxiety, uncertainty and insecurity that characterize the new class consciousness show up in different ways in public opinion polls. Although the economy is growing briskly and unemployment is down, only 31 percent of those surveyed this month by Louis Harris & Associates see this improvement. "Over and over, people tell us they are concerned about their jobs, that they don't feel secure, that the economy is doing badly," Humphrey Taylor, Harris's chairman, said. "For most people, if the economy is not synonymous with jobs, it is at least highly coordinated with jobs."
 Secretary Reich, who has argued that education and training provide the best assurance of job security, contends that most members of the anxious class have only high-school educations. But he, too, now acknowledges that education is less and less of a buffer against the joblessness and stagnant incomes that are drawing people into a sense of shared uncertainty.
 A variety of statistics shows that the incomes of college-educated people have been failing in recent years to keep pace with inflation. Men in their early 50's with four years of college, for example, have been stuck for 10 years at the same income, adjusted for inflation, according to the findings of Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 "In the old days, in the 1950's and 1960's, if you lost a job, you could get another, paying less, and within a few years your rising income would soon get you back to your old level," Mr. Levy said. "It was a safety net."
 Two major polling operations -- the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys and the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center -- describe the anxiety and insecurity that emerge from life without this safety net, even among people with good jobs at good pay. Ask such people about their current economic circumstances, and many reply positively. But ask them what they think the future holds for them or their children, and the anxiety surfaces.
 
The Fearsome Future
 "For the first time in 50 years, we are recording a decline in people's expectations," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. "And their uncertainty and anxiety grow the farther you ask them to look into the future."
 The source of these feelings, and the nascent class consciousness, appears to be rooted mainly in layoffs, both real and expected. Over the last decade or so, layoffs have spread from blue-collar workers and the less educated across the income and education spectrum.
 "Every day people open the newspaper and see that some major company has laid off workers," Mr. Taylor said. "I am sure that downsizing is now seen as a permanent function of management, and that is new."
 Americans in the past dealt with labor problems differently than they do today, reflecting a different class structure. During the Depression, the thousands laid off at Ford Motor Company, for example, saw Henry Ford as the enemy and the source of a solution. They agitated for relief pay from Ford or shorter hours for those still working, to make room for those laid off.
 
Sense of Entitlement
 "People thought of themselves as having rights from companies," said Joshua Freeman, a labor historian at Columbia University. That sense of entitlement grew even stronger in the early decades after World War II, and collective bargaining -- or simply bargaining with management in the case of nonunion companies -- became the arena for arguing out wages, pensions, health insurance, vacations, hours and job security.
 That system is disappearing today. Career-long attachments to one employer, a notion born in the 1920's, are no longer the norm. The new class consciousness makes less distinction between workers and managers. Rights are relative, at best. An increasingly conservative electorate has reduced government's role in regulating the economy. Unions have lost influence and membership.
 And against a background of rising competition, corporate America has gained the power to reorganize and relocate and downsize, almost at will -- leaving, as Mr. Freeman put it, "no structure to deal with the new anxiety and uncertainty."
 What people do is try to cope, by themselves, said Ms. Skelly, of DGY. Self-employment is one solution, DGY's polls show, and that is a rising trend. "They try, on the job, to hide any chinks in their performance," she said. "They work longer hours and take work home, without letting the boss know, to give the impression that they can do difficult tasks quickly. There is nothing like, 'We are all in this together.' There is too much competition. People talk of their vulnerability to friends and spouses, but not to co-workers."
 And many Americans feel in their hearts that the layoffs might be justified. "There is a sense among people that we are inefficient and bloated," Ms. Skelly said. "And until they feel that is no longer true, they are reluctant to criticize the forces that are cutting out the fat and the inefficiencies."

HEADLINE: In One Town, Fed Move Brings Some Fear

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FREDERICK, Md., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Sitting in the Chat 'n' Chew Restaurant, Chris Adams and Dennis Price were eating their $3.75 hot turkey dinners and saying today that they were as mystified as anyone in town about the economic direction of the country.
As partners in a year-old home improvement company that has enjoyed a reasonably good start, they now have the latest interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve to think about. The Fed action, raising the short-term interest rates it controls by three-quarters of a percentage point, was announced on Tuesday as an essential step to contain inflation. Big banks across the country immediately raised the prime lending rate, a response generally considered bad news for people seeking loans and good news for most investors. 
 For the partners, it was a little of both, and their ambiguity was reflected around town, as most people said they were not sure what to make of the Fed's latest move. Many said that they were unconvinced that the economy has been stabilized or that average people would be better off.
And almost all expressed a disquieting fear that whatever security they might have with their current jobs or financial situation could be jeopardized tomorrow or the next day.
"I was happy the way things were going," said Mr. Price, whose company specializes in vinyl siding and other exterior work. "But now, I don't know. I don't know what the answer is."
On the one hand, he explained, the company might benefit because 90 percent of its clients are elderly -- people who have lived in their houses for decades, who have invested wisely and, with the higher interest rates for their investments, expect to have more money to renovate their homes. Over the several years that interest rates fell, through 1993, Mr. Price and Mr. Adams said that many elderly home owners could not afford home improvements.
But on the other hand, Mr. Price said, "Higher rates will eliminate some of our Yuppies with a couple of kids, cars and a house to pay for. They're not going to be able to do as much. Maybe the elderly will offset that."
In addition, the partners' plans to construct a building for the business next year could be shelved. "We have to reassess that now," Mr. Adams said.
Frederick is an old but fast-growing town of 45,000 people that serves as a bedroom community for Baltimore to the east and Washington to the south. Francis Scott Key, the author of "The Star-Spangled Banner," came from here, but 180 years after he wrote his famous song, he would hardly recognize the place. All around its quaint central district of antique shops, small boutiques and eateries is an expanding nexus of insurance companies, mortgage brokers, high-tech industries and strip malls.
With crime, traffic and other urban ills spreading into the near suburbs of Baltimore and Washington, each about an hour away, Frederick has grown to the second-largest city in Maryland, but a place residents say still offers a high quality of life with minimal crime, safe streets, affordable housing and superior schools. The area has become so attractive that some town leaders say they would be just as happy if the population growth slowed and subsequent economic development served only to lower the county's already low 3.9 percent unemployment rate.
Yet the climbing interest rates have crept into the town like a thick smog: People are not sure how it might affect them or when it might clear out.
Joseph Dahms, a professor of economics at Hood College in Frederick, predicted that the rate increase would hurt the city and surrounding areas in a variety of ways. Fewer people, he said, will be able to buy or refinance houses or purchase cars and other high-cost items. Retailers could suffer the immediate effects of people spending less money for Christmas, he said, because they do not want to run up their credit card balances.
"This has scared people, and it's a surprise," he said of the timing and size of the rate increase. "A quarter of a point people could have lived with. The Fed has always been more paranoid about inflation than unemployment, but three-quarters of a point is pretty unusual."
For some area residents, like Mary Losovsky, the higher interest rates could not come at a worse time. A 29-year-old secretary who trained as a teacher but could not find a job, she and her fiance, Jason Hoffman, are getting married on Nov. 26. More than anything, she said, they wanted to buy a house. Now, that seems impossible.
Some time ago, she said, she shopped around and found that a decent town house in the area would cost more than $100,000. A bank would only qualify her for a loan of about $70,000. Even with Mr. Hoffman's salary as a worker with a lawn-care company, the single-family house she wants is out of reach. "It seems to be a ways off now," she said.
"I have a lot of friends with kids who want to buy a bigger house but they can't afford it," Ms. Losovsky said. "That frightens you."
Marvin Lohr, owner of the Village Restaurant and Soda Fountain, has watched his business slowly improve in recent years. But now he wonders how long that might continue. New restaurants are opening all the time, he said. Some of the bigger and better-financed operations are advertising on radio and in the local newspapers. "I can compete with their food," he said. "But not their advertising."
Before Tuesday, Mr. Lohr said he had been thinking about refinancing his debts to improve his cash position. Now, he is hesitant. "I know there's this fear about inflation," he said of the Federal Reserve's rationale, "but I still think they are ahead of the game. Or I don't see that far enough out. I'm not sure."
Almost every morning at the Village, a group of octogenarians push a few tables together to drink coffee and discuss current events. Most are long-time residents of Frederick, like Charles V. Main, the 84-year-old former police chief and de facto host of the table.
"It's just wrong," he said of the rising interest rates. "Middle-class people just can't afford it. It only enhances the value of the rich, the man with a lot of investments. It doesn't hurt me, but I must console people younger than me."
Don Falconer, an 80-year-old retired engineer, said: "It's an overreaction by the Fed. The Government seems to dabble a little too much into the economy, and by so doing, they're going to stifle it. They're being too tight about inflation."
Bud Radcliffe, a 78-year-old former banker, was the only member of the group who acknowledged a personal gain from the higher rates. With money invested in certificates of deposit, he said he would make money as a result. "But I don't think it's good for the economy," he said.
Sitting at a table nearby, Linda Foflygen, a 42-year-old mother of four, shook her head. The wife of an art teacher who supplements his income by working for an engineering firm, Mrs. Foflygen said recent interest rate increases had cost them money. They had been waiting final approval for refinancing their house in Frederick's historic district, she said, before finally getting a rate of 8.25 percent.
"I don't know why they are rushing to raise the rates again, now that people are becoming comfortable with the economy and spending," she said. "Why stifle it? If we were trying to refinance now, we couldn't afford it."

HEADLINE: Southern Africa's Old Front Line Ponders Its Future in Mainstream

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Nov. 19

 BODY:
As a summit meeting of southern African leaders was winding down last month, Frederick Chiluba, the elfin former union leader who is now the President of Zambia, lapsed into a pensive monologue.
Maybe Africa was not really cut out for Western-style democracy, he told his fellow heads of state with a sigh. How could a president get anything done with opponents constantly carping at him? Maybe the one-party state was the way to go, after all. 
 "To run our countries effectively, we have to be securely in control," he said, according to another participant in the meeting. Soon, leaders from South Africa and Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique were all embroiled in this philosophical debate.
Not long ago, it would have been hard to find a quorum of African leaders who could argue from experience about the frustrations of democracy.
But while much of the continent languishes under warlords, despots, or martial rule, southern Africa is coalescing into a region of peace and political pluralism, sometimes crudely honored but remarkable by African standards.
Already this year 3 of the 10 countries that make up the bottom third of Africa -- South Africa, Mozambique and Malawi -- have settled domestic conflicts through negotiation and elections and joined the club of novice democracies.
Today leaders from across the southern part of the continent converged on this placid capital hoping to induct their newest recruit, Angola, a country that has spent most of the last 33 years at war.
Eduardo dos Santos, the Angolan President, arrived today for the scheduled signing Sunday of a treaty promising a cease-fire and a share of power for the Unita rebel movement.
But United Nations officials said tonight that the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, had refused to come for fear of his personal safety. The treaty was to be signed instead by less senior officials on both sides, indicating that even if the rivals stop fighting, they are a long way from trusting one another. If Angola can be calmed, a region of more than 100 million people will be at peace for the first time since the liberation uprisings of the 1960's.
Every country but one, the tiny monarchy of Swaziland, has passed through multiparty elections and all, with varying degrees of indulgence, tolerate political opponents.
The style and oratory have changed, too. Not long ago in southern Africa, the role model was the guerrilla freedom fighters, the battle cry was black nationalism infused with an anticapitalist economic populism, and the symbol of political dissent was the raised fist, often clutching an AK-47 assault rifle.
Now the role model is Nelson Mandela, the freedom fighter mellowed into a conciliator. The battle cry is growth and investment. The hip acronym is G.N.U. -- for Government of National Unity, the power-sharing arrangement embraced most famously in South Africa, but also used in Zimbabwe and contemplated in Angola and Mozambique.
Whether peace and democracy will take firm hold in southern Africa is a question the African presidents debate among themselves, as Mr. Chiluba's remarks last month indicated.
Sometimes the new African democrats seem less like a regional bloc than a 12-step support group -- reformed warriors who help one another resist the temptation to return to old, violent habits.
How did it happen that, on a continent more famous for slaughter and starvation, this region has become an advertisement for hope?
One reason is the demise of the Soviet Union and subsequent retreat of the superpowers, who for many years financed their proxies in a battle for strategic influence and ideological high ground.
Another is the domino effect of change in South Africa, the richest and most developed country in the region.
To defend its flanks against black insurgency, the apartheid rulers in South Africa sponsored wars in neighboring Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Angola, South-West Africa (now Namibia) and Mozambique.
With the election in April of a coalition Government led by Mr. Mandela, South Africa has been transformed into an alternative model of how to deal with enemies.
The change has given new life to the main regional political forum, which was originally formed to combat white racists in South Africa and still goes by the militaristic name of the Front Line States.
With South Africa now a member, that organization has begun to synchronize its diplomacy as a force for regional stability in ways unthinkable before.
When Lesotho's fledgling democracy was overthrown by the military last August, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana brought pressure, including a threat to send troops, until the legal Government was restored.
When the leader of the Mozambican rebels announced a boycott during the country's first elections last month, the Front Line States summoned him to Harare, Zimbabwe, for a stern warning.
Front Line representatives have met twice here this week to orchestrate diplomatic pressure for peace in Angola, trying to halt a Government military offensive, and trying to convince Mr. Savimbi that it was safe to emerge from hiding.
Once the Angolan treaty is signed, it is widely expected that troops from the region will join the 7,000-member peacekeeping force to be deployed in Angola under the auspices of the United Nations, including for the first time noncombat troops from Mr. Mandela's South Africa.
"There is a fundamental resistance in South Africa to any military intervention in any state in southern Africa," said Rusty Evans, a senior official in the South African Foreign Ministry. South Africa is in the midst of rebuilding its white-led army, he noted, and besides, "we feel that we have got a history that we've got to live down."
"We were seen as a major destabilizer in the region," he said, "and our objective now is to build the confidence of our neighbors." But in the case of Angola, he said: "We would certainly be responsive. I'm fairly certain we would not send infantry. But without a doubt we will commit major resources to the lifting of land mines, reconstruction of bridges, and providing military medical facilities."
African officials and foreign diplomats point to a number of dangers that could stifle the promise of the region.
Aldo Ajello, the United Nations diplomat who nursed the peace in Mozambique, said the main question was whether African states could avoid the temptation to crush their opponents, driving them back to war.
Democracy is still far from free-wheeling in several states of the region. In Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe has never let rivals gain enough political influence to pose a serious challenge to him. Here in Zambia, where Mr. Chiluba was the victor in the first multiparty elections in 1991, the state-run media are filled with propaganda accusing opponents of undocumented crimes.
"What is esoteric for Africa is the concept of the opposition as a permanent component of the political dialectic," Mr. Ajello said. "In local culture, once the chief is selected, he is the bloody chief."
As a result, he and other Western diplomats have become strong promoters of including the opposition in some executive role, as South Africa has done.
But many Africans resent this advice as another example of Western paternalism, noting that few Western politicians share power with the opposition in their own countries.
Another danger to the region's peace is economic hardship. Unless the elected governments of southern Africa quickly begin to raise standards of living, they could face less-than-democratic challengers, or wide-scale banditry, or internal dissension, which could break down along ethnic lines.
And always there is the question of whether the outside world will lose interest just when these countries need rebuilding.
"Our biggest danger is a sense of Afro-pessimism," said Mario Pizarro, an Angolan banker and business consultant. The conflicts in Rwanda and Somalia and other African horrors, he said, have exhausted foreign donors and frightened off potential investors.
In formerly Marxist countries like Angola and Mozambique, Mr. Pizarro added, foreign help is needed to nurture a strong private sector, which could become a lobby for stability, much as South African business pushed the white Government there toward compromise.
"Peace is good for business," he said. "If you had a strong private sector in Angola like in South Africa, the war would have ended many years ago."

Chart/Map: "IN THE REGION: A New Era in Southern Africa"
 The two sides in Angola's civil war are to sign a treaty today that could bring peace and democracy to all of Southern Africa for the first time since the anti-colonial uprisings of the 1960's. Except for Botswana and Swaziland, the countries in the region have undergone democratic transitions in recent years.*

 RESOLUTION -- The defeated white regime yielded in 1980.
 OPPOSITION -- Robert Mugabe, the rebel commander who became President, has not installed a one-party state, but coopted the main opposition by making Joshua Nkomo, of the minority Ndebele tribe, his Vice President.
 
Malawi
 OLD CONFLICT -- After leading the protests that won independence from British rule in 1964, Hastings Kamuzu Banda consolidated all power in an eccentric, one-party despotism.
 RESOLUTION -- The country's first multiparty elections in May ended his 30-year personality cult.
 OPPOSITION -- Mr. Banda's party driven into parliamentary opposition.
 
Mozambique
 OLD CONFLICT -- Ruling Frelimo party, which led the ouster of Portugese colonials was bedeviled for 16 years by Renamo rebels, originally sponsored by white regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia.
 RESOLUTION -- After two years of ceasefire, incumbent president Joaquim Chissano and his Frelimo party won elections in October.
 OPPOSITION -- Renamo holds a large opposition bloc in Parliament, and there is talk of some kind of power-sharing.

HEADLINE: A Capitol Hill Empire Is in Eclipse, Ending a Long Reign by Its Emperor

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
After 14 years of unchecked expansion, the empire of Representative John David Dingell Jr. is being dismantled.
Like a plump Thanksgiving turkey, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Mr. Dingell has been chairman since 1981, is being readied to be carved up and dished out. Gleeful Republicans have begun to disassemble its muscular investigative unit and pass around its meaty legislative authority. 
 Unlike a few less important committees, which the new Republican majority plans to scrap entirely, Energy and Commerce is being reorganized. But the scope of that reorganization will be sweeping, and the fate of the legislative and investigative apparatus that Mr. Dingell created starkly illustrates the meaning of the change in House control after 40 years of Democratic dominance.
In the hallways of Capitol Hill, no committee came to symbolize the exercise of Democratic power more than Energy and Commerce. After years of complaining that the committee's reach was far too broad, the Republicans now have a chance to do something about it. Another impetus for stripping the committee of much of its power is that new Republican chairmen of some other committees are eager to exercise the authority that until now has belonged to the chief of Energy and Commerce.
Although it is the House's oldest committee, having been around in one form or another since 1795, Energy and Commerce grew to prominence only in this century, through decades of nurturing by Sam Rayburn. The Texas Democrat was its chairman when it cranked out mounds of New Deal legislation that created a vast new Federal regulatory bureaucracy in the 1930's.
Twenty years later, as Speaker of the House, Mr. Rayburn continued to expand the panel's oversight authority, and in the 1980's Mr. Dingell, who has represented his suburban Detroit district since 1955, built it into the biggest committee in Congress. Its Democratic staff alone numbered more than 140 people.
Under Mr. Dingell's control, Energy and Commerce was known not only for its prodigious law writing -- nearly half of all bills that reached the floor passed through the committee -- but also as an investigative powerhouse that was more than a match for the biggest corporations, academic institutions and Federal agencies.
The National Journal once observed that the Dingell committee claimed jurisdiction over anything that moved, burned or was sold. It oversaw clean-air regulations and securities markets, telecommunications and energy, railroads and toys and consumer protection.
Now, with the convening of the 104th Congress in January, Mr. Dingell will become the senior ranking member of the House of Representatives and the sole survivor among a group of senior lawmakers known as the Old Democratic Bulls. And he will find his old committee scaled back to a shadow of what it was.
Not only will it be considerably smaller and have far less authority, it will be in control of business-oriented conservative Republicans who have already made plain their intention not to take on industries like tobacco, aerospace and insurance in the same way Mr. Dingell, a former Wayne County prosecutor, did for years.
While details remain to be sorted out, Republican plans could reduce Mr. Dingell's own staff on the committee -- and on the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which he also led -- to one-tenth the current size.
One development accompanying the reduction in the committee's strength has been a power struggle among rival Republicans. In particular, Mr. Dingell's successor as Energy and Commerce chairman, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, and the prospective head of the House Banking Committee, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, are locked in a fight over which committee should oversee Wall Street. The maneuvering is such that several industries have even joined in it, paying their lobbyists to engage in the fight over whom they should be lobbying.
This week many of the tenacious investigators of Mr. Dingell's oversight subcommittee, once feared by regulators, businessmen and scientists, began packing up and morbidly joking about their new careers come January.
"I'll be going to 14th and U, where the unemployment office is," said a senior staff lawyer who to the end insisted on speaking anonymously so as not to upstage the chairman, who was off on a hunting trip and could not be reached for comment.
Aides say the committee's remaining significant jurisdiction will be in health care, at a time when neither Congress nor the White House is much inclined to write any broad health care legislation.
In contrast, Mr. Dingell over the years pushed the committee's authority to the limits, in part by creatively interpreting its mandate. To the consternation of the Armed Services Committee, he held hearings on defense contractors in the 1980's, contending that the inquiry was an adjunct to his own committee's oversight of publicly traded companies.
His investigations helped force the resignation of the president of Stanford University, which spent more than $20 million to respond to his queries on its billing for government-financed research. They led a Nobel laureate scientist to retract a research paper. They uncovered mismanagement at the Food and Drug Administration and at the Environmental Protection Agency, and overbilling at large hospitals.
They exposed waste and fraud at the Pentagon: the Air Force's $640 toilet seat and the kennel fees that the military paid for the dog of a General Dynamics executive. They found corruption in the generic-drug industry. Everything from nuts and bolts to blood banks, bottled water and cardiac pacemakers are unquestionably safer now than they once were because of Mr. Dingell's efforts.
His allies have called Mr. Dingell's questioning penetrating, his investigations a sure sign of good government and his committee a haven to whistleblowers.
"The only people who will be happy about this change will be malefactors," said Michael F. Barrett Jr., who was chief counsel to the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee from 1981 to 1991 and who has since represented some targets and witnesses before Mr. Dingell.
To his critics, though, the 68-year-old departing chairman was a bully, mean-spirited, vindictive and power-hungry. Many lawmakers saw more than a coincidence when he pushed for legislation to put a nuclear waste dump in Nevada after Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat from that state, took on the automobile industry, which Mr. Dingell champions, by advancing a bill to require higher gasoline mileage standards.
Joseph N. Onek, a lawyer for Dr. Bernard Fisher and Dr. Robert Gallo, prominent scientists whose research was attacked by the committee, says Mr. Dingell's staff recklessly abused its power.
"They were famous for leaking documents, generating press stories and acting in ways that one would not expect of a responsible Congressional committee," Mr. Onek said. "They would decide they didn't like people and then went after them in ways that were inappropriate."
In recent days, Mr. Dingell's Republican successor, Mr. Bliley, has been struggling to keep as much of the old Energy and Commerce Committee intact as possible, insisting that it would be unfair to him to have a dramatically diminished committee after he toiled on the panel in relative obscurity for 14 years. At a private meeting of transition officials on Wednesday, one participant said, Mr. Bliley pleaded with Republican leaders that "in their haste to get back at Dingell, the Republicans shouldn't be aiming their knives at Bliley's back."
But without Mr. Dingell's towering presence as the head of the committee, rival committees have begun to try to wrest control in areas like energy, railroads, the Coast Guard, the environment, Medicaid and Medicare. And banking groups have been lobbying to have oversight of their old rival, the securities industry, switched from Energy and Commerce to the Banking Committee. Wall Street lobbyists have been fighting back, telling members of Congress that the role should remain at Energy and Commerce, with which the securities industry has dealt for years.
In the scramble over jurisdiction, Republicans on other committees are hoping not only to gain more authority but also to rid themselves of issues they have found counterproductive.
For instance, Mr. Leach, of the Banking Committee, has told the Republican leadership that he would gladly take securities industry jurisdiction and in exchange give up the committee's oversight of Federal housing. Such a swap would greatly expand the Banking Committee's authority. It would also probably lead to the departure of several liberal Democrats who joined the committee to be involved in public housing issues and have also used it as a platform to criticize the bankers.

Chart: "LEGACY: Chairman Dingell's Long Reach"
 Under the Democrats, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has had the broadest jurisdiction of any committee in Congress, passing judgment on 40 percent of all legislation that has reached the floor of the House of Representatives.
 Under House rules, the committee, which has construed its jurisdiction widely, oversees legislation and investigations in the following areas:
 -- Interstate and foreign commerce
 -- All issues relating to national energy policy, conservation, the energy industry, interstate energy compacts, the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 -- Inland waterways
 -- Railroads
 -- Regulation of interstate and foreicn communications
 -- Securities and exchanges
 -- Consumer affairs and consumer protection

HEADLINE: Inflation Fuels Discontent Against Iran's Government

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Iranian demonstrators took time out from a week of state-sponsored anti-American rallies recently to redirect their anger against the Islamic Government and economic policies that have created a crisis of inflation.
At a demonstration this month commemorating the takeover of the United States Embassy during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, nearly 500 students called for the execution of "capitalists" and denounced lawmakers for favoring wealthy merchants over low-income groups. 
 "Free market economic policies must be corrected," the protesters chanted. "The system must help the poor."
The protest, the second in two weeks at Teheran University, was only the latest example of unrest that signals a crisis of confidence in the Government.
In October, 800 students marched against legislation that would have required them to pay if they failed a course, although there is no tuition at the university. After the protest, Parliament defeated the bill.
Senior Government officials promised to continue a previously announced crackdown on speculators and profiteers who had been hoarding large amounts of food after the Government imposed price controls. But the economy has sent few encouraging signs.
Industrial growth is at 1 percent so far this year and buying power has been undermined by uncontrolled inflation that has sent some food prices soaring by as much as 4,000 percent since March.
"If structural changes are not made, social and economic opposition can turn into political opposition," said Changiz Pahlavan, a political scientist here. "On the one hand, the state is reluctant to bring about change because they fear that public expectations may rise. On the other, without change, they face a serious challenge. The official thinking is that if they put the crisis behind them, they will survive."
The crackdown on profiteers, planned after a series of urban riots in 1992, was interpreted by independent political scientists and economists here as a short-term remedy, neglecting the more fundamental issues: curbing Government control of the economy and fostering competition. With prices on some basic foods rising 100 to 4,000 percent since March, the Government released a list of "regulated" prices in October, warning violators of financial penalties and flogging.
Then the police, judicial authorities and civilian-clothed Bassij, veterans of the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's, raided dozens of supermarkets and warehouses in a nationwide campaign. The raids yielded thousands of tons of hidden food supplies that merchants were accused of hoarding after the price-control system took effect, The Keyhan newspaper reported.
In Meshed, 460 miles east of Teheran, 600 tons of cooking oil and 140 tons of sugar were discovered this month. The manager of a Teheran department store, Abdulreza Jozani, was fined $13,000 for hoarding. Mr. Jozani was tried immediately after his arrest, as the Bassij held a public auction of goods at regulated prices, 25 percent less than market value.
"Two months ago a kilo of sugar was 30 rials, now it's 2,300 rials," said Morad Seifollahi, a bank employee who moonlights as a cabdriver to supplement his income of 200,000 rials a month, or $68. "Sugar, tea, cooking oil, butter and soap are luxuries in this country. Few people can afford them anymore, unless we stand on line for hours at auctions."
President Hashemi Rafsanjani announced this month that the crackdown against profiteers, branded "economic bloodsuckers," was part of an effort to turn the open market into an "Islamic market" where profit would have to be fair. He criticized the student protesters as immature and seditious.
Turning the oratory traditionally used for American and British "hegemonist powers" on merchants, Mr. Rafsanjani has accused them of "capitalizing on people's discontent."
The latest crisis was set off in March by a sharp increase in the price of state-run services with 60 percent for telecommunications, 100 percent for gas and 300 percent for electricity at plants and factories. Domestic and foreign airline fares jumped 100 percent. The rial fell nearly 60 percent against the dollar in the past year.
Moreover, with shrinking foreign currency reserves, the Government lifted subsidies on raw materials to industries, and more recently on sugar and cooking oil, whose prices jumped 2,000 and 4,000 percent.
Analysts attribute the volatility of Iran's economic transition to a lack of long-term planning, the emergence of monopolies and oligopolies that prevent market forces from working properly.
"We have a hodgepodge economy," said Kamal Athari, an economist and researcher at the state-run Urban Planning Center. "Wealthy bazaar businessmen and special interest groups have formed monopolies engaging in foreign trade and buying state-owned industries. This has prevented real privatization and the emergence of entrepreneurs, impending recovery, especially in the industrial sector."
Mr. Athari continued: "The Government has rejected the free-market logic and principles of command economy without offering a third way. It is slowly discovering that in the absence of an economic program and the appropriate social foundations, the whole system may collapse."

HEADLINE: Latest Rate Hike by the Fed Makes White House Nervous

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The first five times the Federal Reserve raised interest rates this year, the Clinton Administration was surprisingly accepting. But last week's big increase produced a more varied reaction, leading to worries and irritation among some of the Administration's most senior economic officials.
The concern at top levels of the Administration is that the Fed's actions this time may begin to threaten the 31/2 -year-old economic expansion that must continue through 1996 if the President is to have any serious chance of winning re-election. A top policy maker, who insisted on anonymity, called the rate increase "a more marginal decision on the part of the Fed" than the central bank's previous interest rate moves. 
 Only a few hints of irritation have appeared so far in public. Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank N. Newman indirectly questioned the move, saying at an economic policy forum here on Thursday that it is unclear whether the Fed's most recent rate increase is the right approach to forestall inflation or whether it will prove unnecessary.
To be sure, a range of opinion on the Fed exists within the Administration, from complete support to cautious dismay. The weight of opinion among senior officials still seems to lie in favor of grudging acceptance of the rate increases, but a slow shift toward disagreement seems to have begun.
Still, whatever happens, Administration officials say they plan to avoid following the examples of President George Bush and President Lyndon Johnson in publicly and vociferously criticizing the central bank. "We don't comment on the Fed," said Robert E. Rubin, the assistant to the President for economic policy. "We have enormous regard for the independence of the Fed."
Without exception, Administration officials say public remarks would stir fears in financial markets of conflict between the White House and the Fed, pushing long-term interest rates higher. Meanwhile, they would have virtually no effect on the central bankers.
Some officials even fear that public criticisms would prompt the Fed to push interest rates even higher to reassure financial markets of its continued independence.
Mr. Newman, the Treasury official, went out of his way in a subsequent interview to say that when he suggested on Thursday that the rate hike might prove unnecessary, he had not intended to criticize the Fed. "I intended to make no judgment one way or the other, but simply to point out that when one makes decisions based on projections of the future, one finds out in the future if they were right or wrong," Mr. Newman said.
The central bank has tried all year, with little success so far, to rein in the economy's strong growth on the belief that slower growth is necessary to prevent inflation from rising. But the Clinton Administration and many private forecasters believe the Fed will eventually succeed in applying the brakes, with growth at least beginning to slow in 1995 and 1996.
While the timing of the expected slowdown cannot be pinpointed, most economists believe its full brunt is likely to be felt by early 1996, just as the Presidential primary season gets under way. The Fed itself estimates that the full effect of Tuesday's rate increase will not be felt for 12 to 18 months.
The biggest impact from higher interest rates, economists say, comes not from the immediate rise in mortgage and car loan rates, but only later after companies decide that rates have risen so much that it no longer makes sense to build new factories or install extra equipment.
Important corporate investment and purchasing decisions are commonly made a year or more in advance, which makes it very difficult for anyone to predict with confidence how long it takes before monetary policy affects the economy.
Publicly, Administration officials play down the possibility that the Fed's actions will lead to a sharp slowing of economic growth. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in an interview on Thursday that he expected the economy to grow 3.3 percent this year and slow to a 2.7 percent pace in the next two years.
Even though Administration is not prepared to condemn the Fed interest rate hikes, that has not stopped some Congressional Democrats from expressing their fears. "I think the effects of this are going to be disastrous to the economy and that's going to be disastrous to the Democrats," said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat on the House Banking Committee who follows monetary policy.

HEADLINE: In Florida, a Nightmare for Farmers

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Nov. 18

 BODY:
John Alger has had a string of luck so rotten that when he steps into his flooded fields of sweet corn he can only joke. "We keep kidding that we rescued three Cuban rafters crossing across here," he said, pointing over the muddy flats where Tropical Storm Gordon turned 630 of his acres into a miniature Straits of Florida.
The storm's wind and rain ruined crops on tens of thousands of acres across the southern half of Florida this week, and vegetable prices are already increasing in some Eastern grocery stores as a result. But for farmers in Homestead, the crop losses came with an odd twist: although this city south of Miami bore the brunt of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, its vegetable crops suffered more at the hands of this much weaker tropical storm. 
 "Hurricane Andrew was very inconvenient, but this is going to hurt my pocketbook more," Mr. Alger said.
It is mostly a matter of timing. When the 1992 hurricane hit, farmers were nine weeks away from planting, but this time the tropical storm drenched crops that were weeks away from harvest. In 50 years, "this is the worst flooding we've seen during the growing season," Mr. Alger said.
It is the sort of loss that comes with the territory in Florida, where a cold snap can leave orange groves useless and the blessing of year-round harvests carries the curse of Caribbean storms. But for Mr. Alger, a Cornell-educated, 35-year-old grandson of farmers, the recent storm was the worst of three weather disasters in as many years.
First came Hurricane Andrew, whose damage was mostly covered by insurance. Then there was the March 1993 "Storm of the Century." Now, he said, Tropical Storm Gordon has ruined more than $2 million worth of his crops, mostly potatoes and sweet corn, and washed away $265,000 in seed, fertilizer and herbicide. In a good year, Alger Farms grosses $7 million. "I'm going to have to start all over again," he said.
Mr. Alger's crop damage is a small fraction of the loss in the region, where at least 35,000 acres of planted crops were ruined, said Tom Kirby, executive director of the Dade County Farm Bureau, a nonprofit group that represents the growers whose fields lie between Miami and the Everglades.
Over all, the storm may have cost Florida's agriculture industry $336 million, the state Department of Agriculture said. The high winds shredded leafy crops like lettuce, and the rain inundated squash, corn, green beans, peppers and other crops. The state grows about half of the nation's winter vegetables.
[Gov. Lawton Chiles asked President Clinton on Saturday to designate the counties hardest hit by Gordon as disaster areas, the Associated Press reported. Damage estimates were still coming in, so the Governor did not specify which counties needed the declaration.]
Although this storm was worse for vegetable growers, it was nothing compared with Hurricane Andrew's destruction for the community as a whole, or even for all farmers. Dade County's tropical fruit farmers lost practically nothing in this storm, but were out about $300 million when Hurricane Andrew blew through, Mr. Kirby said.
As the flood waters recede and farmers start to plow under their ruined crops, the economics of what happens next are simple, Mr. Kirby said, "Of course people are going to lose jobs," he said. "There are going to be a lot less crops to harvest."
As Mr. Alger stood outside his packing houses, a Mexican farm worker walked up with her two children, looking for work. He apologized and told her the harvest would not begin until February or March.
Consumers will feel the effects of the storm at the market. Patty Sheehan, the market news administrator for the Florida Department of Agriculture in Orlando, said that already the wholesale price of Florida cucumbers has tripled and green beans have nearly doubled.
Even with high prices, the farmers' heartache is rarely felt by those who eat their produce every day, Ms. Sheehan said. "People expect that when they go to the store their food will always be there, but when something like this happens you realize that their food depends on acts of nature, that farmers are out there dealing with the elements."
Mr. Alger's next step is to make a run up to Belle Glade, about two hours north, to buy new, fast-growing seed. "We're going to go right back and plant," he said. "We'll be working Thanksgiving Day. That's the son of a gun about farming. You're dealing with perishable products, and they don't know if it's Christmas or Thanksgiving."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Deep-Pocket Braves Set a Budget

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Atlanta Braves have nine players signed for the 1995 season (what 1995 season, you ask?) at a total of $30 million. That's more than 11 teams spent, or would have spent without the strike, on their entire payrolls this year, but the Braves don't plan to break Ted Turner's bank.
"Actually, we have our own internal budget, which has been the admonition of agents and players, especially in the last three months," John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said. "We've taken their words to heart. They all said you don't need any kind of cap; all you have to do is set up a budget. So we're going to do that." 
 Schuerholz declined to say what the Braves' budget is, but it will result in a lower payroll than this year's $43 million, which was second only to the Yankees' $47 million.
Six of the nine players the Braves have signed for next season will earn from $3,733,333 to $5.5 million. The roster includes Greg Maddux, David Justice, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Fred McGriff and Roberto Kelly.
The Braves, though, haven't committed the most money for 1995. They are, in fact, fourth in the current salary standing behind Toronto ($34.8 for 7 players), Detroit ($31.7 for 7 players) and the Yankees ($31.4 million for 11 players).
The Blue Jays' lineup of dollar signs is particularly impressive: Joe Carter, $7.5 million; John Olerud, $5.75 million; Roberto Alomar, $5.5 million; Duane Ward, $4.75 million; Paul Molitor, $4.5 million; Devon White, $4 million, and Juan Guzman, $2.8 million.
 
General Managers on a Budget
 In holding their annual meetings at the opulent Phoenician last week, the general managers were not practicing fiscal responsibility in these trying economic times for major league baseball. But several members of the group went slightly out of their way to do just that.
Bob Quinn and Brian Sabean of San Francisco stayed at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort, where the Giants stay in spring training and get a rate of $85 a night. Kevin Malone and Bill Stoneman of the Montreal Expos stayed at the Marriott Suites in Scottsdale for $75 a night each.
"You know the Montreal Expos," Malone said. "We're cost effective. We were here for eight nights and saved $110 a night each. We might be able to sign a six-year minor league free agent with what we saved. He could help us win a pennant."
 
Hot-Stove Trade Talks
 The hottest trade prospect to emerge from the general managers' meetings involved the high-spending Braves and the economy-minded Expos. The trade would send center fielder Marquis Grissom to Atlanta for Ryan Klesko, a platooned left fielder, who is younger and considerably less expensive.
Grissom, who batted .288 and was third in the National League with 36 stolen bases, earned $3.56 million last season. Whatever the Braves' budget is, Grissom and his new salary would be able to fit into it far more easily than he would in the Expos' economic lineup.
Klesko, who as a rookie hit one home run every 14.4 at-bats, and 17 in 245, will have the kind of salary the Expos like -- low.
The hangup in a possible exchange would be Grissom's status. If the clubs, either unilaterally or in an agreement with the union, create a younger class of free agents, players with four or five years of major league service, Grissom would be eligible. The Braves could trade for him and sign him to a multiyear contract, but Grissom, who lives in the Atlanta area, would be in better bargaining position if he waited to find out if he could become a free agent.
 
Canseco's Name Batted About
 The most intriguing trade suggestion that surfaced during the week was the idea that Texas, Houston and Boston would engineer a three-way transaction involving Jose Canseco. Kevin Kennedy, the Red Sox manager, had Canseco in Texas and is said to want him to move to Boston with him.
The Rangers need starting pitching, which the Astros could provide, perhaps along with center fielder Steve Finley, for Canseco. Canseco would then be shipped to Boston for a package of players. The only problem is there seems to be more talk outside the lines of a possible deal than within them.
At the close of business Friday, Bob Watson of the Astros and Doug Melvin of the Rangers had not spoken since Wednesday.
 
Housecleaning in Houston
 To hear some people talk, the Astros are prepared to jettison all sorts of players -- pitchers Greg Swindell and Pete Harnisch, third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Steve Finley being among the most prominent and highest paid. Not true, the general manager says.
"I have been charged with being competitive at a price that has us break even or make a small profit," Bob Watson said. "Do all that and sign Jeff Bagwell. So I have my work cut out for me."
Bagwell is the National League most valuable player who is not going anywhere unless the labor dispute is settled, he receives service credit for the 52 days of the strike and four-year players become eligible for free agency. Second baseman Craig Biggio and two young outfielders, James Mouton and Brian Hunter, are not escaping Houston either.
"I wouldn't trade any of them," Watson said. He will trade other players, he added, but not on a wholesale basis.
"We will attempt to move some people," he said. "It won't be as severe as some people think. Yes, Mr. McLane lost money. Yes, we didn't meet our projection in attendance. But whatever we do, we will be competitive."
Drayton McLane Jr., the owner of the team the past two years, has said he has suffered large losses since his acquisition of the team from John McMullen. People in Houston, who never appreciated McMullen for saving the team for the city when he bought the Astros in 1979, said for the last few years of his ownership that once he sold the team, attendance would skyrocket.
McLane, however, hasn't seen fireworks at the box office.
 
Yanks' No-Return Policy
 The most telling aspect of the recent development with tickets to baseball games in New York wasn't that the Yankees raised the price of 4,300 choice box seats by $8 while the Mets maintained their prices at 1992 levels. It was the difference in their policies, as well as attitudes, on deadline for payment.
The Yankees require payment in full for season tickets by Dec. 12. In previous years, the Mets have asked for complete payment by the end of the year. But this winter the Mets have told their fans they need send only a 50 percent deposit by that time, then complete their payments by Feb. 15.
Furthermore, if the labor dispute is not resolved by the end of March, Mets fans may ask for their money back. The Yankees have made no such offer.

HEADLINE: Nov. 13-19: A Nuclear-Free Ukraine;
Moves in the Ukraine Bring Elation to U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
What a difference four months makes. When Leonid Kuchma, former director of a missile factory, was elected Ukraine's President in July, the Clinton Administration feared that he would be another neo-Communist hack who would do little about the problems Washington was worrying about: Ukraine's 1,800 nuclear warheads and its collapsing economy. But when Mr. Kuchma visits Washington on Tuesday, he will have done virtually everything President Clinton has asked.
 Last Wednesday, thanks to vigorous arm-twisting by Mr. Kuchma, the Parliament in Kiev voted to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear arms, putting aside the belief that such weapons could make Ukraine a power to reckon with. The Clinton Administration hailed the vote because it removed roadblocks from two major strategic arms-reductions treaties that had been stalled. 
 Mr. Kuchma has also pushed through some painful reforms aimed at curing Ukraine's economic ills, including staggering inflation. STEVEN GREENHOUSE

HEADLINE: Clear but Hypocritical

 BODY:
Overlook, for just a moment, the brutality of their ideas. Representative Newt Gingrich and his band of ideologues have enlivened U.S. politics -- indeed, engaging the public in political discourse that is supposed to be at the core of democratic society. They ran on a platform that told Americans how they would transform society by, in part, ripping away every strand of the social safety net.
With government out of the way, they said, civil society would bloom. The Democrats -- led, in the final weeks of the campaign, by President Clinton -- held the contract up to voters for ridicule. The voters decisively picked sides. 
 One thing that makes this year's election remarkable is its aftermath. Mr. Gingrich and his deputy, Dick Armey of Texas, have continued to say what they believe and do what they said they would without excuses or temporizing. In comparison to the Democrats, their press conferences have been clear, if nothing else. When was the last time Speaker Tom Foley or the majority leader, Richard Gephardt, or the President gave voters a legislative vision undiluted by irreconcilable promises, one for each constituent?
Unfortunately, the contract about which Mr. Gingrich is so clear is full of benighted and mean-spirited ideas. The anti-government theme borders on the fetishistic. The tax cuts are reckless. The spending cuts are oblivious to need. Presumably the voters knew this before they voted and will now get some of what they chose, for better or worse.
That much cannot be said about 1992. President Clinton ran on one set of -- we now know -- lightly embraced ideas, packaged as New Democratic. They were then blended into mush with the help of Mr. Foley and Mr. Gephardt. In that sense, voters do not deserve the President they have.
Yet no commentary about the current scene can leave Mr. Gingrich draped in praise. Eventually, one must pierce the vigorous presentation and get at the ideas themselves. Here, the Republicans turn as hypocritical as the Democrats they thrust aside.
Take, for example, the proposal to cut taxes on capital gains -- the profit that investors earn on the sale of, for example, bonds, stocks and real estate. The stated purpose is to give entrepreneurs greater incentive to invest. Stated that way, even some liberals might be tempted to embrace the idea.
But look closely. The contract would cut taxes on the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate that investors already own. That could not possibly spur future investment. The proposal amounts to a huge windfall for affluent investors, but does little to ignite the "animal spirits" of entrepreneurs.
Republicans defend their plan by claiming it will "unlock" investors from old investments, channeling money into new, spiffier projects. This too makes little sense. If Joe decides, in the face of lower taxes, to sell his General Motors stock to Mary, the paper shuffling puts no money into the coffers of General Motors for investment in plant and equipment.
The Republicans could have solved the problem by limiting their tax cut to new investments. They did not -- suggesting they are more interested in rewarding rich constituents than in spurring the economy. At least when Democrats go overboard in redistributing money, they more often do so on behalf of the needy instead of the already rewarded.
The contract also proposes boosting the nation's pathetic saving rate by opening up tax-subsidized retirement accounts to upper-income families. This too could be tolerated by voters interested in fairness if the actual proposal was not so skewed. It would allow wealthy workers to close down existing retirement accounts, pay taxes on the withdrawal and open up a new retirement account on which no taxes would be owed when cashed in at retirement.
This sneaky design would generate extra revenue in the next few years -- when the budget laws require Congress to pay attention -- and rob the Treasury of huge amounts later on when workers retire. For a party that preaches balanced budgets and fiscal prudence, the proposal borders on deceit. The contract also promises to balance the Federal budget -- a $700 billion deficit reduction that Republicans nonsensically declare would be zero.
On examination, the contract is at once bold and disheartening. The Republicans told voters they would cut government off at the knees and on this score they seem true to their word. Apparently it was too much to ask that they also live by their other declarations in favor of fiscal prudence and honest numbers.

HEADLINE: In America;
No G.O.P. Imitations, Please

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Representative Charles Schumer put it best: The Democrats created a vacuum and the Republicans filled it.
 Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said last week: "Any Democrat who wants to revitalize the party has to start from the basic premise that while there were lots of other factors, the Democratic Party was ultimately to blame for the election fiasco. Yes, the Republicans were nasty. Yes, right-wing talk radio emphasized the negative. But those kinds of things can only succeed when there's a vacuum, and we created the vacuum." 
 The vacuum formed when Democratic politicians, for whatever reasons, became estranged from their base. That base, for decades, has been made up primarily of ordinary working men and women -- decent people struggling to pay the rent or the mortgage, to raise their families in a reasonably safe and comfortable environment, to get their sons and daughters through school.
 In Mr. Schumer's words, "We lost sight of the average American."
 This suddenly seems obvious to almost everyone. But there are right ways and wrong ways to reclaim the hearts of working men and women. And one of the wrong ways is to define the so-called average American too narrowly.
 Nearly every post-election analysis points out that 62 percent of white males voted Republican. There is general agreement that the Democratic Party has to get a substantial number of those voters back. With that in mind, groups like the Democratic Leadership Council are aggressively urging Democrats (and especially President Clinton) to lurch to the right.
 This is good advice for those Democrats who survived the Nov. 8 debacle but still would like to commit suicide. Whether the Democrats know it or not, voters are not clamoring for imitation Republicans. They can have the real thing. It should be recalled that the D.L.C., with its cynical cadre of high-tech pollsters and analysts, gave us Mr. Clinton in the first place, along with his carefully crafted, wishy-washy, please-all-people, stand-for-nothing message. The result is that it no longer matters which way Mr. Clinton lurches. He has lurched too much already, which is how he has achieved the almost impossible feat of being perceived simultaneously as a stealth liberal and a closet conservative.
 (Elizabeth Drew, in her book "On the Edge," tells how Mr. Clinton announced his variation of a Bush Administration program for urban enterprise zones. Clinton aides were worried that a high-profile event would look too "inner city," so the President announced the program in a telephone conference call with mayors.)
 Instead of sneaking to the left or the right, instead of being ashamed of groups that have supported the party for decades, the Democrats could use a dose of authenticity. They need to discover an honest way to attract votes from white men while at the same time getting the support of working people who are African-American, who are women, who are Latino and Asian, who belong to labor unions, who are Jewish, etc.
 This is not some wild, impossible task.
 "We have to build bridges," said Mr. Schumer. "There are some issues, like crime and jobs, where you can go into a middle-class white suburb and to an inner city, and when you talk to the average person in those places they will tell you the exact same thing.
 "If you notice, in Newt's 'contract' there is not one mention of jobs. That's the number one thing that the 62 percent of white male voters are concerned about."
 Mr. Schumer paused. "You know," he said, "I think that ultimately people are upset because for the first time in American history it is not a given that their lives will improve, that the trend is upward, that in 10 years you'll be better off, and that almost certainly your children will be better off than you have been.
 "What they want is to see government as a force relevant to their lives, making their lives better. They'd like to see that, but they don't. We have to change that."
 To forge a comeback, the Democrats have to do something real about issues like employment and crime, issues that everyone cares about. If they can do that, the voters will come flocking from the right and the left.
 If not, they will endure a long stay in the lonely regions of powerlessness and irrelevance.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NORTHWEST BRONX;
Intricacies of Redistricting: Draw, and Then Draw Again

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
From Morris Heights up to Riverdale, School District 10 spans a diverse racial and socioeconomic territory, from its poor southern neighborhoods to its richer northern ones.
A plan to redraw the district -- one of the city's largest in geography and student population -- along north-south lines was scrapped amid an outpouring of criticism that it was tantamount to racial segregation. But a revised plan to split the district in western and eastern sections, while not eliciting the same level of opposition, has left many doubting it, too, underscoring the intricacies of redistricting in a racially and economically mixed area. 
 District 10's turmoils reveal how a plan to increase minority representation on school boards, no matter how well-intentioned, can go awry among the very people it is intended to benefit. Recently, black residents in District 22 in Brooklyn joined with whites to fight off a proposal that would have guaranteed black representation in one district by creating two virtually segregated districts. In a system where people suspect that resources are meted out according to political strength, it is perhaps not surprising that minority parents would recoil from boundaries that would cut them off from better-organized white parents.
The District 10 plan is one of several recommended by a panel that was appointed by the Board of Education to redraw districts for the first time in more than two decades. The plan is designed, among other things, to help the city comply with the Federal Voting Rights Act.
The central Board of Education is to hold a series of public hearings next month before making final decisions in February on proposed changes to 10 of the 32 districts.
In District 10, whites account for only 8 percent of the student population, but six members of the nine-person school board are white.
Under the original plan, new boundaries would have created a southern district with mostly black and Hispanic voters, who presumably would have elected minority representatives on a new board. But critics on all sides said the proposal would have left only minority students in the southern half, where low-performing schools with high numbers of poor students would be concentrated. They feared that the southern district, bereft of the richer northern half, would become politically powerless. What's more, in the northern half, the school board would be predominantly white, but the student population would remain predominantly minority.
"The plan went overboard by segregating the school boards," said Jeffrey R. Korman, a member of the District 10 board.
The panel responded by drawing a new plan that cut the district roughly along the Grand Concourse. It said that while the east-west division would not offer the same benefits to minority voters as the first proposal, these new districts would more closely reflect the current district's racial makeup and avoid lumping poorly performing schools in one district.
Some said the new plan might actually be a political setback for black and Hispanic residents.
Carlos R. Cortes, a member of Board 10, said the western section, with the heavy voting population in Riverdale, would elect a predominantly white school board. Furthermore, the eastern section would also lean toward a white school board because its northern, white neighborhoods typically turn out in big numbers. Because a vertical redrawing would divide, and dilute, the minority voting population in the southern neighborhoods, Mr. Cortes said he favored keeping District 10 intact. He said that in recent years, minorities had become more active, electing three representatives to the school board, and that any changes would disrupt the momentum.
"Dividing our district in any form, it's not going to increase minority representation," Mr. Cortes said. "It's going to be back to the good old days when the white population controlled the majority of the student population." NORIMITSU ONISHI

HEADLINE: Shop BIG

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
THIS was the year the big stores took New York, the year those cavernous, low-margin, high-volume temptoriums that challenge both the old-time department store and the friendly neighborhood bookseller arrived, in critical mass, and began to remake the face of shopping as we know it.
From the Flatiron to upper Broadway, Northern Boulevard to the Grand Concourse, these stores that till now had largely shunned the city as too cramped, too expensive, and perhaps too determined to be hip, are moving in, opening up and proclaiming themselves proud to be big. 
 In the popular mind -- and with at least a little encouragement from the marketing folks -- they are "megastores," "superstores"; the new Toys "R" Us opening on Union Square proclaims itself "the world's biggest toy store." Actually, though, they are several different things. Some sell all manner of one thing -- books, housewares, clothing; others are essentially department stores. Some aren't really even that big.
What they all are, in retail argot, is "value retailers," usually part of national or regional chains that offer lots of stuff at low, low prices. They provide maps and grocery-style shopping carts and basically try to get you to buy as much as possible under one roof. Their roof. And though a lot of New Yorkers, and especially Manhattanites, still cling to a way of shopping that is vaguely European and highly inefficient, stopping at one place for this, another for that, the big stores are clearly winning some converts.
"The traditional form of retailing is being changed throughout the United States, and we were the last bastion," acknowledged Walter F. Loeb, who publishes the monthly newsletter Loeb Retail Letter. "Consumers today are value-driven. They will spend more in these value stores."
As they do, city planners, concerned that New York is still losing too many retail dollars to the suburbs, are studying proposed zoning changes that would make the city more hospitable to some big stores. Which has small-business owners and others arguing that changing the way New Yorkers shop amounts to irreparably changing the city's character, too.
Which has me -- confined to the city and conformed to its habits for most of my adult life -- feeling curious and confused. Fortunately, the early start of the holiday season (Hannukah begins next Sunday night, then onward to Christmas), gives me an opportunity to do some shopping and, I hope, clear my head. So I fill a coat pocket with subway tokens and hit the pavement.
 
DAY 1: SAMPLING
 My first stop is Today's Man, one of two, soon to be three, Manhattan outlets offering designer (and designerlike) menswear at discount prices. This one, opened in September, is spread over three floors of what used to be Conran's, at 81st and Broadway, just across from that New York megastore of gastronomy, Zabar's. I begin at the top, with the traditional look. Here a blue blazer from Brookcraft, the store's brand, costs $79, while the same style from Halston costs $149, or two for $259.
And thus, fresh out of the starting blocks, I begin to understand the marketing psychology of megastore shopping: nurturing the continual urge to buy more, supposedly for bigger savings. I'm not sure if I've caught it yet, but I've never seen so many empty suits in my life.
Onward. The sales staff couldn't be nicer. Of course, I am one of only two shoppers in this part of the store on a Wednesday morning. (The other one is a man who is trying coats on by himself and mumbling.) They're going to strike out with me, though; I've just discovered I lack the confidence to buy menswear off the rack, even, or especially, for people I am related to.
On my way out, the pull of tradition, and a whiff of the most amazing aroma, leads me two doors down to the Broadway Nut Shop, in business at 2246 Broadway for the last 54 years and tended by Howie Gold and Larry Ring. Attract his attention, and Mr. Gold will take you on a guided tour of the shop, which, along with nuts, specializes in licorice. There are tins of pure Liquirizia di Calabria ($3.90 for four grams) and Dutch licorice kittens, German licorice spun in wheels, English pink, yellow and black licorice allsorts, even licorice toffee, a seeming contradiction in terms. For the holidays, there are marzipan Hanukkah shapes (a menorah, a Torah) for $2.75, and bags of gold-covered chocolate coins (80 cents).
Just down Broadway, at 79th Street, is Filene's Basement, part of a chain that all began in Boston. As an experiment, I stop first at Charivari, around the corner at 79th and Amsterdam, and buy a woolen vest for $75. Then I enter Filene's and wait for the chagrin to hit.
It never does. I am surrounded by white blazers, patterned sweaters with patterns busier than the IRT at rush hour, giant wool mufflers and stockings with unfamiliar labels. This is on the first floor. Upstairs is the men's department, where I see a lot of dress shirts and work boots, as well as cashmere sweaters for $99. But all around me is evidence of disarray, like jackets left in heaps on the floor by shoppers apparently unmoved by the instruments of corporate thought control. "It's Not What You Spend, It's What You Save," clamors one sign, near the shirts. "Don't Even Hesitate," urges another.
I'm hesitating. But I owe it to myself to check out the dress-up clothes. I have the eerie feeling of being in another city, another time. There is a beige Albert Nipon suit, shades of Nancy Reagan, circa 1981. Examining a black, beaded Theo Miles evening dress, a trio of women murmur "C'est jolie," only to realize that there is a gaping hole in the middle of the gauzy top. I've decided to cut and run. But then I see someone I know, with hangers over her arm. She says she browses here all the time.
"You would come and hope to find a needle in a haystack," explains my friend, more the passionate bargain-hunter than I will ever be. I dash home so the baby sitter can leave.
 
DAY 2: GETTING PSYCHED
 I wake up with only slightly sore ligaments and hit the pavement. Today's destination is Chelsea, which seems to be ground zero for the city's new Brobdingnagian stores.
First is Staples, opened last year at 23d Street and the Avenue of the Americas. It has everything you might expect from a discount place, like harsh lighting and giant shopping carts standing by. But as my cart and I wheel down the first aisle, I fall in love: This place has everything we never have at home. There are bundles of legal note pads, $5.49 for a dozen. There is a package of Scotch tape, four rolls and dispensers for $3.99. Clasp envelopes. Bulletin boards! Pencil sharpeners!
There are also computers and computer accessories, software, fax machines, desk chairs and assorted other office essentials, including a jumbo pack of nondairy creamer (36 ounces for $4.59).
"It's confusing sometimes," says Debbie Murray, a secretary for a nearby construction company. "Sometimes the employees don't know what they have or where things are. Sometimes they're not the greatest prices, either." But still, there she was that morning, looking for a briefcase. "A lot of the smaller stores in the area are much more expensive," she conceded.
Thus reassured, I buy some Scotch tape, thinking that if I ever buy any presents, I'll be prepared to wrap them, too.
A block south, at 675 Avenue of the Americas, is the newest of the brood of Barnes & Noble superstores, a 35,000-square-foot urban mall-as-gathering place -- books, the now-obligatory cafe, even a theater, superimposed on the columned and atriumed cast-iron glory of the old Adams Dry Goods Store building.
This may be a superstore, and I may be just blocks from one of New York's surviving old-style bookstore rows, 18th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, but all the neighborhood types curled up in Barnes & Noble's soft chairs make for a sure sense of community. I see a famous children's-book writer scribbling in her journal in the cafe. I glimpse a colleague, going to see the puppets. I run into another friend, who tells me that when she was locked out of her apartment for a day recently, she came here, rather than pester the landlord. "They had a nice bathroom, I could get something to eat, I could read," she said.
I decide to take a break and do just that, especially since this is my chance for a guilt-free dip into "A Greater Love," Christopher Wilson's tattle on Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. Unmolested -- and, I hope, unseen by anyone who knows me -- I read the entire transcript of the couple's notorious telephone conversations.
Eventually I give it up and walk three blocks south on Avenue of the Americas to Bed, Bath & Beyond, an indoor bazaar of household products that opened in November 1992, and recently grew from 50,000 to 82,000 square feet.
At the door, they hand me a map, which is my first clue that this is going to be a very big shopping experience. A surreal strawberry smell hangs in the air, which I eventually trace to the candle department. Shoppers wander the wide main aisles, then disappear into the side pockets in search of something. Among them are people from the neighborhood, like Claire Baksa, who was wheeling her daughter through the children's section.
"I don't really like big stores," she said. "They're intimidating. This wall-to-wall stuff is too much for me. But I live around here, so I just put up with it. This is kind of a big-store area."
There are lots of useful-looking household items, like ergonomically designed vegetable peelers (I get two, for $8.99 apiece) and some you might be able to live without. How about a toilet-brush holder, shaped like a big cat? $19.99. Queen-sized water-bed sheets, $39.99? Aquis, the super-absorbent hair towel, for $15.99, may be just the thing for that one relative who never speaks to us. I see a Great Wall of toaster ovens, a tower of Brita water filters. There are Joyce Chen wok sets, men's flannel pajamas printed with cowboy boots, crushed-velvet covered boxes, a bath mat shaped like a holly leaf. Shoppers appear to be evenly divided between those seeking just one or two things, who seem stunned, and people, usually the very young, who are trying to furnish new apartments and seem thrilled.
I've seen something we need at our house: plastic dishes featuring characters from "The Lion King." I put two in my shopping cart, thinking that, at $19.99, they're not exactly cheap. Then I head uptown.
Software is a good 90's kind of present, and I've been seeing it here and there in my travels. But the biggest assortment is at Comp USA, a 26,000-square-foot computer store that extends along Fifth Avenue from 37th to 38th Streets. People were clustered around a demonstration of "Under a Killing Moon," a CD-ROM featuring a hapless detective named Tex Murphy. It sells for $54.99. There is also "Doom II" for $38.97 and Tie Fighter ($39.99), about intergalactic pirate wars but nevertheless, in the season of peace, "a perfect gift for the youngster," the sign says.
And there is software for grown-ups: "Wedding Workshop" ($36.99), which offers to "prioritize the guest list" and track gifts and expenses; and my personal favorite, "Scrabble," which makes the computer figure out every possible word that can be formed from up to eight letters and must be the ultimate in cheating, if you plan to play with other people who didn't bring their Macintoshes to the summer house.
Next door to Comp USA is Lord & Taylor, and I dash inside to bask in the glow of a thousand little lights and extraneous decorations. And I see Lion King dishes selling for $24. I go home feeling smug.
 
DAY 3: STUFF, AND A VIEW
 Bradlees opened just two weeks ago -- 140,000 square feet on six floors in the old F. W. Mays building, which had been vacant since 1988. Along with assorted merchandise, it offers beautiful views, particularly from the escalators, of Union Square.
This is still clearly a work in progress. The ceiling features exposed I-beams, there's a loud hammering coming from the back, and the cashiers seem less than clued in to store procedures, like correcting an overcharge.
Bradlees sells some of everything, but I am happiest on 5, where they have a lot of plastic sleds. Last winter, I pounced on what turned out to be the last sled in New York, right around New Year's Day. I also paid $20 for it, and here, the same sled -- a year of inflation later and with the Farmer's Almanac forecasting snow -- is $14.99. Other meaningful toys, most on the third floor, include a game called "Splat! The Bug Squishin' Race Game," which costs $17.99 and sounds like something you could play right in your own home, probably in the kitchen, late at night. They also have the Fisher-Price Tough Trike, the vehicle of choice in city playgrounds, for $24.99.
I am about to get out in one piece when I stop by the video department and see "Snow White," for $19.88. After buying it, I begin to feel that I am enjoying this too much. I run to the nearest Japanese restaurant, where I wind up spending whatever I saved, and then some, at the sushi bar.
 
DAY 4: BURBLIKE
 Time is marching on, and so am I -- to Ozone Park, Queens, and the Home Depot that opened late last year.
Most people seem to come here by car, and that's a good thing. I take the A train from Manhattan, more than an hour into Queens, and disembark at Rockaway Boulevard. Then I take a 15-minute bus ride along the boulevard to the store.
But the reward is vastness, a la jumbo-jet hangar, full of amazing stuff I didn't know you could buy or would want, like giant rolls of scratchy black roofing paper; pieces of newel posts and balustrades; wind turbines, shaped like Ottoman Empire headgear, and the mystery material on the I-beams at Bradlees: Popcorn Ceiling Roll-on, priced at $19.35 for a 4.5-gallon drum. There is the whine of band saws, the beeping of a forklift that roams the sales floor, the whisper of money changing hands.
This is do-it-yourself country, and the principle applies, apparently, to shopping methodology as well. All around the store are half-opened cartons, apparently clawed at by curious shoppers. I see a man proudly pushing a cart loaded with sacks of quick-setting concrete, and wonder who he's buying for. I watch a woman in an elegant coat, holding a purse in one hand and tugging energetically at a 14-foot length of base molding tucked into a rack with the other. (She prevails, but then shouts, "This one is crooked!") The only thing they won't let you do yourself, as far as I can tell, is use the saw.
I am totally stumped for gift ideas, since I'm not shopping for my super, until I discover, in a side aisle, little tiny brooms with red handles. The price is right ($3.92). I place two in my cart which, in my absence, has been hit by something (maybe the forklift?), spilling tea all over my newspaper.
My next stop is Long Island City, but before I leave I go across the street for a quick fix of Queens' ethnic diversity at the Oscar Foods West Indian Grocery, at 111-03 Rockaway Boulevard, which actually sells a lot of East Indian products, like embroidered shalwars, traditional long tunics worn over slacks, gold-tone filigree jewelry and cassettes featuring stars like Anil Kapoor.
Tops Appliance City has long drawn city dwellers to the suburbs (Westchester, New Jersey) for appliance supermarketing. In September, it opened its first New York City store on Northern Boulevard; it's 45,000 square feet, all on one floor, and speaking of feet, mine are getting sore. But I press on and in, following a woman who has told me, since the subway, that she was furious because a TV she bought a month ago had not been delivered. She disappears, and I am left looking at the vacuum cleaners, which are close to the door. Most impressive here is the din: broadcast Muzak competes with rap surging from portable stereos and tentative notes played by people trying out electronic pianos, and bass vibrations thundering from the car-stereo demonstration room. And of course, the television corner is pretty noisy, too, with its 100 or so screens all tuned to the same Costa Rican soccer match. I check out the price of a television as big as the Ritz: $2,499.99. But there is free delivery from this store, whose parent company is publicly traded on the Nasdaq exchange, according to a sign by the entrance.
I skulk toward the exit without buying anything, but I've been spotted. "Oh!" cries a sales manager. "Are you leaving our store?" Yes. Before I have to crawl.
 
DAY 5: TOYS 'R' ESSENTIAL
 I wake up, groggy and upset from dreaming about an appliance delivery that never happens. Also, my feet are in total pain. I consider completing this mission on skates, but can't find my wrist guards. A broken arm, together with my broken feet, I decide, would be very depressing.
So I take the N train to DeKalb Avenue and a Toys "R" Us that opened a year ago to the tune of 42,000 square feet. Cart at the ready, I find two happy shoppers, Ginger Matera of Bushwick and Mayra Rodriguez of Red Hook, who are doing their Christmas rounds weeks ahead of time. "Kids ask for expensive things, and if you buy them everything they want you'll be eating macaroni and cheese for a month," Ms. Matera says. Her two boys, she says, want Game Boy hand-held electronic game sets this year, and the store has them for $49.99 with its coupon, versus $89 elsewhere.
Does she ever feel lost and suburbanized when shopping in a store this size? "No," Ms. Matera says emphatically. "Brooklyn is Brooklyn."
And in Brooklyn, the Tough Trike is $19.99, $5 less than Bradlees was charging. A Radio Flyer red wagon is $44.99. A red stocking that could contain a 2-year-old is $6.49. Three rolls of Hanukkah paper are $3.99. Pinatas, shaped like clowns or lions or unicorns, are $6.99. The most far-fetched toy, a Toys "R" Us-emblazoned 1918 runabout car bank, is $7.48. Something I want, which could be unique to this store: slippers with duck, elephant and frog faces on them, that emit pertinent animal sounds when pressed. The elephant has a particularly authentic-sounding shriek; all are $7.99.
I buy two pairs of the animal slippers, a pair of pinking scissors, a set of paintbrushes and a box of watercolors, spending a total of $27.01, and leave the store right behind a woman who is bellowing "Shut up!" at her crying child.
I take the D train to the Bronx and the biggest, by far, of all the big new stores: the 317,412-square-foot Caldor at 2501 Grand Concourse. Like a hermit crab, Caldor moved last year into the empty shell of what was for years an Alexander's. And either because of the Spanish-speakers in the neighborhood, or some overarching corporate vision, the store's sign sports a big acute accent aigu over the "d." The store dwarfs neighbors like Tiger Kim's, which sells mostly sneakers but also nostalgia in the form of Mets hats ($9.99).
At Caldor, I've decided to make a beeline for pet supplies, in the basement. I've been searching for a rubber newspaper toy for a friend's puppy, and sure enough, I find "The Daily Growl," in a choice of colors, for $1.99. Corny antler sets, to be tied onto the head of your dog or cat, are 25 cents, on clearance.
Some children are running through the toy section, laughing and setting off all the computerized singing "Christmas Bop-a-Tune" animals. Up on the second floor, in toddler clothes, I see two cashiers having an argument; one pretends to high-kick the other in the back. The escalator between here and the third floor is broken, so I walk up to housewares, which I skip, and then to 4, where there are snow shovels ($3.99 to $19.99) and a Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Battle Wheeler 4x4 that costs $159.99. With a top speed of three miles per hour, it might be just the thing to get me through this shopping expedition.
It all ends, finally, after I track down a plastic Santa Claus lawn ornament that, for $39.99, kind of sums up my odyssey: He's suburban-looking, he's hollow, he's rubbing his stomach (not his feet) and his face puffs with glee.
 
New Rules for Big Stores?
 Current city zoning laws, amended in 1974 in the spirit of shielding industry from encroaching retail businesses, restrict large stores on the basis of what they sell, says Barry Dinerstein, a senior planner with the Department of City Planning.
Large stores are permitted in most of the city's manufacturing zones as long as they do not sell clothing, furniture, carpets, electronics or variety goods. Owners of those types of stores must apply for a special permit, as must people planning to build department stores and supermarkets.
But under changes being studied by the Giuliani administration, designed to draw more big stores to the city, stores would be restricted by square footage, not by content. "The hope is to make it big enough to allow the discount department stores to locate here," Mr. Dinerstein said, "but we don't want regional malls."
The review process for the proposal, which is bitterly opposed by many small-business owners, is expected to take about 18 months.

Help for the Transportationally Challenged

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
STEPPING out of my building the other day I came this close to being run down by a man delivering food on a bicycle. I never saw him until he brushed past, and I don't think he ever saw me. He was too busy cackling and gesticulating at another food deliveryman in the street. They were racing.
I didn't scream this time and give chase. I simply visited Charles Komanoff, my transportation therapist. He sighed. "This is one group of bicycle riders I have not been able to reach. Part of the problem is that many of them don't speak English. And when I go to their stores and restaurants, suddenly their managers don't speak English, either." 
 "I guess you are also going to tell me," I said, "that they are on sidewalks because the streets are gridlocked with the real villains, cars and trucks."
"I think you are letting them off the hook too easily," he said, smoothly. "We figure that 20 percent of food deliverers ride on the sidewalk; many of the rest ride against traffic and through red lights. Sure, it's faster for them, they've got hot food and they can get more runs in, but there's no excuse."
I relaxed, always a mistake, and Mr. Komanoff moved in quickly, as if he was threading among stalled cars. "We also figure that less than 2 percent of bike messengers ride on the sidewalk, and hardly any commuters. These two groups have joined together. Wouldn't you rather have more bikes in the city than cars and delivery vans? We think there is something public-spirited about riding a bike. Plucky. We are not complicitous in the car culture."
Catching my gorge on the rise, I said: "You guys have a certain arrogance, a self-righteousness. You want to ride a bike, fine, go ride a bike. But a lot of people can't or don't want to ride. Understand that the car is a room of your own, one of the few places anymore you can be by yourself, listen to your own music, smoke, whatever."
Mr. Komanoff listened and nodded. We were sitting in his office at Komanoff Energy Associates, on Lafayette Street, among flickering computer screens, drawing boards, piles of stats concerned with the state of a world consumed by its consumption. A Harvard-trained economist, the 47-year-old Mr. Komanoff has long been one of the clearest consultants, consumer advocates, media sources and expert witnesses on nuclear energy problems. Balding, bearded and bespectacled, he looks almost as smart as he is. But not nearly as slippery.
"A lot of what you say is right," said Mr. Komanoff. "I would like to be relieved of my anger and my hubris. I would like to feel no more socially valuable than anyone else. Because I am no better."
Now you understand why I go to Charlie Komanoff when I feel bike-battered. He himself began riding seriously only about 20 years ago, and now has that compact, non-Vertical Club hard body that comes from physical exercise for a functional purpose. Along the way, he became involved in the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, and a spokesman for spokes.
"Through the 70's, we were riding the zeitgeist," he said. "Mayor Lindsay closing the park on weekends, a new energy policy, the oil embargo, a transit strike. But in the Reagan 80's, the stretch limo replaced the bike as symbol, and there was fear and loathing of the messenger. I felt that way, too, for awhile. And then they took to the streets against the 1987 midtown bike ban. They had the organization, they had the spirit, they were great."
The zeitgeist seems to be blowing against Mr. Komanoff lately. He is downsizing his consulting business. Saturdays in the city, once a day for easy riding and walking, seem to be choked with more cars than ever, especially downtown. The bike messengers are absorbed by the battle to unionize their dangerous, underpaid, marginalized work. And the voices of old biddies like me are raised against reckless riding when perhaps we should be rethinking the stinking car and making it pay its way.
"I think you're angry at bikers for two reasons," Mr. Komanoff said. "First of all, you actually see a person you can focus anger at. You rarely see the driver of a car or truck clearly. It's harder to be angry at a machine. And second, no argument from me, a lot of these bikes just don't follow the rules. But look at statistics: Last year in the city, 13,811 pedestrians were hit by cars, 289 killed, and 664 pedestrians were hit by bikes, 2 killed. Also, 14 bicyclists were killed in collisions with cars."
And then, Mr. Komanoff spun his numbers into a human face.
A month ago, he and his partner, Judy Levine, a fund-raiser for progressive causes, had a son, Daniel, and moved from Stuyvesant Town to Duane Street, leaving Daniel's grandmother in Peter Cooper Village. A two block walk to visit became an hour on buses.
"Here's a physically fit woman in her 60's who could ride a bike over if there were safe lanes. In a saner city, grandma and grandson could be together more often."
I thanked him for the session, and walked home, temporarily smiling, or at least not scowling, at wheelies. But I kept looking both ways.

HEADLINE: Public Needs, Private Answers -- A special report;
Business Districts Grow, At Price of Accountability

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
More than a decade after New York City business and property owners began creating self-taxing districts to clean, patrol and upgrade their neighborhoods, the districts have spread to virtually every corner of the city, delivering services that once were the sole responsibility of city government.
And though their efforts have generally won broad praise, critics say that some have grown too powerful and have taken over municipal duties without sufficient oversight or public accountability. 
 On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, for instance, residents and elected officials are embroiled in a bitter debate over a plan to set up a vast new district that would employ a private security force of up to 500 officers. Opponents say it would cost too much -- possibly $200 a year for owners of co-ops and commercial properties -- and they worry that the security force would not provide the civil rights safeguards that the city police force does.
Across the country, more than 1,000 business improvement districts, or BID's, as they are known, have been set up in the last two decades, but their greatest impact has been in New York, where their numbers, size and financial clout dwarf those of BID's in other cities. Thirty-three have been established from Harlem to Brighton Beach, and at least 30 more are planned.
With squads of uniformed security officers and sidewalk sweepers, the districts have made vast improvements in many parts of the city -- reducing crime, cleaning up streets and restoring a sense of pride among merchants and the public. Some of their strongest advocates are in City Hall.
"They are filling in for government," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on Tuesday in a Manhattan speech to more than 200 BID members, directors and staff workers. A vigorous advocate of privatizing municipal services, the Mayor has made a series of recent appearances in support of creating more BID's.
But as the districts grow in numbers and power and become a more integral part of city life, they are also facing mounting questions. In many districts business owners complain they have not been given enough of a say in setting policy.
And in a few cases the districts' reach has extended so far into law enforcement and social services that critics question whether they have become de facto governments with limited public accountability.
"We are talking about a whole new subdivision of government that is not accountable to elective officials," said City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, who represents part of the Upper East Side and who opposes the proposed district there.
"If anybody has a complaint about these security people, there sure wouldn't be a Citizen Complaint Review Board," added Mr. Eristoff.
The criticism goes beyond the work of security patrols.
Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said her organization was planning to sue the Grand Central Partnership, the city's largest district, over a program in which the partnership pays homeless people $1.16 an hour to remove other homeless people from automated-teller vestibules.
"They are pitting the poor against the poor," Ms. Brosnahan said.
In a few districts, there have been power struggles that resemble hostile corporate takeovers, and some property owners say they wish their districts had never been formed.
"The city is saying create as many as you want, and we are getting the flavor of the month," said Robert Richards, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce of Jamaica, Queens, where warring factions of property owners have waged a proxy fight for control of a district. The losing faction, claiming that the district's new board has withheld $787,000 it owes to its creditors, has filed suit seeking to force the district into bankruptcy.
"Instead of cooperation, the BID's are attracting greed," Mr. Richards said.
 
Getting Results
The Business Of Improvement
 Across much of New York City, the districts are providing street improvements and services that for decades have fallen through the cracks of city government. This year, New York's 33 districts will collect $32 million from their members for projects that advocates say would be performed less efficiently, and at higher cost, if they were taken on by the city.
Two of them, the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership, have issued $56 million in bonds to rebuild sidewalks, install new street lights and provide other expensive improvements.
"The whole BID phenomenon is a reflection of the public's hunger for high-quality services," said Carl Weisbrod, the former head of the city's Economic Development Corporation. He will become president of a district covering Wall Street and most of lower Manhattan when it is formed in January.
Under a 1981 ordinance, property owners can create a district through a simple majority vote of all owners in a designated area. They must then submit a plan for the kinds of services the district will provide and obtain approval from the City Council.
Once formed, the districts are financed through an offbeat partnership between the owners and the city's Department of Finance. The department collects annual assessments from all property owners and turns the money over to their districts.
Failure to pay is subject to the same penalty as failure to pay taxes -- foreclosure. So far that has not happened.
For property owners the financial structure means paying taxes to the city and assessments to the district -- in many cases for the same sort of services, like police protection and street cleaning. "This is double taxation," said Nancy Brandel, president of Harbor Property Management, which manages two office buildings that will be assessed fees as part of the new Lower Manhattan district.
Still, complaints about the district's taxing powers have been rare. According to the city, Ms. Brandel was one of two people who filed formal objections among the hundreds of property owners in the new district.
The services and improvements the districts have brought run the gamut. On the side streets of midtown Manhattan, the Times Square Business Improvement District last week finished installing 125 high intensity floodlights to improve safety and encourage nighttime pedestrian traffic. Several blocks south, the Fashion Center district plans to hang flags and banners from light poles.
In Queens, the Woodhaven district has special "Bank Day" security patrols on the first day of each month, when retired people deposit their Social Security checks. In Brooklyn, the Brighton Beach district runs advertisements in English- and Russian-language newspapers to promote its shopping area.
Last month, while announcing city approval of the huge new district in lower Manhattan, Mayor Giuliani also announced rules intended to streamline the creation of more. He added that the city would expand a program giving groups of property owners up to $60,000 to help form districts.
"These local democratic institutions are essential to New Yorkers' quality of life," the Mayor said.
But as democratic institutions, the districts are hybrids. Though created by a vote of property owners, they are governed as much by the desire to produce results as by the checks and balances of constitutional law.
Moreover, a recent analysis by the city found that fewer than half the members surveyed had received written announcements of their districts' annual meetings. The study of 24 districts found wide variation in the efforts by BID's to communicate with their members. For example, it said the Times Square district and some others "take pains to update" their membership lists, but that more than 90 percent of member addresses provided by the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation were in error.
"The irony is that the BID's have a splendid record of achievement in improving communities, but their internal processes are so sloppy," said Nicholas Fish, chairman of Community Board 5, which covers seven districts in midtown Manhattan.
Other experts have more fundamental concerns.
"Put a gun to my head and I'll accept BID's," said Peter Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College and senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, a politically conservative research group. "But this is a perverse exchange of responsibility between the public and private domains."
 
Grand Central
Help to Homeless Raises Questions
 Few neighborhoods provide a better example of the power of BID's than the area around Grand Central Terminal.
"If you were the Mayor of Paris, I'd be ashamed to show you this," said Daniel Biederman, who heads three of the city's most prominent districts, Grand Central Partnership, the 34th Street Partnership and the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, at a combined salary of $305,000.
His brief display of outrage, during a walking tour of the Grand Central district, came over what he described as an example of urban tawdriness -- the bright colors and garish signs on a hot dog cart sitting on a sidewalk on 43d Street.
The cart notwithstanding, Mr. Biederman had many improvements to show. There were new street lights, signs, wastebaskets and planters brimming with impatiens. Around the terminal, where hailing a taxi used to mean jostling with traffic and homeless people trying to commandeer luggage, there were two new taxi stands.
Street crime in the area has been sharply reduced, according to the police, in part because of the district's 42-member private security force, which is on patrol from 8 A.M. to 11 P.M. every day. The guards do not carry weapons and must call the police when they see a crime, but property owners say their presence is a powerful deterrent.
The many homeless people who once congregated in and around Grand Central are now absent. That is largely because of a homeless program run by the district, which provides a nearby shelter, job training and temporary housing. But many others have apparently left the area, after BID counselors encouraged them to move on.
While Mr. Biederman's district has been praised for reducing a seemingly intractable social problem, its methods have also drawn scorn.
When the district set up its plan for the homeless in 1989, it created a board consisting only of Mr. Biederman and two colleagues on the district's staff. Property owners in the BID wanted a separate board for the homeless program because they "were concerned about their own potential liability," Mr. Biederman said.
That attempt to avoid liability strikes Ms. Brosnahan of the Coalition for the Homeless, and several people involved with other BID's, as an attempt to skirt public accountability.
"I had assumed that these muckety-muck business people were providing oversight, but I am shocked," said Ms. Brosnahan.
The program, which provides training in building maintenance and other fields, assigns homeless people to automated-teller vestibules to try to persuade other homeless people to seek counseling, or else to leave.
Although it pays far less than the minimum wage, the Grand Central Partnership says it gives housing, food and job training to the homeless, and intends the $1.16 an hour only as a "training stipend."
The Partnership has a contract to provide its bank services at several Manhattan sites outside its own district. And now, it has applied for a major contract with the New York City Department of Homeless Services to use its trainees to work with the homeless across the city.
And that has provoked the lawsuit by the Coalition for the Homeless, which it says it will file this month on behalf of 17 former employees of the Partnership program. But the suit is also intended as a defense of the Coalition's own franchise as a provider of homeless services.
"We don't see a distinction between Coca-Cola and the Grand Central Partnership," said Lisa Daugaard, legal director for the Coalition. She said the Partnership, with low wages, "is squeezing out competent providers who work with trained professionals."
 
Brooklyn
Business Conflicts Divide a Board
 In a few smaller districts, the common goals that originally brought property owners together have fallen victim to internal disputes, and some owners say they think their investments in the districts have soured.
"It looks like schlock city out there," said Peter Aschkenasy, co-owner of the 112-year-old Gage & Tollner restaurant on Fulton Mall in downtown Brooklyn, where Abraham & Straus and a handful of other fashionable retailers have for decades maintained an uneasy coexistence with discount outlets.
Mr. Aschkenasy was a member of the board of the Fulton Mall district until last year, when the entire board was ousted in a fight between the discount merchants and owners of large businesses.
Once in power, Mr. Aschkenasy complained, the new board members relaxed the rules on splitting up retail space, and some merchants put up garish new signs. As a result, he said, attracting more businesses that appeal to wealthier shoppers appears to be much less likely.
Not all business people in Fulton Mall agree with Mr. Aschkenasy, but some say the board's upheaval underscores the fractionalized interests that can create problems at any time for improvement districts.
"We are very much interested in maintaining the dignity of Fulton Mall," said Charles Chera, the owner of several buildings on the mall, who led the effort to oust the district's former board and is now its chairman. He said the previous directors had ignored "the wide diversity of people who shop here" and the needs of merchants who serve "working class customers."
To some advocates of the BID's, such competing interests are simply democracy in action.
"Periodically, you are going to get new blood, and that is all for the good," said Lawrence O. Houstoun Jr., a consultant who has worked with business groups in several cities, including New York.
 
Upper East Side
A Security Force Of Private Guards
 The biggest battle may have just begun.
"We believe the police are doing a superb job," said Lucius J. Riccio, Transportation Commissioner under Mayor David N. Dinkins and now chief neighborhood organizer and lobbyist for the proposed Upper East Side district. "But they are the first to admit they need public assistance."
The district would encompass every block from 59th to 96th Street and from the East River to Central Park. It was proposed by Howard Milstein, owner of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which has dozens of buildings in the neighborhood, and it has support from officials of the Parks Council, the Fifth Avenue Association and the Council of New York Cooperatives.
But it has also provoked growing opposition. Last month, three state legislators who represent the Upper East Side, Senator Roy M. Goodman and Assemblymen John Ravitz and Alexander B. Grannis, opposed the plan, saying that low crime rates on the Upper East Side made it unnecessary and that a private security force would add to the neighborhood's reputation for elitism.
Although some established districts include apartment and co-op buildings, the Upper East Side district would be the first to be primarily residential, requiring it to resolve such questions as how to assess rent-stabilized buildings.
While Mr. Riccio insisted that the district was being planned as a BID, others say it would more closely resemble a residential improvement district. In a mini-battle of semantics, still others are calling it a "security district."
Mr. Riccio said he did not expect the plan to be voted on by the City Council until late next year, but co-op boards and business owners in the neighborhood have already been asked to support its outlines.
The BID would employ 350 to 500 security officers, with 70 assigned to foot or motor scooter patrol at any time. That would be more than double the number of police officers assigned to the neighborhood.
As in other districts, the security officers would be unarmed and would be required to call the police when they saw crime. They could make citizen's arrests until the police arrive. "They would mainly be a source of information for the police," Mr. Riccio said.
Details of whom would be assessed, and for how much, remain to be worked out, but the plan being circulated calls for owners of commercial space and co-ops to pay an average $100 to $200 per unit each year. Owners of the most valuable properties would pay more than $200.
The plan has provoked skepticism among civil rights lawyers, who say they fear such a large security force would overstep the bounds that normally limit private security guards.
"As critical as we are of the N.Y.P.D., at least they are accountable," said Norman Siegel, director of the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Without a formal complaint process, he said, anyone whose rights are violated by security personnel in a BID "may have no option but to sue, and most people can't afford it."
Councilman Eristoff said he opposed the plan in part because its security force might cause the police to withdraw officers from the neighborhood, despite agreements by the police and the Sanitation Department not to reduce services.
Mr. Riccio said there was no cause for concern.
"We are not trying to do the cops' jobs, just help," he said. If that leads to an increase in property values, he said, "I don't see why that is a bad thing."

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
A Parellel Art World, Vast and Unruly

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR FAKERY," SAID Carol Lay, neatly drawing a line in the sand between underground comics -- her world -- and high art. She was sitting in the living room (and studio) of her apartment in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn talking about cartooning's double requirement -- drawing and writing skills -- that can make it seem even more demanding than higher art forms. Ms. Lay became a cartoonist after a disenchanting period studying fine art at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the early 1970's. "Let's just say I took one too many courses in Conceptual Art," she continued, smiling only faintly.
 Aline Kominsky-Crumb, one of the first women to publish in underground comics, was more blunt. "I like the fact that I do things that people read on the toilet," she said, speaking from her house in Sauve, a small village in southern France. "Comics are cheap and funny and throwaway. I definitely want to stay away from the pretentious end of the art world." 
Welcome to the world of underground comics, a place where art and life, fact and fantasy and, of course, words and images mingle with unusual directness and often highly combustible results. Underground comics took the the stage in two New York shows last season: "Comic Power," at Exit Art, concentrated exclusively on the subject, while "Bad Girls," at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, included a handful of cartoonists and comic books. At a time when artists like Nicole Eisenman, Amy Sillman, Sue Williams, Lily van der Stokker and Katie Merz are gaining prominence by using cartooning riffs to make visually compelling, mordantly feminist paintings, there is increasing interest in women who do the real thing.
 The female underground began to approach critical mass in 1990, with the publication of "Twisted Sisters," an anthology edited by Ms. Kominsky-Crumb and Diane Noomin, which sold briskly in regular bookstores, not just comic-book stores. In 1993, Trina Robbins's "Century of Women Cartoonists" appeared, with two chapters on the underground. And last summer, Twisted Sisters struck again, with a series of four comic books that will be collected into a second anthology, "Twisted Sisters 2: Drawing the Line," in April. The publication will be marked next summer with an exhibition of the original drawings at the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco.
 Like the art world, the underground comic universe is teeming with talented women, and they are making their presence felt in what has been a largely male preserve. Working primarily from their own life experiences, these women are taking the underground tradition of raunchy revelation and self-exposure to places they have never been before.
 Their work may constitute one of the 20th century's most accessible, most psychologically detailed portraits of the many forms of female life and life style. This portrait, limned by cartoonists of every race, creed and sexual inclination, veers in tone from the tragic to the riotously funny, often within single images. It encompasses an exciting range of visual styles, from semi-photographic to semi-legible, and touches on a dazzling array of subjects, mundane, sacred and taboo. Everything from artistic crises to bodily functions is fair game, including childhood, marriage, childbirth, sexual encounters of all kinds (incest included), dreams, revenge fantasies, and other forms of violence both real and imagined.
 Women cartoonists have had a boost from a general explosion of interest that is driving parts of the comic underground into the daylight of mainstream pop culture. The evidence is familiar: Matt Groening's "Simpsons" on television, Art Spiegelman's "Maus" among Pulitzer Prize winners, Robert Crumb's slacker version of Eustace Tilley on the cover of The New Yorker.
 This rising comic underground is a vast and unruly parallel art world with its own history and traditions, its own elders and prodigies, its own factions and issues. It is rife with people who, as Robert Motherwell said of painters, carry the history of their medium in their heads. And because cartooning pays so little, it has a fragile, pure-of-heart precariousness evocative of the New York art world of the 1940's and 50's.
 Instead of gallery shows, this universe has comic books, which come in solo and group varieties and are published irregularly by presses with wry, iconoclastic names like Last Gasp, Rip Off Press, Fantagraphics, Kitchen Sink Press and Drawn & Quarterly. Instead of Jackson Pollock, it has the legendary Robert Crumb, who, as de Kooning said of Pollock, "broke the ice" when he brought forth Zap Comics in the counterculture ferment of San Francisco in 1967, liberating the comic form from the mainstream superhero genre and its audience of teen-age boys.
 Since then a lot of water has passed under the bridge, and through much of it women cartoonists have had to swim upstream. Zap and its successors in the 1970's and 80's, Arcade and Weirdo, replaced what Caryn Leschen, a San Francisco cartoonist, called "guys in tights flying around fighting each other," with the hormonally challenged nerd, and the hero-adventure story with first-person tales of sex, drugs and rock-and-roll that often landed them in court. (Not for nothing do the words "mature readers" or "for adults only" emblazon the covers of nearly all underground comic books.) But these comics published cartoons by women only sporadically, if at all, and their raunchy, heavy-breathing stories frequently portrayed women in a degrading manner. (Even the New York comic book World War III, a paragon of raised consciousness that started in the early 1980's, tends to be dominated by male cartoonists.)
In opposition, several all-women underground comic books, including It Ain't Me Babe Comics and Wimmin's Comix -- were founded in the early 1970's, and Wimmin's, at least, is still going strong. In the 1980's, under the editorship of Ms. Kominsky-Crumb, Weirdo began publishing a fair number of women.
 TODAY WOMEN CARTOONISTS form a rich and sprawling network of generations, styles and publications that spreads coast to coast. Like most cartoonists, they tend to cluster in and around New York, San Francisco and Seattle. Their work can be found in individual comic books (there are roughly a dozen by women) and group comics like Real Girl, Diva, and Dykes' Delight, an English comic book devoted to the work of lesbian cartoonists. Self-syndication is a growing practice, both among mainstream cartoonists like Nicole Hollander, and among others like Lynda Barry, Carol Lay, Nina Paley, Alison Bechdal, Heather Mc Adams and Caryn Leschen, whose work appears in the numerous alternative weeklies published in the United States, Canada and other parts of the world.
 To find out what these women were up to, it was necessary to absorb quantities of information, read comics until the eyes threatened to go belly up, and keep a list of women cartoonists that soon topped 160. It also involved meeting and interviewing a series of ambitious, opinionated but remarkably approachable women, whose natural habitats tended toward small rooms crammed with books and papers that were much more like writers' studies than artists' studios. And it meant falling in love with the underground comics themselves, with their amazing compression of narrative and emotion, their graphic density, and the cunning grid of framed images (called panels) -- surely one of the most irresistible of all modernist conventions.
 They are definitely art, these little movies that seem projected on a page for your eyes only. Mass-produced yet overtly handmade, they can brim with artistic intention and personality. They are both as malleable and as resilient as painting. They seem altogether different from garden-variety newspaper comic strips scanned for their punch lines with the morning coffee. And since comics cost almost nothing to create, they are open to all comers, which may explain their attraction for women.
 "Cartooning is the cheapest art you can possibly do," said Phoebe Gloekner, a former cartooning prodigy, now 33 years old, who lives in San Francisco. "All you need are some pen nibs and a bottle of ink." Ms. Gloekner, who has recounted her childhood experiences of sexual abuse in her powerfully rendered, quasi-realistic cartoons, summed up the narrative possibilities of her medium when she said, "If you can think it, you can make a cartoon about it." (And you can probably get it into print without having to ask anyone's permission, especially within the expanding substrata of self-published mini-comics and of "zines," a major training ground for up-and-coming female cartoonists. In this area, keep an eye out for Megan Kelso's Girl Hero and Shira Levine's Noisy Jewelry.)
 Like Carol Lay and Ms. Kominsky-Crumb, many women cartoonists planned to be fine artists but went AWOL from art school and gradually came to recognize a cartoonlike form of private journal or letter writing as their "art." Others, including Ms. Gloekner, have been seriously enamored of cartooning since childhood. By age 11, Leslie Sternberg, the unofficial historian of the comic underground, was earning lunch money by making drawings of naked women for the boys at school. Roberta Gregory, one of the first openly lesbian cartoonists, grew up seeing cartooning as a serious career option because her father drew for Disney.
 THESE WOMEN TEND TO BE impressively multidextrous, pursuing different media and forms of expression for both fun and profit. Most of them do illustration work, which pays better than cartooning, and have other sidelines, like writing children's books or doing performance art. Heather Mc Adams sings in her husband's rock band, makes experimental films, and sometimes translates her cartoon characters into ceramics and petit point. Ms. Gloekner supports herself and her daughter with the exacting art of medical illustration.
 If you look through a lot of underground comics by women past and present, it is apparent that the genre has grown and improved and the number of impressive artists increased over the years. Today's comics are often better produced and stylistically more distinctive than their predecessors, as if the artists themselves are more convinced that they are making art, not just an amusing, slightly subversive form of entertainment.
 Especially enthralling are the new ways that women, as well as men, are stretching and elaborating the cartoon format, changing the shape of the panels, giving the divisions between them a special character, or doing extreme things with space. Ms. Gloekner, telling the tale of a chance sexual encounter in a doorway, puts the reader exactly in the woman's shoes, looking down at her own breast as it is grasped by a strange man.
 Other distinctive fusions of word and image include Debbie Dreschler's dark, nuanced tales of childhood and adolescent pain rendered in a close, textured style that is best called quilted; the whiplash, mad-as-hell drawing-writing with which Roberta Gregory brings her most popular character, Bitchy Bitch, to seething, hilarious life; Heather McAdams's willfully awkward renditions of the trivia of her own life parlayed into universal jokes; and Ms. Kominsky-Crumb's stream-of consciousness narrations of her life, rendered in a claustrophobic, offhand style, each frame crowded with thought and speech balloons.
 Comics may be absorbed in a more direct way than so-called high art. The ones you like insinuate themselves into the mind like a good rock song; you can pore over them again and again, appreciating the humor, the line and textures, the reality of the characters, the economy of the sequences.
 Not all cartoonists stick to autobiography. Some, like Julie Doucet, a widely admired young Canadian cartoonist, convert their emotions into extreme fantasies of violence and sex -- mitigated by a soft, rather innocent drawing style -- that have only a tangential relationship to reality. Diane DiMassa, creator of the mini-comic "Hothead Paisan, Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist," specializes in violent female revenge fantasies that can thrill the (female) soul. In one memorable DiMassa strip, a heavyset man sits next to Hothead on a park bench, carelessly letting his leg touch hers, an experience known to most women who ride subways. Fulfilling an untold number of rush-hour fantasies, Hothead simply whips out an ax and chops off the offending limb. INCREASINGLY, COMICS HAVE A freedom and tenderness that enables them to do things that other forms of expression can't manage nearly as effectively. Furthermore they can be both general, abbreviating reality, and highly specific, locating a viewpoint with utmost precision. Ms. Gloekner's image of a grasped breast has a movie-camera extremeness about it, but in a movie the image would go by too fast; in cartoon form the experience is frozen, available for the mind to mull over. Similarly, the tales of incest told in Ms. Gloekner's work would be much harder to take on film, and yet much less vivid if written in narrative form.
 Happily, underground women cartoonists are not setting a good example; like their male counterparts in the underground, they are telling unvarnished truths. So doing, they offer evidence that women are subject to the same feelings, torments and desires, and capable of the same unspeakable acts and fantasies as men. Like the so-called sitcom "Roseanne" and the ironically violent 1992 movie "My New Gun," their work removes women from either doormat or and pedestal status and seeks to put them on an equal footing with men.
 Cartoons are frequently compared to therapy by the people who make them. If you can make a cartoon of it, you can be rid of it. The process is the visual equivalent of Freud's talking cure -- a drawing cure, if you will. Perhaps all good art offers a similar kind of cure to both artist and viewer alike; cartoons just acknowledge it more openly. Cathartic and direct, touching on experiences that befall everyone but are also highly personalized, the underground comics have always been among the most efficient ways to see one's life flash before one's eyes in nonthreatening circumstances. These days that life is increasingly of the female persuasion.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Fernando Henrique Cardoso;
Having Left Campus for the Arena, Winner in Brazil Shifts to Right

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
IF Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's President-elect, had run for office in the United States, his opponent would have had a field day dredging up his past.
 A leftist, though hardly revolutionary, professor who cited Marx and criticized the West when it was fashionable in the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Cardoso left a wealth of material for dissection, especially the book "Dependency and Development in Latin America," a seminal text still used in American graduate schools as a period piece on political mood of the 60's and 70's. 
 Mr. Cardoso ran on a capitalist platform of increased foreign investment, privatization of inefficient state enterprises and fiscal responsibility. As finance minister, he had engineered the plan that cut inflation from 45 percent a month in June to 1 percent a month in October.
 Mr. Cardoso's campaign positions were quite different from the beliefs he espoused in his book, but the differences never became an issue because he had built a reputation as a centrist senator. Faced with his past, Mr. Cardoso's best defense would have been that he is a changed man.
 "He now seems to be more of a social democrat than a socialist, but he was never a flame-throwing revolutionary," said Marc Chernick, an assistant professor of Latin American politics at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. Mr. Cardoso's victory in October was a defeat for one of the Brazilian left's current standard bearers, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 "It is ironic that Cardoso stops the left," Professor Chernick said, "because he was somewhat of the intellectual godfather of the left." Mr. Cardoso was arrested, blacklisted and exiled by the military regime that ran Brazil from the 1960's to the 1980's for his writings and political activities.
 The quotations are from "Dependency and Development in Latin America" and from campaign interviews and writings. (Mr. Cardoso wrote the book with Enzo Faletto, a Chilean historian. It was first published in 1971 and was published in English by the University of California Press in 1979.) By the periphery he means the developing world, and by the center he means the wealthy West. KEN BROWN
 "It is not realistic to imagine that capitalist development will solve basic problems for the majority of the population. In the end, what has to be discussed as an alternative is not the consolidation of the state and the fulfillment of 'autonomous capitalism,' but how to supersede them. The important question, then, is how to construct paths toward socialism."
-- "Dependency and Development in Latin America"
 "I am in favor of deregulating the economy. To put an end to inflation means to deregulate the economy, right? The economists invented indexation of the economy to correct the devaluation of the currency. When inflation disappears, indexation will disappear. As we want to defeat inflation, we will deregulate the economy."
-- Oct. 6, 1994, news conference.
 "A real process of dependent development does exist in some Latin American countries. By development, in this context, we mean 'capitalist development.' This form of development, in the periphery as well as in the center, produces as it evolves, in a cyclical way, wealth and poverty, accumulation and shortage of capital, employment for some and unemployment for others. So, we do not mean by the notion of 'development' the achievement of a more egalitarian or more just society. These are not the consequences expected from capitalist development, especially in peripheral economies."
-- "Dependency and Development in Latin America"
 "I am certain we must continue to fight inflation, because inflation is what impoverishes Brazil and the Brazilian people. Inflation causes an unfair distribution of income, it prevents calculations from being made and it prevents domestic and foreign investments."
-- Oct. 6 news conference.
 The international economy has gone from the devil to the savior for many Latin Americans, including Mr. Cardoso.
 "Of course, imperialist penetration is a result of external social forces (multinational enterprises, foreign technology, international financial systems, embassies, foreign states and armies, etc.). What we affirm simply means that the system of domination reappears as an 'internal' force, through the social practices of local groups and classes which try to enforce foreign interests, not precisely because they are foreign, but because they may coincide with values and interests that these groups pretend are their own."
-- "Dependency and Development in Latin America"
 "The international system is a field of opportunities, of resources, that must be sought naturally. We are a great country, with a clear vocation for an active and responsible participation in world affairs."
-- "Let's Work, Brazil" (Cardoso campaign manifesto)
 "It has been assumed that the peripheral countries would have to repeat the evolution of the economies of the central countries in order to achieve development. But it is clear that from its beginning the capitalist process implied an unequal relation between the central and the peripheral economies. Many 'underdeveloped' economies -- as is the case of the Latin American -- were incorporated into the capitalist system as colonies and later as national states, and they have stayed in the capitalist system throughout their history. They remain, however, peripheral economies with particular historical paths when compared with central capitalist economies."
-- "Dependency and Development in Latin America"
 "The process of liberalization of the economy and opening toward the outside world will continue, not an objective in and of itself, but as a strategic element in the modernization of our economy."
-- "Let's Work, Brazil"
 While his books were full of ideology, Mr. Cardoso is now more interested in policy.
 "We stress the socio-political nature of the economic relations of production, thus following the 19th-century tradition of treating economy as political economy. This methodological approach, which found its highest expression in Marx, assumes that the hierarchy that exists in society is the result of established ways of organizing the production of material and spiritual life. This hierarchy also serves to assure the unequal appropriation of nature and of the results of human work by social classes and groups. So we attempt to analyze domination in its connections with economic expansion."
-- "Dependency and Development in Latin America"
 "Privatization cannot be proposed or carried out under ideological banners. Privatization imposes itself in order to increase society's investment capacity, to increase competitiveness and, where it is the case, improve management.
-- "Let's Work, Brazil"

HEADLINE: ENCOUNTERS;
Law, Conducting and Mathematics in One Package

BYLINE: By ERIKA DUNCAN 

 BODY:
WE began at 10:30 in the morning on the Saturday of the Labor Day Weekend in the Paradise Diner, Sag Harbor's "greasy spoon," reminiscent of the places in the city where the lawyer, conductor, mathematician Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg might occasionally meet a client before going on to dinner at a setting just slightly more elegant.
We moved through the day as he talked, gesticulating nonstop as if he were still conducting some invisible orchestra, first out to the Sag Harbor pier -- "and I do often meet a client on a jetty or a small strip of beach," he was saying in the kind of aside that so often would come in between his lines, this lawyer who practices without an office or a secretary or an answering machine, partly to spare his clients overhead, partly because he never meant to be a practicing lawyer, not really. 
 Even as he was telling me how, when he was a graduate student in philosophy at New York University, he became obsessed with wanting to teach mathematics, for which he had no formal degrees, and persisted until finally he was given an unwanted summer session, as he was telling me about how suddenly in the early 50's, when his academic career was safely under way, his earlier interest in entering the musical profession began to resurface, going backwards and forwards in time, for he never dropped one thing in order to pursue anything else, he told me that "of course it all had happened simultaneously, otherwise I would be several hundred years old."
Somewhere along the line, friends persuaded him, much against his inclination, to take a summer job working for I.B.M., and the summer job lasted for 20 years, which didn't deter him from guest conducting for the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, nor from taking over the directorship of the Mannes Colege of Music. It didn't deter him from working on a book of seminal texts charting the historical evolution of symbolic logic, along with Jean van Heijenoort, who once was Trotsky's private secretary and bodyguard, another "temporary" endeavor, that lasted seven years, and brought him permanently to East Hampton.
He stopped for a minute, and started to discuss Brahms and the problems particular to conducting him that do not occur in either Bach or Stravinsky, why it is very satisfying to a conductor to have one set of problems at a rehearsal and another set at a performance entirely.
He had never meant to be a lawyer, he repeated, when already engaged in multiple simultaneities of life at 49 -- fully engrossed in both his music and his work at I.B.M. -- he suddenly began to study law. "I saw it as a kind of midlife sabbatical," he explained. "As a recharging of the batteries. I wanted to write a book on how software could be legally protected.
After three years of study he took the bar exam, more the way he had needed to walk into college when he was still in high school, as an exercise of sorts, then half-heartedly joined a law firm, quickly phasing out in order to write his book.
Then the phone started ringing, writers, musicians, computer people, people from his many academic worlds. "When a 25-year-old starts to practice law, he needs to be part of a firm. Who would go to a 25-year-old with no clients?" he interjected. "At my age it was very different."
Before he knew it he was brushing up on copyright litigation to help the dentist/artist Frederick Franck and the historian Joel Carmichael, and estate law for the family of Dwight Macdonald.
The phone never stopped ringing, which is one of the reasons, perhaps, that he doesn't have an answering machine.
We moved from the edge of a mooring on the end of the pier, where the pleasure boats coursed, to a bench where the early autumn sun streamed down on us, as I felt he was telling me not the story of one life, but of many, many overlapping lives.
Wherever he was, he was elsewhere. Miraculously, whether it was I.B.M. or New York University or the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, or the Mannes College of Music, he was released without question from being full-time, to whatever else it was that he felt he needed to do.
"Only once in my life, I felt the need to see a psychiatrist," he said. "It was when I suddenly felt the urge to re-enter the musical profession. I remember sitting bolt-upright in the middle of the night when it suddenly occurred to me that I could predict the next 40 years of my life. This so terrified me to have everything so pre-destined and pre-ordained."
He discussed it for just a few sessions, until the psychiatrist reassured him that he didn't think it would be dangerous to go ahead.
He told about a feeling, perhaps akin to that first premonition of danger, he had had when he passed the bar exam, as if already he could anticipate it all.
"The book about software copyright law never came into being," he said as the years seemed to fall away, and his wide face turned boyish as it so often does, as he described how his living quarters have turned into "one huge file, and I am juggling 300 clients who fortunately don't have something coming up every week."
Only when he was looking around and would suddenly stop talking would his ever-gesticulating arms grow still, as now for a moment he stopped to watch the boats, and I studied his red polo shirt, the same in winter and summer alike. For he never seemed to feel the cold.
Only every once in a while, when the temperatures would creep down near to zero, did he conform enough to custom to put on an overcoat, more to appease curious questioners in the street than because he really needed one. And he made it a point of pride that he only wears a suit while doing litigation in court.
"Once I was criticized for conducting so much of my practice over dinner," he explained. Eccentrically meticulous about picking up the bill, regardless of the economic circumstances of his clients, he felt such hospitality created a far nicer ambiance, safe from their telephones and his.
"There are probably clients who like the idea of a walnut-paneled office, but the cost is passed on to the client. I am always shocked by the enormous cost of legal services. Often smaller claims must be forgotten, because they are not worth the overhead. There really has to be a better way."
As the sun persisted, we moved from our bench on the pier to a bench down on Main Street that was more in the shade, with the tourists still passing and thronging about us. And still Stefan was undaunted. And still our visit would go on till half past 6; he would call me the next weekend to say there was still more he had to say, and then the next.
"Being a family lawyer is a bit like being an old-fashioned family doctor," he explained. "If you start out with someone in copyright law, you will not want to abandon him just because you don't usually do divorce, or because you don't like to handle cases between landlords and tenants."
"And I hate to send a bill before something is finished. And as we all know, these things can go on for years. And often, although they tell me it is poor business, when a client does not win a case I am tempted to lower the bill."
He was talking about how the Austrian Cultural Institute had gotten him involved in the case of Madame Piscator, the widow of the theater director who is now in her 90's. His face saddens as he tells me of her plight. Someone in her bank, suspicious of her contributions to various impoverished people in the theater community, had reported her to a social work agency. A legal guardian who had been appointed for her had put her into a mental hospital.
After having her freed, Stefan was now fighting to have her human and artistic rights restored, her right to visitors, her right to a secretary to transcribe the book that she is writing, to determine her own spending. His face saddens as he talks of the fact that such a thing could have happened in the United States today, and then grows animated again as he ventures to explain some of the crazier quirks of the current legal system.
I watch his gesturing, his face.
Once someone who observed him teaching at I.B.M.'s Systems Research Institute commented that he taught as if he were queuing in some distant trombone.
He wants to cut down on litigation, he says, because he wants to write a book about how the court structure itself encourages corruption in the presentation of evidence.
He also wants to write a book called "Encounters," treating the various people he has known, and another called "Beholden to No One," "that would be not so much about my own life but a portrait of the times [he] had passed through."
He wants to write a primer on a system for entering musical notation into computers that he developed while working for I.B.M. and I wonder, was it in the interstices between time -- jumping on a plane once a week in the early 60's to conduct the St. Louis Philharmonic, or, in the late 60's, to chair the department of conducting at the University of Southern California -- as he tells me rather wistfully that before the invention of the modern jet engine his often 42-times a year commutes would be periods of much greater accomplishment.
And as if there had been no pause, he is telling me the story of a friend of a friend, who ended up in the hospital at the age of 88 without a proper will, how he was called in at the last minute. "A dynamic rearranging of my schedule," he called it, even as he explained that he usually likes to sleep late, to stay up, when he is in New York City apartment, until the first edition of The New York Times comes onto the newsstands. Nonetheless, he rushed to the hospital, stayed up half the night, and by 11:30 in the morning had come up with the proper will.
"Ninety percent of client contact is psychology," he says. "You get a real glimpse into the abyss. Especially with divorce litigation. Especially with estate litigation."
Then he pauses for a minute. "I admire people who do criminal law. I could never really do it. Those people are the real heroes. They certainly don't get many thanks from society at large."
For a moment a man comes along the pier side, walking a German shepherd. Stefan excuses himself to go pet the dog. "German shepherds are my real friends," he says, returning.
"And yet I believe that someone accused of crime is entitled to a fair trial. I don't know when I will be accused of a crime -- I don't think that I've done one -- but if I am accused I want to have a fair trial."
Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg was born in Heidelberg, in 1927. The Mengelberg family, boasting many musicians, had been in the Rhineland for centuries. One was said to have known Beethoven and was portrayed with a violin in an oil painting in the house where Stefan grew up. His granduncle, Willem Mengelberg, deriving from the Dutch strain of Mengelbergs, was the conductor of the famous Concertgebouw Orchestra in the Netherlands, where he played a major part in creating what is now taken for granted as the virtuoso orchestra.
The family had been Catholic until Stefan's maternal grandfather had rebelled against the authority of the Catholic church and had become Protestant. One distant ancestor was the abbot of the famous German monastery at Heisterbach, and legend would have it that a monk began to meditate on the notion of time, to ask how it was that God could be infinite in time. He took a walk, and when he came back it was 100 years later, and he had learned something about time and infinity.
Was it this secret inheritance that gave Stefan his interest in symbolic logic and time? Stefan and his brother, almost from the beginning, had been brought up by their mother, a professor of economics whose friends included Hannah Arendt and Paul Tillich. Their father, a lawyer, who was to end up in Argentina, was "much remarried" and gave him many, many half brothers.
His paternal grandmother was Jewish, and it was from her that Stefan's older brother got his blond, blue-eyed coloring, so extreme that he might have been able to play Siegfried in any opera house. Nonetheless, according to the Nurenberg laws, the two boys were seen as borderline cases. "Only if we had joined the Hitler Youth would our Jewish grandmother have been 'forgotten.' We had cousins who were admitted to the Hitler Youth and taken to Berlin where anthropologists measured their noses."
This of course was out of the question. Stefan's mother, one of four female university professors in Germany at the time, had done her dissertation on the fiscal policies of the Social Democratic Party, and she was immediately dismissed when the Nazis came to power.
The family lived for three years on the outskirts of Frankfort, and then moved to Wuppertal, now the home of the Pina Bausch ballet company, where they lived for another three years before coming to the United States. Stefan's mother was given a position at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, where Stefan would begin his American life.
As his anecdotes ran from those of his clients to those he had worked with closely, as he told me suddenly about Ruth Fischer, whose assistant he had been when working as a graduate student in philosophy, who was the founder of the Austrian Communist Party, and then later, for a short while, the head of the German Communist Party, "a position unheard of for a womaen half-Jewish" -- a sense of feisty, full-blooded apprenticeship emerges, tales of initial resistance followed by what was always a meeting rather than a tendency to worship or be too much influenced.
And yet when the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe, whose symphony he edited and then conducted, asked him what was his original contribution, he spoke about the fact that he did not necessarily think it a negative thing to "serve," that there were so many worthy people and endeavors in each of the fields that he was in, and in a way his translating -- for example, the essays in the history of logic -- served a greater purpose than his writing just one single brilliant piece.
I think of how Stefan explained to me that really it was a good thing he was not an outstanding research mathematician, in terms of the teaching of mathematics. "For outstanding research mathematicians are unable to teach the pitfalls, since they never fall into the pits."
And then, the lives not over yet, he starts to tell still other tales of suddenly, last year, beginning to edit the journal put out by the National Association of Scholars. They are tales of trans-Atlantic phone calls over the placement of a single comma that might alter the whole meaning of a phrase, and how he loves those calls, whatever time they take, however much they cost, what a wonderful experience it was to be working with a philosopher from Oxford, though it really was ridiculously expensive.
And strange it was, as he would talk, whether it was about the earlier work he did for Dwight and Gloria Macdonald, or the quarrel over a famous actor's building a chimney in East Hampton six feet from his unknown neighbor's property, as case history moved into life and back again, the boundaries between himself and those he talked about seemed to disappear.
Day seemed to disappear into night, as the time of our talking seemed to grow later and later, and eventually it was 6 o'clock in the evening, and then 6:30, and then 6:35.
So passed a carefully timed timelessness, a willingness to give each moment, each legal encounter, as long as it takes. And yet it was strange, in his life, as he described it, I felt each moment spent generated more time, until I knew we could continue on forever and forever, that every new beginning and impression, every seeming ending was only another chance to be beginning again.

HEADLINE: Amid Affluence, Hunger Is at Home

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
LAST Monday morning, 74-year-old Stefan Szymik arrived at the soup kitchen at Grace Episcopal Church here for his first hot meal in three days. The former machinist, a homeless man who said he lived meal to meal on Social Security checks, had purchased a package of luncheon meats from the local A.&P. two days before but had eaten little since.
Like many of the 80 or so other people in the dining room -- the elderly, the newly unemployed, homeless and disabled among them -- Mr. Szymik had come to depend on the bounty of the soup kitchen. 
 Another man, Harold Chavis, 48, said he used to be a tractor-trailer driver and that he comes to the soup kitchen every day. A man of few words, Mr. Chavis described himself as "homeless and hungry."
A 43-year-old woman, who would identify herself only as Roxanne, was also waiting for a meal, as was her daughter, Fatima, 2, who sat quietly at a table counting coins in her pink plastic purse.
Victoria Stewart, 35, a former telephone operator, and her companion Bubby Seabrook, 46, who said he had worked as a pediatric nurse, had come for a free meal, too, because they were out of work now and living on public assistance.
It was the first hot meal for many since the weekend, when the soup kitchen was closed, and some said they had stolen food from supermarkets during the two days to get by. Others had visited food pantries, where they received dried goods and food staples to tide them over. Others described a network of church-run soup kitchens, where they could count on a hot Sunday meal.
A few, however, said that although they had eaten little for several days, they were not hungry.
"The less you eat, the less you want to eat," Mr. Szymik explained. "You learn to get by."
According to Second Harvest, a national nonprofit hunger relief organization in Chicago, 10.4 percent of the population -- close to 26 million Americans -- are fed by local food banks throughout the United States.
Like Fatima, 42.9 percent are children. And like her mother, Roxanne, 26.8 percent of the nation's hungry are single parents.
Another 8.1 percent are elderly, like Mr. Szymik, many of whom are living on fixed incomes.
Others are newly unemployed, like Ms. Stewart and Mr. Seabrook, and social workers say it is especially difficult for them in a county like Westchester, where housing and other cost-of-living expenses run high.
In Westchester, where the mean household income was more than $48,000 in 1990, according to the Census Bureau, the statistics on hunger follow the national patterns -- although those studying the problem locally say the county presents a special picture.
"Poverty and hunger tend to be invisible in Westchester, and most people like it that way," said Priscilla Denby, who is directing a study of hunger at Pace University.
But attitudes have recently begun to shift, and Dr. Denby said that in telephone interviews with Westchester residents during the study, respondents were asked if they would be willing to spend another $100 in taxes to feed the poor. The survey found that 61.5 percent would.
According to the university study -- titled "A Growing Hunger: A Study of Food Inadequacy in Westchester County, 1993" -- even though the county is one of the wealthiest in the nation, one-third of Westchester's residents have "had to choose at some time between being hungry or paying the rent."
Numbers from the county's Department of Social Services show that 9,078 residents received food stamps during the fiscal year 1993-94, up from 8,700 the year before.
The Pace University survey also says poverty and hunger are not confined to the big cities of the county, and interviews revealed "pockets of problems throughout Westchester."
"Wherever it occurs, in the southern tier cities of the county or in the suburbs, poverty and hunger are joined at the hip," Dr. Denby said.
Ghassam Karam, assistant professor of economics at Pace University and a coordinator for the hunger study -- he prefers to call it "The Other Westchester" -- said that according to the 1990 census, 58,164 Westchester County residents were listed as living below the poverty line, which is considered to be $14,700 a year for a family of four.
But the actual number for those who are "hungry and in need" was probably closer to 135,000, if one includes residents living at 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, he said.
Dr. Denby described "a new type of person" who was going hungry in Westchester, saying that "more and more, it's the newly unemployed that we are seeing."
At Second Harvest, which represents 189 food banks and 50,000 agencies nationally, Christine Vladimiroff, president and chief executive officer, said that the "face of hunger was changing."
"Increasingly," she said, "we are seeing the working poor, who receive minimum pay and no benefits.
At Food-Patch in Millwood, a local food bank allied with Second Harvest, Christina Rohatynskyj, the executive director, described it as "a broad spectrum of people who are suffering, who are having to ask themselves, 'Do we buy the kids shoes, or do we eat? Do we pay the rent or do we eat?' We're talking about people who never dreamed they would enter the emergency food network."
Food-Patch, which stands for People Allied to Combat Hunger, fed 200,000 people during the 1993-94 fiscal year, with about 43 percent of those being children, Ms. Rohatynskyj said. The organization distributes food to local food pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters.
Food banks and soup kitchens are now worried that sources of Federal funding for their relief efforts will be jeopardized by the change in administration and Ms. Rohatynskyj said, "We're all feeling threatened."
The food banks expect even less money from Congress to buy United States Department of Agriculture commodities -- like butter, cornmeal and canned meat, beans, fruits and vegetables -- to distribute to the food pantries. The Government's $25 million budget to purchase commodities for food pantries was down from $85 million last year.
Meanwhile, as the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays approach, food pantries and soup kitchens continue to feed the poor, relying increasingly on private donations.
At the Ossining Food Pantry in Trinity Episcopal Church, Aileen Hunt, a supervisor, said her organization was distributing bags of groceries that contained a three- or four-day supply of food to 115 people a week.
The typical mix of groceries for a mother and two children from the food pantry includes soups, vegetables, cereal, dried milk, beans, oil, peanut butter, jelly, tunafish and pasta -- worth about $28.
For Thanksgiving, turkey hams, which are pressed turkeys flavored like hams, will be distributed by the pantry, along with 150 turkeys.
At Grace Church, Lesma Howard-Zepeda, director of the nutrition center, said that although the soup kitchen was receiving less money from donors and had already seen a $14,000 shortfall this year in its $110,000 annual budget, it would keep its doors open, and full-course holiday meals would be served.
"At holiday time we talk of abundance," said Ms. Vladimiroff of Second Harvest, "and some are offended that we only pay attention to the hunger problem at this time of year. Our hope is that what happens at Christmas and Thanksgiving carries over."
"The numbers keep going up for domestic hunger," she said, "Maybe we don't see the bloated stomachs, the skeletal frames" and the orange hair from vitamin deficiency, "the graphic images of famine and death, but the problem in this country is not going away."

The Credit Card: We Love It, We Hate It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA; Joseph Nocera writes the Profit Motive column for GQ magazine. His history of the credit card, "A Piece of the Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class," was published last month by Simon & Schuster.

 BODY:
WHAT is the defining act of the American consumer? Easy. It is handing a salesperson that slim piece of encoded plastic -- the credit card. What is harder to answer is why so common an act is such a mystery.
On the one hand, we love the Card. There are 1.15 billion credit cards in circulation, amounting to nearly 10 for every American cardholder. This year, collectively, we will charge about $700 billion of goods and $325 billion of debt on them. 
 And, every year, we love it more. In 1970, the average balance on credit cards was $649. By 1986 it was $1,472. This year, it will be $2,800.
But we also hate the Card, with which banks can make money from both merchants and cardholders. "I think the banks, ever since the moneychangers were driven out of the temple of God, have been trying to perfect some plan whereby they can collect from both sides," railed Wright Patman, Democrat of Texas and head of the House Banking Committee, in 1967. He spoke for all of us.
Partly, we fear the Card's temptations. "Unless we bring credit cards under control," cautioned former Senator William Proxmire at the same time, "we are likely to produce a nation of credit drunks." Even by that early date, few still subscribed to the naive views of one early observer, who, shortly after the bank credit card was born in 1958, said its major use would be "to take advantage of sales -- to buy your skis in the summer and your barbecue grill in the winter."
Everyone also knew that banks would hardly stand in the way of the credit card's considerable temptations. After all, banks' most profitable customers are those who get into debt, stay in debt and pay the minimum balance -- just the minimum balance -- on time.
We still share all these sentiments, and strongly so. In some of my recent research, people spoke with surprising anger and resentment about banks trying to "lure" them into debt. "Why do they keep sending me preapproved solicitations? Don't they know I already have six credit cards?" Or, "I hate the way they raise my credit limit when they think I'm not looking." When we walk around with $10,000 to $15,000 of credit in our pockets, we come face to face with issues of willpower -- or lack of same. And we resent those who put us in a position to succumb.
But even as we speak irately of the tempter banks, even as we view the credit card as a bit sinful, we see it as a status symbol and a key to the good life, and hand it over the counter. In one recent study, 22 percent of respondents described themselves as "uncomfortable using credit cards." Who were these people? Mastercard holders.
The Card carries other mysteries. Why were Americans so willing to accept 18 percent and 20 percent interest rates on their credit cards, while other rates fell dramatically? The banks do not know. But they knew the behavior -- which is why they kept rates high for so long.
And, in store visits, why do consumers spend more with a credit card than with either cash or checks? No one knows.
And why do so many people who are able to pay off their card balances every month nonetheless run up debt? Again, no one knows.
But the Card keeps growing. "Have you ever tried to rent a car without one?" asked Alex Hart, a former head of Mastercard. The question suggests how far things have come. In 1965, the Bank of America ran a publicity stunt in which a man lived for a month using only his BankAmericard. We have traveled from the possibility of using only a credit card to the virtual impossibility of not doing so.
But the industry sets its sights still higher. If the technology is ever so instantaneous that you can pull out your card at, say, McDonald's, its triumph will be complete. You will love the Card even more. And you will still resent it.

THE SOUTH IN MODERN AMERICA
A Region at Odds.
By Dewey W. Grantham.
Illustrated. 359 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $30. 
DEWEY W. GRANTHAM took on a tough assignment when he agreed to write "The South in Modern America." Mr. Grantham, a distinguished historian at Vanderbilt University, was asked to compress into one moderate-sized volume the history of the South from the disputed Presidential election of 1876 to the Clinton election of 1992. When one considers that the twin peaks of New South historiography -- C. Vann Woodward's magisterial "Origins of the New South, 1877-1913" (1951) and George B. Tindall's equally formidable "Emergence of the New South, 1913-1945" (1967) -- together took over 1,200 pages just to reach the end of World War II, the dimensions of the challenge facing Mr. Grantham become clear.
Yet in many ways he has managed to meet this challenge, and he made two decisions at the outset that were crucial to his success. He chose to rely heavily on existing scholarship -- the book is "essentially a synthesis," he notes -- and he decided to concentrate on a limited number of major themes. The result is something of a minor miracle: a reliable and eminently readable history of the South since Reconstruction in slightly more than 350 pages, even with the footnotes at the bottom of the page.
"The South in Modern America" has four principal themes. The first -- the enduring competition between North and South -- is the most obvious. Although Mr. Grantham gives some attention to economic and cultural rivalries, his major concern is political conflict. While the Democratic Party was rising to dominance in the post-Reconstruction South, Republicans were achieving majority status in much of the East and West, and it was not until a transplanted Southern Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, won the Presidency in 1912 that the South, led by powerful Congressional committee chairmen, returned to the pinnacle of national power in Washington.
A similar pattern re-emerged during the Great Depression when Franklin D. Roosevelt, late of Hyde Park, N.Y., and Warm Springs, Ga., captured the White House. F.D.R. was so wary of offending the Southern barons who dominated Capitol Hill that he refused to support a bill to make lynching a Federal crime. To do so, Roosevelt feared, would end any chance he might have of getting his economic and reform legislation through Congress. The more recent era has witnessed a stunning reversal of the South's traditional role in Presidential elections as the Republican Party has grown dramatically all across the Sun Belt. In both the 19th and the 20th centuries, Mr. Grantham correctly points out, race has been the single most important force shaping the contours of Southern politics.
Race also figures largely in the second and third major themes of the book: the ways in which Northerners and Southerners have compromised with one another since Reconstruction and how this process of accommodation led at times to a substantial degree of regional convergence. The South had no monopoly on racism during the period Mr. Grantham covers. Indeed the outside pressure the Federal courts, and eventually the national executive and legislative branches, put on the South during the "Second Reconstruction" -- the civil rights struggle -- was in many ways an anomaly. During World War II, it came as no surprise when a race-baiter like Senator Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi told his constituents that Roosevelt's Fair Employment Practices Committee was "nothing but a plot to put niggers to work next to your daughters." What may surprise some readers is that men like Bilbo were able to garner enough Congressional support outside the South to kill F.E.P.C. in 1946, and this case was by no means an isolated instance.
Mr. Grantham's fourth theme is the one he turns to at the end of his story: the problem of regional identity. He probes this topic by examining Southerners' religious life, their profound sense of place and family, their impressive literary tradition and their "subculture of violence," and he comes to the quite reasonable conclusion that the South retains its status as "the nation's most distinctive region."
There is much more. In addition to race and politics, Mr. Grantham examines the dramatic transformation of the Southern economy in the 20th century; he discusses the enormous impact of both World War I and World War II on the South, and he sketches the main outlines of the cultural changes that occurred in the region. Clearly Mr. Grantham could not cover everything in a volume of this length (the role of Southern women is given very modest space, for example), and he sometimes moves at breakneck speed to push the story along. But "The South in Modern America" is nonetheless a superb study. Readers seeking a compact, up-to-date history of the New South need look no farther than this book.

HEADLINE: Farmland Preservation Is Lagging

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY 

 BODY:
A STATE program started 14 years ago to preserve New Jersey's diminishing farmland has so far saved 22,080 acres -- an average of about 1,575 acres a year. But during the same period, an average of 10,000 acres a year has been sold for development, state records show.
Further, state officials acknowledge that despite efforts in recent years to streamline the application process, insufficient local and state funds, political delays and the state's relatively high land values have contributed to large backlogs in applications for the State Farmland Preservation Program. As a result, the state approves fewer than a dozen applications a year for farmland preservation while hundreds of others are routinely turned down. 
 "We have more farms than we have money," said Donald D. Applegate, executive director of the state's Agricultural Development Committee, which operates the program in cooperation with county and municipal planning boards. "It is a highly competitive situation."
Figures provided by Mr. Applegate and other officials show that farmland presevation applications from farmers have numbered 450 or more a year. But only an average of 10 small farms are saved each year.
"It is a small percentage of the total farm acreage that has been preserved when you look at the gross," Mr. Applegate said. "We have plenty of farms yet to go."
Altogether, the program has spent $114.5 million for preservation. About $33.5 million of that has come from county and municipal government, while the state's share of $81 million has come from state bond issues.
Still, farmers, as well as national and state farm experts, defend the program. They say it has been successful and has produced local clusters of preserved farms, as well a motivation for farmers to go on rather than sell their land.
"There is a certain amount of frustration, but the program is successful and has its merits," said Steven J. George, a nurseryman in the Morris County community of Mendham. Mr. George is president of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, which is the political and lobbying arm of the agriculture industry.
The frustration, Mr. George and others said, is born of a continual shortage of money to finance the program. Some critics say that will change only when a permanent financial source is found. Since its inception, the program has run on money from $150 million in bond issues.
Linda B. Webber, a planner and the preservation administrator for Hunterdon County, said that under the program a farmer approved for preservation is paid the easement value of his land while still retaining full ownership. Easement value, she said, is the difference between the land's market value and its hypothetical worth with a permanent deed restriction, which prohibits transfers of deeds for development purposes.
In return, the farmer agrees to add the deed a restriction barring the sale of the land to developers.
For instance, Mrs. Webber said, if a farmer can prove the land is worth $10,000 an acre to developers and $3,000 an acre if preserved, the state will pay the farmer 60 to 80 percent of the $7,000 difference, while the county and the municipality pick up the remaining 20 to 40 percent.
Among other criteria, competing farms are judged on size and assessments, soil quality, water and soil conservation features, proximity to other preserved farms or other open spaces, and their long-term value to agriculture, officials said.
Deborah Bowers, the publisher of the Farm Preservation Report, a nationwide independent newsletter on the subject, called New Jersey's program "very successful." In a recent telephone interview from her office in Maryland, she conceded that no state program could ever hope to stay ahead of the huge losses in farmland that were still occurring.
"Land saved will never be a significant amount compared to development," she said. "There is a lot more money to be made from development than preserving it for future generations."
But she noted that a recent survey she did of the nine states with preservation programs showed that New Jersey had spent "much more than any other state" to save farmland.
New Jersey's program, she said, protects important farms within an agricultural area and the protection stabilizes the agricultural industry in those particular communities. "What we call the impermanence syndrome steadied, so that farmers feel that maybe there is a future for farming where they are," Ms. Bowers said.
The state committee's current list has 48 farms that have received approval for $16 million in state easement purchases this year. Of these, five farms were approved in 1992 but held over. Perhaps more important, 71 farms have qualified to be purchased next year, but only $19 million of the $44 million that is required to do so will be available, officials say.
"We suspect that we will not have enough money for most of the 71," Mr. Applegate said. He said only $69 million remained from the three bond issues used to finance the program since 1981. Not all counties and municipalities have come up with the 20 to 40 percent contributions, he said.
Mr. Applegate said that under a cost-sharing agreement, the state also pays half of a farmer's soil and water conservation improvements in return for his not selling his farm for development for eight years.
Candace M. Ashmun, president of the Morristown-based Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions, said that preserving farmland first arose as a priority from a blue ribbon commission appointed in the 1970's by Philip Alampi, who was the state Agriculture Secretary. By the late 70's, Ms. Ashmun said, it had been incorporated into the master plans of both the State Planning Commission and the Pinelands Commission, of which she is still a member. She said the idea was primarily to offer economic protection for farmers facing even greater development pressures than they do today.
By 1980, Ms. Ashmun said, state officials felt that a farmland preservation program was sorely needed, not to thwart development, but to make farming more secure and attractive to younger farmers.
Farming plays such a major role in New Jersey economy that Ms. Ashmun and others contend that agriculture has deserved the special protections afforded not only by the preservation program but through tax exemptions and other regulatory relief.
Figures provided by the Crop Reporting Service, an agency within the United States Department of Agriculture in Trenton, show a precipitous decline in New Jersey farmland for the last decade. For example, in 1981, when voters approved the first $50 million bond referendum, there were 1.3 million acres of farmland in the state.
Disagreements over how to administer the program delayed payments to the first farmers until in 1985. By then, there were 960,000 farmland acres, a loss of 70,000 acres.
Further, the 1994 figures show an aggregate loss of 140,000 acres since 1981, leaving the present total of 860,000 acres of farmland. This is an average loss of 10,000 acres a year since the program began.
But the state and national farming experts, as well as the New Jersey farmers themselves, say the program has fostered a new optimism among farmers for the future of farming. They say at least some farm owners are not so easily succumbing to the lure of developers these days.
Keith Wiebe, an economist with the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, said most of the nine states that have state-run preservation programs are in the Northeast. Other states have privately financed land trusts or no programs at all, he said.
Some New Jersey farmers say the long wait in having their applications approved is worth it in the end for them and their families.
Gary Mount has owned Terhune Orchards in the Mercer County community of Lawrence Township for 19 years. He said he had unsuccessfully applied for an easement purchase since 1982, his application having been repeatedly denied.
At $11,180 an acre, farmland in Mercer is among the highest in the state. The statewide average is $6,942 an acre, said Robert Battaglia, the chief state statistician for the Crop Reporting Service.
But Mr. Mount said he was happy that an application for the state purchase of 55 of the 225 acres he owns or rents was finally approved this year. "It has been frustrating and upsetting at times, but we stuck it out," he said.
"I am 50 years old now," Mr. Mount said. "Before I got the approval, I would plant these dwarf apple trees that we have. They take 12 years to mature before you break even, and I wondered if anyone would be around to harvest them at their peak, or if they would even be there."
Now, he said, "we will be able to retire a lot of our debt, keep the farm and still make a living from it." He added: "Someone will harvest those apples. That is ideal."
 
An Exporter of Food
THE relatively high cost of farmland in New Jersey, state agriculture officials say, is attributable to rich soils and the easy accessibility of many farms to 22 major markets out of the state.
Since the State Farmland Preservation Program began purchasing farm easements in 1985, the average cost for an acre has been $5,500. The average market price per acre as of last June was $6,942, according to the Crop Reporting Service in Trenton. Of the 21 counties in the state, only Hudson has no assessed farmland, officials said.
Donna Callaghan, the chief of the State Department of Agriculture's bureau of market development and product promotion, said that 70 percent of all New Jersey farm products are exported. "About 30 percent of what we grow here stays here," she said.
Joseph Tarpine, a market reporter for the department, said "at least three-quarters" of the produce sold at the six-day-a-week Vineland Auction, which is in Cumberland County and is the largest block auction of its kind in the nation, is sent to other states.
This, he said, includes the 8,200 tons of lettuce, peppers, peaches, cabbage, spinach, escarole, beets, tomatoes, herbs and other crops that were bought there up to Oct. 15. Purchased by 35 brokers and buyers, the auctioned products will bring farmers about $44 million in receipts this year, Mr. Tarpine said.
Farmers in the Cumberland County area sell half their products through the auction and half privately, Ms. Callaghan said.
While much of this produce is shipped to Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Pittsburgh, Mr. Tarpine said, shipments also are made to 18 other cities, including Montreal and Miami.
"We produce a lot more than we use," said Stephen J. George, president of the New Jersey Farm Bureau.
Ms. Callaghan said it was difficult to arrive at a more precise figure for New Jersey's farm exports because of the "circuitous route" that some of them take. "Some of it may leave for Philadelphia or New York," she said, "but find its way back to supermarkets in New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Angolan Government and Rebels Sign Treaty to End 19-Year War

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The enemies who have fought since 1975 for control of Angola signed a treaty here today promising to end the last war in southern Africa and to collaborate in rebuilding their rich and devastated country.
The accord, which calls for the guns to fall silent on Tuesday, is the third such pledge to end Angola's relentless fratricide. But it is the first to guarantee a share of power to the Unita rebel movement, and the first to be backed by plans to deploy thousands of armed United Nations peacekeepers. 
 Despite the determined optimism put on for the signing, the credibility of the treaty was diminished by the absence of the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, who sent word that he was unable to leave his hideout in Angola because the Government would try to kill him.
Even after a truce signed last Tuesday, which was supposed to create a more trusting climate for today's peace pageant, diplomats said that the Angolan Army had continued shelling Unita positions and that the rebels had also launched attacks.
The treaty was signed today by Gen. Eugenio Manuvakola, a senior guerrilla commander and secretary general of Unita, and by Venancio de Moura, the Angolan Foreign Minister.
Afterward, the Unita general clutched the Foreign Minister warmly and then hugged the Angolan President, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who had planned to sign for the Government but stepped back when Mr. Savimbi failed to appear. The embraces inspired the day's only roar of emotion from the throng of diplomats wilting inside a heavily guarded conference center.
"I pray to God that this will be the last peace agreement on Angola," Alioune Blondin Beye, the United Nations special representative to Angola, said later.
In 1991, the last time Angolans signed a peace deal, it was hailed as fruit of the new world order that emerged after the cold war. The United States and the Soviet Union, which had helped finance the warring rivals, helped push them to peace, which lasted about 18 months.
This time, peace in Angola is viewed as a milestone of a different sort -- a sign of how southern Africa is moving, against the continental trend, toward reconciliation and democracy.
But how soon Angola will join South Africa and other neighbors that have turned their attention from violent conflict to economic recovery is a subject of deep skepticism.
The United Nations, which is to police the deal, plans to move cautiously. Only a few dozen monitors will be deployed at first to watch the cease-fire, and only if they are convinced that both sides are abiding by the treaty will they eventually move in about 7,000 peacekeepers.
While participants insisted that the treaty was not devalued by the lack of Mr. Savimbi's signature, his absence raised questions about whether he could muster the trust to disarm his men and claim positions in the Government, as the treaty provides.
"If there is no political will, if there is no good faith, then anything, no matter how small, can ruin it," said Maj. Gen. Chris Garuba, a Nigerian mediator at the peace talks.
African leaders who assembled here to encourage Angola's reconciliation were less upset with Mr. Savimbi than with the Angolan Government for continuing its successful military offensive despite a chorus of international calls to stop.
On Saturday night, at a closed meeting of leaders from the southern region, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe strongly criticized the Angolan Government for continuing to attack for three weeks after peace talks were concluded.
"None of us have ever trusted Unita," Mr. Mugabe was quoted as saying by one guest at the meeting. "We think the Government had a right all these years to defend its sovereignty. We supported you.
"But things have changed. Why the escalation at this moment? Why at this moment, when the signing was imminent?"
Mr. Savimbi, whose exact whereabouts have not been disclosed, was offered safe passage to Lusaka on a United Nations airplane. But his deputies said he did not trust the Government to assure his security.
Foreign intermediaries who took part in the peace talks offered other explanations for Mr. Savimbi's failure to come.
One was that the proud guerrilla leader might have felt that it would be humiliating to make an appearance when he was widely seen as defeated on the ground. Another was that he might have been catering to a hawkish faction in his movement that rejects the treaty.
There were also renewed rumors that Mr. Savimbi was sick, injured or even dead, although Mr. Beye, the United Nations representative, met him recently and found him in good health.
The treaty is the product of 12 months of talks so glacial in their progress that at one point the negotiators spent an entire week quarreling over the name of the joint commission that will work out the timing and details of the reconciliation. They finally called it "The Joint Commission."
The treaty text has not been made public, but drafters say it spells out a list of officials Unita will appoint as a junior participant in the Government, including governors in 3 of Angola's 18 provinces, plus Cabinet ministers, ambassadors and mayors.
Although Mr. Savimbi has been widely reported to have been offered the position of Vice President, the signers today said his role in the future government had not been settled.
"When we see that Dr. Savimbi has the political will to participate in the process of national reconciliation, we will be able to solve this question," said Mr. de Moura, the Angolan Foreign Minister.
Angola, a country of 10 million people rich in oil and diamonds, has scarcely known peace since 1961, when the first nationalist rebels began an uprising against Portuguese colonizers.
No sooner was independence won in 1975 than the liberation fighters turned on each another. Mr. dos Santos's Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola was supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba; Mr. Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known by the Portuguese acronym Unita, was backed by the United States and South Africa.
Mr. Savimbi and Mr. dos Santos signed their first peace treaty in Zaire in June 1989, but they soon differed over exactly what they had signed, and by August Mr. Savimbi announced a return to full-scale hostilities.
In May 1991, the two men met in Portugal and signed a peace that included internationally monitored elections. This time, the war stopped long enough to hold elections in September 1992. Outpolled and with his army never fully disarmed, Mr. Savimbi resumed his war, making major gains against a Government that had let down its guard.
The accord signed today provides for a runoff presidential election, because Mr. dos Santos won in 1992 with less than 50 percent of the vote. It would not take place until the United Nations decided that the country was stable, and Mr. Savimbi's popularity seems to have declined sharply during the last two brutal years of fighting.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. GOVERNORS CAUTION CONGRESS ON SOCIAL AGENDA

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Nov. 20

 BODY:
Buoyed by their biggest victory in 25 years, the nation's Republican governors and governors-elect sought today to put some distance between themselves and the Republicans who will control Congress.
They urged the new Congressional leaders not to be distracted by social issues like school prayer and warned that they did not want the Federal budget to be cut at the expense of the states. 
 Arriving here for the annual conference of the Republican Governors Association, several delegates brushed aside two centerpiece issues of Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker-in-waiting: his proposals for an overhaul of welfare and for a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in schools.
They took care not to directly attack Mr. Gingrich and some even embraced his call for a balanced-budget amendment, but only on the condition that such an amendment would include language barring the Federal Government from passing on the increased financial burden to the states.
But at least 20 of the governors and governors-to-be crowding the podium at a news conference this evening asserted that their independence from Washington, even if that meant keeping distance from the new Republican leaders.
"We're balancing budgets, we're reforming welfare, we're fixing health care, we're dealing with crime," said Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, the new president of the association, which now has 30 members. "Our message will be to Congressional leaders, people of this country: Give us the ball and get out of the way. We can solve these problems."
Gov. Pete Wilson of California said flatly: "We believe the states that we have been privileged to govern are just that. They are sovereign, proud states of the United States. They are not colonies of the Federal Government."
Echoing his colleagues who argued that Republicans should emphasize economic stability rather than social issues like school prayer, Gov. John Engler of Michigan said, "If we don't deal with the economic issues, we'll need more than prayer to solve our problems."
Several governors who flanked him, as well as partisans in the audience, broke out in applause.
The news conference today, the first public lineup of so many newly elected governors, vividly demonstrated their political importance. Though the transition of power in the House and Senate has drawn much attention since the election, not since 1968 have Republicans controlled so many governors' offices.
Republicans became governors in eight of the nation's nine most populous states, states that have the most electoral votes and that will be crucial in the 1996 Presidential elections. The only big state that rebuffed the Republicans was Florida, where Gov. Lawton Chiles withstood a challenge from Jeb Bush.
Many of the governors who were re-elected earlier this month won in landslides, particularly in the industrial states along the Great Lakes. For that reason, the opinions of these governors, and their proposals for cutting taxes, add to their weight in the party.
In one manifestation of the importance, the meeting today was swarming with lobbyists who were angling to meet the chief executives-to-be and their aides.
Despite their talk of independence, several governors insisted that they could work well with the new Republican leaders in Congress. In an initial effort at keeping relations smooth, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and some colleagues met earlier today in Washington with Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is expected to become the next majority leader, Dole and other Senators.
"They're eager to cooperate with us," Mr. Thompson said. "And that is such a change of philosophy and common courtesy that we've been asking for so long. And it is really refreshing to go to Washington and have somebody come in and say, you know, they'll listen to us."
But the comments of the governors today amounted to a preview of the possible intraparty fissures among members of Congress and the governors. Many Republican governors said the midterm elections were a referendum on their successes at cutting taxes and bringing other innovations to states, not simply a reflection of approval of Mr. Gingrich and his "Contract With America," a list of 10 tax cutting and budget-balancing proposals by Republican candidates for House.
Even Mr. Thompson, who has initiated several welfare plans in his state, made plain that he had little tolerance for Mr. Gingrich's proposal, which would cut off benefits after two years, require recipients to work and prohibit benefits for mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
"Each of us in our own way have gone to Washington on bended knee, to kiss the ring, to get a waiver in order to do something," Mr. Thompson said. "All we're saying now is we don't want to have to go through the mating dance."
The governors were also adamant that they did not want Congress to be distracted by social issues like school prayer and abortion. Gov.-elect George W. Bush of Texas, for one, said he saw nothing wrong with organized prayer in schools, but he questioned whether it should be such a focus in Washington.
"I have no problem with a school prayer amendment so long as it is not mandate to our local Texas school districts," Mr. Bush said, "and each district school board gets to make that decision. My priority is for Texans to be running Texas. And I hope that that's the message that comes out of Congress. We're pretty good at what we do in Texas, and we like to be left alone by the Federal Government as much as possible."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, appearing this morning on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," said that an amendment legalizing organized prayer in schools was a poor idea and that Republicans should concentrate on economic issues.
"I hope that the legislature, that Congress understands that what got everyone elected this year was fiscal issues," she said, "that the people want to see less government, less taxing, less spending by the government and that's where we put our emphasis."
The remarks by the governors also seemed to reflect the early angling for possible candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a moderate on social issues who has been mentioned as a possible Republican Presidential contender, appeared on "Meet the Press" to position himself more to the right as he defended Mr. Wilson's support for a referendum in California that cuts off most government support for illegal immigrants. Mr. Wilson is also considered a possible nominee.
"Different states should be able to handle it their own way," Mr. Weld said. "If Texas wants to say, 'We're going to educate the children of illegal immigrants,' at least that's the choice of the state."
But on school prayer, his position was clear. "A moment of silence, fine," he said. "Mandatory prayer, no."

HEADLINE: Young Democrats Brace For Life Beyond the Hill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The worst part of the way things are going in Congress nowadays, said Regina Wood, is the way Republicans keep barging into her office to size it up.
"It's a little disturbing that they don't wait until we're out," said Ms. Wood, a 23-year-old staff assistant to the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, who was defeated by his Republican opponent after 32 years in Congress. "They're bidding for our office space." 
 As a result of the Republican landslide on Nov. 8, 37 incumbent Democratic members of Congress lost their jobs -- not to mention more than a thousand people in their offices and on committee staffs.
In one respect, young Democrats who find themselves unemployed have it relatively easy: They can seize on low-paying offers or jobs outside Washington that older victims of the elections cannot accept because of financial obligations or a reluctance to move their families.
While young Republicans arrive daily, lured to the nation's capital by job offers from the Republican National Committee or Republican consulting operations, the young Democrats whom they will replace -- like Ms. Wood -- are scrambling to find new jobs and are tightening their belts until they do.
As Republicans sample the views from their prospective Congressional offices, Democrats gaze upon a bleak job market, deal with their anger, fill out law school applications and grapple with what one young Democrat called "Republican arrogance."
Ms. Wood will send out her resumes to other offices on Capitol Hill, but she knows there are more young Democrats than entry-level jobs in a place that serves as a magnet for ambitious political cubs. Seeking opportunities in the opposite camp is almost never done.
"There's no question that this is a humbling experience," said Patrick Dorton, a former aide to two Democratic Congressman. "The elections were a very grounding experience for a Democrat who was flying high in 1992." At 26, Mr. Dorton is considered a veteran among younger staff aides, and he has frequently been sought out for advice since the elections.
Life without prospects on Capitol Hill is unnerving for a group of young staff members accustomed to walking with their heads held high, Mr. Dorton said.
"I feel angry more than envious," said a 26-year-old Democrat at the Department of Health and Human Services who requested anonymity. "I think it's really annoying, especially to people two years ago who were on top of the world."
She said that those who could afford or who were willing to take on additional educational loans, were using the opportunity to return to school.
"Almost every friend I have in Washington is leaving their political career and going to graduate school -- most to law school," she said. "After working in politics awhile, you're not ever going to go anywhere unless you have a concrete skill, and politics is such a hollow thing to build a career on."
But Greg Klein, who works for A. T. Kearney, a large management consulting company offered another suggestion. A young Democrat with a bachelor's degree and two to three years of experience on the Hill, Mr. Klein said, has the "makings of a nascent lobbyist."
And Robert Gray 3d, the 26-year-old press secretary for Representative Peter I. Blute, a Massachusetts Republican and former campaign aide for the Bush-Quayle campaign, says "juris doctor Democrats" may be turning tail too quickly.
"It would behoove the talented Democratic staffers who are considering leaving to stick around," he said, so that they can help their party try to re-elect the President.
Although Mr. Gray and Mr. Dorton differ politically, they remain best friends and roommates. "Most of the people here on the Hill are young people in their 20's first, and Republicans and Democrats second," said Mr. Gray, adding with a laugh, "I don't think I'm going to make Patrick do extra chores or anything like that."
But not everyone is up to the challenge of bipartisan friendship. "This is politics, and their ideas lost," said George Frondren, 25, executive director of the College Republican National Committee. "That's the bottom line. I don't feel bad for them."
For almost every departing Democrat, there's a young Republican who is arriving. Chris Wilson, the 26-year-old campaign manager for David McIntosh of Indiana, who was just elected to the House, said he never considered moving to the East Coast until now.
"For young Republicans, Washington will be viewed as a utopia," Mr. Wilson said.

HEADLINE: Takeover Of Kemper Is Dropped

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Unable to finance its proposed takeover of the Kemper Corporation and having seen its stock price plunge 27 percent since it made the offer, Conseco Inc. yesterday called off the $3.25 billion deal.
The move came after Citibank, the lead lender, indicated that it probably would not be able to finance even a lowered bid, one person close to the negotiations said. Rising interest rates had made the loans needed to complete the deal more expensive while depressing the value of Kemper's brokerage and mutual fund businesses. 
 Kemper made the deal with Conseco, an insurance company based in Carmel, Ind., while it was fighting a hostile offer from the General Electric Company. Yesterday's news now leaves it free to entertain offers from G.E. or anyone else. Since Conseco said on Nov. 2 that it wanted to lower its offer from $67 a share in cash and stock to $60, Kemper has received private expressions of interest from G.E., the Chubb Corporation and Sun America, one person at Kemper said.
It is not clear how much another party would be willing to pay, or whether any deal will occur. G.E. had originally offered $55 a share, and indicated a willingness to go to $60 before the Conseco bid appeared.
The dropping of the deal was announced in statements by the two companies; neither company's executives were willing to speak to reporters. The statements quoted Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chief executive, and David Mathis, Kemper's chief executive, as saying it had become clear to both parties that the transaction could not be completed.
Mr. Mathis said the board of Kemper, a financial services and insurance company in Long Grove, Ill., "remains committed to the goal of maximizing value for our shareholders and we plan to explore all possible alternatives as expeditiously as practicable."
Conseco's efforts to finance the deal were public and embarrassing. It said it might sell its stakes in one or more insurers it controls. That sent the prices of those companies up, only to fall after it became clear that no buyers were available at the prices Conseco sought.
Banks led by Citibank were to put up $1.22 billion in loans. But Citibank told Conseco that given the declining results at Kemper, it needed to get new commitments from the other banks and refused to guarantee success.
Another $750 million was to be raised by selling bonds through Morgan Stanley & Company. The brokerage firm had issued a letter saying it was highly confident it could sell the bonds. Morgan Stanley never withdrew the letter, but an inability to arrange other financing rendered the commitment moot.
Under terms of the cancellation, Conseco will get no money from Kemper even if it arranges another deal, both sides said.
Under the defunct deal, Kemper's life insurance operations were to be transferred to a Conseco-controlled partnership, Conseco Capital Partners II, while the brokerage and mutual fund businesses would have remained with Conseco. That meant that a big part of the bank financing had to be based on the mutual fund business, which has been hurt by withdrawals from Kemper's bond funds this year.
Kemper's stock has already fallen as it became clear first that Conseco was having trouble arranging financing and then that it would have to cut its offer to complete the deal. The shares closed at $48.625 on Friday, down 19 percent from the peak of $65 they reached on June 23, the day the Conseco bid was announced.
But the stock remains 19 percent above the share price of $40.875 it closed at on March 11, just before G.E. entered the fray. And its financial condition has worsened. Largely because of declining prices for the bonds it holds, Kemper said its book value on Sept. 30 was $29.21 a share, down from $38.24 at the end of 1993.
Mr. Mathis said Kemper's delayed annual meeting would be held on Dec. 23. At one time, G.E. had mounted a proxy fight for that meeting, but dropped that effort after Kemper agreed to put itself up for sale.
Conseco's share price had plunged amid fears that the Kemper acquisition would dilute Conseco profits. Mr. Hilbert denied that, saying cost savings and growth would make up the difference, but many on Wall Street were skeptical.
The dropping of the Kemper bid may thus help to push up Conseco stock, but the public fiasco could erode confidence in a management that had developed a substantial Wall Street following.

GRANDPARENTS IN THE AGE OF AIDS
As the AIDS epidemic rages, grandmothers across the nation are increasingly thrust into an old role with a new twist: they are caring for adult children dying of AIDS and for the grandchildren, in some cases also dying, who are left behind. Heterosexual AIDS infection jumped 130 percent from 1992 to 1993 (an increase due in part to a change in definition), and experts estimate that as many as 125,000 children will lose their mothers to AIDS by the year 2000. These children are increasingly left in the care of relatives, family friends and social agencies. 
 In 1992, there were 865,000 children under 18 being reared by their grandparents. Last year, that number jumped to more than one million, according to Census Bureau information analyzed by the American Association of Retired Persons. A1.

A MENTAL PATIENT KILLS ANOTHER
A man who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity 10 years ago walked out of a state psychiatric center in Brooklyn, then, after returning almost 12 hours later, stabbed a fellow patient to death, most likely with a knife obtained while roaming the city, the police said. The ease with which the patient, Daniel Alvarez, 48, escaped from the Kingsboro State Psychiatric Center and was able to smuggle a knife past officials raised new questions about the security and operation of the aging mental health center. B3.
 
JUDGING THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM
Since Mayor Giuliani's new initiative to combat domestic violence went into affect Aug. 15, the Police Department has made an average of about 300 arrests weekly in family violence cases -- a 15 percent increase over 1993. Advocates for victims of family violence have given Mayor Giuliani high marks for effort for the program, but say the program has gotten off to a slow start in some 76 precincts. B3.
 
MAN CHARGED IN PLOT TO KILL OFFICIAL
A 33-year-old convicted killer has been arraigned on charges that he conspired to assassinate District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens, an assistant prosecutor and the judge who handed him a life sentence. The charges say that the suspect, Armando Hernandez, put out a $50,000 contract on the three officials. The judge was identified as David Goldstein of State Supreme Court in Queens, but officials would not release the name of the assistant district attorney. B3.
 
BICKERING AMONG G.O.P. COUNCIL MEMBERS
For a while, they seemed a fairly merry little band of legislators. But through a combination of smoldering animosities and fallout from other political feuds, the seven Republicans on the City Council are showing that Mayor Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki are not alone in the bickering within their party. B7.
 
3 CORRECTION OFFICERS SUSPENDED
As sporadic food and work strikes by inmates at Rikers Island continued, three correction officers were suspended after refusing to fill in for striking inmates assigned to the food service detail, a Department of Correction spokesman said. B3.

PATAKI MAKES A DEBUT
A year ago, when the Republican Governors' Association met in Phoenix, it was Christine Todd Whitman's show, a coming-out party for a new political star who had toppled a Democratic incumbent by promising deep cuts in state income taxes. This year, Governor-elect Pataki of New York is just a face in the crowd at this year's meeting. B7.
 
TRIMMING NEW YORK'S MEDICAID SYSTEM
There is no debate about it. New York's Medicaid system, the kudzu of health care programs, needs pruning. It is one of the most expensive and expansive Medicaid programs in the country, and Governor-elect Pataki has pledged to cut it. But how? Metro Matters, B7.
 
N.J. TRANSIT SEEKS 4 NEW RAIL LINES
Economic and environmental concerns may put electric trains back on four suburban routes being considered by New Jersey Transit. The lines would extend north and west into Paterson, West Orange, Summit and Plainfield from a proposed rail line linking Elizabeth and Newark. The entire system would connect to the Newark Airport monorail, now under construction. B7.

In the Free Market, Vietnam's Poor Pay a Price

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAM LO, Vietnam

 BODY:
In the poorest part of the poorest part of the country, all the talk about Vietnam as Asia's newest economic power is a distant whisper.
The rice farmers who tend the arid, gritty soil along Vietnam's central coast say they are thankful that their crops can fetch higher prices in newly free markets. But the land here in Quang Tri Province is so unproductive that even when prices go up the effect for most farmers can be measured in pennies. 
 Among the 400,000 people of the province, many farming families earn less than $200 a year. And in some years, when the land is washed over by salt water that floods in from the South China Sea, there is no crop at all.
"I have seen pictures of Hanoi and the other big cities, and I think they must be like paradise, like a dream," said Ho Thi Dong, a 40-year-old laborer, her sun-leathered face framed by a conical bamboo hat and a frayed yellow ribbon loosely tied around her neck. "But here in the country, I think life is more difficult than before. The Government cannot help us as before."
As the Vietnamese Government abandons Communism to make way for the free market, the services that millions of Vietnamese had come to depend on are crumbling.
In Government schools across Vietnam, students are suddenly being asked to pay for their books and, in some cases, for classes. Those who cannot afford them are being pulled out of school by their parents.
Vietnam's health care system, once fully financed by the Government and considered a model for the developing world, is giving way to a private system that requires patients to pay for medicine and a doctor's care.
For farmers, there is no longer the promise that in years of flooding or drought the Government will step in to help them survive by providing seed and fertilizer.
The loss of Government services is one thing in a place like Hanoi, the capital, or Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. Under a free market and with billions of dollars in new foreign investment, Vietnam's cities are booming, and most of this nation's city-dwellers have never lived so well.
But the new economic system means something else in a place like Quang Tri Province, where the people are about as poor as any on earth, where few foreign investors come to visit, and where the opportunities of the free market can easily be swept away by flood or drought.
The Government began to cut off free services four years ago, directing some of the money to projects like roads and electricity lines, which are desperately needed to attract foreign investors.
"It's logical for people to pay something for medicine and education in a market economy," said Do Duc Dinh, a Government economist who is deputy editor of The Vietnam Economic Review. "In the cities, this has been no problem. The problem is with the 10 percent of the population that still cannot afford these services."
In the scrublands of Quang Tri Province, Mrs. Dong, the laborer, surely falls into that second category. Abandoned years ago by her husband, she supports two children on an income of about $12 a month, typical in the province.
One recent morning she was being paid by the local forestry department to lug two heavy baskets full of tree seedlings, the baskets tied to the ends of a bamboo stick that dug deep into her shoulder as she walked. The seedlings, she said, would be planted on hillsides in hopes that when grown they will form a windbreak against the hot, dry eastern gusts that parch the farmland each year.
Mrs. Dong lifted the pole from her shoulder and sat down to rest. She gently rubbed her stomach, which has troubled her for years.
"I have trouble keeping food down," she said. "In the old system, I could go to the doctor and get the stomach medicine for free. Now, I must pay for the medicine myself."
Because of the illness, Mrs. Dong's life has been reduced to a month-by-month calculation: Can she find the $2 to buy stomach medicine and an extra $2 for vitamin tonic for her ailing 6-year-old daughter? "Sometimes I cannot afford the medicine for either of us," she said.
A few miles down the road at the Quang Tri Provincial Hospital, Dr. Phan Huu Tai, a surgeon and the hospital's director, took a visitor on a tour of the dank operating room, pointing to the rusting 20-year-old anesthesia equipment and, on the moldy wall, an ancient air-conditioner that barely worked. "Sometimes in the terrible heat of the summer, the electricity will die, and we must operate by flashlight," he said.
There is no money for renovations, he said. The central Government's contribution to the 300-bed hospital has been cut by about one-third since 1990, to about $90,000 a year, and his own salary has dropped to $50 a month.
"The idea is that the patients can pay us to make up the difference," Dr. Tai said. "I think what is happening instead is that when some patients become sick, they just do not go to the hospital anymore."

HEADLINE: Extended Family Of Immigrants Mourns Victims Of Van Accident

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Balbir Singh's family left the Indian state of Punjab in the kind of serial migration that has been an article of faith for immigrants to the United States for more than a century. First came his brother-in-law, then his sister and her son, and then, in 1989, Mr. Singh.
Looking for economic opportunity and an escape from the civil strife in Punjab, they settled together in Flushing, Queens, and became part of the Sikh community whose life revolves around a temple in the Richmond Hill neighborhood. Mr. Singh delivered newspapers until two years ago, when his sister, Kulwant Singh, got him a job at the National Wholesale Liquidators Store where she worked, in Bethpage, L.I. He quickly rose to assistant manager, and frequently drove a company-owned van in which other store employees who lived in Queens rode to work in a car pool. 
 On Saturday morning, at age 31, Balbir Singh died behind the wheel of that 1987 Ford Club Wagon van, in an accident that also claimed the lives of two of his co-workers and injured 13 others. All of the victims were from India or Pakistan and most were, like Mr. Singh, from Punjab, which for years has been riven by conflict between Sikhs and Hindus.
One victim, who died at Mary Immaculate Hospital, was identified yesterday by a hospital spokesman as Surinderpal Madhar, and the Chief Medical Examiner's Office identified the third as Iqbal Singh, 23. It was not clear yesterday whether Iqbal Singh was related to Balbir Singh, but Singh, which means lion, is part of the name of many Sikhs.
At the Gurdwara Sikh Temple in Richmond Hill, Sukhbir Singh, a temple spokesman, said yesterday that nearly all of the 16 people who were in the van were members of the tight-knit temple. "They work six days a week and come to temple every Sunday," he said. "Every time we do anything for our community, they help. We belong to each other."
Iqbal Singh and Surinderpal Madhar often worked in the temple kitchen, cooking meals for newly arrived Punjabis, and donated money to the temple, he said.
He said that three Rajijathain, high priests from the Golden Temple in Punjab, the heart of the Sikh religion, were on their way to Queens for a memorial service to be held at the Richmond Hill temple today at 10 A.M. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion that blends elements of Islam and Hinduism. Its male adherents traditionally wear turbans and ceremonial swords, and many serve in the Indian military.
One of the injured, Jaqir Singh, 30, was a farmer in Punjab until he emigrated in 1985. He lives in an apartment in Jamaica, Queens, with several other young Sikh men. A friend, Parmjit Singh, said Jaqir Singh's goal was "to save money, bring his wife and family here and have everybody together."
His wife is on her way to the United States, but rather than embarking on a hopeful new life, she will be going to her husband's bedside at Jamaica Hospital, where he is in critical condition with severe head wounds.
Many of the victims got their jobs through a network that has been a hallmark of Indian immigrants, producing concentrations in such businesses as gas stations and truck companies.
Neil Rosen, vice president of National Wholesale Liquidators, based in West Hempstead, L.I., said that when the first of the chain's 12 discount stores opened in 1984, one of the first people hired was a Punjabi man. "He brought in his cousins, his brothers, everyone," he said. "It seems there are always people from the Indian subcontinent coming in, looking for work, and they seem to bring each other in."
Balbir Singh, who was single, found a home of sorts at the store, where nearly all the employees are from India. "He loved his job, all the workers, all the employees," said Kulwant Singh, who no longer works at the store. "He was a very hard worker."
Balbir Singh helped his nephew, Sundeep Singh, 18, a student at Aviation High School, get a part-time job there, and the teen-ager was in the van when it crashed. He suffered head injuries. Yesterday, at Long Island Jewish Hospital, Sundeep Singh, in a daze, a purple bruise covering much of his face, leaned his head against his mother's shoulder as she wept for her dead brother.
At the National Wholesale Liquidators store in Bethpage, in a strip mall across the street from a former Grumman plant, stunned employees yesterday went numbly through the routine of arranging displays of plastic Santas and boxes of cookware.
Mr. Rosen said the employees were distraught when the store opened yesterday morning. "So I closed the doors, and brought them all together and told them that we're family, and everybody had tears in their eyes, including me," he said. "These people are not of my same hemisphere or my religion, but you work with people for years, and it's family."

HEADLINE: Apple Lawyer Will Become New Director Of Gay Group

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The nation's largest gay political organization has reached into the corporate world for an executive director to guide it through what promises to be a tumultuous period in the gay-rights movement.
Elizabeth Birch, the 38-year-old chief litigator at Apple Computer Inc., is to be named today as executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an organization that is based in Washington and claims more than 80,000 members. The fund fights discrimination against homosexuals through organizing, lobbying and financial support for political candidates. 
 "I'm not naive," Ms. Birch said yesterday. "I understand it will be enormously challenging. But I continue to be optimistic, as someone who comes from outside Washington, that there is a wonderful trend going on in America.
"Even in the midst of the largest Republican sweep in 20 years, America has simply refused to institutionalize discrimination," she said, referring to the defeat of referendums in Oregon and Idaho seeking to abolish gay-rights measures.
Ms. Birch was involved in the battle last year between Apple and Williamson County, a suburban county north of Austin, Tex. The county commissioners balked at giving the company a tax abatement on the construction of an $80 million office complex because Apple offered benefits to the partners of gay employees. But after Apple said that as a matter of principle and economics it would not build without the breaks, the county awarded financial incentives for the project.
Ms. Birch lives in Boulder Creek, Calif., near Santa Cruz. She was co-chairwoman of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1992 until this year. She joined Apple in 1989 and has served as general counsel of the Claris Corporation, its software subsidiary.
The campaign fund spent four months looking for a successor to Tim McFeeley. Jean Harris, a special assistant to San Francisco's public health director, applied for the job but told the search committee that they ought to choose Ms. Birch. "She's a tough cookie," Ms. Harris said. "She's got a corporate image, brains and the ability to take the risks that need to be taken."
John Laird, a former mayor of Santa Cruz, Calif., has worked with Ms. Birch on gay causes for almost a decade. "She can walk into a room and immediately connect with people from the corporate world," he said. "But that's not to take away from her street-level activities, which have also been good."

HEADLINE: Keeping in Touch With the Victims of Domestic Violence

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
A son hit his 65-year-old father with a shovel, leaving deep cuts on his left hand. A young man got into an argument with his live-in girlfriend over their sex life and the argument escalated so furiously that she called 911 out of fear he would beat her. A man burned his common-law wife's face with a cigarette during a fight.
These brief descriptions of some of the 16 domestic incident reports that Police Officer James O'Donnell reviewed last Monday morning gave only a glimpse of the violence that went on behind closed doors last weekend in the 120th Precinct on the northern part of Staten Island. 
 But they led Officer O'Donnell and a detective he works with to open investigations into the cases and make follow-up visits to offer counseling and legal advice to the victims.
The domestic incident reports, which are separated from other 911 emergency complaint reports so they receive special attention, are part of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new initiative to combat domestic violence. The core of the plan is to record and track all such complaints and give higher priority to collecting evidence in such cases.
Under the plan, at least one patrol officer and one detective in every precinct have been assigned to try to prevent family disputes from escalating into serious violence. The initiative also requires officers to make arrests if such violence does occur.
"We get a small victory every day," said Officer O'Donnell, "getting a case opened for a possible arrest, getting the people to go to court for an order of protection, just getting the women to call me to help out."
Since the program went into effect Aug. 15, the police have has made an average of about 300 arrests weekly in family violence cases -- a 15 percent increase over 1993 figures. In theory, the increase in arrests should deter future offenses and reduce the number of children exposed to violence at home -- a condition criminologists say often turns children into violent adults.
Advocates for victims of family violence have given Mayor Giuliani high marks for effort, but they say the program has got off to a slow start in some of the city's 76 precincts. They say the increase in arrests is below what it should be, given that it comes as emergency calls have increased substantially due in large part to the publicity surrounding the O. J. Simpson case.
"The principles are right on target, but implementation has a long way to go," said Dorchen Leidholdt, director of the Center for Battered Women's Legal Services, a private group offering legal representation to victims throughout the metropolitan area. "Giuliani's mandatory arrest policy is a step forward."
Part of the problem, the advocates say, is the department's shortage of computers for filing complaints. But they also note that domestic violence officers receive only one day of special training and that the regular patrol officers who respond to the 911 calls may lack the sensitivity to handle such cases and do not always follow orders and make arrests.
Capt. Joseph A. Lehan, the commanding officer of the 120th Precinct, acknowledged the problems, saying the policy "is still in its embryonic stage." But he said, "It's not like the old days when the radio car came to the scene of a dispute and what was acceptable was to tell the husband to take a walk and cool off."
A number of other cities have installed similar programs in recent years, but because few resources have been devoted to them, results have been mixed.
New York's program has proven more effective in the 120th Precinct than in many others in the city, in part because it is one of 12 where officers work in tandem with a social worker employed by Victims Services, a private nonprofit agency.
Last week, Officer O'Donnell and Marile Adams, a fellow domestic violence officer, took their daily drive through Staten Island's neighborhoods -- going from areas of graceful Victorian-style homes to graffiti-marked public projects to follow up with people who had lodged domestic violence complaints.
The tour demonstrated both how family violence crosses class lines and the difficulty of the task the officers face. At one home, nobody answered the door bell. At the home of a woman who said her husband had beaten her, the officers could not get past the door because a female friend said the woman was asleep. The police left some literature on domestic violence.
Frustration followed frustration until the group arrived at the West Brighton home of an unemployed 24-year-old woman who was trying to start a new life after her husband was sent to jail on a gun charge two months ago -- an arrest that followed the woman's complaints that he beat their 2-year-old child. The woman was home and gladly let the officers in.
The officers wanted to know if she needed any help in relocating to a new home. She listened carefully to her visitors' advice on how to make sure that her estranged husband does not find her once she moves.
"You may want to put this behind you," Officer Adams said. "But if you leave the precinct, I can let the domestic violence officer in the next precinct know, so we can keep track of you and help if we are needed."
The woman thanked them for the advice, and expressed surprise about all the attention she was suddenly getting. "Before this incident came down," she said, "when I called the police before they didn't do anything."

A Discount Megastore Wins Friends and Influences Rivals

SERIES: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town -- A retail giant and a community's economy: last article of a series

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENPORT, N.Y.

 BODY:
When Wal-Mart opened a huge discount department store in Columbia County last spring, no one tried harder than Pamela Taylor-Farrell to warn mom-and-pop businesses that their survival was at stake.
But nearly eight months later, Ms. Taylor-Farrell, the former president of the downtown merchants association, has been won over by the other side: Now a self-described "Wal-Mart groupie," she roams the gleaming aisles of the store after work on each payday. 
 She has stocked up on Suave hair spray and Revlon cosmetics. She has bought hand weights, an aerobic step and an exercise slide. And after shedding 82 pounds in recent months, she has sought out Wal-Mart to rebuild her wardrobe, snatching up L'Eggs thigh-high stockings, bras and black stirrup pants.
"I took a hard line against them and felt I fought a good fight," said Ms. Taylor-Farrell, the advertising manager of a local newspaper. "There's just too many damn attractive things. And they're at a reasonable price."
Like countless other places across the country, Greenport and the neighboring city of Hudson have seen long-time shopping patterns upset by the arrival of the nation's largest retailer. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of cars lined Wal-Mart's spacious parking lot, while only a few people strolled along the cobblestone sidewalks of Warren Street, Hudson's main thoroughfare and the shopping district closest to the new store.
It is difficult to assess the sales performance of the new store, because the Arkansas-based chain is notoriously secretive. But a manager at the Greenport Wal-Mart said the sporting goods department alone, fueled by brisk sales of hunting rifles, would exceed $1 million in business before the end of November.
And sports is only one of the store's 23 departments, many of which compete directly with several dozen Warren Street establishments, including Town Fair, a 44-year-old toy store; Airhead Balloons/Hudson Flower Market, a gift shop, and the J. C. Rogerson Company hardware store, which has anchored downtown Hudson since 1832.
As the merchants of Warren Street enter their first Christmas shopping season since Wal-Mart came to town, many say that Wal-Mart has bitten hard into their customer base, which had already been eroded by shopping malls in the Albany area. No one has gone out of business, but there are rumors that several shops are on the brink.
Some merchants are responding to Wal-Mart's arrival by slashing prices, others are increasing their advertising budgets and at least one, Rogerson's hardware, has installed a computer atop its 19th-century checkout counter to make its inventory control more sophisticated.
For the most part, each is acting alone. Despite studies showing that a Main Street must present a united front to survive Wal-Mart, the merchants of Warren Street have been unable to agree on a strategy. In June, their bickering led to the quiet dissolution of their long-time merchants association, the Society to Promote Our Unique Town (S.P.O.U.T.), of which Ms. Taylor-Farrell was president.
"Of course I feel guilty," said Ms. Taylor-Farrell, who used to shop Warren Street every week but now does little more than get her hair styled at Lisa Marie's Beauty Shop. "But like everyone else, I have to stretch my dollar."
Although uneasiness lingers on Warren Street, the new Wal-Mart has raised spirits elsewhere. County officials say they are thrilled with a 6 percent increase in sales tax revenues in the third quarter, attributable largely to Wal-Mart. Consumers from as far north as Schoharie County and as far south as Dutchess County say they are glad to have a new shopping option within a one-hour drive. And numerous Wal-Mart workers, many of them unemployed earlier this year, say they are fortunate to be working at the store, even if the starting salary is only about $220 a week.
For Don Michalek, 25, a former Navy petty officer who had been out of work for over a year, being hired as the manager of Wal-Mart's sporting goods department gave him and his wife the financial security to have a second child. Two months after the store's March 30 grand opening, Mr. Michalek's wife learned she was pregnant.
"Without the job," said Mr. Michalek, one of 250 full- and part-time workers, "it would have been 'No way!' "
For decades, Wal-Mart has been a retail force in small towns across the West and Middle West. But the discount retailer was virtually unknown in the Northeast until three years ago. Since then, the company has opened 35 Wal-Mart's in New York, 10 in New Jersey and 4 in Connecticut. By early 1996, the company plans to have 71 stores in the three states.
Wal-Mart -- which has 2,102 stores nationally -- transcends other discount merchandisers by offering generally lower prices, sugary-sweet service (the Greenport store, like every other Wal-Mart, has a greeter at its front door) and a state-of-the-art distribution network, analysts say.
Joan Koweek, whose parents founded the Town Fair toy store on Warren Street in 1950, has already learned that Wal-Mart can be a formidable foe, dropping prices on select items to near cost as a way to lure consumers. For example, Ms. Koweek discovered that the Exersaucer -- a baby walker that she was selling in the mid-$50 range -- was being sold at Wal-Mart in the low $40's. She quickly lowered her price, as well as the prices of a number of other toys, including Bed-Time Barbie (reduced to $12.99 from $16.88) and a child-size car from Little Tikes (reduced to $34.95, including a company rebate, from $49.95).
After noticing a drop in traffic on Warren Street immediately after Wal-Mart opened, Ms. Koweek said customers had recently begun to return. Since her store traditionally does 40 percent of its annual business in November and December, she is taking no chances, buying additional billboard space and adding a new line of educational toys that Wal-Mart does not carry.
"It'll be an interesting Christmas," Ms. Koweek said, the store's original hardwood floor creaking beneath her. "I'm looking forward to the challenge."
Dennis McEvoy, one of the owners of Rogerson's hardware, has tried to keep Wal-Mart in perspective. In June, Mr. McEvoy's father, John -- a fixture in the store for 55 years -- died at 68 after battling a stroke and then liver cancer.
The younger Mr. McEvoy, a graduate of Brooklyn Law School, has embraced his father's role with gusto, identifying the voices of most customers on the phone before they say their names, just like his dad did. With Wal-Mart's sizable hardware department just two miles away, Mr. McEvoy has taken steps to modernize the 162-year-old store: his front window now displays the seasonal promotions of a national hardware wholesaler; he sets prices on new items with an eye on his new competitor and he is carrying a Mikita 1/2-inch cordless drill that he never stocked before.
"We're trying to get a little bit more aggressive," Mr. McEvoy said.
Other stores that do not compete directly with Wal-Mart have found they have flourished in the giant's shadow. Berman's Furniture, which is a few hundred yards south of Wal-Mart on Route 9, has seen its business increase 30 percent, thanks to Wal-Mart customers who stop by on their way home.
And revenues at Sweeps, a Warren Street shop that sells and services vacuum cleaners, are up 15 percent. That's because the owner, Jeff Bagnall, lined up informal service agreements on virtually every major brand of lawn mower, snow blower and vacuum that Wal-Mart sells.
"Every day," Mr. Bagnall said, "I thank God I'm in the repair business."
But Wal-Mart -- with a selling floor as big as two football fields -- is not for everyone. Eunice Nabozny, stopping by Sweeps on a recent afternoon to pick up a belt for her Hoover vacuum, said she much preferred the 200-year-old brick storefronts of Hudson to the hustle and bustle of Wal-Mart.
"I guess I'm getting old," said Mrs. Nabozny, her 4-year-old grandson Christopher in tow. "I like family-type stores, the personal touch of the little guy."
Surprisingly, sometimes so does Wal-Mart.
Earlier this year, the Wal-Mart managers were scrambling to replace the frayed American flag that waves from the store roof and is central to the chain's image. They eventually found it at Rogerson's hardware, for $60.89.
"I think the old man is smiling down on that one," Mr. McEvoy said.
 
 
 
THE SERIES SO FAR
 The most recent article of this series on Wal-Mart's arrival near Hudson, N.Y., appeared on March 31. It described the store's opening day. An article on Jan. 24 examined the hopes and prospects of job-seekers and the store's interview process. The first article, on Nov. 28, 1993, looked at the effect Wal-Mart was expected to have on businesses along Hudson's main thoroughfare, Warren Street.

HEADLINE: At Conference Of Governors, Pataki Makes A Quiet Debut

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Nov. 20

 BODY:
A year ago, when the Republican Governors' Association met in Phoenix, it was Christine Todd Whitman's show, a coming-out party for a new political star who had toppled a Democratic incumbent by promising deep cuts in state income taxes.
This year, Governor-elect George E. Pataki of New York used a similar playbook to unseat perhaps the most prominent governor in the country. But he is just a face in the crowd at this year's meeting, just one of 11 Republicans about to take over statehouses that were previously Democratic or independent. 
 And despite his campaign assertion that "I want to be Christie Whitman," at least when it comes to cutting taxes, Mr. Pataki seems to have little interest in captivating the conference with his debut. Mrs. Whitman, whose victory in New Jersey made her one of only two new Republican governors elected in 1993, stayed for three days last year, delivered a speech and spoke frequently to reporters. Mr. Pataki is staying for less than 20 hours, spending most of it behind closed doors and then leaving for a family vacation, the second since he was elected 12 days ago.
Mrs. Whitman is staying until the meeting ends on Tuesday, according to her aides, and Governor-elect John G. Rowland of Connecticut plans to join the group on Monday, according to conference officials.
Mr. Pataki said today that he felt it was more important to spend the next week focusing on his transition, even though he will be doing it from an undisclosed vacation spot out of New York. But the decision also seems to reflect the emerging style of a leader who has made few public appearances since his election and has rejected numerous chances to grab the national spotlight, including network television interviews.
Few of Mr. Pataki's colleagues here had met him before (he did not attend a school for new governors in West Virginia this weekend sponsored by the National Governors' Association). But his reputation as a Cuomo slayer preceded him.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who won a second term this month, said Mr. Pataki had "sort of folk hero status already."
Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said Republican leaders took "special pride" in Mr. Pataki's defeat of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. "Old Mario had sort of burnt out, hadn't he?" Mr. Fordice said.
Though Mr. Pataki's early departure means he will miss speeches by the incoming leaders of the House and the Senate, Representative Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the Governor-elect acknowledged that he needs an education on Federal issues affecting New York.
"One of the reasons that I'm here is because I haven't looked at the Federal issues in the past and I want to take a look," he said.
At times while discussing state-Federal relations today, Mr. Pataki sounded strangely like Mr. Cuomo. He said he favored a Federal balanced budget amendment, but, like Mr. Cuomo, he said Washington must not solve its fiscal problems by passing obligations on to the states. And he pledged that his proposal to cut state income taxes by 25 percent over four years would not force local governments to raise their taxes.
"I don't think it helps in Washington if they balance the budget in Washington by shifting the costs and the taxes to state government," he said at a news conference with other governors. "So I think we are all pretty much in agreement that we want to see the Federal Government pass a balanced-budget amendment but do it in such a way that controls your costs and doesn't just shift your costs."
He added in an interview: "Part of the reason we're in the economic straits we're in right now is because the Federal Government has not imposed the discipline it should have and is passing costs of past programs to future generations."
He refused to say where he would spend the next week, saying only that it was out of New York and that he would return next weekend.
"My last vacation, which was a weekend and a Friday, I probably spent 40 hours on transition matters," Mr. Pataki said. "It was more a physical distancing than a stopping of the process of transition. And that's the same this time. I'll be physically with the kids and Libby out of New York State, but we will be working every day, many, many hours on transition."

HEADLINE: Review Set Of Nasdaq's Operations

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq stock market, under mounting pressure from antitrust regulators, litigious investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced yesterday that it had appointed a seven-member committee, headed by former Senator Warren Rudman, to review its governance and operations.
The committee includes Peter S. Lynch, the former manager of the Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund and an author of books and articles on investment strategies, and two former S.E.C. commissioners, Irving M. Pollack and A. A. Sommers Jr. 
 The announcement comes a month after the Justice Department announced that it was investigating Nasdaq dealers for possible antitrust violations and to determine whether bids were rigged on stocks to keep the spreads high. The department has not made a direct target of Nasdaq, a network of securities dealers linked by computer and phone.
Mr. Rudman said he agreed to head the committee on Wednesday, after being asked by Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Joseph Hardiman, the president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the Washington trade group that runs Nasdaq.
An industry executive involved in the selection process said Mr. Levitt had persuaded Mr. Rudman to serve and had worked closely with Nasdaq executives in choosing the other panel members.
"I feel very enthusiastic about the choice of the panel members, and I wanted the committee to be headed by someone with impeccable credentials for probity and integrity," said Mr. Levitt, who declined in a telephone interview to comment on his involvement in the panel's selection process. Mr. Levitt added that the caliber of the panel members "will in my view reinforce public confidence in the over-the-counter market."
The panel, to be called the Select Committee, was named by the board of governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers. The purpose of the committee will be "to review all of the operations of Nasdaq, its governance, its regulatory role, and how it treats large and small investors," Mr. Rudman said.
Professor Marshall E. Blume of the Wharton School described the committee as "a very high-level group of people, in their integrity and knowledge of the regulatory process," adding: "But they don't have a good financial economist in that group, and they could use a high-level person from a corporate entity that raises capital through Nasdaq-type listings, since ultimately that's what these markets are about."
A. Jared Silverman, chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, said the panel "is heavy on Federal regulators, but a lot of the complaints come in on the lower end of the market from investors, through the states."
In an interview, Mr. Hardiman said Nasdaq would have "important announcements" about changes in its market structure today or tomorrow. He declined to describe them, but an industry executive with knowledge of the announcement said Nasdaq planned to expand its limit-order protections to investors, in orders up to 1,000 shares between Jan. 1 and June 1. After that, he said, there would be no limit on the level of protection.
Under pressure from Mr. Levitt, Nasdaq proposed a rule to let many small buy orders be executed at the lower bid price rather than the higher asked price, if customers put in what is called a limit order. The S.E.C. has indicated that it wants to expand that rule, and Nasdaq appears to have complied.
Several class-action law suits have questioned the fairness of the Nasdaq market, and some investors have long awaited a change in the governance of the board, which is weighted toward industry members, to include more public members. Others have lobbied for stronger enforcement procedures and better disciplinary oversight.
Mr. Hardiman said the new committee's purview would not include issues that are the subject of litigation against Nasdaq market makers or are the subject of the Justice Department inquiry, because "there should be no interference with the Justice inquiry or civil litigation."
But Mr. Silverman, the New Jersey regulator, disagreed. "If you're doing a top-to-bottom study, you should be looking at all aspects of Nasdaq," he said, adding: "By roping off the antitrust area, you're not looking at the questions raised about the spreads, the small-order execution system, and questions about the problem brokers. And those are some of the key issues."
Mr. Rudman, although he has no direct experience with market trading, served for six years as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which supervises the S.E.C., and is a former attorney general in New Hampshire, where he prosecuted investor-fraud cases.
His committee "will look at that area, to see if the operations are carried out with fairness," he said, adding, "But we won't look at it through the same glass that the Department of Justice is looking at it."
He retired from the United States Senate in 1992, and is now a partner at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Mr. Lynch, now a member of the board of trustees of the Fidelity group of funds, is the author of "Beating the Street," a book on investment strategies for small investors. Under Mr. Lynch, the Magellan Fund invested heavily in Nasdaq stocks.
Mr. Pollack, a former S.E.C. commissioner involved in the deregulation of the securities market, is now special counsel to the law firm of Storch & Brenner. Mr. Sommers, also a former S.E.C. commissioner, is chairman of the Public Oversight Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The other committee members are Stephen L. Hammerman, vice chairman and general counsel of Merrill Lynch & Company and a former chairman of the N.A.S.D. board; Jean W. Gleason, a longtime securities lawyer who is a partner in the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski and former director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, and Robert H. Mundheim, general counsel to Salomon Inc. and its Salomon Brothers subsidiary and former general counsel to the United States Treasury Department.
Mr. Hardiman's target for completion of the study is the end of March.
"I don't see that they will be able to do any new research in that time limit," Professor Blume said, "since realistically the first draft would have to be completed by the end of February."
Mr. Rudman said that the committee's work could be done by early spring, "since I'm not interested in dragging this out," adding, "But if that doesn't give us enough time, then we won't have it in by then."
Mr. Hardiman said he "doubted" that penny-stock frauds would be looked at by the committee, "since that issue is in hand." He added that although the committee is free to look at listing standards, "our standards exceed those of the American Stock Exchange."
However, Mr. Silverman commented, "There are stocks on exchanges listed that are sold with the same techniques that we found objectionable in the case of penny stocks." He added, "We think that's an area that needs to be looked at because it goes to the question of sales practices."
Mr. Rudman said he did not want to name specific areas the committee would investigate, "since we're going to meet and ask many people about what specific issues should be addressed."

HEADLINE: Melvin Eggers, 78, Syracuse University Chancellor

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Melvin A. Eggers, the chancellor of Syracuse University from 1971 to 1991, died yesterday at his home in DeWitt, a suburb of Syracuse. He was 78.
He had a long illness, said John Harvith, a spokesman for the university. 
 Dr. Eggers, who retired in August 1991, was the ninth chancellor at Syracuse, and also held the title of President. He was succeeded as chancellor by Kenneth A. Shaw, who said yesterday, "He has left this institution with a legacy for excellence."
And Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said "As one of my teachers and later as a colleague, Melvin Eggers set a standard for excellence that has helped me both as a professional and as a person."
Dr. Eggers is widely seen as having strengthened Syracuse academically. In the 1980's, while the university upgraded many of its academic programs, its enrollment flourished, 10 new buildings were opened, and its basketball and football teams became national powerhouses.
New construction in Dr. Eggers's era included the Carrier Dome, a 50,000-seat indoor sports complex that was built with the state's help.
But as time passed, the university suffered as the number of high school graduates declined and college costs rose steadily. The school also faced growing competition from the State University of New York.
By October 1991, Syracuse had lost about 1,700 undergraduates in two years. That loss was the primary cause of a $9.5 million budget deficit for the fiscal years 1990 through 1992. By October 1991, undergraduate enrollment was about 11,500 students.
At the time, Thonmas F. Cummings Jr., vice president for enrollment management and continuing education at Syracuse, said enrollments at Syracuse and at many other private colleges and universities where tuition had rapidly increased were being hurt by a recession-induced pinch on family incomes as well as stiffer competition among educational institutions for the fewer students then available.
Dr. Eggers was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in econmics from Indiana University in 1940 and 1941, respectively. He received a Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1950.
During the academic career that then unfolded, he co-wrote several books and articles on economics. He joined the Syracuse faculty in 1950 as an assistant professor of economics and rose to be chairman of the economics department before being appointed provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.
Dr. Eggers is survived by his wife, the former Mildred Chenoweth, a brother, Oscar, of Prairie Village, Kan.; a daughter, Nancy Beilstein of Tustin, Calif; two sons, William of Pittsford, N.Y., and Richard of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Why Neil Simon Decided to Turn His Back on Broadway

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
In his still-definitive 1969 book about the Broadway theater, "The Season," William Goldman predicted that virtually all straight plays would soon be Off Broadway. The reason, he argued, was simple: the high costs "make doing anything but mass appeal plays a lunatic Broadway venture."
There is no playwright with more mass appeal than Neil Simon, and it has taken 25 years for the prediction to come true for him. But America's richest, best-known playwright is hunting for a 500-seat Off Broadway theater for his newest comedy, "London Suite." 
 That news was followed by a second thrust through Broadway's doublet: "Angels in America," the Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play that became one of the theatrical events of the decade, will close next month at a loss of $660,000.
How could this happen?
The answer is basic economics. While big musicals are raking in record amounts on Broadway -- "Showboat" is selling more than $900,000 worth of tickets a week and "Sunset Boulevard" is opening with a $37 million advance -- the returns on plays are so meager and unpredictable that Off Broadway is not only a hedge against disaster, but a good bet for making money.
Taking that bet, Mr. Simon's producer, Emanuel Azenberg, agreed to open his calculations to scrutiny. By his reckoning, he would have to raise $1.6 million to mount the show on Broadway, but only $660,000 to do it Off Broadway. With the lower operating costs, he said, the numbers add up: "Off Broadway, 400 seats at $40 makes me a smash. On Broadway, 400 seats at $55 closes me down. You tell me -- what makes sense?"
Off Broadway, in fact, has become so attractive that the biggest brake on producers is that there are so few comfortable, convenient theaters.
Audiences are willing to buy $40 tickets. Labor is nonunion. Shows that do well can still earn the "they loved it in New York" label needed to go to London and on tour. And while it takes a smash hit to make money on Broadway, Off Broadway a critics' darling, a snob special or a merely popular comedy can turn a profit.
Even though a 500-seat Off Broadway house can sell only $160,000 worth of tickets a week while a 1,000-seat Broadway house can theoreticaly sell over $400,000 worth, the smaller venue's running costs are so much lower that the profit margin is greater.
There are many equations in a production budget, but the crucial one running through the producer's mind is: If we don't flop, how soon do we turn a profit?
"In the old days -- up to 1970 or '75 -- you could do 100 performances of a comedy and recoup with a healthy profit," said Frederick M. Zollo, who produces plays on and off Broadway, "Angels" among them. "Not any more."
Most shows have eight performances a week, so 20 years ago, by Mr. Zollo's calculations, they would earn profits shortly after 12 weeks. Today, if a Broadway play costs $1 million to mount -- and that's dirt cheap -- and ends each week $50,000 to the good, it "earns out" in 20 weeks. Twenty weeks times $50,000 is, however, ridiculously optimistic nowadays.
"Millennium Approaches," the first half of "Angels," opened on May 4, 1993, and is to close Dec. 4. That's 83 weeks. It cost $2.2 million to mount and about $200,000 a week to run. At closing, it will still owe investors $660,000. (The second half, "Perestroika," was mounted with a $1.4 million loan, since repaid.)
"Angels" is not typical because it was lavish, seven hours long and broken into two parts. It may yet recoup from tour, regional and movie income. "I'm optimistic about that, I'm even bullish," said Margo Lion, one of the producers.
But as far as Broadway is concerned, it's a financial bust. Mr. Simon has far less to fear because his comedies about feuding heterosexual couples and television comedy writers are more likely to earn years of royalties from suburban dinner theaters than is a "gay fantasia on national themes." His "Jake's Women," which lost money on its seven-month run on Broadway in 1992, is now $100,000 in the black.
But even if "London Suite" was a big hit, not earning out quickly could be dangerous. Rave reviews fade. The original cast leaves. Ads that once looked fresh turn yellow on the page. The winter slump follows the summer slump, the Labor Day-Yom Kippur double whammy fades into record snowstorms: producers have no shortage of excuses for bad weeks.
Here is how Mr. Azenberg figures his Off Broadway prospects:
"Six actors, one set, only a few props change. I don't have to get marquee names. On Broadway, you'd be smarter if you did, and that's not easy to achieve."
Off Broadway theaters use nonunion stagehands, ushers and box-office workers. The biggest expense is "loading in": installing the set and lighting it. Loading "London Suite" Off Broadway would cost $8,000, Mr. Azenberg's staff calculated: 12 workers at $13 an hour, with dinner if they put in more than eight hours. On Broadway, it would cost $175,000: 30 to 35 men (because carpenter, electrician and props jobs are separate), getting $25 to $37 an hour, along with vacation pay, benefits and payroll taxes that bring the producer's cost to $41 to $61 an hour. Plus overtime at up to $90 an hour.
"You're taking something made of plywood and canvas and putting it up at the cost of a house with plumbing and a foundation that would last 300 years," Mr. Azenberg said.
"Load-in" costs include running the theater. A typical Broadway box office has five employees costing, with benefits, $1,150 a week each. An Off Broadway office has two, costing $550 a week each.
For advertising before and just after the opening, Mr. Azenberg would spend $350,000 on Broadway, but at most $100,000 Off Broadway, most of that on posters and newspaper ads. "Off Broadway, you're not permitted the illusion that advertising will bring in an audience," he said. "You know word of mouth does it."
The $1.6 million Broadway capitalization would be $660,000 Off Broadway. But only $440,000 of that would actually be spent. (All productions raise more than they must spend. The difference is a cushion against a flop: for refunds, advances against royalties and bonds posted with the unions. If the show flies, the investors get the money back.)
"The ticket price will be $37.50 to $40," he said. "Five hundred seats times 8 performances a week times $40 a seat is $160,000. You take 20 percent off for discounts and theater parties. That's $128,000. Now, if the show costs me $60,000 a week to run, even if I did only 80 percent of $128,000, I still make $25,000-plus a week after paying royalties. If I can do that for only 18 weeks, I pay off the $440,000.
"To do that, I only need to sell 400 seats a night. You do that on Broadway, you're out of business."
And the logic is compelling. How hard can it be to find 400 people a night who want to see Neil Simon, especially if they think they're getting him wholesale?
One need only look at how other name playwrights have fared recently -- Albee, Miller, Mamet, Wasserstein -- to follow the trend.
Edward Albee's latest play, "Three Tall Women," has been at the Promenade, a 400-seat Off Broadway theater, for seven months. It has three actresses, one set and six costumes. Elizabeth I. McCann, the lead producer, said she raised $375,000 -- and spent only $214,000 -- because the cast and set were already assembled by the Vineyard Theater. "If we'd had to do it from scratch, it would probably have cost $475,000," she said.
The play recouped its investment in the first eight weeks.
"We have 100 lighting instruments in the air, while a Broadway house has 1,000, easily," she said. "Our costumes come off the rack -- at Bloomingdale's, but still. . . . On Broadway, for whatever reason, most are specially made, even if they're contemporary."
She refused to go into her weekly running costs because she fears that Mr. Azenberg has his eye on the Promenade, which is fairly pleasant for an Off Broadway house and conveniently on the Upper West Side. As it turns out, she's right.
Arthur Miller's newest play, "Broken Glass," closed in January after running at the Booth Theater on Broadway for nine weeks. It lost $700,000 of its $800,000 capitalization, said Robert Whitehead, the lead producer. In retrospect, he said, he wishes he had done the play under auspices of the Broadway Alliance, a union-producer agreement that cuts costs at some theaters in return for caps on ticket prices. But the Booth was not an Alliance theater, he said, and his cast would not have accepted the $2,500 salary cap.
Wendy Wasserstein's play "The Sisters Rosensweig" was that rarity, a smash hit.
David Mamet's two-character, one-set "Oleanna" is a movie now, but it ran at the Orpheum Theater on Second Avenue for 15 months. It was capitalized in 1992 for $325,000, of which only $230,000 was actually spent, said Mr. Zollo, the lead producer.
On a good week, with most of the 350 seats selling for $35, it grossed about $95,000. Weekly expenses were $39,000 plus royalties and extra rent based on the gross, for a total of about $56,000.
"It could spin off nearly $40,000 a week," Mr. Zollo said. "It made over $1 million just Off Broadway. Then it had very successful tours and a London production."
Off Broadway, Mr. Zollo also produced "Marvin's Room" by Scott McPherson, "Key Exchange" by Kevin Wade and "Sex, Drugs and Rock-and-Roll" and "Pounding Nails Into the Floor With My Forehead," both by Eric Bogosian.
" 'Marvin's Room,' didn't quite break even," he said. " 'Sex, Drugs' cost $120,000 to put on and made a lot of money at the Orpheum. 'Key Exchange' did very well. 'Pounding Nails' cost $200,000 and did well."
"If we'd put 'Pounding Nails' on Broadway," he added, "It would have cost more than $200,000 just for the sets."
"I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel," he added. "I don't see anything making it on Broadway except a British play that has an imprimatur, or a star vehicle."
Mr. Simon and Mr. Azenberg apparently agree.
"When Neil and I started talking about doing this," Mr. Azenberg said, "he asked, 'What would it cost?' I said '$500,000.' He said, 'We could lose that much; it would be O.K.' Believe me, he's not worried about the money any more. He wants people to see his play. And he wants the investors to get their money back."
Mr. Simon puts up most of his own backing, but his other investors are people who have been in on earlier Azenberg or Simon vehicles, relatives and old friends -- some decidedly not rich.
"But it's not just the investors," Mr. Azenberg said. "You need the theater to be a venue where a playwright can make a living. Otherwise, he's a screenwriter."

The Economics of Prenatal Care

 BODY:
Fearing that purely altruistic social arguments would never carry the day, health care advocates have long claimed that the expense of offering prenatal care to poor women would be more than offset by the savings in preventing premature births and other costly problems. But now Dr. Frederick Cornell, who directs maternal and child-health programs at the University of Washington in Seattle, and Dr. Jane Huntington, a Seattle internist, have analyzed the more than 100 papers on which that contention was based -- and found them flawed.
Those who do not receive timely prenatal care are predominantly poor minorities at high risk of having premature and low-birth-weight babies. Reducing that risk, the doctors say, takes a kind of care -- identifying and treating drug and alcohol abuse, for example -- far more comprehensive than that provided by the average prenatal program. That takes more money. 
 The new study does not prove that prenatal care does not save money; it merely says the evidence cited is inadequate to prove that it does. But cost should not be the criterion for providing that care. In a society as advanced and wealthy as ours, prenatal care should be provided to all.

Self-Deportation?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The victory in California of the movement to deny schooling and medical services to illegal immigrants who are not actually bleeding to death is the first skirmish in the war on unwed welfare mothers.
That's because both Proposition 187 (punishing some 300,000 alien schoolchildren for the sins of their fathers) and the Gingrich approach to welfare reform (withholding support when unemployed single mothers have additional children) are based on this philosophy: the most cost-effective way to change behavior is to make life unbearable under present behavior. 
 During the recent resurgence of righteousness, Gov. Pete Wilson of California was described in this space as "the best candidate with the worst issue" and Prop. 187, which he strongly supported, was denounced as a "nativist abomination."
I came to admire him when, as a Senator, he exposed the abuse of the franking privilege by incumbents. Early this year I reported Richard Nixon's prediction that a California comeback victory would make Wilson the front-runner for the '96 Republican nomination -- and if running-mated with Gov. Christy Whitman of New Jersey, the ticket would win. Visiting Washington last week, Pete Wilson invited me over to screw my head back on properly.
About the nativism charge: he is eager it be understood that he is not anti-immigrant, only anti-illegal immigrant. "One in four Californians are legal immigrants," he says, "and don't need lectures on the contributions of legal immigrants. In fact, they are the most vociferous critics of illegal immigration. . . . The issue is the rule of law."
O.K., with a sizeable portion of voting Latinos in favor of curbing their illegal competitors, let's grant that most of the proposition's supporters are neither nativist nor racist. Support from those who resent all immigrants, legal and not, surely came Wilson's way, but it does not mean he shares their prejudices.
About the privacy-intrusion charge, turning teachers into immigration agents: "Teachers don't enroll students," Wilson says, implying it is only the administrators' job and not the teachers'. He says that school districts everywhere ask for proof of residence, and adds that all applicants to Federal jobs must produce verifiable citizenship documents. (He's against national ID cards.)
Maybe he can bolster that defense of 187 in court with regulations against discrimination or intrusion in its enforcement. But no administrative amelioration is likely to alter the requirement that schools have reverse truant officers assigned to root out those sneaky little offspring of illegales trying to cop a freebie education (to which the Supreme Court has ruled they are entitled, and with conservative justices, stare decisis ain't dead yet.)
What's Wilson's purpose in all this? To get budget-cutting Washington to reimburse California $2.5 billion a year for state services to the illegals? To get the Feds to stem the tide of invaders, many of whom sashay in as tourists?
Yes to both, but more: "If it's clear to you that you cannot be employed, and that you and your family are ineligible for services, you will self-deport."
I take the import of that to be: make 'em so miserable that they leave the country. To which many law-abiding Americans, especially tax-burdened Californians, would say: Hooray!
Ebenezer Scrooge is my hero, too, but that neatly theoretical "economic disincentive" won't disincent -- because being miserable here doesn't compare with the misery they ran away from.
Do we really want to drive most illegal families deeper underground, many to lives of crime? Would we rather have 300,000 children on the streets, learning costly delinquency -- or safely in school, becoming potential citizens and taxpayers?
Pete Wilson wants an immigration plank in the Republican platform. Fine; it should include Federal reimbursement, amnesty, border control -- but none of this creation of an uneducated, unmedicated underground.
After our talk, I am prepared to withdraw the charge that 187 is driven primarily by nativism. But in terms of practicality and of the American spirit, a government policy of making any child's life miserable is still an abomination.

HEADLINE: DOLE TIES SUPPORT OF TRADE ACCORD TO TAX CONCESSION

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Seeking to wring concessions from a politically weakened White House, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas said today that he had told Clinton Administration officials that he would be more inclined to vote for a worldwide trade pact if the White House dropped certain objections to a cut in the capital gains tax.
Administration officials said today that they had promptly dismissed the offer made by Senator Dole, the likely majority leader. 
 Senator Dole's proposal was the latest Republican effort to gain as many concessions as possible from the White House in exchange for supporting the pact. The Administration has already agreed to address some of Mr. Dole's previous demands in return for his support, provoking criticism of Mr. Dole by more conservative Republicans for not driving a hard enough bargain.
Mr. Dole said today on the ABC news program "This Week" that he made his latest proposal during a meeting on Saturday with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff.
Mr. Panetta said this afternoon on the CNN news program "Late Edition," "I don't think he's going to get a commitment from us that we're going to suddenly support a capital gains tax cut," particularly as part of the trade accord.
In a telephone interview this evening, Mr. Kantor declined to comment on Mr. Dole's linking of taxes and trade, but said that the Administration was still trying to allay his concerns about the trade pact itself. Mr. Kantor said that the Administration "made good progress this weekend" to find the votes to pass the agreement.
If approved, the 124-nation trade accord would reduce tariffs around the world and extend the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to farming and service industries like accounting. It would also create a World Trade Organization to referee international trade disputes.
Until today, Mr. Dole's most strenuous objections had focused on whether the pact would undermine American sovereignty.
Without Senator Dole's support, the accord, which is awaiting debate next week in a special session of Congress, could die in the Senate where it faces a particularly difficult test. The chamber's rules require at least 60 senators to waive a requirement that the pact's tariff reductions be balanced with extra taxes or spending cuts.
Mr. Dole said today that the waiver should be coupled with a change in the Administration stance on capital gains taxes. "You're going to make money with a capital gains rate reduction," he said. "And according to Treasury, you lose a lot of money. And we'd like to say, 'Well, come on now, if we're going to waive the budget on GATT, maybe we can waive the budget on what you suggest capital gains may be scored.' " Mr. Dole was referring to the way that policy makers count, or score, the effects of tax cuts.
Mr. Dole said that lower taxes on capital gains -- the increase in value of stocks, bonds and business investments -- would increase Federal revenue.
But the Joint Tax Committee of Congress and the Treasury Department have long calculated that any cut in capital gains taxes would cost the Government billions of dollars in revenue, with the exact amount depending on the depth of the cut. And the Administration wants spending cuts to balance any loss in Federal revenues.
Republicans have contended that such calculations vastly overstate the cost of the cut because they exclude the effects that a capital gains tax would have on the overall economy.
The Republican position, which Mr. Dole called today for the Administration to adopt, is that a capital gains tax cut would help the entire American economy by encouraging people to sell long-held stocks, bonds and business holdings and invest the proceeds in other, more productive businesses. As these more productive businesses expanded, Republicans say, the extra tax revenue from them would make up for the money lost in the original tax cuts.
If the Republican approach of looking at a tax cut's overall economic effect, known as dynamic scoring, were adopted, then Congress could approve a cut in the capital gains tax without matching spending cuts. But Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, strongly criticized the scoring method at a breakfast with reporters last Tuesday, saying it would lead to much larger Federal budget deficits.
As recently as Thursday, Mr. Bentsen said in an interview that any tax cuts would have to be fully balanced with spending cuts, and his press secretary, Joan Logue-Kinder, repeated this position today.
In the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Republicans, including Mr. Dole, generally spoke in favor of the pact. But strong opposition from conservative Republicans, who contend that the World Trade Organization would undermine American sovereignty, have made it hard for potential Presidential candidates like Mr. Dole to support the deal.
Wall Street firms and business executives have long sought lower capital gains taxes. But making such a cut has proved politically infeasible without a broad tax cut for less wealthy Americans, and because budget rules require that a tax cut be offset with spending cuts or increases in other taxes. The budget rules are aimed at shrinking the growth of the Federal deficit.
Although eager to strike a tough bargain with the Administration on trade, Mr. Dole toned down the rhetoric on other issues coming from some of his Republican colleagues in recent days.
For example, he tried to smooth over the dispute touched off by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said on Friday that he thought Mr. Clinton was unfit to be Commander in Chief of the United States military.
"I must say, I had reservations early on," Mr. Dole said. "I think he's up to the job now."
Mr. Clinton is "doing better all the time," Mr. Dole said, citing American efforts to keep peace and install a democratically elected government in Haiti, as well as to continue efforts toward peace in the Middle East.
"Jesse was just giving his opinion," Mr. Dole said. "I think he'd rather have another Commander in Chief."
On CNN, Mr. Panetta called Senator Helms's comments "reckless." He added, "They send terrible signals abroad to both our enemies and our allies about our ability to come together on foreign affairs issues."
Mr. Dole also voiced doubt that a constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in schools could pass.
"I don't think we ought to get bogged down" on such divisive matters, Mr. Dole said
He added, "If we're going to bring about change, we better bring up some measures we can pass, so the American people will get the message that we're serious about it."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about Senator Bob Dole's linking of support for a world trade pact to a cut in the capital gains tax referred incorrectly in some editions to the relationship between a tax cut and a change in Federal budget rules. If the overall economic effects of a tax cut are counted in a manner suggested by Republicans, it can be enacted without matching cuts in Federal spending.

HEADLINE: Takeover Fight Transfixes the Swiss

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZURICH, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In Switzerland, discreet finance and genteel business manners are a way of life, and the rare corporate takeover is quietly handled behind closed doors.
 But now the Swiss are getting their full share of a knock-down, drag-out fight over control of the country's largest financial institution, the Union Bank of Switzerland. The bank is so big that its global assets nearly equal Switzerland's gross national product, but that has not put off Martin Ebner, a rich, brash Swiss financier whose actions are in the tradition of American takeover specialists like Carl C. Icahn and T. Boone Pickens. 
Mr. Ebner, who controls 16 percent of Union Bank's voting shares, wants to reshape the giant from an institution that offers almost every banking service and earns a respectable profit into a lean bank concentrating on high-profit private banking and securities underwriting.
 The current managers, he asserts, are trying to hold on to their jobs and are sluggish and lack innovation. Their institution far underperforms the banks he idolizes most, he says, like J. P. Morgan and Wells Fargo in the United States and Lloyds Bank of London.
 Not surprisingly, executives at Union Bank profoundly disagree. They note that the bank, with a 25 percent share of the Swiss mortgage market, cannot freely move mortgage rates up and down as international money markets and their rates shift. In 1991, for example, Robert Studer, the bank's chief executive, was called to testify before Parliament to explain why the bank pushed its lending rates up one-half of a percentage point.
 The furor over the Union Bank battle has made for a frenzied Swiss press. One Zurich daily is running a 12-part series on the battle and a financial daily, Cash, is offering prizes totaling $32,000 to those who most closely guess how much of the proxy vote Mr. Ebner and U.B.S. get at a special shareholders meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
 What is at stake is not just control of Union Bank but also its role as a Swiss institution. To address the perceived threat, the bank's board has scheduled the special shareholders meeting, at which the board hopes to pass a resolution that would radically reduce the voting power of Mr. Ebner's stock and that of investors who support him.
 "Mr. Ebner's objective is not for U.B.S. to live as a healthy bank for the next 200 years and be a support to the Swiss economy," Mr. Studer said. "He wants us to focus on areas that require much less capital, and then take the excess capital we have built up and hand it over to shareholders to make them rich."
 What has turned into a national debate on entrenched management versus investor greed is playing out in a rapidly changing corporate environment. For decades Switzerland was renowned as a closed country, veiled in bank secrecy, that left wealthy Swiss families and big financial groups in control of Swiss institutions. While bank secrecy remains, the Government is trying to broaden ownership of many hallowed financial institutions, primarily to make sure they will be able to tap the growing international capital markets.
 During the summer, Parliament approved a law that stops Swiss banks from refusing to sell so-called registered shares with special voting powers to foreigners. Since the 1970's, the Government had limited the sale of registered shares to the Swiss, to keep control of its banks, it said, out of the hands of Arab investors and drug cartels.
 In 1992, Parliament passed a similar law removing ownership restrictions on industrial corporations. And by the end of next year it is expected to relax its restrictions on foreign ownership of Swiss real estate.
 But even as politicians seek to bring in more foreign capital, they resist the idea of foreign control. The new banking law that takes effect on Jan. 1, for example, requires that an individual or corporation whose holdings reach 10 percent of a bank's shares must notify banking authorities of that holding, and grants the authorities the right to revoke the voting rights on the shares if they deem that person unfit to influence the institution.
 Similarly, a law that will go into effect next year will make greenmail more difficult and hostile takeovers more costly by requiring anyone who buys one-third of a company's stock to make an offer to the company's remaining shareholders. That would make it difficult for someone to gain effective control with a minority stake.
 Mr. Ebner has been the Union Bank's largest shareholder since 1991, after he persuaded Swiss pension funds to bankroll his company, BK Bank Zurich AG, which became a major shareholder in U.B.S.
 Through BK Bank Zurich, he began criticizing the management of Union Bank, and in 1993 he complained vigorously when the bank's board removed a director, Christoph Blocher, a prominent right-wing industrialist who strongly opposed any attempt by Switzerland to join the European Union.
 Mr. Ebner also holds stock in Union Bank through BK Vision AG, an investment company in which the Rolex Holding Group, which makes the famous watches, is a major shareholder.
 At the bank's annual meeting this year, Mr. Ebner proposed that the board be trimmed to 9 directors from 23, arguing that it would streamline the bank and make it more innovative. Although his plan was voted down, he won 40 percent of the vote, which frightened the bank's management. Soon thereafter, Mr. Studer and the chairman, Nikolaus Senn, began trying to figure out how to reduce Mr. Ebner's voting power.
 Mr. Ebner's strategy was built on his recognition that the bank's registered shares, which could be owned only by Swiss nationals, were out of favor because of their limited liquidity, and were valued at roughly one-fifth of the bearer shares that could be owned by anyone. Yet both types of shares have equal voting rights, so Mr. Ebner realized that he could have five times the voting power by buying registered shares.
 To head off Mr. Ebner, Mr. Senn and Mr. Studer decided to propose at the company's 1995 annual meeting that a new type of share be created, for which all existing shares would be exchanged -- but with the exchange reflecting market value, so that each registered share would get one new share, but each bearer share would get five. That would leave Mr. Ebner with a hopelessly weakened position.
 After Mr. Ebner approached the bank's management during the summer and said he was close to cementing support for a controlling interest in the bank, the board decided it could not wait until 1995 and called for Tuesday's special shareholder meeting.
 The bank's return has averaged about 10 percent in recent years, a level Mr. Studer says is high given the large reserves the bank has to keep. Not so, argues Mr. Ebner, who says Union Bank could have returns in the 15 to 20 percent range, similar to that of institutions like Morgan and Lloyds.
 Mr. Ebner seems to practice what he preaches, operating out of a comfortable but far from lavish office on the top floor of a shopping center building. BK Bank has no secretaries and no corporate cars and invests solely in a handful of stocks it considers undervalued. Mr. Ebner likes to take large positions in companies and then try to influence management to become more efficient and profitable.
 But if Mr. Ebner loses the vote on Tuesday, he might lose something else that analysts have said he is looking for -- respect.
 "Until now he counted on being part of the Zurich financial establishment," said Hans Kaufman, chief of Swiss research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. "That is his great goal. But if he loses this, he loses face and will always remain an outsider."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 1995, Wednesay

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Nov. 21 discussed a battle over the owner ship of the Union Bank of Switzer land. It recounted recent moves to permit more foreign investment in Swiss companies, including banks, after years of tight restrictions. Re calling the evolution of the banking law over the last 20 years, the article referred to what legislators and bankers perceived as a threat from "Arab investors and drug cartels."
In referring to Arab investors, the article should have made it clear that in the 1970's, as the Swiss were drawing up the legislation, it was aimed at Middle Eastern countries that had just acquired huge amounts of money from oil and were invest ing around the world.
 The article should not have linked the concern about those Middle Eastern countries to a debate about possible investment by drug cartels; the legislators' discussion of a threat from drug money occurred a decade later.
Letters from an Arab-owned in vestment group, challenging the No vember account of the Swiss events, prompted a review of the article.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. PROPOSAL WOULD OVERHAUL WELFARE SYSTEM

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The Republican team taking over the House of Representatives will propose a welfare bill that eliminates a decades-old guiding principle of poverty and food programs: that anyone who qualifies for these benefits automatically gets them.
Under the proposal drafted by House Republicans for submission in January, Congress would set an overall annual limit on welfare spending and replace food stamps and child-nutrition programs with a lump sum payment to each state. 
 The Republicans would consolidate 10 nutrition programs into a "food assistance block grant," cut the available money by 5 percent and then set a limit on future spending. The limit would be adjusted for increases in population and food prices in the prior year.
The programs to be consolidated in this way include food stamps, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children and the school lunch and breakfast programs. The food stamp program costs $25 billion a year and helps feed 27 million people. The program for women, infants and children, or WIC, serves 6.2 million people at a cost of $3.1 billion a year. The school lunch program costs $4.5 billion a year and feeds 25 million children a day.
House Republicans said today that the bill would also require state welfare officials to provide the Federal Government with information to help identify illegal immigrants. The proposal would also curtail aid to aliens, both those who are in the United States illegally and many of those who are legal residents.
Each of the bill's proposals is big enough to insure long, impassioned debate next year, but one is particularly striking.
Under the Republican bill, people now eligible for welfare, food stamps and free school lunches would no longer have a legally enforceable right to such assistance. Instead of such "entitlements," specific sums would be appropriated each year for food assistance and welfare. If the money ran out before the end of the year, benefits could be scaled back, people could be removed from the rolls or new applicants could be turned away, depending on state decisions.
House Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, the Speaker-in-waiting, have said they will bring the bill to the floor within the first 100 days of the next Congress, as promised in their 10-point "Contract With America." A copy of the bill was obtained by The New York Times from state officials who have been following the issue and meeting with House Republicans.
As such, it will be a focus of debate in the House next year and appears to have a better chance of passage than any other welfare bill. But to become law, it will have to pass the Senate, where some senior Republicans have supported expansion of food programs. It would also be subject to approval by President Clinton. Mr. Clinton's willingness to veto measures he opposes, and his ability to sustain those vetoes, are two of the imponderables of the next Congress. A veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of each chamber.
While Mr. Clinton has called for overhauling the welfare system, he has focused on job training and limits on the duration of welfare payments, not on food programs.
The Republican bill would repeal the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the National School Lunch Act of 1946, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 and several other Federal laws intended to prevent hunger.
It would replace the money allocated under those laws with the new block grant, which states would use for the general purpose of food assistance but without having to follow the detailed nutrition standards set by existing laws and regulations. Current rules say, for example, that school lunches must supply at least one-third of the recommended dietary allowance for various nutrients. In addition, under the proposal, states could provide people with cash instead of food stamps.
Republicans said their proposal would save money and force Congress to face up to the cost of welfare and food assistance, rather than continue these programs on autopilot.
But Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the Democrat who has been chairman of the Agriculture Committee for eight years, said the Republican proposal would "lead to a dramatic increase in hunger and will leave states stranded to deal with the fallout on their own." He said he had worked closely with Republican senators like Bob Dole of Kansas and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana to strengthen food programs.
Mr. Lugar is expected to become chairman of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. Dole, who is in line to be the new Majority Leader, said in 1982 that "the Federal Government should retain primary responsibility for child nutrition programs," and he noted that President Richard M. Nixon expressed the same view in 1969.
Officials of two groups that advocate Government assistance for needy people, Edward M. Cooney, deputy director of the Food Research and Action Center, and Isaac Shapiro, acting co-director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the Republican proposal would hamper the Government's ability to respond to urgent need.
"In the event of a recession," Mr. Shapiro said, "the need for food assistance increases sharply, but the food stamp program would not be able to expand to meet the need," because of the Republican plan's spending limits. In late 1991 and early 1992, food stamp rolls sometimes grew by more than 300,000 people a month, and the number of recipients soared to more than 24 million.
In a further effort to control spending on social welfare programs, the House Republican plan would deny most forms of assistance to people who were not citizens, including many legal aliens.
State welfare officials would have to provide the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service with "the name, address and other identifying information" on illegal aliens whose children were United States citizens.
The Republican bill, the Personal Responsibility Act, lists 60 programs for which illegal aliens and many legal aliens would be ineligible. These include Medicaid, maternal and child health care, community health centers, migrant health centers, the school lunch and breakfast programs, the WIC. program, public housing, child immunizations, job training, aid to homeless people and the screening of youngsters to detect lead poisoning.
This proposed ban is similar to one approved this month by the voters of California, in Proposition 187. Civil liberties groups and some Hispanic organizations are challenging the California measure in court, saying it violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws.
Under current law, illegal aliens are ineligible for most major Federal and state benefit programs, but they may get emergency medical care under Medicaid, and mothers with small children can get supplemental food assistance. In addition, the Supreme Court has said children who are illegal aliens may not be denied a free public education. Presumably, some of these children get school lunches, because there is no test of citizenship or alien status.
Legal aliens, especially permanent residents of the United States, are currently eligible for most Government benefits available to citizens, like education and housing assistance. The Republican proposal would make aliens ineligible for many of these.
But the restrictions would not apply to refugees, to emergency medical services or to permanent resident aliens who are over 75 and have lived in the United States for at least five years.
The Republicans' bill would also, for the first time, set a limit on the growth of Federal spending for welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Supplemental Security Income, for elderly, blind and disabled people, and on 15 types of housing assistance for low-income people.
In general, the bill says, the states would not be allowed to pay welfare benefits for a child whose paternity had not been established, nor could the states provide welfare benefits for children born out of wedlock to women under the age of 18.
Money saved from these restrictions would be returned to the states as block grants to provide services, but not cash payments, to help young mothers with illegitimate children. The money could be used "to establish and operate orphanages," to operate group homes for unwed mothers, to promote adoption and to reduce out-of-wedlock births, the bill says.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Leader, Dogged by Economic Woes, to Meet Clinton

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Nov. 21

 BODY:
When the Ukrainian leader, Leonid Kuchma, meets with President Clinton at the White House on Tuesday, he will very likely be praised for moving in the last month to reform the economy and to persuade his truculent Parliament to rid the nation of nuclear weapons.
The Parliament's ratification last week of the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear arms means that the long-sought goal of eliminating those weapons is a done deal. But living up to tough economic conditions set by the International Monetary Fund last month is hitting road blocks. 
 Already, the leftist Parliament, led by the powerful Olexandre O. Morov, the chairman of Ukraine's Socialist Party, is threatening to overturn President Kuchma's decrees and oppose the elements of his package of economic reforms.
And in the countryside, where managers of collective farms and factories have watched inflation soar, energy become scarce and their prices plummet, there are severe doubts about I.M.F. reforms.
With 52 million people in an area about the size of France, Ukraine is the second most populous country from the former Soviet Union and now one of the most economically depressed. Despite a potentially rich agricultural sector and a technologically advanced industrial base, the economy has been badly mismanaged since independence in 1991.
Last week, a Ukrainian toilet paper plant announced that it was recycling the local currency, known as coupons, to make its product.
Earlier this year, the United States doubled its foreign aid to Ukraine to $700 million for 1994, making it the fourth largest recipient, after Israel, Egypt and Russia. As little as 10 percent of the aid is actually being spent, however, an American official said.
[In Washington, Administration officials speaking on condition of anonimity said President Clinton would offer Mr. Kuchma a total of $900 million in aid in their meeting, an increase of $200 million beyond amounts already in the pipeline.]
In return for Ukraine's first I.M.F. loan, for $371 million, Mr. Kuchma and the president of the National Bank, Viktor Yuschenko, moved in recent weeks toward liberalizing prices, freeing trade restrictions, reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing the exchange rate of the almost worthless coupon.
Bread, milk and meat prices as much as tripled in recent weeks. Mass transit and electricity prices have gone up dramatically, too.
But in other areas, there appeared to be some early back-tracking. The Government lifted export licenses but in their place the foreign trade ministry introduced new registration requirements, which exporters say are another form of bureauracy intended to stall legal export.
In an indication of how rocky the reform path would be, Mr. Morov said in an interview today that he opposed Mr. Kuchma's decree on land reform. He said a decree last week authorizing farmers to buy and sell land on collectivized farms violated the constitution.
Mr. Morov charged further that the reforms were turning land "into a commodity," and that such a step was "unreasonable, to put it mildly."
In contrast, Mr. Kuchma's chief economic strategist, First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk, said last week that the private ownership of land was the most important step toward market reform and "if such an initiative is not undertaken, nothing can go forward."
Mr. Pynzenyk was referring in part to World Bank import rehabilitation loans of more than $300 million that have strict privatization requirements tied to them.

It's Time, Again, to Talk of Cabbages, Not Kings

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 21

 BODY:
"How much do you charge for delivery?" a customer asked, leaning on the handlebars of his bicycle in front of a truck- sized heap of cabbage on the side of the street in western Beijing.
"Charge for delivery?" Wang Zhenping fired back in a mocking tone that turned a few heads in the Horse Tail Gully vegetable market. "Did you just crawl out of a cave or something? It's free!" 
 The great cabbage migration has begun, and it's a buyer's market.
Mountains of Chinese cabbage -- 396 million pounds by the reckoning of the Beijing authorities -- began advancing on the capital this month, as one of old Beijing's agricultural rhythms persists against the onslaught of modern supermarkets and glitzy shopping centers that have sprouted here.
Rough-hewn peasants who have been sleeping with their crops for weeks in a 100-mile arc of farmland outside Beijing have converged for the annual ritual of selling what was once a survival crop for many Chinese.
They come in trucks, horse-drawn carts and pedal-powered three-wheelers, all straining under billowing loads of cabbage that within the space of a week fill acres of sidewalks and alleyway space.
Ten thousand city workers help the farmers with a fleet of 1,400 trucks, which haul cabbage to 500 city-run markets.
From these and from hundreds of freelance cabbage heaps, the hawking begins.
"People will always buy cabbage," Mr. Wang said. "That's the food you get through the winter on."
Lan Wei, a 26-year-old worker in a state factory who was out marketing the other day, said, "In the past, there used to be nothing else to eat."
Smiling, she repeated a ditty of the Communist era, "When you've got your winter cabbage, in your heart you feel secure."
Buying winter cabbage is no simple chore. Volume is the key, as is buying early to get the best price, as little as a penny per pound.
"It used to be that people would get in long lines and really stock up on the stuff -- 400 to 500 pounds," Ms. Lan said. It was stacked on balconies and in stairwells and hung outside windows as a strategic food reserve for every family.
By December it freezes and turns black from the coal soot that makes China's wintertime air famous for its density, but Beijingers just peel away the outside leaves and plop it in boiling water.
"You can fry it, you can make it into dumplings, you can put it into soup," said Wang Yanhong, a young woman who works for an American company in Beijing. She defended it against the disdain of today's youth in China.
"It's not that all young people don't like it," she said, "It's the same as any vegetable. If you eat it every day, you'll get sick of it."
Ms. Lan said that "in recent years, a lot of cabbage hasn't been sold."
The reason is that prosperity, greenhouse farming and year-round vegetable crops shipped from southern China have cut into the northern custom of stocking up on baicai, which in Chinese literally means "white vegetable." (Chinese cabbage is not the soccer-ball-shaped stuff familiar in the West. The Chinese version is cylindrical, with broad white leaves that trend toward a green crown.)
But there seems to be a larger cultural shift afoot.
"Of course, young people don't like cabbage as much as the older generation does," said Hu Bei, 23, another shopper in western Beijing, "but it's also that lots of young people are too lazy to cook, especially the ones who are earning high salaries or working for foreign enterprises."
Many newly well-off Chinese simply identify the annual cabbage haul as a relic of past privation. And to the young, it seems downright unfashionable.
But if anything has spurred the sales of this year's crop of cabbage, it has been soaring urban inflation, which has pushed up vegetable prices 50 percent in the last year. Even households with new income are watching their food budgets.
"In the past few years people haven't bought so much cabbage," Ms. Hu said. "Now, though, they're worried about the prices going up on vegetables, so they're buying more."
It may seem hard to imagine that while millions of Chinese are getting rich, millions of other Chinese seem to be slavishly following the habits of an earlier era.
"The farther north you go, the more people rely on it," Ms. Lan said.
Back at the Horse Tail Gully market, Mr. Wang, his brother and sister-in-law, Gao Aijun, 27, had been selling for three straight days and it looked like it might take two more days to reduce their cabbage heap to the dregs.
"This year it's been a pretty good harvest," Ms. Gao said, "and we'll do a lot better this year than last," perhaps with a total profit of more than $1,200 on 55,000 pounds of cabbage.
That is, Mr. Wang added with a note of caution and a sideways glance up and down the street, "depending on whether any competition arrives."
In the cabbage business, a competing heap could come around the corner at any moment, he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
An oil company tries to enliven one of the basic purchases -- gasoline -- with a light touch.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
IT has been decades since the enthusiastic uniformed Men from Texaco sang their way through hard-charging sales pitches and Esso insistently promised it would "put a tiger in your tank." Today's gasoline advertising tries selling in a far softer, more low-key manner, as demonstrated by a humorous, at times even winsome, campaign for the Sun Company.
Broadcast commercials and print advertisements by Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York focus on products like Sunoco gasoline and a new "co-branded" credit card linking Sunoco and Mastercard. The campaign for Sun, which spends $13 million to $14 million annually on promoting its Sunoco brand and service stations in the East and Midwest, is intended to put gasoline in its proper place, so to speak. 
 A big mistake made in traditional "chest pounding" ads by oil companies was "the idea that gasoline was more important to people than it actually was," Rochelle Klein, executive creative director at Angott, Thomas, said. "They never took into account that it's a purchase people have to make, not want to make."
By comparison, she added, the tenor of the agency's Sunoco advertising is that "we're something you have to do on the way to do something you want to do."
That attitude is evinced in the campaign, which began running last week. One television commercial pays tribute to cars as the song "Bless 'Em All," a paean to the troops during World War II, plays on the soundtrack. "After all," an announcer asks puckishly, "without cars, where would we be?"
In a second spot, for the Sunoco Mastercard, which offers rebates on gasoline purchases, the announcer asserts: "For years, your credit card purchases have fueled the economy. It's time they fueled your car."
And a final spot, also for the Sunoco Mastercard, spoofs a familiar animated commercial for the co-branded credit card of a Sunoco rival, Shell. "Unlike our competitors' cards, our new Sunoco Mastercard doesn't fox trot, cha-cha or lambada," the announcer wryly declares, referring to the Shell commercial in which special effects give the impression that the credit cards can dance.
"And for those who have to have a card that dances," he says, as a hand picks up a Sunoco Mastercard and moves it from side to side, "arriba!"
Norm Vincoff, manager for marketing services at Sun in Philadelphia, said: "In any business, you can get tied up in the belief people out there have a deep interest in your product and it's one of the most important things in their lives. But you have to be realistic about the role gasoline plays."
"We don't want to insult the level of intelligence of consumers," he added.
The campaign carries a theme, "On the driver's side," that was introduced in the spring of 1993 by Sunoco's previous agency, the New York office of Hal Riney & Partners. Angotti, Thomas absorbed Riney's New York office, and its accounts, in September of that year.
"Angotti has done a great job positioning Sunoco the way we want to be," Mr. Vincoff said, "in terms of value and high-quality product."
In addition to the Angotti, Thomas ads for the Sunoco Mastercard, 13 million to 14 million households -- including about 1.8 million that hold Sunoco credit cards -- will receive mail solicitations created by Cohn & Wells, a San Francisco shop specializing in direct-response advertising. The Sunoco Mastercard is issued by Bank of America.
The Angotti, Thomas campaign will appear in three phases, Mr. Vincoff said. The first runs through early December, the second begins after the new year and the third is scheduled for mid- to late 1995. There will be television and radio commercials in local markets, he said, as well as ads in newspapers in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Amid Midwest Roar, Inflation Sleeps

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
Business is booming all across the major industrial centers of the Midwest. In a region that only a decade ago was dubbed the Rust Belt, companies are running at top speed, hiring temporary workers, demanding overtime of employees and straining to meet deliveries.
These are some of the signs that worry the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last week for the sixth time this year out of fear that a fast-paced economy points to a re-emergence of rising wages and prices. But amid this outbreak of inflation's symptoms in the nation's heartland is a curious phenomenon: so far, there is no disease. 
 The main reason that inflation remains benign, business executives and analysts in the region said, is that greater domestic and overseas competition helps keep prices in check. Moreover, now that American industry is again in fighting trim, both business and labor seem to recognize that the United States has a much better chance of seizing a larger share of expanding foreign markets if prices remain attractive.
"Business is hot and heavy right now," said David Carlson, sales vice president for the Adron Tool Corporation, an advanced tool and die shop here. "But it's truly a world market and we're under the gun constantly to improve productivity. Basically, we can't raise prices or we might not get the job."
If inflation is coming, this is the first place it should show up. But in contrast to the inflation rate during many previous periods of surging business, price increases remain quite tame. Consumer prices even fell in the North Central states in October, the only region where this occurred, according to the Government.
"It's amazing that in the Midwest, where manufacturing activity is leading the nation, that inflation pressures are as well contained as they are," said Robert H. Schnorbus, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Indeed, it is possible that price pressures are building under the surface so that they will eventually break loose of the Fed's monetary restraint. But it is more likely, to judge by recent interviews with business executives and other analysts in the Midwest, that intensified market forces and new attitudes are reinforcing Fed policy so strongly that inflation should remain restrained.
Even after more than three and a half years of economic growth, "one doesn't see any upward pressure at all on labor costs," said Norman Robertson, an economic consultant in Pittsburgh. "The competitive pressures seem to be more intense now than in previous upswings."
The Midwest labor market is the tightest in the nation. A sharp rebound in the region's automotive and machine tool industries has driven the unemployment rate down to 5 percent, eight-tenths of a point below the nation as a whole. As recently as May 1993, the Midwest unemployment rate was 6.4 percent.
If current levels of unemployment persist in the region, said Mark M. Zandi, an analyst at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., "we should begin to see some more pronounced wage pressure." In contrast to the warmer South or to the Rocky Mountain West, with its wide open spaces and recreational features, the Midwest is not as likely to import many workers from other areas. "You don't see the big migration flows into the Midwest," Mr. Zandi said.
But that pressure toward higher prices has so far been held in check by forces working in the other direction.
Jeffery T. Grade, chairman of Harnischfeger Industries, a large company here that produces cranes and other heavy industrial equipment, points to what he calls a new "self-imposed discipline" that is creating a partnership among producers, suppliers and customers.
"If you take unfair advantage," Mr. Grade said, "in the short run you'll be a hero but in the long run you'll wish you were not so stentorian. That, to me, is what's regulating inflation."
One important way that American companies are keeping costs under control is by using more temporary workers for blue-collar production. The pattern, which is long established in many clerical and technical jobs, is even spreading to managerial work.
Workers supplied by Manpower Inc., the largest temporary-help company in the nation, generally cost companies just as much in the short term as full-time workers. But they help keep costs under control by giving management a high degree of flexibility, according to Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower, which is based in Milwaukee.
"Strategically, companies face both a need to find people and the fear of adding costs because buyers aren't willing to pay increased prices," he said. "That is a total change in everybody's psychology."
Conditions are similar elsewhere in the factory-heavy Midwest. Even in the auto industry, manufacturers and their suppliers are relying on large numbers of temporary workers in Indiana, Michigan and other states.
"We're opening offices in places I'd never even heard of" a year ago, said Warren Rosenow, Manpower's regional vice president in Chicago.
Still, some signs of potential inflation are cropping up here that policy makers in Washington cannot risk ignoring. There was the man who turned up on a radio call-in show the other day complaining that his "totally burned out" brother-in-law has had only seven days off since July. Meanwhile, some manufacturers say they can no longer count on prompt delivery from suppliers. That points to production bottlenecks that lay the foundation for prices to be bid higher.
The Milwaukee Metal Products Company, for instance, used to be able to obtain steel blanks in a week or so, said Betty Jane Parrott, the company's vice president, but now "they're moving out to two or three weeks."
And in Wisconsin's Sheboygan County, where the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent, companies are contracting out work they no longer can get done locally. Many are even putting expansion plans on hold. Finding workers, especially for blue-collar jobs, "is a huge problem right now," acknowledged Barbara N. Lillesand, executive director of the Sheboygan County Chamber of Commerce.
The squeeze is finally forcing companies to start offering more money to attract new workers. "We're bumping up against our capacity to be able to fill all the orders," said Kenneth Krueger, financial vice president of the Allen-Bradley Company, a Milwaukee-based unit of the Rockwell International Corporation that is a leading producer of automation controls. In early summer, it hired its first new workers since 1978 after exhausting an employee-recall list that once included thousands of names.
But companies are also gaining flexibility by investing heavily in advanced, highly productive equipment that expands capacity and thereby tends to relieve inflation pressure. Indeed, much of this equipment is produced in the Midwest, a big reason the region's economy is so strong.
It is possible, of course, that "we're just sort of waiting for the dam to break," said Mr. Schnorbus, the Federal Reserve economist in Chicago. "But I'm more inclined to believe that we're in a different pricing environment than has existed in the past."

HEADLINE: Where's 42d St. Grit? Around the Corner;
Slow Change Along Eighth Ave. Strip

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Come midnight, Eighth Avenue in midtown is a street of neon thrills, lurking dangers and impossible expectation, a Felliniesque montage where a group of giggling theatergoers crowds into a peep booth to have something to talk about on the ride home.
But there is pain in the face of the old man jiggling two quarters in a paper cup, and an odd frenzy in the voice of a man passing out handbills for a topless bar. Doris Brown, a 41-year-old prostitute looking for business across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal recently, said life wasn't getting any easier. 
 "There's money out here, but some nights it takes so long to get it," she said.
Except for the part near Eighth Avenue, 42d Street is now largely a surreal ghost town awaiting a new life. It is Eighth Avenue itself that has become the most sex-saturated street in the city, the police, business people and leaders of community groups said. In the last five years, sex shops and adult theaters have tripled to 15 from 40th to 48th Street, and the corridor south to Penn Station is peppered with about a half dozen more. In addition, many stores are situated on side streets just around the corner from Eighth Avenue.
Although crime statistics are not broken down by street, the police believe the crime rate is the highest in the Times Square area.
This is the avenue that seems never to improve, even as Broadway and Seventh Avenue to the east have taken on a new sparkle, and the Clinton neighborhood immediately to the west more or less succeeds in burying its Hell's Kitchen past. "Eighth Avenue is like the same jungle it was I don't know how many years ago," said a businessman running for a late bus. "It just swallows people up."
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, fears the street's continuing blight threatens the revitalized theater district. "It is a street people try to avoid," he said.
But there are gathering whisps of change. Several weeks ago, the state Urban Development Corporation took title to all of the east side of Eighth Avenue between 42d Street and 43d Street to build a hotel as part of its redevelopment project; Disney is among the bidders. The businesses there now include peep shows, video shops and adult book stores. The condemnation process is expected to start soon.
William H. Daly, director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, said that, in terms of square footage, this one step will eliminate nearly 30 percent of sex businesses on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 53d streets. Even more important, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is pushing for a yearlong moratorium on the opening of sex businesses in the city. During that period, zoning changes would be formulated to push the sex shops to the city's industrial periphery. Current shops would likely be allowed to recover at least some of their investment before having to move, although details have not been determined.
Last week, the City Planning Commission approved the moratorium. It next has to go the the City Council, and the city Planning Department is drafting zoning regulations.
Although the rules will apply equally to sex shops from the Bronx to Staten Island, perhaps its greatest impact will be felt on Eighth Avenue. "The initiative is generic and citywide, but would certainly change Eighth Avenue," said Andrew Lynn, executive director of the Planning Commission.
For the Times Square Business Improvement District, which is now focusing on Eighth Avenue, such action is crucial to stemming the street's slide. "We absolutely need government intervention," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the group.
According to a recent study by her group, there is economic incentive for landlords to rent to owners of sex shops. The study found that rents from 40th Street to 53d Street for sex businesses range from $90 to $125 per square foot per year. Rents for nonpornographic uses along Eighth Avenue are $40 to $50 a square foot north of 48th Street and $50 to $80 south of it. Still, the study found, there's money to be made on the avenue: average rent for nonpornographic uses elsewhere in western Manhattan was $35.
The study also found a lower commercial vacancy rate than for the city as a whole -- 9.6 percent, compared with 15 percent citywide -- a figure that attests to the strong commercial interest in the area. "Eighth Avenue could become a far more vibrant retail strip," the report declared.
There is some evidence this is already happening. Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream says the company's store at the northeast corner of 43d Street is one of its highest-volume sellers. Partly as a result, Green Mountain Coffee said it is planning to open an upscale coffee bar next door. Between 46th and 47th Streets, bright new awnings outside bustling establishments indicate a new retail energy.
The once-grubby Port Authority Bus Terminal, at Eighth Avenue and 42d Street, bristles with new upscale fast-food outlets and, after years of trying, the Port Authority finally convinced a bank to install automated teller machines earlier this year. It quickly became one of the city's busiest A.T.M. centers.
Worldwide Plaza, the five-year-old complex between 49th and 50th Streets, has no vacancies for either commercial or residential space.
As a result, real-estate executives and property owners voice much optimism about the avenue's future. "Eighth Avenue is going to have a fantastic decade," said Arthur Zeckendorf, whose family built Worldwide Plaza and is scouting for other opportunities on the street.
But it is premature to say any corners have been turned. The street still has a dangerous edge, and considerable low-level drug dealing continues, despite beefed-up police efforts.
"There are about 30 junkies on the corner every morning when I walk my dog," said the Rev. Dale D. Hansen, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church on 46th Street, just around the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue.
But things are still better than they used to be, neighborhood people say. Child pornography, a staple of the old 42d Street a decade ago, is seldom seen on Eighth Avenue, the managers of the video stores say. And the dozens of massage parlors, more dens of violence than sex, were chased from Eighth Avenue in the early 1980's. "This was a meaner street back then," said Mr. Daly, of the midtown enforcement office.
A backhanded compliment comes from Ernest Schroeder, who runs the Full Moon bar at 46th Street. "They've eliminated the low-lifes up and down the street," he growled. "Those were my customers."
The sex shop business has changed, too. Mr. Daly says that organized crime's hold on pornography has been loosened, largely, he said, because of aggressive Federal prosecutions. Smaller entrepreneurs, many from India or Pakistan, have taken over, he said. With little capital, they tend not to offer live entertainment, but pirated, often crudely reproduced videos at $5 each or three for $12.
"There are too many video stores, and all of us hurt each other," said a worker at XXX Video at 778 Eighth Avenue. "It is a bad sign."
Rick Travis, owner of the Pleasure Palace at 733 Eighth Avenue, said that he voted for Mr. Giuliani and would do so again, but that the Mayor was wrong in trying to control sex establishments. "We pay millions of dollars in taxes and give jobs to a lot of people who normally would otherwise be unemployed," he said.
He also contended that sex shops were a benefit to property owners. The Oriental gift shop that preceded him in his space did not generate enough business to pay the rent, he said, whereas he is prompt with his.
"My landlady wanted somebody who could pay the rent," he said. "It doesn't make her a porn queen. It makes her a businessperson."
Even so, there are property owners who are declining to rent to pornographers. Reasons vary from moral considerations to concern that the value of upper floors will be lowered by renting to an objectionable tenant on the ground floor.
"We want to upgrade our property, not downgrade it," said Richard Barth, vice president of corporate properties for Chemical Bank. He said he has passed up many opportunities to get high rents from pornographers for the bank's property on the northwest corner of 43d Street.
Robert Cohen, a developer who just bought four buildings, including the defunct Covenant House social service agency between 43d and 44th streets, said he would never rent to a sex shop, despite the "crazy numbers" he said he has been offered. "You end up cannibalizing the value of your investment," he said.
Peer pressure is also a factor. Carvel Moore, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, which includes Eighth Avenue from 35th to 41st Streets, says more than 80 percent of the landlords there have signed agreements not to rent to sex shops.
Among them is Mark Orbach, whose commercial space at 585 Eighth Avenue was vacant for almost a year. He heard generous offers from sex merchants, but owners of neighboring buildings begged him not to accept them. They even enlisted his rabbi to lobby him.
The result was that Mr. Orbach rented his space to a clothing store for 60 percent of what he could have taken in from a pornographer; his neighbors gave him money to help him make up for the loss. "I would like to clean up Eighth Avenue," he explained.

HEADLINE: Pataki Asks Cuomo's Help In Holding Down Spending

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Showing increasing concern about the state's fiscal condition, Governor-elect George E. Pataki asked Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today to freeze state hiring, delay signing new contracts and impose a moratorium on other major spending commitments until he takes office on Jan. 1.
Mr. Pataki's request came on a day he said New York's deepening fiscal problems would make it "more difficult" to fulfill his campaign promise to cut taxes deeply without noticeably reducing government services. 
 But he said he remained committed to his tax-cut plan, though he provided few details about how he might cut spending.
"Obviously, when you're facing a multibillion-dollar deficit that we did not anticipate, it's going to be more difficult and going to require a harder look at programs and personnel," Mr. Pataki told reporters in Williamsburg, Va., where he was attending a meeting of the Republican Governors Association. "And that's just a fact of life."
Mr. Pataki, who left Williamsburg for a weeklong working vacation with his family in Florida, spoke to Mr. Cuomo this afternoon about his requests and followed up the conversation with a letter that he released.
Because the Cuomo administration projects a gap in next year's state budget of at least $4 billion, Mr. Pataki wrote, "I would request certain discretionary actions that might occur in the normal course of business be delayed until my administration has had the opportunity to review them next year, particularly those that would result in potentially exacerbating this deficit problem."
Mr. Pataki said that he made the request "with clear understanding and utmost respect that you as Governor and your administration must and should be responsible for the state government, its policies and actions throughout the remainder of your term."
Mr. Cuomo responded in a letter of his own that he would keep state costs low, but he did not explicitly agree to Mr. Pataki's requests. "We intend to manage our budget situation so as to keep costs as low as possible while still meeting our obligations," Mr. Cuomo wrote. "In addition, my budget director will work to limit the filling of vacant positions in the state general fund work force."
Mr. Pataki asked for a freeze on hiring, promotions and reclassifications of state workers in all but essential areas, a delay in signing new state contract awards, including construction contracts, and a "moratorium on any other major commitments that can be reasonably delayed until after Jan. 1, 1995." Spokesmen for the Cuomo administration and the State Comptroller's office said early this evening that they could not determine how many state employees had been hired since the Nov. 8 election.
Mr. Pataki said in Williamsburg today that at the time he proposed his plan to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years, he expected next year's budget gap to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. The Cuomo administration disclosed after the election that the gap could be as much as $4 billion, and perhaps more, in a general fund budget that is $34 billion this year.
Mr. Cuomo's top aides have said that it was clear when this year's state budget was passed in June that the gap in next year's budget would be at least $3 billion. And Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Columbia County Republican whom Mr. Pataki has appointed to lead his budget task force during the transition, said today that he thought at the time that the gap would be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.
During the campaign, Mr. Pataki said he could pay for his income tax cut through growth in state revenues, which he projected at 6 percent a year, and by keeping growth in state spending to the rate of inflation. "I believe we can do it without cutting services in a way that people are going to look and say, 'My God, I've lost this service,' " Mr. Pataki said in an Oct. 7 interview with The New York Times.
Today Mr. Pataki said that in light of the increased gap, "We are going to have to look very carefully at all the different options as to how we can cut costs. We talked during the campaign about a targeted hiring freeze, and we're certainly going to have to do that. We talked about cutting political patronage jobs. We're going to have to do that."
At the governors conference, Mr. Pataki received advice from those of his counterparts who also came into office facing large budget gaps, and most said he should prepare to make deep cuts.
Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who said he and his Legislature cut about a third of his state's projected spending over four years, recalled that he "left a lot of jobs vacant" and imposed a 5 percent pay cut for state workers. And Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, who said he cut $1.8 billion out of a $13.7 billion budget by eliminating one out of every nine state jobs, said he advised Mr. Pataki, "If you're going to step on toes, kick over the milk boxes and gore sacred oxen, it's better to do it all at once."

HEADLINE: Ameritech Forcefully Stays Home

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Richard C. Notebaert, the chairman of the Ameritech Corporation, opened a newspaper here last May to find a startling full-page advertisement by AT&T.
"Check your phone bill -- you may be surprised at what you're paying," the ad said, offering a 10 percent discount from Ameritech prices for calls to points farther than 15 miles. 
 AT&T was muscling in on the market for calls between places as close to one another as downtown Chicago and the suburb of Winnetka -- a market dominated by Ameritech, the regional Bell company that provides local phone service in Illinois and four other Midwestern states.
Mr. Notebaert ordered an immediate counterattack -- radio, television and print ads. "DO NOTHING," urged one set of ads. "Trick or treat indeed," snarled another, arguing that AT&T's savings were largely illusory and that customers would have to dial an extra five digits to complete calls through AT&T.
Such competition for the local telephone market is developing in New York, Maryland and other states, and on a more narrow basis in most big cities. But nowhere is the fight more ferocious than in Chicago, because Ameritech has been girding for competition -- and even banking on it -- far more than any of the other Bell companies.
"They almost have a biker mentality about defending their territory," said Jack Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
While many other regional Bells have been seeking nationwide opportunities in video services and wireless communications, Ameritech has decided to focus on its own five-state Great Lakes region and its core telecommunications network. It was conspicuously absent from the merger frenzy last year among telephone and cable television companies, and this fall it spurned invitations to join long-distance carriers or other Bell companies in a national alliance to develop wireless communications networks.
"Ameritech has really stuck to its knitting," William Vogel, an analyst with NatWest Securities, said. "They think the telephone business is a great business and see no need to de-emphasize it."
But defending its franchise will not be easy. Because of recent decisions by Illinois regulators intent on ending monopoly control of local telephone service, and thanks to the sheer size of the Chicago market, this city has in recent months become a magnet for new telephone ventures. In the process, it has become a laboratory for changes sweeping telecommunications.
Ameritech has been aggressively promoting a sort of grand bargain with Federal regulators. The company would agree to open its network fully to all rivals, giving up any preferences it now enjoys in exchange for being allowed to enter the long-distance and cable television markets. Such a trade-off is the core principle of legislation, applying to all phone companies, that almost passed Congress last month and will be debated again next year. The general principle is supported by all Bell companies, but they objected sharply to many crucial details and blocked the bill's passage.
Ameritech has also waged a successful campaign to persuade regulators to give it more flexibility on profits and pricing. The new regulatory policies allow Ameritech to keep almost all the profits it can squeeze out from improved efficiency, typically in exchange for a commitment to freeze or lower the price of basic phone service.
In its own house, Ameritech has slashed jobs and other costs to become the most efficient of the Bells, and it is cutting crucial prices aggressively. As a result, analysts say, Ameritech may be the phone company best positioned for the new competitive era.
"Competition will be good for everyone, including us," said Mr. Notebaert, 47, who assumed the post when William L. Weiss retired in May. "Look at AT&T. Their market share in long distance has dropped from 100 percent to 60 percent, but they are stronger than ever."
The list of Ameritech's current and aspiring rivals is a long one. MFS Communications has built a fiber optic network in downtown Chicago and some outlying suburbs that stretches several hundred miles. So has Teleport Communications Group, based in New York.
MCI Communications, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, has announced plans to offer both residential and business service in Illinois -- as well as New York and four other states -- as early as next year. Time Warner Inc., the nation's second-largest cable television company, plans to compete against Ameritech in much of Ohio. Sprint, the third-largest long-distance company, has just formed an alliance with three cable television companies and plans to offer both wired and wireless services.
Chicago will be one of the Sprint team's first targets. Helping lead the way is Teleport Communications, which operates fiber optic networks in 19 cities and is owned by Sprint's three cable partners: Tele-Communications Inc., the Comcast Corporation and Cox Enterprises.
Teleport, which occupies almost a full floor in the Sears Tower building, plus switching centers around the area, has already announced that it will start residential phone service in January in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.
The list of rivals does not stop there. AT&T, the world's biggest long-distance carrier, is pursuing its attack on Ameritech's lucrative business in "toll calls." These are calls that cover distances of more than eight miles but stop short of the true long-distance calls that Federal rules bar Bell companies like Ameritech from carrying.
These toll calls, between places like downtown Chicago and suburbs like Schaumberg, are billed by time and distance. Because customers must dial extra digits if they use a long-distance carrier for such calls, Ameritech has been able to keep toll calls almost exclusively to itself. Toll calls represent a $1.4 billion business for the company in its five-state region. But AT&T, despite the extra-digit drawback, has made a target of this business, promoting discounts it says can be as much as 30 percent.
Ameritech is countering in a number of ways. In Washington, it has proposed what it calls its Customer First plan: opening its network totally to competition in exchange for being allowed to enter the long-distance and cable television markets. The Justice Department's antitrust division has been negotiating with Ameritech, and a decision could come early next year.
Richard H. Brown, vice chairman of Ameritech, said his company would prosper amid competition if it was allowed to enter the long-distance business. "Forty percent of our business is already subject to active competition," he said in a recent interview, referring to areas like cellular telephones and Yellow Pages listings.
If the Customer First plan is accepted, Mr. Brown said, it will expose about $1 billion of Ameritech's $12 billion in revenues to new competition while allowing it to compete for $8 billion in long-distance service that originates within its region.
Ameritech is eager for full competitive freedom because customers are already beginning to pursue the fruits of competition. In Chicago, Chrysler Systems, a computer leasing subsidiary of the Chrysler Corporation, leases high-speed lines from Teleport and has cut the cost of long-distance calls within Illinois by more than 15 percent.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest commodity futures exchange, uses several companies to provide the high-speed lines that relay transaction data. And Frank Romer, the exchange's director of telecommunications, has thought of using Ameritech's rivals for the thousands of telephone lines used by trading firms on the exchange floor. "We've been offered options on dial-tone service that are cheaper than what we pay now," he said.
To be sure, competition for ordinary local phone service is still limited. Mr. Romer said he was reluctant to switch carriers for ordinary voice service because thousands of people would have to change their phone numbers, a big disruption. Ameritech has agreed in principle to install technology that would let customers take their phone numbers with them when they switch -- but not until Ameritech wins more freedom for itself.
For all of Ameritech's free-market talk, rivals complain that the company has been balking about negotiating on several important issues. Last month, MFS Communications complained to Illinois regulators that Ameritech was refusing to discuss terms on which it and rivals would compensate one another when each completed calls for the other's customers. For now, MFS must pay Ameritech when an MFS customer calls an Ameritech customer -- but also when an Ameritech customer calls one served by MFS.
"They talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk," complained Royce M. Holland, president of MFS Communications. "To us, the Customer First plan sounds more like the Me First plan."
Even as the regulatory battles grind on, the economics of competition are inciting Ameritech's rivals to become more aggressive.
Robert Anunziata, chief executive of Teleport Communications, said his company would have to expand beyond business services and into serving residential customers. "Our business users will be using our switches very heavily during the day, but at night the usage is very limited," he said. "That's when residential usage picks up. Business and residential service complement each other."
Ameritech makes a similar argument on why it needs to enter long-distance business, saying that it must be a "full service" provider. Slowly but surely, state and Federal regulators are heading toward such full competition from all sides. When that happens, consumers will learn which of the rivals can fulfill its promise.

Brazil Supply Report Pushes Orange Juice Prices Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Orange juice prices plunged yesterday after an estimate of Brazil's orange production showed much less drought damage than traders expected.
Coffee prices extended a recent decline to five-month lows, as additional rainfall in Brazil lifted prospects for coffee production there as well. Since late September, coffee prices have dropped by one-third. 
 Steep declines in soybean and pork prices pushed the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 1.22 points, to 231.50, the inflation index's lowest level since Oct. 14.
On the New York Cotton Exchange, orange juice for January delivery fell 10 cents, to 107.55 cents a pound, and subsequent contracts dropped the maximum 5-cent limit.
The Brazilian Citrus Exporters Association estimated this year's supply in the state of Sao Paulo at 277 million 90-pound boxes, compared with 292 million boxes estimated at the end of September. The state accounts for nearly 90 percent of Brazil's orange production.
"The market was looking for a 10 percent drop in the Brazilian crop estimate due to effects of a prolonged drought," said Warren Seeley, a trader with Arcal Brokerage. "But it appears they only lost about 5 percent of their crop."
Orange juice prices have risen 31 percent since Oct. 7, largely on the basis of drought damage in Brazil.
Florida's orange crop was not affected by the recent pass of Tropical Storm Gordon, which destroyed millions of dollars worth of other crops.
Coffee prices extended a recent selloff. Coffee for December delivery fell 8.75 cents, to $1.5865 a pound, while coffee for March delivery lost 8.65 cents, to $1.6370, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
A sharp decline in soybean oil prices and reports of stepped-up farmer selling of soybeans weighed on soybean prices at the Chicago Board of Trade. January soybeans fell 7 cents, to $5.635 a bushel.
Crude oil prices were little changed as traders anticipated the chance that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would decide to maintain current production quotas.

Early Dollar Rally vs. Mark Fades in New York Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the German mark in European trading early yesterday before retreating in New York as traders tried to determine whether the dollar's recent gains were justified.
"There is still a bullish mentality toward the dollar," said Frank Pusateri, vice president of foreign exchange sales at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
 The dollar has been stronger against the mark and Japanese yen in recent weeks. Traders have attributed the gains to higher interest rates in the United States, which make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive and to the possibility of another large round of dollar-buying by the United States to prop up the value of the dollar.
The dollar has also gained, some traders say, on expectations that Republican control of Congress will lead to spending cuts, lower taxes and a reduced Federal deficit.
The dollar rose to 1.5640 marks in intraday trading yesterday, its highest level since Sept. 2. In late New York trading, the dollar fell back to 1.5562 marks, barely up from 1.5548 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 98.34 yen, from 98.56 on Friday.
The dollar continues to be weighed down by a number of concerns, including a weak American bond market and the United States deficit. Some traders say that the Federal Reserve's increases in short-term interest rates this year have not been sufficient to quell worries about inflation, which erodes the value of bonds and holds down the demand for dollars by foreign investors.
Investment fund managers and corporations that hold currency positions for months "haven't gotten into the fray" of buying dollars, said Amy Smith, senior currency strategist at the IDEA consulting firm.
Dealers are looking ahead to a meeting of the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council on Thursday.
Stephen Axilrod, a former top official at the Fed who is now an economic consultant in New York, said there was a 50 percent chance that the German central bank would ease rates again. A strong mark and decelerating German money-supply growth would seem to give the Bundesbank room to ease its credit stance, he said.
In other currency trading in New York, the British pound edged up to $1.5678, from $1.5655 on Friday. The dollar, firming Friday's gains against the Swiss franc, rose to 1.3190 Swiss francs, from 1.3185 francs on Friday.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
The Future Lies Ahead, Perhaps Far, Far Ahead

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MANES 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS is the perfect spot for the country's biggest computer convention. Like the enormous marquees for shows like "Sooper Dogs," computer ballyhoo greatly exceeds reality. A city literally built on silicon and chockablock with hotels masquerading as tropical islands, showboats and pirate dens seems a particularly fitting place to promote boxes once devoted to staid scientific calculations but now decked out in hardware and software trappings that can simulate even aerobatics so realistically that airsickness bags may become useful peripherals.
Year after year, fall Comdex charmingly demolishes the myth of the universality and importance of the information highway. No matter how wired they might be, more than 190,000 hardcore infomaniacs and salespeople insist on abandoning virtuality and transport their physical persons to the desert to press buttons and the flesh. 
 This year's most obvious novelty was multimedia pornography, largely traditional stuff transferred to CD-ROM. Aisle upon aisle of it attracted some of the conference's biggest crowds in a vast multimedia hall occupying what was once a parking garage.
On display elsewhere was fantasy of a similar variety, the corporate propaganda that we might call technography, something first popularized at World's Fairs, where carmakers extolled the benefits of paving the universe. What the two genres have in common (aside from their music and acting) is a dream world where pure pleasure has no unintended consequences and, most incredibly, everything always works.
The purest recent example of technography was presented by the Microsoft Corporation in a film that accompanied the Comdex keynote address of the company's chairman, William H. Gates 3d.
Set in Seattle in 2005, the production revisits the "Information at Your Fingertips" theme Mr. Gates introduced in 1990. It offers a vision of homes controlled by smart digital devices, police officers equipped with screens that can transcribe speech instantly, ambulances with videophones and telemetry and schools with lots of high-tech goodies. Exactly where the money for these items might come from in a city whose citizens recently rejected bond issues for rebuilding aging school, police and library buildings is not discussed.
While the world of science fiction tends to present dystopias of unrelenting gloom, technography invariably sees technology as a virtually unmitigated good. In a scene that has become obligatory in the genre, the young hero of Microsoft's melodrama researches his class assignment with the help of a home computer linked to vast storehouses of information. Then, as in Apple Computer Inc.'s "Knowledge Navigator" demonstration (one of the great early landmarks of this form of propaganda), he delivers a flashy presentation containing approximately half a shred of information.
This triumph of production values over content utterly dazzles his teacher and peers, perhaps because he has demonstrated such an aptitude for politics or software marketing. But Microsoft's n otion that a schoolchild of 2005 will have $58.89 of discretionary digital cash to spend on a reproduction of a pre-Columbian artifact for a school project suggests that what the future really holds is rampant inflation.
In Comdex's real world, much of the future was postponed. The greatest expectations revolved around projects that are not yet products, like the operating system Microsoft originally expected to have shipped by now, recently christened Windows 95 and still unavailable. The company also announced a new on-line service, but it will not be available before the middle of next year either. The new line of PowerPC computers from I.B.M., expected since early 1994, may now arrive after next year's crocuses. What you can buy now, however, is a videotape of Microsoft's technographic extravaganza, for $9.95; no E-mail address is listed, but would-be visionaries can call (800) 369-5718.
As always, interesting technologies were on display, but their potential for success remains unclear. High-speed infrared links may give portable computers the ability to transfer data without a cable, but only if compatible devices turn up on printers and desktop machines. High-resolution flat-panel screens, shown by the NEC Corporation and the Sharp Electronics Corporation, offer improved lightweight displays that come with annoying real-world tradeoffs. As always, it is safe to predict that the unrelenting improvement of electronic hardware will bring faster, cheaper products packing more information into each inch and ounce.
But though products conforming to the new "Plug and Play" standards were much in evidence, there is little reason to expect that computers will soon be significantly easier to use or understand. A simple question to a software engineer about a CD-ROM drive elicited a disquisition about standards, drivers and BIOS'es that left my head spinning and the poor CD-ROM drive more misunderstood than ever.
In the year 2005, despite the manifold glories of the information highway, we will still be traveling to conventions like Comdex and having these conversations face to face. Our computers will understand them only in our dreams.

HEADLINE: Top International Trade Official Urges U.S. to Approve Accord

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Failure by the United States Senate to ratify the proposed new global trade agreement, the world's top trade official said yesterday, would destroy the existing world trading order, return international commerce to "the law of the jungle" and deprive the world of an estimated $500 billion in economic gains by the year 2005.
 Addressing a press conference at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, the official, Peter Sutherland, who heads the Geneva organization that regulates international commerce, said it was inconceivable to him that the Senate could reject an accord that has been supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations. 
 But with the Senate preparing to vote on the agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, amid signs of resistance from Republicans, Mr. Sutherland warned that failure to ratify it would "destroy the credibility of the existing trading system" and create a growing risk of trade wars as countries retreated into beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
"It would be the law of the jungle," Mr. Sutherland said, adding that if the United States failed to ratify the agreement from the Uruguay round of negotiations then other partners to the accord would also renege on reducing trade barriers and extending international trade law into new fields, like the protection of intellectual property rights.
In recent days Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is likely to become chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, has called for the vote to be postponed into next year. And Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said over the weekend that he wanted passage of the trade measure linked to a cut in the capital gains tax.
Other conservative senators have expressed fears that the agreement requires the United States to give up too much sovereignty to the proposed new World Trade Organization.
Such indications of weakening support for the agreement have caused dismay among America's trading partners in Europe and elsewhere, raising the possibility of a trans-Atlantic economic clash.
Mr. Sutherland focused on the economic gains all countries are expected to make under the new agreement. He said a new study predicts that the world's total annual income gain from freer trade in goods alone would be $510 billion by the year 2005, against an earlier estimate of $235 billion. In practice the gain would be greater because freer trade in services is not included in this calculation.
On the most optimistic assumptions in the study, the United States stands to gain $122 billion in additional income from the growth of its exports and imports. The study says the comparable figures for the 12 European Union members is $164 billion, for Japan $27 billion and for the developing world together and the countries in transition between Communism and capitalism, $116 billion.
The study also estimates that America's exports and imports would both increase by as much as 21.7 percent and those of the European Union by up to 19.4 percent.

HEADLINE: The Right Thinkers: Some Voices in the New Political Conversation

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
It was only two years ago that the hottest think tanks, the most sought-after strategists and the most visible political organizations were the ones devoted to charting bold new directions for the "New Democrats." They talked about "third ways" and "reinventing government." They talked about spending government money -- "strategically," of course.
No more. 
 The hot strategists in Washington today are those who helped think the conservative movement back to power and are now happily meeting, planning and networking over how to use that power in the next two years. They are consumed with the grand task of building an enduring conservative majority: by reclaiming the tax issue, using the energy of conservative Christians, capitalizing on the politics of values and, perhaps most of all, stoking the public's anger toward big government and the appetite for rolling it back.
Since Election Day, the nation's capital has been utterly in thrall to this new conservative ascendancy, or Reagan II, as some conservatives call it. The Heritage Foundation has reclaimed its 1980's glow. The world view of Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the likely House Speaker, always available to loyal viewers of C-Span, is now parsed and pored over by a city of political professionals. Sales of his 20-hour videotaped course, "Renewing American Civilization," are soaring.
William Kristol, the conservative strategist who long predicted that health care plans would be the Democrats' Afghanistan ("not a threat but an opportunity for us"), has acquired the status of all-purpose seer. And the Contract With America, the House Republicans' list of campaign promises from tax cuts to term limits, is now considered a Baedeker to the 104th Congress.
"What's caught this city, the political class and the media class by surprise is that the political conversation has totally changed its terms," said Terry Eastland, a top official in the Justice Department during Ronald Reagan's Administration. "So that the entire conversation is, 'How do we limit and downsize government?' "
In the House, which has become ground zero for the revolution, Mr. Gingrich, Representative Dick Armey, the incoming majority leader, and a handful of other members are scrambling to prepare for the first 100 days; away from Capitol Hill, several strategists are thinking further with the new political calculus. For those seeking to adjust to the transition -- or, as some Republicans put it, the "transformation" -- what follows is a sampling of conservative strategists to watch:
 
William Kristol
Head of political group who resisted compromise
At 41, Mr. Kristol already has a long conservative pedigree, as the son of the commentator Irving Kristol and a former top aide to William Bennett, Secretary of Education, and Vice President Dan Quayle. But Mr. Kristol rose to new prominence over the last two years by writing a series of widely circulated memorandums that challenged the conventional wisdom on health.
These days, with the advantage of hindsight, the risks to the Democrats in advancing a big overhaul of the health care system seem obvious. But in early 1993, the Republicans were the ones who seemed in danger -- of being outmaneuvered on domestic policy as they were in the 1992 campaign, of being latecomers and foot-draggers for a vast new benefit program for the middle class.
Mr. Kristol played heretic, arguing against the idea that there was, in fact, a health care crisis; he also urged Republicans to resist any effort at making a grand compromise with the Democrats on the issue. "I never thought we faced an inevitably dominant resurgence of liberalism," he said, then and now. "I always thought '92 was a rejection of Bush, not an endorsement of activist government."
A Ph.D. in government from Harvard who left a career in academia, Mr. Kristol is chairman of a political group known as the Project for the Republican Future and is a longtime believer in "limited government." He sees the next two years as crucial to laying the groundwork for a Republican return to the White House. At the risk, he says, of offending more pure-minded conservatives, he argues that the party needs to "build for the long haul" on Capitol Hill and "shed the minority mind-set of let's do everything we can all at once."
 
Grover Norquist
An ally of Gingrich and foe of new taxes
If there was one issue that tormented conservatives in their 1992 electoral debacle, it was taxes; specifically, watching their party lose its image as the anti-tax party after President George Bush broke his "read my lips" pledge and signed on to the 1990 budget agreement. To Grover Norquist, this was simple heresy -- then, now and in time to come.
Mr. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is part of the Gingrich/Armey network on Capitol Hill and is considered an expert on populist anti-tax movements. Since the late 1980's, his organization has been circulating pledges among candidates, asking them to forswear new taxes; 185 in the new House and 28 in the Senate have now signed them.
"The tax issue is the central divide between the two parties," Mr. Norquist said. "That's the centerpiece: The Republican Party is saying, 'No more money and power to Washington; turn off the spigot.' And the Democratic Party is saying, 'No, no, more money and more power.' "
The 38-year-old Mr. Norquist, a former executive director of the National Taxpayers Union, says the American public now sees the connection very clearly between smaller government and lower taxes. He can envision no tax increase that he could ever support, and sees the next two years as a time to begin to "radically restructure Washington."
 
Ralph Reed
Christian Coalition leader and family advocate
Tony Blankley, spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, said this week: "The organized Christian vote is roughly to the Republican Party today what organized labor was to the Democrats. It brings similar resources: people, money and ideological conviction." Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, is widely credited with bringing a new political sophistication to this crucial segment of the party.
Mr. Reed says he saw the challenge of the past two years as bridging the gap between the Republican Party's economic conservatives and those more oriented to the social and moral issues, like many of his constituents. Both welfare reform and tax relief for middle-class families were issues that connected "the great divide," he said. In surveys of Christian Coalition members, "We've found these voters are hungering for a broader agenda that addresses the financial strain on the family as well as moral pressures."
Looking ahead, Mr. Reed says he is keenly aware of the dangers of over-reaching, especially on issues like prayer in the school. "Social change proceeds in America with deliberate and slow steps," he said. "Our desire to restore the centrality of the family will take place over decades, not years. The mistake that frankly the religious conservative movement made in the early 1980's with Reagan, and the gay rights movement made with Clinton, was: 'O. K., we won. Now we want, in turn, our entire agenda legislated immediately.' "
Mr. Blankley says: "Newt has said that they have a seat at the table. We want them at the table."
 
William Bennett
Former Education chief who writes on values
Mr. Bennett, the former Education Secretary who took to the campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was utterly clear on the meaning of this election. "It was about limited government, about the end of the nanny state," he says. It was about beginning to reverse "the discharge of responsibilities from families and communities and local governments onto the Federal Government," and reviving personal responsibility.
After the 1992 Republican National Convention, many analysts believed that the campaign for traditional values had proven too divisive, too dangerous to inject into mainstream politics. Mr. Bennett said that all that was proven was this, "Using the values issues as a club and stick, that's not right." With his best-selling book, "A Book of Virtues," and his writing and speaking, Mr. Bennett did much to revive these issues in the past few years.
"Why did it come back? Because that's what it's all about," Mr. Bennett said. "The question I'd get asked was: 'What's going on with America? Are our wheels coming off? Are we losing this great republic? Is it getting nasty and mean and brutal and coarse, and can we get it back?' " Every major policy proposal should be viewed through these concerns, he says.
Mr. Bennett added that this new conservative ascendancy "won't work" if lawmakers simply cut programs for the poor, "but middle-class subsidies remain the same." Asked for examples, he suggests lawmakers start looking at financing for the arts and humanities, the Department of Education and agriculture programs.
Mr. Bennett is a co-director of Empower America, a conservative political group.
 
Vin Weber
A former lawmaker and friend of Gingrich
Another co-director of Empower America, Vin Weber is also a longtime friend and former House colleague of Mr. Gingrich's. After serving six terms as a representative from Minnesota, including a stint in the Republican leadership, Mr. Weber announced his retirement in 1992. Since then, he has made himself felt from his perch at Empower America.
Mr. Weber, who was chairman of Jack Kemp's Presidential campaign in 1988, describes the challenge of the next two years as nothing short of "replacing a 60-year-old framework for problem solving with a new framework for problem solving" -- one less centralized, less bureaucratic. Look to the new farm bill, he suggests, as an early proving ground for these new approaches.
Mr. Weber argues that people are ready for a different kind of government -- not a passive one.
 
Kate O'Beirne
A leader in Heritage and specialist in marketing
As vice president for government relations at Heritage, Mrs. O'Beirne describes herself as immersed in the "marketing" of conservative proposals. Among them is a $500-per-child tax credit for American families, which was embraced by the Contract With America.
The Heritage analyst says that the promise of such tax cuts helps build the constituency for reducing the size of the government, "actually getting rid of the programs that we learned in the '80s are darned tough to cut."
She describes the challenge for Republicans over the next two years as "Be not afraid." Mrs. O'Beirne, who first came to Washington in the 1970's with Senator James Buckley of New York, and later served as a deputy assistant secretary at Health and Human Services under President Ronald Reagan, added that this new conservative insurgency has an edge over the last.
"We have resources that we didn't have in 1980," she said. "We had no infrastructure in 1980. Now, there's a network; there's Reagan alums and Bush alums all over town, and they have substantive expertise. You want to reform H.H.S.? We have people who know the department intimately."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Splits on Dole Threat on Trade Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Republicans split today over the decision of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to hold a worldwide trade agreement hostage to tax concessions from the White House. While a prominent Republican strategist warned against the move, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a supporter of the pact, said he would not interfere with Mr. Dole's effort.
Meanwhile, Democrats worried that the uncertainty over whether the Senate would ultimately approve the pact could erode support for the agreement in the House, where it previously seemed headed for an easy victory. 
 Mr. Dole, the likely Senate majority leader, said again today that he would be more inclined to vote for the accord if the White House dropped its objections to a cut in the capital gains tax. The accord reduces tariffs and greatly extends the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, and is the result of more than a decade of negotiations that spanned three Administrations. Until Sunday, Mr. Dole had not linked the passage of the agreement to the tax cut, long a Republican objective.
Mr. Gingrich, who is expected to become Speaker of the House in January, today reaffirmed his commitment to trying to pass the agreement in a lame-duck session that begins next week. But he declined to criticize Mr. Dole.
"The Senator is negotiating a situation in the Senate which is different from the House," he told reporters at a news conference in Atlanta. "He's a very smart negotiator, and I wouldn't attempt to critique what he's doing."
But today some other members of his own party warned that Mr. Dole was playing a dangerous game, with the possible consequence that Republicans could be blamed for the loss of one of the biggest international tax cuts in history and the failure of an important issue for the business constituents of Republicans.
"We need to get GATT ratified and out of the way," William Kristol, the Republican strategist, said in a memorandum that was widely distributed today. "From a strategic point of view, we don't want a GATT fracas to be the nation's first taste of the new Republican dispensation."
If the bill is delayed beyond the special session of Congress that will begin after Thanksgiving, Mr. Kristol said, it could overwhelm the first weeks or months of the new Republican-controlled Congress.
"The last thing we need at the start," he wrote, "is a complicated and divisive debate on GATT."
This afternoon Mr. Kristol said he had written the memorandum because "I was trying to help the Republicans walk back off this limb."
"Given the opposition out there for GATT," he said, it would not be in the best interest of Republicans "to appear to be part of a back room deal for some financial interests." He added: "If we were still a minority party, it would be reasonable to use this as a weapon. But we're not."
Mr. Kristol's memorandum underscored how divided the Republicans, traditionally the party of free trade, have become over the issue of the 124-nation trade agreement.
A growing number of Republicans have joined an odd alliance of Democratic conservatives, some Southern Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and consumer advocates like Ralph Nader in criticizing the accord.
The conservative Democrats and Southerners like Senator Helms from textile-producing states fear that the agreement will speed the importation of low-cost goods. The consumer groups argue that the new World Trade Organization, an institution created under the agreement to arbitrate trade disputes between nations, would have the power to override American environmental or consumer-protection laws that other nations view as barriers to selling goods in the American market.
The result is that the accord has become the subject of three simultaneous struggles. One is among Republicans vying for position as they prepare to take over majority control of Congress. A second is between Republicans and the Democratic White House, as Mr. Dole and others attempt to exercise their new-found powers to negotiate. And a third is a revival of the many economic interests who opposed the pact, but had given up the fight.
Mr. Dole's continued refusal to support the agreement is also beginning to erode support in the House, where passage of the agreement had not been in doubt.
Many House members who planned to vote for the agreement when passage seemed certain are now questioning whether it is wise to go on record in favor of an pact that may ultimately die in the Senate. The House is scheduled to vote on Nov. 29, and the Senate two days later.
"People don't want to be put on the line," Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader in the current Democratically controlled Congress and a supporter of the trade accord, said in an interview today. "There needs to be a sense of confidence in the Senate, or we will begin wondering in the House if we want to even bring it up."
In recent days, some Democratic leaders have been critical of the White House for failing to get President Clinton more publicly involved in the debate. "The President has probably been thinking that this is getting done, and now it is just down to the details," Mr. Gephardt said. "That was correct before, when there was an expectation of general support for GATT. But it may not be true now."

HEADLINE: Overtime Is Money, but G.M. Assembly Workers Say They've Had Enough

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JANESVILLE, Wis., Nov. 16

 BODY:
If for many workers the American dream is drifting out of reach, the 4,800 General Motors workers here have nailed it down. They own homes, cars, big-screen televisions, sometimes boats. They have the assurance of secure pensions and good medical care. Many of these men -- and most are men -- earn enough that they can comfortably support their families; their wives don't have to work.
But these workers, whether young and building families or older and planning for retirement, say they cannot enjoy what their labors have bought. G.M., they say, asks them to put in extraordinary stretches of overtime. 
 The company requires them to work 10 hours beyond the conventional 40, about twice the average overtime for American factory workers. And the company strongly encourages them to work even more hours voluntarily, so that it can sell more of the Chevrolet Suburbans and GMC medium duty trucks made here.
Products of a labor union culture that promised a good day's work for a good day's pay, these workers can afford to say that there's such a thing as too much work and more than enough pay. And that is precisely what they are doing. Indeed, they are so fed up with overtime that 92 percent voted early this month to strike if their union, the United Automobile Workers, agrees to authorize one.
Anger with overtime has erupted at other G.M. plants; the union went on strike in Flint, Mich., for four days last September. There, the company bowed to the union's demands, and agreed to hire more workers.
People here like Jack Courtney, 50, who fills in for people on breaks, want the same deal. "People don't just want the money," he said. "They want time with their families."
Like most assembly line workers in this city of 52,133 about 75 miles southwest of Milwaukee, Mr. Courtney is paid about $18.50 an hour before overtime kicks in; $27.75 with it. He said that his U.A.W. Local 95 here thought it had made a sweet deal in 1986 when it agreed to four 10's -- a four-day work week of 10-hour days, with three days off. But the contract also provided for a fifth 10-hour day if the company felt it was needed. Such days were rare at first, but became routine about four years ago.
"Then they went to eight hours on Saturdays," Mr. Courtney said as he drank beer at the G.M. workers' watering hole, Zachow's, on the edge of the plant's grounds. "A lot work Sundays, too. After two or three years of it people are tired."
No one is forced to work beyond the mandatory 50 hours, but the company can make it hard to say no. G.M. has been losing money in its North American business this year, despite strong sales. Workers do not have to look far beyond Janesville to see the rubble of G.M. factories that died after other bouts of losses.
Michael Marcks, president of Local 95, explained: "They'll say: 'You know, we've got customers and they need our product. They could go buy product somewhere else.' You can lean on people that way."
Many other companies have moved to heavy overtime. In September and October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says factory workers put in an average of 4 hours 42 minutes of overtime a week, the most ever registered in the 38 years during which the agency has kept track.
Joe Valdez, 29, would promptly settle for a regular work week. A floater, like Mr. Courtney, he said: "I live a comfortable life. I have my house. I have my car. I have my wife. I got my kids. I got a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old.
"I got my toys, a lot of garage toys. We're saving up to go to Mexico. Forty hours a week is fine for me. If once in a while you get a 50-hour week, that's not bad. But we've got people working double shifts. We need more help in that place."
Mr. Marcks said more workers were being injured at the plant because the overtime leaves them tired, and that makes them accident-prone. But James W. Crellin, a G.M. spokesman in Detroit, said, "We have seen no statistics that would indicate an increase in the severity or frequency of accidents due to increased overtime at out facilities."
General Motors asks people at the busier of its 150 North American plants to work overtime because it is loath to take on permanent new workers. Mr. Marcks said that with the exception of temporary employees, no new workers have been hired in Janesville since 1986.
To stop periodic losses and to streamline the business, General Motors, like thousands of American manufacturers, has been restructuring and cutting its work force even as the economy grows. Almost three years ago, the company said it would eliminate 74,000 jobs; with 244,000 blue- and white-collar workers now, it is just 14,000 short of the goal.
Charles Licari, a company spokesman, said new workers cost about $42 to $43 in hourly wages and benefits, plus time and production lost to hiring and training, so that asking people to work overtime is still less expensive. The typical worker here, who earns $18.50 an hour for 40 hours, earns the standard 50 percent premium, or $27.75 for Saturday and weekday overtime, and double pay, or $37 an hour on Sundays and holidays.
For some busy executives and professional workers, 50-, 60- and even 70-hour weeks are not unusual. But there is a dimension of assembly line overtime that middle-class, white-collar workers seldom face: Management that has to ask people to work longer so that it can produce more goods often asks them to work harder and faster.
On the Suburban line here, G.M. has been stepping up production from 44 vehicles an hour to a goal of 49. Management says that robots, computers and new work methods should permit the higher production speed. But workers say any productivity increases are hurting them and the quality of their work. "We have so many seconds to do a job," said Jim Silbaugh, 44, who puts roofs on trucks. "I've got a moving table. I put the roof on the table. Then a robot picks it up and puts it on the truck."
Then, Mr. Silbaugh said, "They speed the line up. Everybody's got to hurry, hurry, hurry. Sooner or later, somebody's going to be screwing up."
Indeed, more and more finished vehicles are being sent to the plant's repair section, the workers say. A man who does paint repairs, for example, and who declined to be identified, said he works 11 1/2 hours five days a week, 12 hours on Saturday and 8 to 12 hours most Sundays. For his 80 or so hours, he earns more than $2,000. "But if they would give these people more help to do their job better," he said, "then I would think that would take care of some of the repair."
Idolina Garcia, a 40-year-old worker who installs airbags, said she feared that too much work would lead to a recurrence of the repetitive motion injury she sustained to her wrists. Last week, she says she worked only three days, more than 50 hours: Monday and Tuesday from 5:48 A.M. to 10 P.M., and Wednesday from 5:48 A.M. to 1:30 A.M.
Fred Peper, 55, works as a janitor, lifting and breaking up cardboard cartons, for the standard $18.50 an hour. Sometimes he works as much as 66 hours a week over seven days. He doesn't need the money, he said, but his grown children do. In their jobs, they don't have health insurance, so he pays his grandchildren's medical bills.
"I like my job," he said. "I feel good. I hurt, of course. My arms are numb. They're still pushing me pretty hard, but I'm used to it."
Edward Mackay, 36, said high pay could become a habit, and with it, high debt. Mr. Mackay, who tightens bolts that hold gas tanks on trucks, said he kept to the mandatory 50 hours and insisted on two days off a week.
He said he could manage easily on his $750 a week, or $38,000 a year, without the overtime that brings him to $1,000 a week. Married, with a year-and-a-half-old daughter, he has a 1985 Ford truck, a 1990 Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a two-bedroom house he bought four years ago for $23,000.
But he said some co-workers seem ill-prepared for the 40-hour week, or worse, that will reappear when the economy eventually stalls. "These guys are getting in so far over their heads," he said. "They have $200,000 homes. They've just got to have something new in that driveway so people driving by can say, 'That guy must work at G.M.' "

"Forty hours a week is fine for me," Mr. Valdez said. "If once in a while you get a 50-hour week, that's not bad. But we've got people working double shifts. We need more help in that place."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
A Renewed Modern: More of a Museum Or More Modern?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Gertrude Stein is supposed to have said, "A museum can either be a museum or it can be modern, but it cannot be both." That has been the Museum of Modern Art's dilemma for all of its 65 years, and it is truer today than it ever was.
How is the archetypal museum of the 20th century to survive into the 21st? Or to put it as Stein might have, how can the Modern remain modern after modernism? 
 As Stein knew, a collection is what makes a museum a museum, and the Modern keeps collecting. Among the first tasks assigned to Glenn D. Lowry, its recently appointed director, when he takes over full-time in July will surely be to ponder the expansion that everyone at the museum has been talking about almost since the last one 10 years ago. The Modern outgrew its new building on 53d Street even before it opened in 1984, and a decade of art since, including lots of big paintings, photographs, sculptures and installations, has only added to the museum's sense that it has a space crunch.
The Modern has been not-so-secretly looking at places to annex around town, including the Dorset Hotel next door, thus far without announcing any results. One explanation of why the museum took so long to find a new director may be that candidates didn't relish the prospect of a tenure spent dealing with real estate, not art.
Even in these straitened economic times for cultural institutions, museums accept the idea that bigger is better. Is it? There are reasons that places like the Frick, the Kimbell, the Gardner and the Freer are many people's favorites. Those museums are intimate, meaning visitors can get to know every work on view in them. The Louvre and the Metropolitan may be indispensible, but they also seem unfathomable.
The Modern is far bigger than the Frick and much smaller than the Metropolitan. Yet if it grows indefinitely, its galleries expanding to accommodate an ever-more-numerous collection, what will distinguish it, eventually, from the Met, except that it has no art from before 1880?
The question isn't quite as crazy as it may seem. Expansion at the Modern is probably unavoidable -- considering bequests that continue to come in, like the Rockefeller and Paley collections -- and not necessarily bad. But there are reasons to fret about it. Some are practical: the last expansion was a disappointment, even if it gave the museum more room and higher revenues. The Modern replaced intimacy with the ambiance of an office building. Its galleries for temporary shows have turned out to be inadequate, even grim, while the best spaces are given over to restaurants.
Most important, the galleries for the permanent collection of painting and sculpture are designed like an endless hallway. Not only must visitors wend their way from one end to the other to get in or out, but the curators must also make the history of modern art, as told through the collection, conform to the architecture. In reality, that history may be multi-layered and contradictory, but in the Modern it must look seamless, as if marching forward in an orderly manner.
The museum has long seen 20th-century art as seamless. The old Modern building had something of the same architectural arrangement, only smaller. The idea of seamlessness stemmed from the museum's founding director, Alfred H. Barr Jr. One of his most extraordinary achievements was literally to draw a chart, like the branches of a family tree, showing how everything in modernism (everything he deemed relevant, at least) grew from the same French roots -- Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat and van Gogh. Barr's approach influenced the physical layout of the museum, and his legacy was still alive in 1984 for the last expansion.
But times have changed. Barr's vision clearly needs to be reconsidered and broadened, and if the Modern is going to expand successfully, it must think not just of more square footage but also of a revised vision. At the heart of the expansion issue, in other words, is a philosophical question about the way the museum conceives of modern art.
It helps to recall something of the Modern's evolution. The museum opened in 1929 as a place devoted to the new in art. Barr and the museum's founders, aware of the dilemma that Stein described, thought at first that the Modern should possess representative works by Cezanne, van Gogh and others to put new art on view in context, but that it shouldn't be a traditional collecting institution. Barr used a torpedo metaphor. He said the permanent collection was like "a torpedo moving through time, its nose the ever advancing present, its tail the ever receding past of 50 to 100 years ago." Thus the bulk of the collection would remain in the near past and taper off as it went back in time. To remain modern, the Modern would have to avoid becoming a repository of old art.
For a while it was decided that the Modern would periodically turn over older art to the Metropolitan. But that changed after World War II. Rising prices for modern art made it imprudent for the Modern simply to give away what it owned.
At the same time, just as the United States gained hegemony in political and economic spheres, the Modern not coincidentally rose to a position of international pre-eminence in the art world. This meant not only that its exhibitions carried more weight but also that its collection assumed canonical stature. The Modern was transformed, in a sense, by its own success from a spunky and quick-footed place to an august and slow-moving one.
The museum became less spontaneous, more self-conscious about its influence, more focused on history and more reluctant to throw its authority behind young artists. Artists, meanwhile, began to react against modernism, which meant they were reacting against the museum that was synonymous with it. The Modern was increasingly attacked for being out of touch with the new, and by the late 1960's other institutions arose in New York to fill the gaps it had supposedly left. Those attacks persisted through the 80's, when the museum took conspicuously long to recognize post-modernism, and they continue to this day.
But a new generation of curators has lately come to power at the Modern. One sign of change is the rearrangement of the permanent collection by Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of painting and sculpture, to reflect more of the rough-and-tumble reality of history, although Mr. Varnedoe can still do only so much within the constraints of the Modern's galleries and its collection. Another sign is the variety of shows of new art, which is a little more extensive than before.
And yet another is the apparent willingness of curators from many departments in the museum, like photography, drawings, prints, architecture and design, to work together, thus breaking down the barriers between media that were also a holdover from the old days. Since so much contemporary art is multi-media, departmental cooperation is crucial if the museum is to dedicate itself to the new.
But should it? The Modern could just declare itself a museum specializing in the 20th century, as the Musee d'Orsay in Paris specializes in the 19th. It's a perfectly plausible goal: to elaborate on and refine the vision of 20th-century art that Barr and his colleagues developed, leaving the 21st century to someplace else.
It's plausible. But museums tend to think of themselves as sharks (not just torpedoes): they've got to keep moving to stay afloat. And at the Modern, movement has always meant expansion.
One can only hope that plans for more of it will not go forward until the museum and its incoming director have first done some hard thinking about how the new space will be used, as well as who will design it. Will it unlock the Modern from its old vision of art history and allow it more flexibility? Will it make sense of a museum in the 21st century whose collection begins in the 19th? Or will it just mean bigger rooms, more art, more restaurants, shops and bookstores? One hopes not. The Modern will have to prove Stein wrong, without simply doing more of the same, to succeed. Real estate, in some ways, will be the least of Mr. Lowry's concerns.

HEADLINE: Appellate Ruling Called a Threat to Endangered Species Act

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
IF the United States Supreme Court does not overturn a ruling from a Federal appeals panel, the Endangered Species Act might itself be threatened with de facto extinction, conservation groups, biologists and the Justice Department argue.
The department filed a petition with the Supreme Court this month asking it to reject a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the act does not prevent the destruction of the habitat of an endangered species, even if destroying the habitat means exterminating the animal. The lower court ruling, called Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Greater Oregon v. Babbitt, shocked conservationists and made them run for legal ammunition to protect the teeth of an act that is considered one of the most effective pieces of environmental legislation ever passed. 
 If the act cannot be used to protect the habitat of an endangered organism, the opponents of the new ruling insist, then it cannot protect the species and becomes an impotent husk of legislation.
The act states that it is illegal to take, kill, capture, harass or "harm" an endangered species. For the 20 years of the act's existence, the word "harm" has been interpreted to mean that the foraging, nesting or living sites on which an animal depends cannot be substantially modified. It certainly means that it cannot be destroyed altogether, said Tim Eichenberg, a lawyer with the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington, which opposes the appellate ruling.
Based on that interpretation, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has devised regulations to protect the habitat of species living on either government or private lands and to encourage property owners to take the needs of any threatened species living on their lands into account when planning development projects.
But the appeals court ruled that the word harm did not mean habitat must be protected, and that the act merely prevented an animal from being bagged or shot at outright.
"I find it totally absurd to conclude legalistically that the endangered species act did not mean to include habitat," said Dr. Thomas Eisner, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University who has been extremely active in conservation work. "This says that you can build on either side of an eagle's nest as long as you don't build right on top of the eagle." And if the eagle happens to be out hunting, he added, "then the nest also becomes fair game."
For now, the ruling only applies to the District of Columbia, but should it be upheld by the Supreme Court it would doubtless have nationwide reverberations, casting into doubt 150 habitat conservation plans proposed by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt that are in various stages of development. If there is no longer any legal incentive to protect habitat for endangered species, said Mr. Eichenberg, "then I don't think many companies or individuals now engaged in conservation planning efforts are going to bother continuing."
He said tens of thousands of acres of non-Federal lands could be affected by the ruling, and about half the 230 species listed on the roster of endangered animals and plants -- those living largely or exclusively on non-government territory -- would find their living quarters suddenly in jeopardy.
The act is thought to be responsible for rescuing a number of famously endangered beasts, among them the bald eagle, alligator, gray whale, black-footed ferret and red wolf. Many surveys show that the act enjoys vast support among the general public, though lately the act has been depicted as a drag on economic development and an example of Government obstructionism.
The case started about four years ago when a loose coalition of timberland holders, logging companies and community groups in the Oregon region used the debate over the fate of the northern spotted owl as an opportunity to begin challenging Federal rules intended to protect endangered animals.
Last year, a panel of the appeals court in the District of Columbia voted 2 to 1 to reject the group's arguments that habitat preservation was not specified by the endangered species act and instead upheld Fish and Wildlife's definition of the word harm. The Sweet Home group asked the court to reconsider, and in March the same three judges reversed their previous ruling and agreed, 2 to 1, that the act strictly referred to the immediate and direct destruction of species, not to their habitat.
The Justice Department has asked the full Court of Appeals to reconsider that decision, but it has also called on the Supreme Court to issue a ruling that would become the law of the land. Should the High Court choose to take up the case -- and many predict that it will -- the ruling is likely to be handed down by summer.
The judge who reversed himself in March was Judge Stephen F. Williams. Voting both times to protect the habitat was Chief Judge Abner J. Mikva, while Judge David B. Sentelle voted against extending such protection.

HEADLINE: Bob Dole, Trade Bully

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, the next majority leader, is exploiting his new political power by withholding approval of a world trade agreement that has taken seven years to negotiate. One reason, he says, is that the accord will threaten American sovereignty. That at least sounds noble, though Mr. Dole is wrong. His other reason is narrow and crass. As he told ABC on Sunday, he may block the trade accord unless the Administration swallows a cut in the tax on capital gains -- the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments.
Mr. Dole's behavior mirrors what the electorate decisively rejected two weeks ago: politicians who say they stand for one set of principles but act according to another. The Republican Party has proudly put the U.S. in the forefront of nations negotiating for open trade and investment. Mr. Dole supported past free-trade pacts because he recognized that they contributed mightily to world growth. The new accord would give the U.S. economy alone a boost of between $70 billion and $200 billion a year. 
 Now, however, he threatens to dishonor this tradition by sacrificing an agreement that, on average, could enrich American families by $1,000 per year -- for the sake of a proposal designed to line the pockets of already-wealthy investors. The Republican version of a capital gains tax cut would do little for the economy. But it would provide a nifty and undeserved gift for investors whose assets have appreciated over time.
Time, alas, is on Mr. Dole's side. When Congress takes up the accord next week the legislation comes under "fast track" rules, which require Congress to vote immediately and without amendments. If Mr. Dole stops approval, the legislation will carry over into next year when it may no longer be protected by fast track. Protectionist forces could add crippling amendments, which the 123 other signatory nations would surely reject. Delay, then, almost surely means defeat.
Also adding to Mr. Dole's leverage is the fact that the Government estimates that the accord, by cutting tariffs, would initially reduce government revenue. To adopt it, the Senate will need 60 votes to suspend budget rules -- a total that would appear out of reach unless Mr. Dole signs on.
The Senator apparently wants the Administration to enter a Faustian bargain. It would agree to warp estimates of future tariff revenues so that the trade pact would no longer appear to raise the deficit. But the Administration would thereby set a precedent of using optimistic revenue estimates, providing safe haven for Mr. Dole's proposals for cuts in taxes on capital gains and retirement savings. At risk is the credibility of budget estimates upon which Congress bases decisions.
Mr. Dole is apparently close to negotiating at least a cosmetic victory on sovereignty. The threat he and others have raised is mostly imaginary, but it goes like this: The World Trade Organization, which the accord would set up to adjudicate trade disputes, might capriciously rule that U.S. environmental, labor and safety laws amount to unfair trade barriers that should be struck down or answered with sanctions against U.S. exports.
Mr. Dole exaggerates the threat. Trade panels under existing international rules can already authorize sanctions against the U.S.; the new treaty does not invent new threats. The U.S. would be ultimately protected in the future, as it is now, by the unwillingness of countries to engage the U.S. in a trade war.
Besides, the U.S. has the right to pull out of the Trade Organization on six months' notice. Whatever deal Mr. Dole might strike with the Administration is likely to clarify procedures for withdrawal but is unlikely to enhance U.S. sovereignty.
Tearing apart the trade accord for the sake of a tax cut on capital gains is reckless. Few believe the tax cut can have a powerful impact on the economy. But free trade helps, enormously.

HEADLINE: Observer;
Adam Smith, Please Call

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Reading an article on popular music the other day, I was halfway through before realizing I was asleep. This was not the article's fault.
A primitive conviction that anything can be learned if you have the patience to read about it remains with me despite long experience to the contrary. Another primitive impulse, however, has lately been sending me into dreamland whenever I delve into difficult subjects. As a result, I now spend a lot of time sleeping in prose which I have entered in search of knowledge. 
Computer manuals, for example. I will never need sleeping pills as long as there's a computer manual. A page or two on RAM and ROM and I'm the sandman's most peaceful baby. A recent tract on what caused the First World War gave me the best night's sleep in a month, and on a straight-back kitchen chair too.
Only last week while writing one of these columns I had reached just about this point when I paused to read it from the top, hoping to discover what I was talking about. I might have slept past the deadline but for a panicked editor's telephoned reminder that an uncertain America awaited my guidance.
What anesthetized me in the pop-music article was a reference to punk rock and macho rock. Mere tots are totally knowledgeable on these subjects, but to me they are as remote as the moons of Uranus. To me there is only one kind of rock; namely, loud rock.
It's wonderful that anybody has ears subtle enough to tell punk rock from macho rock, nerd rock or rock-'em-sock-'em rock. I am ashamed that I can't do it, and would like to learn, but an ancient inner voice whispers, "Nobody can master everything, pal, so why not settle for a little nap?"
"Well," you may ask if you are Alan Greenspan, "if you're not qualified to dilate on simple rocks, how can you dare talk about economics, as you obviously intend to do?"
The answer is I'm not going to talk about economics, but merely ask a few simpleton's questions. These have occurred to me over the past few weeks just before falling into deep slumber from opening paragraphs of economics news stories.
For instance, about the Federal Reserve people constantly raising interest rates: I know they do it for our own good. To prevent inflation. And I understand that inflation would be a terrible disaster.
I also understand that whether we're hit by the inflation catastrophe depends on people who buy and sell bonds. If they think we are inflation bound, it's "So long, sweetheart!"
They start buying or maybe selling bonds -- I'm not sure which -- at a prodigious rate, and the whole country is kaput. So obviously, having us at their mercy, they must be kept happy. Meaning, assured that inflation is not in the cards.
That's why Mr. Greenspan and company have to keep raising rates. And bless them in this good work, say I. There's a drawback though. Raising rates keeps the economy hissing and knocking like a car with a missing cylinder.
With each rate rise, businesses that are about to boom slow down instead. Out-of-work people with good job prospects remain out of work instead.
This unhappiness -- misery for some -- is all for the greater good of the whole country. Hence, commendable. Failing businessmen and jobless people are doing heroic service. By going down the drain, by not working, they are keeping the bond people from dropping the inflation bomb.
My question is this: Shouldn't the country treat these people at least as well as it treats its military people? They get uniforms, decent salaries, early-retirement pension plans.
Why not the same for the businessmen ducking the bankers' artillery, the unemployed working stiffs living on pasta and beans? They're on the front line every day sacrificing to keep a terrifying bond market at bay.
This leads to a second economics question; to wit, why are politicians suddenly so eager to make welfare people take jobs? Here is the Federal Reserve doing its best to keep unemployment high so as to pacify bond people, while politicians insist that these already unemployed welfare people become dis-unemployed.
Does this make economic sense? Wake me if you find out.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Gets Shortchanged on Subway Station Renovation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 15 news article on renewal of subway work in Flushing, Queens, raises great concerns for the residents and commuters of Brooklyn. For the New York City administration to target a single renovation project in one borough is an oversight that needs correction. 
 A look at the last decade of Metropolitan Transportation Authority use of capital funds shows that though Brooklyn has 36 percent of the stations in the city transit system, only 17 percent of M.T.A. station renovations between 1982 through 1991 were done in Brooklyn.
That is why Brooklyn's elected officials and transit riders fought to insure that Brooklyn would have the largest share of station renovations in the current five-year capital improvement plan. Of 93 stations scheduled for rehabilitation before 1997, 41 are in Brooklyn.
This week we learned that 13 of these projects have been canceled. These include two, the Franklin Shuttle and Atlantic Terminal, that are vital to the thousands of people who live, work and go to school in Brooklyn. These are grave omissions, and they need to be restored.
The condition of stations on the Franklin Avenue Shuttle line may be the system's worst. Further delay in making repairs to the line may mean the loss of an entire transportation system for Crown Heights and central Brooklyn.
Additionally, by any measure, Atlantic Terminal must remain on the M.T.A.'s list for immediate rehabilitation. Conditions at this busy transportation complex in downtown Brooklyn are also among the worst in the city.
This complex, which serves 10 subway lines and connects the system with the Long Island Rail Road, is Brooklyn's Grand Central Terminal, serving 140,000 commuters daily. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's own staff survey has urgently recommended this much-needed rehabilitation.
The M.T.A.'s failure to finance rehabilitation of the Atlantic Terminal complex will be a serious setback to the economic resurgence under way in the commercial center of Brooklyn, which is generating new jobs, new housing and new commercial activity.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY PLANS TO CUT PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAID 20%

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
New Jersey officials said today that they planned to cut the amount of money hospitals receive to care for Medicaid patients by 20 percent starting in March. William Waldman, the State Human Services Commissioner, said he expected a court challenge, but is confident the move, which would reduce hospital reimbursements by $135 million annually, would be upheld.
"We cannot be in the business of subsidizing hospitals," Mr. Waldman told reporters at a meeting in his office. "We must become the purchasers of services that are delivered efficiently and economically." 
 New Jersey now pays the third highest Medicaid rates in the country, behind Rhode Island and New York, Mr. Waldman said, and the proposed rate changes would place the state closer to the national average. The cuts would simply be made across the board, based on the amounts of the previous year's reimbursements, regardless of the number of patients served. Under state law, no one may be refused medical care.
Medicaid is one of the largest and fastest-growing costs for state governments, in many cases the second biggest outlay after education. In recent years, state officials across the country have taken a variety of approaches to lower expenses, limiting prescription drug use as well as coverage for certain procedures considered optional, like fertility operations.
One approach is to lower compensation to providers: hospitals and doctors. For example, Kentucky has recently proposed a $50 million reduction in Medicaid payments to physicians.
Although Mr. Waldman said the cutback is not intended to be a budget-saving device, he said it was inspired in part by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's philosophy of making government "smarter, leaner and more effective." But he also called Medicaid "the Pac-Man" of government, eating up the state budget, and said program costs were increasing at a rate of 18 percent a year, threatening possible service cuts in the future.
The announcement was a surprise and shock to hospital administrators. Gary S. Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said, "Slashing payment rates to hospitals by 20 percent at a time when demand for services is increasing and proposed alternatives like managed care for Medicaid is still on the drawing board is wrong.
"In the long run, these cuts will hurt the most vulnerable hospitals and most vulnerable people in the state," Mr. Carter said, in a written statement released through his office. "Hospitals are not in favor of any cuts that would undermine the mission and integrity of the entire Medicaid payment system."
Administrators of many of the association's 100 member hospitals will meet on Monday to come up with a more complete response to the announcement, he said.
Ron Jones, the chief financial officer of United Hospitals Medical Center and Children's Hospital in Newark, learned that his hospital's Medicaid reimbursements will drop to $32.5 million from $40.6 million if the changes are finally approved.
"I can't imagine setting a budget with $8 million less," he said. "We might have to curtail services at some point." Mr. Jones said half of the 10,000 patients the hospital admits each year are Medicaid recipients. The medical center has 345 beds and a $140 million annual budget.
"I hope we can at least convince the state to phase in these cuts so we don't have to deal with them all at once," he said. "We'll have to think about increasing the number of insured patients we serve, but that would take several months and probably wouldn't make up for all the loss."
Michael Sparer, an assistant professor of health in the School of Public Health at Columbia University, said there are frequent challenges across the country over hospital reimbursement rates by state-run Medicaid programs. "The states win some contests and some they don't," he said.
The test for the courts is whether the reimbursement is "reasonable" and whether the hospitals are providing "efficient and economic" services, he said.
"I think New Jersey has a better chance of winning because it has always paid hospitals above cost," Professor Sparer said. The national reimbursement rate is about 80 percent, he said, but in a report released last year by the Congressional Research Service, New Jersey was reported to have paid hospitals 105 percent of costs in 1990, the last year covered by the report.
The Medicaid cuts are one of several financial pressures on the hospital industry. In recent years Congress has regularly limited its increases in compensation for the Medicare program for the elderly, and private insurers have used their managed-care programs to negotiate lower compensation rates.
In New York, Governor-elect George E. Pataki has appointed a task force headed by Elizabeth P. McCaughey, the Lieutenant Governor-elect, to examine the state's $20 billion Medicaid program for possible economies.
James R. Tallon, the president of the United Hospitals Fund of New York, said, "There is also pressure to cut Medicaid spending in other states, and if it disproportionately affects urban hospitals it could make it difficult for them to survive."
John Holahan, director of the health policy research center at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, said, "There are lots of ways cut back on Medicaid, but not many pain-free ways." The same hospitals that care for most of the Medicaid patients are those that have a lot of charity care, he said.
"You can probably find some fat in administrative costs but at some point you're going to get into the muscle," he said. Mr. Holahan said the search for economies comes as Congress is preparing to look at Medicare next year. "You could see hospitals scrambling to remain competitive," he said.
New York, New Jersey and most other states are moving to managed-care systems, aimed at getting patients out of emergency rooms and into health centers where they can get preventive and primary care. So far, 420,000 of the New York's 2.5 million Medicaid patients are in managed care, but the goal is to enroll half by the year 2000.
New Jersey has enrolled 46,000 of about 400,000 people who receive welfare through the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program and hopes to have most receiving their health care through health maintenance organizations in another two years.
Indiana trimmed its Medicaid program by $100 million in 1993 and is looking to make $400 million more in cuts this year. Critics there have charged that the service reductions are too severe and say the two-year Medicaid reduction program should be stopped.
In Massachusetts, Gov. William Weld, a Republican, recently stopped paying for fertility treatments for women on Medicaid. In 1993, his administration, with support from the Democratic Legislature, negotiated lower rates with nursing homes and hospitals and moved 250,000 Medicaid recipients into managed care.
Until two years ago, New Jersey, like many other states, paid for charity care by adding a 19 percent surcharge to the hospital bills of paying patients or those with insurance. That system also covered bad debts, which could conceivably been used to pay for any shortfall in Medicaid reimbursement.
But under the new system, which runs through the end of the next year, charity care is being financed by borrowing $1.6 billion from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and bad debts are not covered.
Hospital administrators say that if they can't find the economies in their operations the state is seeking, then they will have no choice but to cut services. Ron Napiorski, chief financial officer for University Hospital, a teaching hospital at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the $14 million cut the hospital is scheduled to experience could force a reduction in its training program for interns and residents.
Mr. Waldman said the cutback in Medicaid payments would not be so severe that it would affect access to health care. He said as a result of deregulation, "Market forces in the health care industry are changing very rapidly, and we believe our new rates will be competitive with what other purchasers of health care are paying next year."
Federal law requires that states make Medicaid reimbursements that are "reasonable and adequate." In the last several years hospitals and nursing homes in several states, including New York, Indiana and Washington, have won legal challenges to have reimbursement increased.
Velvet Miller, New Jersey's director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, said Medicaid pays $1 billion for inpatient services for 132,000 people annually. Of that total, $676 million is paid to the state's 84 acute care hospitals that would be affected by the rate change.
The Federal and state governments each pay half of New Jersey's Medicaid costs, so the $135 million in projected savings will mean a $67.5 million spending cut for the state.
Al Drake, the chief spokesman for the Public Defender's Office, said the proposed cutback was the type of government action the Public Advocate's office "would have looked at and expressed concern about, but there is no longer a Public Advocate." As part of a cost savings effort, Mrs. Whitman eliminated the Public Advocate's Department during her first few months in office.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 91.52 As High Rates Lure Investors to Bonds

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In one of the most turbulent market sessions this year, stock prices fell further yesterday than on any other day in the last 10 months.
Almost all the 91.52-point, or 2.4 percent, selloff in the Dow Jones industrial average came in late afternoon trading and left traders puzzling about the reasons. But many said the heavy sales were a result of the belief that investors, both large companies and average Americans, would now sell stocks to buy bonds because they were becoming a more attractive investment. 
 The attraction of bonds is tied to the fact that interest rates are at their highest level in more than two years. Such higher rates are offering investors yields in the bond market that many feel outweigh the near-term gains in stocks. Indeed, bonds rallied yesterday. [Page D15].
Don Fishback, president of Fishback Management and Research in Cincinnati, likened the current situation to "reverse sticker shock," the mirror image of the time that consumers soured on low yields for bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills a few years ago and bought stocks instead.
"People are finally understanding that it's better to get 7.5 percent guaranteed by the Government than a 3 percent dividend" from a stock, he said.
Yesterday, the Dow fell 91.52 points, to 3,677.99, in one of the heaviest trading days of the year, with 385.3 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. That level is 33 percent higher than the year's daily average of 290 million shares.
The two other big stock indexes also fell, with the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks down 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq down 2.2 percent.
The Federal Reserve's six short-term rate increases this year have pushed the interest rate on 30-year Government bonds to more than 8 percent and two-year Treasury notes to more than 7 percent. The last increase, a jump of three-quarters of a percentage point, came last week, as the Fed continued to try to slow growth and restrain inflation in the year ahead.
Analysts worry that if the rate increases prompt a shift in investors' sentiment to bonds, the outlook for the stock market could be for further sharp declines. At the least, the stock market, which set highs in January, would settle around its lows for the year.
Selling in expectation of an event is normal in financial markets, as traders and investors try to get ahead of the tide, which can increase their gains and cut their losses.
On Monday Byron Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, reduced his recommended allocation of stocks to 85 percent, from 97 percent, with the difference going to securities with maturities less than one year.
"I think I'm late in recommending this change," Mr. Wien said. "The thing that has been driving the stock market is mutual funds, and there is increased probability that cash inflows into mutual funds may slow or even reverse."
"It's not happening yet," he added. "I'm just saying the risk is higher."
Spokeswomen at Fidelity Magellan and T. Rowe Price, two of the nation's biggest mutual funds, said there was little transfering out of stock funds into bond or money-market funds yesterday.
In the last two days, the Dow has fallen 137 points, or 3.6 percent, the biggest two-day drop since late March, about three weeks after the Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates on Feb. 4 for the first time this year.
Moreover, stock prices may drop again this week if two Government reports -- durable-goods orders today and jobless claims on Friday -- signal the kind of economic strength that the Federal Reserve's policy makers and the financial markets regard as inflationary. Such inflation signals often prompt the Fed to further push up interest rates.
Because of the Fed's six increases in key interest rates, Treasury notes with maturities as short as one year now yield more than twice as much as the 30 blue-chip stocks of the Dow, even with their dividends reinvested into the stocks. On price alone, the Dow has lost more than 2 cents for every dollar invested in it since the beginning of the year.
"We're talking negative territory as far as stocks, and everybody is noticing," said Gregory A. Nie, vice president for technical analysis atKemper Securities in Chicago. "Even cash -- and I mean 30-day or 90-day notes -- is outperforming bonds, and bonds are certainly beating stocks."
On any given day, there are any number of explanations for market movements, such as worries about the passage of the global free trade agreement or speculation about large institutional investors or mutual funds selling large blocks of shares in key stocks.
But like Monday's decline, in which the Dow tumbled 45.75 points, yesterday's fall came out of a cloudless sky. The dollar had been stable for much of the session, bond prices were up and no significant Government reports were released to rattle traders.
A normally favorable portent for the markets may have stampeded the stock traders. The Treasury Department sold $11 billion in five-year notes at a yield of 7.81 percent, one-hundredth of a percentage point less than bond traders had expected to pay.
That tiny gap signaled to many stock and bond traders that the floodgates of potential bond buyers might open soon. Those buyers had been sitting on their hands for more than a month since long-term bond yields passed 8 percent.
If those buyers sold stocks to buy bonds, that meant a downdraft for stocks. The rush for the exits began around 2:45 P.M., not long after the results of the Treasury auction were announced, and accelerated in the last 15 minutes of trading.
Mr. Nie, the technical analyst at Kemper, said that much like they did on Monday, traders watched a key price indicator all day and then sold stocks in a rush. But instead of watching the 200-day moving average for the S.& P. 500, they watched the Dow, whose level of 3,750 had held at critical points in the March and June quarters.
When, at 3 P.M., the Dow fell past that level, traders pushed the button on their high-speed computer programs to sell stocks, mainly those in the Dow and S.& P. 500 indexes. At 3:35 P.M., the New York Stock Exchange invoked its "circuit breaker" rules to slow computer-guided trading.
In addition, a third key stock index, the Nasdaq composite index was signaling trouble. The Nasdaq index, generally reflecting smaller companies like high-technology firms, fell 16.53 points to 741.21 yesterday.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.26 points, to 246.32, and the American Stock Exchange market value index declined 5.14 points, to 436.14. The S.& P. 500 fell 8.21 points, to 450.08.

HEADLINE: Dole and Gingrich Embrace Before Republican Governors

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Nov. 22

 BODY:
Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich today displayed a bonhomie seldom, if ever, seen between the two Republicans.
In their first joint appearance since the election two weeks ago, Mr. Gingrich of Georgia, the House Speaker-in-waiting, and Mr. Dole, who is likely to become the Senate majority leader, appeared at the close of the Republican Governors Association conference here to emphasize how well they will work together. 
 When they were not flattering each other, they were flattering the 30 governors and governors-to-be whose party dominates the governorships for the first time in a quarter-century.
As might be expected on this day of mutual admiration, the governors responded with standing ovations after Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich vowed that they would restore power to the states. Seeking to reassure the governors, they said that while the states would get less Federal money, they would not be unduly burdened by efforts in Washington to balance the budget and streamline Government.
Even for politicians, who have a penchant for saying nice things about people they despise, the cordiality between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole was noteworthy. The two have never been close. It was Mr. Gingrich who once called Mr. Dole "the tax collector for the welfare state." And in recent years Mr. Dole has made it clear that he prefers working within the system and had little patience, or respect, for Mr. Gingrich or his attacks on the political establishment.
During the campaign, Mr. Dole declined to endorse Mr. Gingrich's "Contract With America," a manifesto of proposals signed by more than 300 Republican House candidates.
But today Mr. Dole said, "I'm excited about the Contract With America." And he pledged to work with Mr. Gingrich, even as he acknowledged, "We're not going to agree on every issue."
Mr. Dole playfully teased Mr. Gingrich for getting more attention now that he is in line to be the first Republican Speaker in 40 years, which would put him second in succession to the President.
"I generally follow Newt these days on these TV shows; he's in line to be President but I'm not sure what I'm in line to be," Mr. Dole, who is preparing for a possible bid for President in 1996, said to roars of laughter from the audience.
Mr. Gingrich, 51, who spoke first, was just as complimentary of Mr. Dole, describing the 71-year-old Senator as far more experienced in Government. "The press is going to make a big effort to try to get a wedge between the Republicans in the Senate and the Republicans in the House," he said, perhaps foreseeing inevitable strains between the two chambers -- and the two leaders. "We lead two different institutions, and Senator Dole is clearly the senior Republican leader in Washington, has been a Presidential candidate, has been a majority leader. I mean, he actually has been in charge.
"I stand here, in a sense, as the student of the governors."
Mr. Dole drew cheers from the chief executives by telling them that the first Senate bill introduced in the new session will deal with limiting the Government's practice of imposing requirements, or mandates, for the states without providing the money to meet them.
But Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, warned the governors that it would not be painless. "We will get out of the mandate business," Mr. Packwood said, "but we will also get out of the money business."
The appeals for unity clearly pleased the governors, many of whom praised Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich. Several governors also said they were no longer as concerned as they had been on Sunday, when the conference opened and some were warning the new leadership not to impose themselves on the states and not to emphasize social programs at the expense of economic ones.
After a closed-door breakfast meeting between the governors and the new Congressional leaders, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey said, "The most important thing is that we are all together."
Gov. John Engler of Michigan said it was an exciting time because "the doors are open and we're sitting at the table." And Gov.-elect George W. Bush of Texas spoke of the "positive spirit of addressing difficult problems."
Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole called it a historic meeting, and it certainly was unusual. For the first time in decades, the Republicans who will dominate both chambers of Congress and the governorships sat together, with all parties seemingly eager to use their new power to make major changes.
"This is the meeting which crystallized the process of getting power out of Washington," Mr. Gingrich said.
As high as their spirits were, both Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich acknowledged that they were well aware that the era of good feeling and harmony on the issues among Republicans would probably not last.
Mr. Dole declined to embrace a welfare overhaul plan supported by Mr. Gingrich that would replace poverty and food plans with lump sum payments to the states. "I don't know how many welfare ideas we have -- probably as many as we have people up here," the Senator, flanked by several governors, said at a news conference.
At one session with the governors, Mr. Dole said it was too early to debate specifics. "Don't get sucked into the details," he told them. "Give us a little time."
In the meantime, he was savoring the moment. "It's never going to get any better than it is right now because we don't have the responsibility yet," Mr. Dole said. "So it's great."

HEADLINE: Administration Says Deal With Dole on Trade Is Near

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Administration officials said tonight that they expected by Wednesday to reach a deal with Senator Bob Dole that would pave the way for his support of a world trade agreement scheduled for a vote in a lame-duck session of Congress next week.
After a day of negotiations with Mr. Dole over his objections to a crucial part of the pact, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said, "We're making great progress and I think we'll have it." 
 At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Clinton contended that the expansion of the 124-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, would "raise incomes of American workers, and I think that is our most urgent economic job."
Moreover, he rejected Mr. Dole's effort to win a concession from the White House. Over the weekend, Mr. Dole suggested that his support for the trade pact would be linked to White House support for a cut in the capital gains tax rate, long a Republican objective.
But Mr. Clinton gingerly steered clear of criticizing Mr. Dole today, saying he had shown a "very constructive attitude." The President said he was "encouraged by the progress that we have made in working with Senator Dole on the substantive issues surrounding GATT."
Mr. Dole was more cautious than Mr. Kantor this evening and made no predictions of an imminent agreement. "It is my hope that the differences with the Administration over the GATT accord can be resolved soon," he said. "We are trying to fix GATT, and if we can, we should act on it this year." But he did make his support for the trade accord conditional on White House concessions on the capital gains tax cut, which Mr. Clinton has repeatedly rejected as a tax break for the rich.
"My objective is to make certain that the capital gains issue gets a fair hearing from this Administration," Mr. Dole said.
Without the support of Mr. Dole, who is likely to be the next majority leader, passage of the agreement seems difficult, and perhaps impossible, in the Senate. Over the past two days Mr. Dole has come under tremendous pressure from all sides of his party, with major business interests -- including potential financial supporters if Mr. Dole seeks the Presidency in 1996 -- urging him to support the complex trade accord, and conservatives warning him that the bill would surrender American sovereignty to a newly created organization, the World Trade Organization.
Critics of the accord, including many conservatives in both parties, have complained that foreign judges reviewing trade complaints for the World Trade Organization could rule against American environmental or labor laws, or state regulations, declaring them impediments to the importing of foreign goods into the United States. If Congress or the states refused to change the law, trade sanctions could be imposed against American goods.
Mr. Kantor said today that the Administration had been negotiating with Mr. Dole over the creation of a commission that would review World Trade Organization decisions to determine that the proceedings were fair. "The issue is not whether we win or lose," he said, "as long as the process is proper."
Though Mr. Kantor declined to go into the details of the commission's workings, other Administration officials said that it would be able to recommend, if necessary, that Congress pull out of the trade accord. Under the terms of GATT, any member can leave the organization with six months' notice.
"It's very, very unlikely this would ever happen," a senior Administration official said earlier this week. "But we want to give Dole the cover he needs to support this thing."
But the review panel idea is fraught with its own political perils, both for the Administration and for Mr. Dole. Foreign nations that were pressured by the United States to agree to the extension of GATT and to the creation of the organization, may view the accord with Mr. Dole as a sign that the United States is not committed to obeying the World Trade Organization's mandates. "It weakens the authority of the institution if the United States is threatening to pull away if they don't like the outcomes," a Japanese diplomat said this week.
Nor is the accord likely to satisfy critics of the trade accord, who have seized upon the World Trade Organization issue in their efforts to torpedo the entire accord.
Today a prominent Democrat, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, declared that he would vote against "this misguided agreement."
"I heard the message from the voters two weeks ago, and they want their Federal government to change the way business is conducted in Washington," he said. "I believe it would be a mistake to ignore this political sea change by ramming the GATT through Congress next week without much debate and with no opportunity to amend." Under the rules guiding GATT's passage, debate is limited and the bill itself cannot be amended. Mr. Dole's concerns would be addressed in subsequent legislation, probably next year.
The right wing of the Republican party, whose support Mr. Dole must also seek in any presidential bid, is also urging Mr. Dole to hold out against GATT, no matter what assurances are provided by the Administration. Patrick J. Buchanan, who led the "America First" trade campaigns, calls the agreement "a wholesale surrender of American sovereignty and states rights."
Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation and president of National Empowerment Television, said today, "I believe the implementing legislation is flawed, that the World Trade Organization is suspect and that a lame-duck session of Congress has no business taking up a measure as important as GATT, in as much as this session of Congress has been repudiated by the American people."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Board Votes Plan Calling for 10 Fare Rise

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Brushing aside the objections of New York City officials, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a long-range strategy yesterday that calls for a 10-cent fare increase next year to help pay for monthly passes with unlimited rides and free transfers between subways and buses.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two representatives on the M.T.A. board said the plan was unrealistic because it did not take into account the city's decision to cut $113 million from its contribution to the M.T.A. 
 "There are a lot of holes in this plan -- you could drive an M.T.A. train through some of them," said Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, one of the Giuliani administration's representatives on the board.
Several other board members said they had voted for the plan with deep reservations and now expected a lengthy public debate over whether to raise the fare. But after decades of charging a single fare for each ride, the board for the first time has proposed raising the basic fare -- now $1.25 -- to reduce the costs for some riders, members said.
"This town has never been through a debate like this," said Peter E. Stangl, the M.T.A. chairman.
Every year, the M.T.A. must submit a five-year financial plan to the Legislature. But each of the main elements of the plan voted on yesterday must still face public hearings and a separate vote by the board.
The business plan's approval, by a 9-to-3 vote, came at a stormy meeting in which the board also approved giving a $17 million contract to a data processing company, Lockheed Information Management Services, that the Giuliani administration has banned from doing business with the city. Again the Mayor's representatives objected but lost the vote.
The board also voted to delay until at least 1997 the rehabilitation of the decrepit Franklin Avenue shuttle in Brooklyn. The work was put off along with 20 other projects to make up for $500 million the city has cut from the M.T.A. capital budget. While the Brooklyn project was shelved, the board voted to put back into its plan the reconstruction of a busy stop in Flushing, Queens, that Mayor Giuliani wanted protected.
Transit officials acknowledged that plans to revamp fares faced several hurdles before they can become reality. The plan ignores Mr. Giuliani's proposed cut for M.T.A.'s operations this year and counts on the state's replacing that money in the future, an unlikely prospect given the state's own budget problems.
The M.T.A.'s plan also assumes Federal aid will remain steady despite signs in Washington that the new Republican-controlled Congress may again reduce mass-transit financing. It also banks on the board's winning public support for fare rises both next summer and in early 1997 in return for the fare changes.
The Governor-elect and the Assembly Speaker have already voiced opposition to raising the fare. Mr. Giuliani's aides say the Mayor would prefer to pay for the new fare plan through cuts elsewhere in the M.T.A.
Mr. Stangl said the proposals were intended to break with the past practice of keeping the fare as low as possible and raising it only in economic crises. The monthly passes and free transfers were crafted to attract more riders, he said.
"What we're trying to do is to establish a policy that will increase ridership," he said. "I just don't buy that this is giving discounts to some on the backs of others."
But some board members, like Barry Feinstein, a labor leader, said the proposed fare rise seemed intended to pay for changes that would benefit commuters in outlying suburbs and well-off riders who can buy in bulk rather than working-class people living in the inner city. "I think it's discriminatory," he said. "Those who can least afford the ride are the ones who will pay the greatest amount for the ride," he said.
The plan approved yesterday would establish unlimited monthly passes priced at the cost of 55 rides and give people a 5 percent discount on each $20 purchase of rides. It would also provide free transfers between buses and subways, cutting in half the fares paid by nearly 525,000 commuters who take both trains and buses to work. The plan also gives riders of commuter rail lines a slight discount on subway rides, 46 rides for the price of 40, and would let mass-transit riders travel free on the Staten Island ferry.
Those changes are estimated to cost $32 million next year in lost revenues, $200 million in 1996 and $273 million in 1997, transit officials said. To help make up the revenues, the plan calls for the fare to rise to $1.35 in July and to $1.50 in January 1997. Even with those increases, the M.T.A. will have to seek an additional $149 million in state aid in 1997 to balance its books, officials said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Cost-Cutters Reviewing Implants

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 22

 BODY:
On a recent trip to a New Jersey hospital, Kevin Weeks was appalled to witness an operation he considers a waste of money.
"I saw them putting a $3,000 hip that will last more than 20 years in a 100-year-old woman," said Mr. Weeks, director of operating room programs for Premier Health Alliance of Westchester, Ill., a purchasing cooperative owned by 53 large hospitals around the country. "They should have used a $300 unit that will last five years." 
 Goaded by the need to control spending, hospital administrators backed by experts like Mr. Weeks are pressing doctors to use cheaper artificial joints, pacemakers and other implants. And many physicians, who long chose whatever medical device they wanted, are also being urged to channel more business to manufacturers that offer hospitals the deepest discounts.
The drive for economy in a realm where hospitals traditionally have given doctors complete freedom of choice is one of the most dramatic signs yet of how powerful market-driven forces are reshaping health care. Hospitals say hundreds of millions of dollars can be saved by providers without harming patients.
But some doctors worry that this assault on their once-sacrosanct reign over implants could compromise health care. At the very least, they warn, the first patients operated on by a doctor who switches to a new device may suffer more pain and a higher rate of failure until the surgeon becomes intimately familiar with the new implant. And some manufacturers and research-oriented physicians warn that the pressure threatens to slow the pace of innovation that produces better equipment.
"It's difficult to control cost in a rigorous fashion without sacrificing quality of care," said Dr. Richard Frieberg, head of orthopedic surgery at the Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati. Dr. Frieberg has played a central role in developing a plan to reduce the variety of implants used at his hospital. But his cautious approach to negotiations with colleagues underscores the difficulties in getting doctors to agree on money-saving measures.
"I disagree with what some colleagues have done," Dr. Frieberg said, "but I can't say it's wrong."
Many hospitals are enlisting doctors and nurses in an effort to develop plans that among other things would sort out which patients should get which implants. A 30-year-old fitness instructor, for example, might receive the latest high-performance knee replacement; his sedentary grandfather might receive a standard model like those used in the 1970's.
The pressure to pay more attention to cost is most intense in orthopedics -- which has more manufacturers to play against each other -- and where lives are rarely at stake. But even heart surgeons are feeling growing pressure to contain costs.
"We found some folks who hadn't looked at the alternatives in pacemakers for years," said Samuel A. Greco, senior vice president for financial operations at the Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corporation, the hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky., that has grown rapidly through mergers.
To cut costs on orthopedic devices, Columbia has been telling its doctors that if they agree to narrow their options, the chain could win more contracts from health maintenance groups, thus attracting more patients and giving the company the clout to negotiate still deeper discounts from suppliers. Mr. Greco said a number of orthopedic implant contracts had been renegotiated in the last few months, driving costs down by 25 percent to 30 percent.
Medical devices account for 4 percent of total health care spending, but orthopedic implants typically account for 35 to 40 percent of the bill for an operation and often run much higher. The Medicare reimbursement for a total hip replacement -- and 85 percent are on patients covered by Medicare -- is $9,500 for the entire operation. But with prices for equipment averaging $2,500 to $3,000 in simple cases and ranging up to $7,000 in more difficult surgeries, many hospitals contend they are losing money on orthopedics. The Premier hospitals, for example, say they now lose an average of $1,300 per case. Doctors are reimbursed separately by Medicare.
Costs can vary widely, even for the same device. Within New York alone, one hospital paid $2,000 for the same hip replacement from the same manufacturer that another hospital purchased for $4,500, said Kerry Hicks, senior vice president at LBA Health Care Management of Englewood, Colo.
The economy drive is riding on the conviction that in most applications there is much less than what is claimed to distinguish new designs from old ones or the products of different equipment makers.
"The bottom line is that the materials and designs have evolved to the point where they are very similar, almost commodities," said Dr. William Healy, chairman of the orthopedic surgery group at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.
Hospitals still have to overcome the reluctance of many doctors to abandon equipment they are familiar with. Loyalties also rest on relationships with sales representatives who frequently assist doctors in surgery, provide educational tips and support doctors who are interested in developing new implants. And many surgeons find company-supplied data showing a performance edge for their products convincing.
Even doctors who believe there is little to distinguish the competing product lines fear the legal risks they run if they get poor results during a switch-over.
Experts like Dr. Charles Engh, who runs a teaching practice at Mount Vernon Hospital in Virginia, say that even the most experienced surgeons may need 40 operations to regain their former success rate after switching to a new line of implants.
"It's something we will ultimately do but it's not our preference," said Dr. Sheehan, an orthopedic surgeon since 1968 who works at three suburban hospitals here. "How would you like to go to a patient," Dr. Sheehan added, "and say, 'I've never used one of these before but I'm sure it will be O.K.'?"
The economy drive is clearly eroding profits for medical manufacturers. The number of hospitals receiving discounts from at least one orthopedic implant vendor jumped from 11 percent in 1992 to 75 percent last year, according to a survey of its readers by Orthopedic Network News, an industry newsletter.
Equipment makers say that the profit-sapping trend could slow the pace of innovation in several key segments of the $45 billion medical device industry. They also contend that it could lead to higher costs in the long run if the cheaper implants need to be replaced sooner.
But some patients' rights advocates challenge those claims. "The power of the device companies to oversell should not be underestimated," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, who heads a health issues group for Public Citizen, a consumer lobbying organization in Washington. Over long periods, more expensive devices may not necessarily perform any better than those they supplanted, he said. And because it is much harder to compare implants that stay in the body for years than it is to judge prescription drugs, Dr. Wolfe said, nobody really knows.
The major manufacturers are granting discounts to hospitals that prove they can deliver high volumes of orders. Occasionally, the price retreat is cloaked by rebates or by offering additional services to save money elsewhere. DePuy Inc., for example, offers its Orthopace program advising doctors on how to prepare patients for rehabilitation ahead of time, leading to faster releases from hospitals.
Medtronic Inc., a leading device company in the cardiovascular field, is trying to counter pressure to cut pacemaker prices by offering discounts to hospitals that will buy more of its other products. "Having broad product lines allows us to come up with counteroffers," said Richard Reid, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based company.
Still, the competition is taking its toll. Three smaller orthopedics companies have sold themselves to competitors in the last year.
And the uphill battle manufacturers face in proving their products are superior is expected to lead to ever tougher demands for discounts from individual hospitals and buying groups. Premier, the nationwide buying group based outside Chicago, recently introduced a new program offering its hospitals discounts of up to 40 percent on orthopedic implants if they steer most of their business to participating suppliers.
The suppliers that signed on to the three-year arrangement included the orthopedics division of Johnson & Johnson, Intermedics Orthopedics Inc. (a division of Switzerland's Sulzer), the Osteonics Corporation (a subsidiary of the Stryker Corporation), Smith & Nephew Richards Inc., and Wright Medical Technologies Inc.
Perhaps the most notable thing about the supplier group is the absence of the market leaders, including the Zimmer Corporation (a division of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Howmedica Inc. (a division of Pfizer Inc.), and DePuy (a division of Germany's Boehringer Mannheim G.m.b.H.). These companies currently account for well over half the orthopedic implants used at Premier hospitals.
What the established leaders are gambling on is that enough doctors will remain loyal, despite encouragement from hospital managers to switch, that they will do better by not giving in to the demand for big discounts.
That is just fine by Gary Sabins, vice president in charge of sales at Intermedics. The company, based in Austin, Tex., has 70 percent of the business at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla., but much less in other Premier hospitals. "It's our hope the doctors will reward those who came to the party," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Thanks Ukraine With $200 Million

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton offered $200 million in additional economic aid to Ukraine today to thank that country's new President, Leonid Kuchma, for taking politically difficult steps sought by Washington toward free-market reforms and the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Promising a new relationship with Ukraine, which the Administration expects to become a major power in Europe in years to come, Mr. Clinton also provided Mr. Kuchma with security assurances in return for having persuaded his Parliament last week to vote to eliminate Ukraine's 1,800 nuclear warheads. 
 Those assurances included a promise never to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, to talk with its Government if the country is ever threatened militarily and, if necessary, to present Ukraine's case to the United Nations Security Council.
To demonstrate the Administration's new bonds with Ukraine, Mr. Clinton announced that Washington would provide a $100 million emergency grant to Ukraine -- with no strings -- for importing food and fuel. No other country receives such a grant from the United States.
Administration officials say that after years of delaying economic reforms, Ukraine sorely needs money to pay for imports because its citizens are being squeezed by a series of reform initiatives, like removing price controls on many products.
Another $100 million in assistance for student exchanges, privatization and small business will raise aid to Ukraine to a total of $900 million for 1994 and 1995, making the former Soviet republic Washington's fourth-largest aid recipient after Israel, Egypt and Russia.
Mr. Clinton welcomed Mr. Kuchma with a full state visit and a 21-gun salute on the White House South Lawn, a greeting that seemed likely to bolster the Ukrainian leader's status among his own people.
"Your boldness in the face of daunting problems reminds us of one of our greatest leaders, Franklin Roosevelt, who provided leadership in a time of great hardship," Mr. Clinton said. "You have blazed a path ahead on the two most critical issues for the future: economic reform and nuclear weapons."
When Mr. Kuchma was elected last July, American officials warned him that unless he took drastic and painful steps to fix his economy, Ukraine risked disintegration.
Administration officials said they were delighted that Mr. Kuchma was able to push through a far-reaching economic reform program even though former Communists still have a strong hold on Parliament. Among the moves that he has taken are large-scale privatization of state companies, cuts in Ukraine's budget deficit and the removal of price controls on many goods.
"He has made the tough decisions that eluded his predecessor," a senior Administration official said.
President Clinton has written to European and Japanese leaders to urge them to contribute funds to Ukraine so it can buy imports of basic necessities. Several American officials criticized the European Union for moving slowly on furnishing the $100 million in emergency aid that Washington has suggested.
For the Clinton Administration, the Ukrainian Parliament's vote, after months of delay, to eliminate its arsenal of nuclear arms, the world's third-largest, was crucial because it cleared the way for two other arms reduction treaties.
American officials said that vote required extensive arm-twisting by Mr. Kuchma because many Ukrainian lawmakers wanted to hold onto the nuclear weapons so Ukraine would retain its clout.
The United States has already committed $350 million to speed the dismantling of Ukraine's warheads.

A Tipsy Big Ben Leans Over Bedlam-on-Thames

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Westminster Bridge is falling down, or would be if engineers had not just embarked on a project to shore it up. Across town, near Sloane Square, one of the Victorian-era iron beams supporting the roof of the Underground station is cracked, forcing trains to crawl through at 15 miles an hour.
Even Big Ben isn't standing as tall as it used to. Last month, engineers reported the 135-year-old clock tower was listing just over a tenth of an inch, a slight tilt that some experts believe is related to nearby tunneling for a rail line extension. 
 It was Dr. Samuel Johnson who said that when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life. But these days, as the Sunday newspaper The Observer noted recently, when a man is tired of London, he may have a good reason. The capital itself seems to be sagging, gridlocked and constantly under repair.
"London is like a piece of Gruyere cheese," grumbled Gerry Brennan as his taxicab crept past Buckingham Palace, where workers closed lanes to tear up sidewalks. "There are holes everywhere. If hole digging were an Olympic sport, I can tell you this: Britain would win the gold medal every time."
Anyone who has lived within commuting distance of New York or Tokyo or Paris knows that grousing about traffic and detours is just part of the usual background static, a kind of urban white noise.
But in London's salons and boardrooms, in the letter columns and front pages of its newspapers, the grumbling has built to a kind of crescendo. "London is crumbling under the strain of modern living, and trouble-shooters are failing to keep it from falling apart," declared a special report broadcast this month on London's Capital Radio. "Roads are collapsing, bridges are bending and buildings subsiding."
For many tourists, London is still the most agreeable of foreign capitals: safer, cleaner, more intimate than most. Yet the same things that charm tourists -- narrow streets, ancient buildings and quaint plumbing -- frustrate Londoners since so much of the city, at any one moment, seems to be either broken or under repair.
Movement for London, a public interest group that campaigns on behalf of transportation issues, estimated recently that more than two million holes are dug each year in London roads by any one of 17 different utilities and public agencies, which -- to make matters worse -- do not always coordinate their construction schedules.
As a result, these critics complain, the city's traffic pattern has increasingly been turned into an ever-changing labyrinth of detours, roadblocks and one-lane roads.
There are other holes too, appearing entirely on their own. At Heathrow Airport, a parking lot and office building alongside one of the main passenger terminals suddenly began to disappear last month, when nearby tunneling for a new high-speed rail line caused them to sink.
Some critics argue that the problem is complicated because London, alone among the major cities of the world, does not have its own central, elected government to oversee and coordinate activities.
Since the Greater London Council was abolished in 1982 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who saw it as a redoubt of profligate socialism, the administration of the metropolitan area has been balkanized among 33 different boroughs and local governments, 5 departments of the national government and 60 separate boards and committees.
Stephen O'Brien, the chief executive of London First, which seeks to lure investors and businesses to London, says the disruptions and repairs are the price that comes with building new rail links, or installing a citywide system of underground wiring for cable television.
"As a result of the recession, key parts of London's infrastructure have suffered from under-investment," Mr. O'Brien said. "But in time you will see fabulous things; we are just all going to have put up with the misery until they are finished."
But Roy Porter, a historian and the author of "London, A Social History," published this month by Hamish Hamilton Ltd., says he believes the jury is still out. For all its myriad charms, its thriving neighborhoods, its open spaces, London is suffering from its lack of governance and central planning, Mr. Porter concludes.
"It's true that London is an old city, and that its sewage system is crumbling and its road system out-of-date," he said. "But it is not to be excused. We need a central government."
Without those kinds of improvements, Mr. Porter says, he is not hopeful. "The projections are that London road traffic will double in the next 15 years," he said. "What that will mean to levels of traffic, to pollution, to quality of life in this city, you and I can both guess."

Brink's Robbery Case Goes to Rochester Jury

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Nov. 22

 BODY:
After a seven-week trial, a Federal jury today began deliberating the fate of four men linked to the $7.4 million robbery of a Brink's armored-car depot.
The theft, on Jan. 5, 1993, was the nation's fifth-biggest armored-car robbery. 
 A year ago, $2 million was recovered in a New York City apartment used by the Rev. Patrick Moloney, 62, a Melkite Catholic priest who runs a youth shelter, and Samuel Millar, 39, a former rebel from Northern Ireland.
Before deliberations began, Judge David Larimer of Federal District Court told jurors not to infer anything from his decision two weeks ago to throw out two of the three charges against Mr. Millar and the Father Moloney.
They and the fourth defendant, Charles McCormick, 30, an unemployed teacher who subleased the Manhattan apartment to the priest four months before the money was found in a bedroom closet, each face a sole remaining charge of conspiring to possess money from the robbery.
The judge said the prosecution had failed to show that they ever possessed stolen money in western New York, or that the money ever left the state and became an "interstate shipment," as two counts of the indictment allege.
The judge also dropped an interstate shipment possession charge against Thomas O'Connor, a retired Rochester police officer who smuggled Mr. Millar into the United States in 1984. He was working as a guard at Brink's on the night gunmen raided the depot.
Mr. O'Connor, 55, is the only one accused of taking part in the holdup and faces up to 25 years if found guilty. Mr. Millar, Father Moloney and Mr. McCormick, face up to five years each.

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary Urges Cuts For 'Corporate Welfare' Too

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Firing back at conservatives who have vowed to trim welfare costs, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich today issued a broad but vague call to choke off as much as $200 billion in "corporate welfare" as a way of finding money for jobs programs.
But he stopped short of identifying any corporate tax break or subsidy as unreasonable or counterproductive. And though he referred to a study by a Democratic research organization that identifies $111 billion in preferential programs for specific industries, the Labor Secretary said he was not endorsing that report or the suggestions in it. 
 Instead, in the third speech in which he has laid out a theory of America on the decline -- with a crimped middle class and a growing divide between the rich and poor -- he blamed social divisions and lingering pocketbook issues for the Democrats' defeat in the Nov. 8 elections and reiterated his vow to streamline and reinvigorate his department's approach to job training and job creation.
Convulsive political change will continue, he warned, until the middle class sees an end to a spiral of downward mobility that started 15 years ago.
In the Administration's soul-searching since Election Day, Mr. Reich has been the most consistent advocate for sticking to President Clinton's original agenda for using the Government to promote social change, arguing against a wholesale shift to the political center.
"We are re-examining every special benefit that the poor receive," Mr. Reich said in an interview after his midday speech before the Democratic Leadership Council. "It seems only fair that we should also target tax breaks and subsidies that simply don't make sense. All of that needs to be on the table."
Mr. Reich's comments were not immediately echoed at the White House, where, at a news conference this afternoon, President Clinton said he needed time to review the details of the study and assess any possible action.
"Conceptually, it's an attractive idea," he said. "I have to have time to review the details in the context of our budget." He added, however, that he had made no decision about any of the specifics of the Labor Secretary's proposal.
Mr. Reich, this morning, called for bipartisan support. He vowed to "streamline and consolidate the current clutter of adult education and job-training programs" overseen by his department and to "pull the plug on programs that don't work." But he also called on Republicans, who have been readying proposals for budget cuts and tough changes in welfare, to consider the fates of workers who have not been able to take advantage of a steadily growing economy because of slow wage growth and flat job opportunities.
"Nearly one out of five who lost a full-time job since the start of 1991 is still without work," he said. "Among those who have landed new jobs, almost half, 47 percent, are now earning less than they did before."
At the center of Mr. Reich's prescription for change was an 11-month-old report written by the Democratic Leadership Committee's Progressive Policy Institute. The institute's report identifies specific subsidies in the oil and gas industry, private utilities, agriculture and those industries that make tax-free investments in the United States-linked lands like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam as drains on the economy and areas of unproductive tax policy.
Robert J. Shapiro, the author of the report, said the timing of Mr. Reich's remarks was apt, though the report had been in circulation for nearly a year. "We are coming up to the new budget season," he said. "The fact is, if you want to find a little tax relief, you have to find somewhere to save. I'm pleased that they are using market logic" to diagram potential tax cuts.
Tax experts today responded cautiously to Mr. Reich's remarks, pointing out that ever since President Ronald Reagan started assailing welfare benefits, liberals had threatened corporate benefits.
"There has always been this talk that if you don't like welfare, then don't give it to corporations," said Eugene L. Vogel, chairman of the tax department at the New York law firm of Rosenman & Colin.
Mr. Vogel said he generally approved of Mr. Reich's comments but hoped that the Clinton Administration would not move to make a flurry of changes in the tax code. "We just shouldn't keep jiggling it," he said. And in the current political environment, with Republicans dominating Congress, Mr. Vogel added, "I'm not sure how cooperative Congress is going to be, anyway."

More Scrutiny of a Microsoft Merger

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation and Intuit Inc. said today that they had received a second request from the Justice Department for information on their proposed merger. Both said the request had been anticipated and that they were cooperating with the Government.
"We were by no means surprised to get a second request," said William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, adding that second requests were not uncommon in mergers of companies with overlapping products. 
 Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., agreed last month to acquire Intuit, a Menlo Park, Calif., producer of Quicken, the market-leading personal finance software program, in a stock swap valued at about $1.5 billion. Microsoft also agreed to divest itself of its competing product, Money, to Novell Inc. for an undisclosed amount, to avoid antitrust action.
In what is the largest software industry acquisition ever, Microsoft paid more than 7 times revenues and more than 60 times earnings for Intuit, an indication of just how far it is willing to go to capture a market.
The deal also signaled the intention of Microsoft to dominate electronic banking as thoroughly as it does desktop computing, as was underscored by a subsequent deal with Visa International to provide software for electronic shopping.
Last week the Silicon Valley law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosetti filed a brief with the Justice Department, arguing that while Microsoft's acquisition of Intuit was anticompetitive in the present market for personal finance software, its future implications were even more troubling.
Relying on an economics concept called "increasing returns" theory, the paper suggested that Microsoft could use its dominance of desktop computing today to achieve dominance of nascent markets it deems strategic.
"Notwithstanding that in certain places their market share is small, the economics would predict they're going to dominate," said Gary Reback, the lawyer who wrote the brief. He said the Justice Department had requested the brief, submitted on behalf of the firm's clients, which declined to be named for fear of retaliation from Microsoft. The brief "argues that the Government should take action," he said.
Justice Department officials declined to comment. But Esther Roditti, editor of the Computer Law & Tax Report, said that the argument made by the law firm was not likely to sway the Justice Department. "I've never heard anything so speculative as that argument in an antitrust case," she said. "They've always been based on current conditions."
Still, analysts say that Microsoft has made a series of moves that could let it dominate the market for on-line commerce, banking and information. Windows 95, the next release of the company's popular operating system software, will contain the software needed to dial up Microsoft Network, an on-line service the company plans to introduce. With six million users, Quicken, which permits electronic bill-paying, already has more users than the three largest on-line services combined. And Visa has hundreds of millions of users, many of whom might shop on line.

Mexican Attitudes Shift In Flood of U.S. Goods

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Marlboro Man rode off American television years ago, but in Mexico he is still galloping hard, part of a stampede for products from across the border that is changing and challenging Mexico's modest advertising industry.
The elimination of tariffs by the North American Free Trade Agreement has brought hundreds of American products, from Kellogg's Pop-Tarts to the new Ford Mystique, to join standbys like Marlboro cigarettes on Mexican shelves and in showrooms. 
 The newcomers are extensively advertised in ways that try to reflect Mexican culture. In response, the established Mexican products must be more heavily marketed to keep from losing ground.
As they bid for attention, the new advertisements are testing accepted conventions that until now have excluded nearly all humor and sarcasm -- or even indigenous Mexican faces -- from television commercials.
When American competitors were kept out and consumers had few choices, Mexican manufacturers considered advertising to be a nuisance. Now that the border is largely open, that attitude is changing.
"The whole market here is in a state of flux right now," said John E. Holmes, regional president for J. Walter Thompson, which has been in Mexico for 50 years. "The big question now is, 'Are we a part of Latin America or are we a part of North America?' The answer is unclear."
This might seem to be a good time for Mexican ad agencies or the local branches of big international companies to flourish. But the comparatively small size of the Mexican consumer market and the traditional aversion of Mexican businesses to spending on advertising have made this a shakeout year for the country's advertising industry.
"An open economy is going to open up creativity, but it's going to pulverize the market itself," said Cecilia Bouleau, editor of the advertising magazine Adcebra. She said big agencies had been forced to lower commissions and reduce staff to be more competitive.
The five largest agencies in Mexico, as measured by billings, are foreign, beginning with McCann-Erickson. Many Mexican agencies have survived by allying with international companies, which tends to obscure the smaller agency's identity.
Still, advertising interest in Mexico remains high. "Latin America is double the size of the population of the U.S., and Mexico is the second- largest country in Latin America," said Angel Collado-Schwartz, chairman of Nazca, a subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi.
While Mexico ranks second in population behind Brazil, its advertising expenditures of nearly $2 billion last year were third behind those of Brazil and Argentina. More than half the 90 million Mexicans are 25 years old or younger, making them a prime consumer market, at least in theory.
Advertising experts in Mexico say that almost anything American sells, but finding the right approach is not always as simple as translating "yes" into "si."
American Express learned that lesson a few years ago, when it tried to transplant its successful "Membership has its privileges" campaign into Mexico.
American Express told its agency, Panamericana Ogilvy & Mather, to use the same advertisement in Mexico that ran in Argentina. But while Mexicans and Argentines both speak Spanish, some words have quite different meanings.
An account executive on the campaign said the slogan in Argentina had been translated: "Ser miembro tiene su privilegio," or "To be a member has its privileges." In Mexico, the slogan caused snickers, because miembro is commonly used to refer to male genitals. The ads were pulled, and the offending phrase changed to "membresia," the word that Mexicans use for membership.
Sergio Armando Lopez Zepeda, director of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies, said advertising in Mexico still lacked a degree of sophistication and its own brand of creativity. Many television commercials, like those by the Leo Burnett Company for Marlboro, copy commercials in the United States. The earthy humor that Mexicans love is rare, because many companies fear it would reflect badly on their products.
But a cross-cultural style is emerging that acknowledges the proximity of the United States, but adds a uniquely Mexican flavor.
The commercials done for the Mexican Yellow Pages by the Mexican agency Alazraki & Associates, are among the first designed around Mexican humor. They feature working-class Mexicans who almost never appear in advertisements, which are dominated by people who look like upper-class Anglos.
In one new commercial, two men parking cars complain in Mexican street slang as they rush from car to car. They feel overworked, it turns out, because their boss is attracting so many customers.
"I thought he didn't advertise in the Yellow Pages," one disgruntled employee says. "What do you mean?" the other says. "He put it in there, in red."
Television advertising is the most effective medium in Mexico. Ads for cigarettes and hard liquor are shown, but only after 10 P.M, as are commercials for condoms.
Slightly more than 65 percent of the advertising peso is spent on television, with more than 80 percent of that going to Televisa, a communications giant that operates three nationwide networks. But the cost of television commercials -- up to $150,000 a minute -- is too expensive for most Mexican businesses. A newly privatized network, Television Azteca, is competing by offering lower rates and more attractive time packages.
While Mexico's population of 90 million is relatively young, advertisers point out that it is also quite poor. Only about 12 million Mexicans have enough money to be considered active consumers.
As a result, only 8,000 of Mexico's 55,000 medium-sized businesses mount advertising campaigns, Mr. Lopez Zepeda said. The products most heavily advertised are aimed at the broadest potential market, like Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay's Sabritas brand chips and Bimbo bread and baked goods.
With some of the sheen starting to wear off the new American imports, advertisers must try harder to make Mexicans buy their products.
"We Mexicans are realizing that not everything that comes from outside is better than what we make here," Mr. Lopez Zepeda said. "For the first time, the Mexican consumer is learning how to buy."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Sugar Surges on Prediction Supply Won't Meet Demand

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Sugar prices surged to a four-and-a-half-year high yesterday after the International Sugar Organization predicted consumption would outpace production in 1994-95 by 1.9 million metric tons.
The deficit forecast for the September-August marketing year reflects declining production, particularly in Europe, and rising world demand. 
 On other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose modestly after OPEC members agreed to freeze production levels for a year, and copper prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.35 point, to 231.15.
World sugar for March delivery rose 0.61 cent on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to 14.59 cents a pound, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since May 25, 1990.
The International Sugar Organization, representing major sugar-producing countries, increased its deficit forecast by 46 percent from the September estimate of 1.3 million tons. This would be the third consecutive year of deficit production and declining world stockpiles.
"You've had some major production problems in Russia and Europe and you're seeing some continued erosion in Cuban production," said Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter, Discover & Company in Chicago.
At the same time, developing nations are becoming bigger sugar consumers, said William Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. "Consumption increases as people have more money and their diets change with the increase in their disposable income," he said.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil prices rose after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would maintain its output ceiling of 24.52 million barrels a day for another year. Demand for OPEC crude is expected to average 25 million barrels a day in the first half of 1995, and 25.6 million in the second half.
Even with OPEC cheating, which currently increases production to about 25.1 million barrels a day, demand could outstrip production late next year, forcing prices higher.
January deliveries of crude oil rose 26 cents, to $17.82 a barrel.
Profit taking ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow brought copper prices down from near five-year highs on the Commodity Exchange of New York. The December copper contract fell 4.1 cents, to $1.3225 a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hurt by Stock Drop And View on Strong Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was weaker against most leading currencies yesterday, hurt by a late stock plunge on Wall Street and comments from Germany's top central banker.
The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said he favored a strong German mark. In addition, he said there was no pressure on the central bank to alter its monetary policy. 
 "You should not prepare yourselves for too great a change," Mr. Tietmeyer said. The Bundesbank's policy-making Central Bank Council meets tomorrow . Lower German interest rates would bolster the value of the dollar against the mark, but the Bundesbank last cut interest rates in May, and most European economists expect no change in interest rate policy.
"The statement in itself is probably nothing new, but given the fact that the dollar was slightly vulnerable, the market was able to push it lower," said Ian Spence, a managing director at the Chemical Bank.
Traders said the dollar was also pulled down in late trading by a selloff in American stocks, which dampened demand among foreign investors for the dollars needed to buy the securities. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 91.52 points.
Despite the weakness in stocks, currency dealers said investor sentiment toward the dollar remained relatively upbeat.
"What we've seen in the bigger picture is four straight weeks of new highs in the dollar," said Paul Farrell, a vice president at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "I think this trend will probably stay in place."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5527 marks from 1.5562 marks on Monday. The dollar slipped to 98.23 yen from 98.34 yen.
Currency trading is expected to be quiet today on the eve of Thanksgiving. Japanese banks will be closed today for a national holiday.
Separately, the Italian lira came under attack after news that magistrates had told Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that he was being investigated on corruption charges.
The lira fell to a record low of 1,035.60 against the German mark. The dollar rose to 1,609 lire, from 1,594.50 on Monday.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar fell to 1.3180 Swiss francs, from 1.390 francs on Monday. The British pound rose to $1.5695 from $1.5678.

HEADLINE: Resisting O.J.-itis

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
EARLY next year, when the O. J. Simpson trial kicks off in earnest and full-time coverage returns to television, J. W. Johnson vows that the Cottonwood Cafe will be an O. J.-free zone. He will not tune the cafe's television to Court TV, nor will he lend an ear to barflies who wish to dissect the latest about Cato Kaylin or Marcia Clark's skirt lengths.
"I just can't take it anymore," said Mr. Johnson, an owner of the cafe, on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. "This morning when I was eating breakfast, watching CNN, they came on with jury selection and I flipped it to another channel." 
 Mr. Johnson is one of a growing number of Americans who feel that the never-ending rain of news, analysis and water-cooler chitchat about the O. J. Simpson story, which continues even now, during a lull in the case, has become too much, crowding out the stuff of daily life.
"This is November," Mara Manus, a Los Angeles film producer, said in exasperation. "When did it happen, last June? It's insane we're still talking about this."
She and others -- you could call them O. J. avoiders -- want to be covered under Judge Lance A. Ito's recent order requiring that jury members get morning papers with references to the case snipped out. Barring that, they have devised ways to sequester themselves from the barrage of news, recently estimated by the judge's clerk at 27,000 newspaper and magazine stories, with broadcast reports heard as far away as Tibet.
Their strategies range from banning mention of Mr. Simpson at social gatherings to packing away television sets for the duration to seeking alternative news sources in cyberspace.
Deborah Rosen, the founder of Rosen & Company, a marketing firm in Santa Monica, Calif., told of eating recently at a Manhattan restaurant where everyone at the table agreed to avoid mention of the trial.
"Every day and everywhere you go, people are talking about it," Ms. Rosen complained. "Everyone's got to weigh in with their views."
Penn Jillette, the illusionist, said he lost interest in the case "about a minute into the car chase" in June.
"I live in a rarefied non-O. J. environment," he added. To black out further information, he gets most of his news from the Economist, the British newsweekly that has scarcely mentioned the story. And he hangs out with computer scientists, many from Bell Labs in New York, a set famous for its tunnel vision. "In that particular social circle, I don't think it was ever mentioned, not so much as a joke," Mr. Jillette said proudly.
David Zinsser, who owns the Cottonwood with Mr. Johnson, said that when he and two friends rented a beach house in Montauk, L.I., this summer, they made a simple rule: not one word was to be uttered about the Simpson case. In the interest of a restful vacation, Mr. Zinsser said, "we refused to listen to, watch or read anything about it."
To be sure, most Americans seem eager to devour each new bit of O. J. trivia. "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted," the biography by Faye D. Resnick, is holding strong on the New York Times best-seller list at No. 4.
But there is some evidence that outbreaks of O. J. Simpson fatigue are not isolated cases. Television magazine shows like ABC's "Prime Time Live" and CBS's "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" have suffered sharp ratings declines this fall. Several television executives have said the drop-off could be traced in part to viewers' satiation with the Simpson story.
"There has been an O. J. overload, there's no question in my mind," said Joe Peyronnin, a vice president of CBS News. "Everybody is doing the jury story. Everybody is doing the DNA story. People have gotten too much of that."
Several experts pointed to the surprisingly low rating for Ms. Chung's Oct. 20 interview with Ms. Resnick on "Eye to Eye," despite the huge publicity the show inadvertantly received when Judge Ito ordered prospective jurors not to watch it. The broadcast got a 9.8 rating, compared with 19.4 for NBC's drama "E.R." in the same time period (each rating point represents 952,000 households).
But other television news insiders cautioned that the Simpson story is in a temporary lull as jury selection drags out and that once the trial begins, probably in mid-January, viewer interest will bounce back. Frank Magid, a consultant to about 130 television news departments around the country, said he recently surveyed 1,000 people about their appetite for the story and advised his clients, in effect, to keep it coming.
That is bad news for folks determined to carve out an O. J.-free zone. For them the world can be a daunting place. News of the trial makes the papers every morning, the television news almost nightly and the covers of supermarket tabloids week after week.
"It's so clear there is no new information," said Paul Rudnick, the playwright. "I would like to avoid the whole subject. But I feel simply by passing the newsstand, it clings to me. It's become a form of asbestos. It's in the air and impossible to avoid."
Even some of those whose business it is to keep the information flowing admit to feeling tuckered out. "Frankly, I'm drowning in it," said Tom Leykis, a talk-radio host on Los Angeles station KMPC-AM. "Unless you've been here, you have no perception of how ever-present this story is on television."
Los Angeles has seven television channels with local news broadcasts, and judging by their blow-by-blow coverage, most seem to agree with Geraldo Rivera, who said earlier this month that the trial is "the most extraordinary criminal case in our lifetimes, maybe in this century, maybe in history, maybe ever."
Faced with hyperventilating of this kind, some people have taken the drastic, almost un-American step of seceding from the great republic of television watchers. Mr. Leykis said he had heard from callers who said they don't watch the news anymore, and several who've unplugged their television sets because of the O. J. tsunami.
But Ken Minyard, another Los Angeles talk-radio host, wondered whether such O. J. avoiders were really closet O. J. watchers.
"From the beginning we've had calls from people who say this is terrible and people are obsessed with it," said Mr. Minyard, whose morning-drive show on KABC-AM is top-rated in Los Angeles. "I think they're the first ones watching 'Hard Copy' that night."
Mr. Peyronnin of CBS News predicted that if and when Mr. Simpson takes the stand or grants an interview to a network news division, it will be "a national television moment" that rivets Americans to their sets.
In that event, however, there are many O. J.-phobes who say that they will skip the appointment. One is Kevin Kelly, the executive editor of the computer magazine Wired, whose October cover promised "Absolutely nothing about O. J. Simpson in this issue!"
On the Internet and on-line services, where Mr. Kelly goes for much news and information, one can pick and choose topics of interest, rather than submit to the barrage that comes across the airwaves.
"It's much more of a hunting, browsing thing, where the reader or customer is in control," Mr. Kelly said. "It is easier to avoid stuff you're tired of. My little roamings are pretty O. J.-free."
He has one other strategy for avoiding the topic: getting rid of reporters who ask about it. Ten minutes into a telephone interview, Mr. Kelly said: "I've just talked more about O. J. than I ever have in my life, and I'm finding I'm tired of it. So maybe I should go on to something else."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: A Natural at Filling the Seats;
Weak Bat Adds Skepticism to Jordan's Future in Majors

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
Michael Jordan swung at the first pitch and dumped a double next to the left-field line. The fans at Scottsdale Stadium cheered lustily, but a group of more dispassionate observers reacted differently.
"That soft line drive was on an 81-mile-an-hour fastball that was right there," a major league scout said a couple of innings after Jordan's hit in a recent game. "He just got out too early with a soft swing." 
 The scout was not putting down Jordan for the way he got his third Arizona Fall League extra-base hit in 93 times at bat; he was assessing the Scorpions' outfielder critically, the way scouts are paid to do. And when scouts assess Jordan, the first aspect they address is his weak way of hitting, which they cite as the greatest obstacle to him playing in the major leagues.
Like many others in baseball, the scouts talk candidly about Jordan's ability only if they are not identified. Bashing Jordan is not a game that is readily accepted by people who admire him for the effort he has made the last 10 months and appreciate him for the economic benefit his presence has brought to the Southern League and the Arizona Fall League.
The Birmingham Barons drew a franchise record 467,867 fans this year, the sixth-highest attendance in Class AA history. Scorpions games attract far more fans than other games in the Arizona league. Two of the three Saturday night games drew 161 and 476 fans; Jordan's game attracted 1,937.
Even the scout who harshly assessed Jordan's double said: "You can't get rid of him because he's quadrupled the attendance of every game down here and it's the same way everywhere he goes. He's great for baseball. It's great to see somebody who fulfills a dream, and it would translate to the younger kids if they stuck with it."
After a season with Birmingham on the Class AA level of the minor leagues, the National Basketball Association legend has spent several more weeks playing in a league that is a minor league mixture, but with pitchers who are considered Class AAA quality.
The Chicago White Sox, whose operating owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, has the same position with the Bulls, have pegged Jordan for Class AAA Nashville next season. Class AAA is the last stop for players before the major leagues. Sometimes young players slip backward from that level. More often than not, players of many ages become stuck there, unable to cross the gulf that is much larger than any jump in the minors.
At the age of 31, Jordan is not a typical minor leaguer. His teammates here are mostly 24 or younger. They have time to develop into major leaguers, if they have the talent. Jordan does not have much time, and it's highly questionable that he has the talent.
Scouts and other baseball people differ in their assessment of his defensive and base-running skills, but they are unanimous in their view of his hitting.
"He has a pretty weak stroke," said the head of one major league scouting department.
A general manager who saw Jordan play last week said: "He doesn't have a good swing. The ball doesn't jump off his bat." Another concluded: "I don't think he's going to hit the ball. He doesn't have a lot of wrist in the ball."
Syd Thrift is a veteran baseball man who has worked for several clubs. Currently the director of player development for the Baltimore Orioles, he knows about the process of turning good athletes into baseball players from the days he ran the Kansas City Royals' Baseball Academy.
"He's going through the process of where his hands should be, his starting position, where you take the ball, what do you do with your body," said Thrift, who watched Jordan play from a scout's seat behind home plate. "He's in a pretty good position to take the pitch. He's learning how to identify breaking pitches. That's his problem. He hasn't hit them. You have to learn how to hit. You learn by seeing and feeling."
Jordan batted .202 for Birmingham, needing a late-season splurge to get there. He hit only 3 home runs and struck out 114 times in 436 times at bat. In Arizona, he has maintained his strikeout ratio while raising his batting average (.239 after yesterday's game) but hitting no home runs.
He has not been a factor in producing runs. His ratio of 6 runs batted in for 109 at-bats would translate to 33 r.b.i. for a 600 at-bat season. His inability to generate power, his penchant for hitting soft singles instead, has kept him from being a productive hitter.
"His hands are not back far enough," Thrift said, dissecting Jordan's stance. "If he moved his hands straight back six inches, he'd be in a strong hand position. The difference between here and here gives you more power. He's right here. I think that comes from being defensive, protecting you against the breaking ball."
Gordon Goldsberry, an Orioles' scout, echoed Thrift's assessment.
"I talked to people who saw him take batting practice in Chicago two, three years ago when he was playing basketball," the former major league first baseman said. "They said he hit balls into the seats. It looks like maybe he manufactured his swing just to try to hit the ball instead of trying to hit the ball hard. As big as he is, with his arms and legs, it seems to me he could turn the bat loose."
Instead, Goldsberry said, the 6-foot-6-inch Jordan hits defensively. "It looks like he's trying to avoid striking out," he said. "He sort of feels for the ball instead of hitting it. I'd like to see him take a hack at it and see what happens. I think he could hit some home runs. I think it would be better suited for him to be that kind of a hitter than a straight Punch and Judy type of hitter."
Another scout said he thought Jordan's defensive style of hitting stems from a lack of recognition of pitches.
"There's nothing that can be done or cured or helped in the space of a year or two," he said. "It's going to take awhile. You have to have a feel for how hard the guy's throwing, how the ball moves, what pitch it might be. He gets caught out in front. He gets fooled quite a bit."
An executive of a National League club said if he were in charge of Jordan's baseball future, he would put him back in Class AA next season, not that he had flunked that grade but that he just needed to repeat it.
Jim Beattie, a former pitcher and now the Seattle Mariners' minor league director, said Jordan needed to face a lot of different pitching and learn to adjust to pitches inside.
"When I saw him, it looked like his swing was a little long," Beattie said. "It looked like he was trying to sweep a little bit, just trying to get his hands through. If I was a pitcher pitching to him, I'd try to hit him hard in, then throw breaking balls away."
That's precisely what pitchers try to do with Jordan, with success more often than not. But inside pitches, at least, don't intimidate him.
"He has no fear of the ball," a general manager said. "One time I saw where a ball went up under his chin. He went right back in and took a good swing at the next pitch."
Can Jordan make it to the majors? That is, after all, what he's trying to do. None of the general managers, other executives and scouts answered the question with an unqualified yes.
"If he gets there," an assistant general manager said, "it'll be on a promotional basis, I believe. From what little I've seen, he's so far behind at 31 years old, he doesn't seem to have real good instincts for the game. He was on base twice the game I saw, was picked off once and was damn near picked off the second time. He seems to be slow reacting. In the outfield, he's a little tentative."
Another assistant general manager said he thought Jordan would make it "but only because of a very unique situation with ownership." This executive, too, pointed to something Jordan lacks.
"It's not just the physical and mechanical adjustment but also a mental approach to this game he still has to overcome," he said. "I don't think he can overcome that. That's the whole thing. You get to that point by playing when you're a youngster. This game is difficult enough playing it all your life."
Gary Hughes, the Florida Marlins' scouting director, was one of those who cited Jordan's improvement from the time he started last February.
"It's not as goofy as I thought it was," Hughes said of the idea of Jordan's playing major league baseball. "It's still within the realm of possibility."
But time is against Jordan. "If you looked at him as an 18- or 19-year-old, you might think you could improve his skills a little bit, but at his age, it looks like it will be difficult," a general manager said, then offered a scouting report: "arm below average, power below average, ball doesn't jump off his bat, good runner, plays the game hard, instincts lacking."
The scout who watched Jordan hit an 81-mile-an-hour fastball for a soft double did not rule out an eventual visit to the majors.
"If I had to bet on him making it, I'd probably take the Fifth because I have no way of determining how long he'll stick with it," he said. "If he sticks with it a couple more years, he may be able to play. If he ever gets to the point where he can do some of these things naturally, he'd be worth his weight in gold. But as far as being a major league player, the chances are astronomical against it. But I wouldn't bet against him. If I had him, I wouldn't release him."

HEADLINE: In America;
At Last, A Truce

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The cold war has ended. Governor-elect George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are going to sit down and talk. The blood feud, provoked by Mayor Giuliani's decision to cross party lines and endorse Mario Cuomo for re-election, is being put aside -- at least for the time being.
Political egos being what they are, it took nearly a week to negotiate the cease-fire. The word began to filter out early yesterday: 
 "Something may happen soon," said a Pataki aide.
"We may have it resolved," said a voice from the Giuliani camp.
You might have thought they were talking about Grant and Lee at Appomattox.
However it was arranged, the agreement comes not a moment too soon. Mr. Pataki is on a working vacation in Florida, no doubt trying to figure out how to keep his promise to cut income taxes by 25 percent now that he knows the state will face a $4 billion shortfall next year.
Mr. Giuliani is in City Hall, trying to close a billion-dollar budget gap right now. The Mayor's cuts are no longer surgical in nature. Most fat has already been removed. Each new cut is a ghastly gouging of services needed by New Yorkers -- in some cases, desperately needed.
With both the city and the state in deep financial trouble, there was no time for a feud between the Mayor and the Governor-elect.
Ramon Cortines, the city's Schools Chancellor, was on the verge of tears Monday as he testified before the City Council about the latest cuts to hit the school system. "We are standing at the edge of an abyss," he said. "With each new round of cuts our footing grows more precarious."
Council leaders are fighting drastic budget cuts on a wide front. They are trying to prevent the elimination of city funding for mental retardation and substance abuse programs. They are trying to block the dismissal of civilians from the police force and prevent further cuts to the overburdened Department of Corrections.
Youth programs are hemorrhaging. Programs that feed the hungry are hurting. And Comptroller Alan Hevesi contends that the city could face another shortfall, of $400 million, before the end of the fiscal year.
The feud between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani had gone far beyond the usual antipathy between governors and mayors. Mr. Giuliani took an enormous gamble with his endorsement and he lost. It was inevitable that he would be punished. But there were other elements to the feud -- big slights and little slights, some public, some private. And there was always the specter of U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's patron, hovering in the background. The feud was threatening to seriously interfere with the work of running the city and the state.
I once asked Dizzy Gillespie how close he had been to Charlie Parker. He replied, "How close are two coats of paint?" The same can be said about the interests of New York City and New York State. Each is dependent upon the other.
Mr. Giuliani's continuing budget problems cannot be worked out without the help of the state. Mr. Pataki's effort to cut taxes and streamline government haven't a prayer without the cooperation of the city.
The mutual interests go far beyond issues of budget and taxation. Mayors and governors have no choice but to work together in good faith on economic development, on transportation issues, on law and order.
(One example: As soon as a convict in New York City is sentenced to a year or more in jail, he goes into the state prison system.)
The links are endless. The city's health and social welfare systems are monitored and regulated by the state. And while there are many who are reluctant to admit it, the city is the dynamic force that gives the entire state its national and international stature.
"You can't separate the two," said a former state official. "Without a hand-in-glove kind of interaction, neither jurisdiction can be effective in achieving its objectives."
New York City is particularly vulnerable now because of the tax-cutting, anti-urban, anti-social welfare policies of the national Republican Party. Although Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani are Republicans, they have an obligation to fight for the legitimate interests of city residents.
That can begin to happen when they finally sit down next week. It could have begun sooner, if either man's ego had allowed him to just pick up the telephone.

Out of the Hands of Babes

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
Would you buy a rug if you knew that it had been woven in India by 10-year-olds beaten if they didn't work fast enough? Would you wear a shirt if it had been sewn by a 9-year-old locked into a factory in Bangladesh until production quotas for the day had been met? Would you eat sardines if the cans had been filled by 12-year-old Filipino children sold into bonded servitude?
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, is the most sweeping free-trade pact in history. But like many agreements among different nations with different agendas, much has been lost in the translation. One of the losses in the GATT negotiations was the right of children not to be exploited, overworked and underpaid as a source of cheap and compliant labor around the world. 
 From the children who make carpets in India, sometimes 16 hours a day, seven days a week, to those who sew in Bangladesh for as little as five cents an hour, the International Labor Organization estimates that there may be as many as 200 million child laborers worldwide. Some are working in sweatshops that contract to make American goods. In testimony before the Senate earlier this year, a 15-year-old from Honduras told of girls working up to 80 hours a week at a factory manufacturing Liz Claiborne sweaters.
Child labor is the dirty little secret of foreign imports. Senator Tom Harkin, who wants to outlaw U.S. imports of all products made by children under age 15, says the problem is that Americans don't know that some of what they buy, including toys for their own kids, has been manufactured by children working the kind of hours, under the kind of conditions, that many still associate with the darkest days of the Industrial Revolution.
"You give me any cross-section of 100 Americans," says the Senator, "people from any income level, any area of the country, and I think the reaction would be overwhelmingly against buying the products."
Mr. Harkin is a voice crying in the wilderness, and the wilderness is the gilded thicket of free trade, thorny with U.S. concessions. Mr. Harkin's bill to keep products made with child labor out of the United States would probably be a violation of GATT, which provides only for those restrictions spelled out in the trade pact.
During various GATT negotiations, developing countries successfully argued against child labor provisions, insisting that children have always worked in their cultures, that to try to interfere with child labor is protectionist and punitive when a child may be the only wage-earner in a desperately poor family.
But the tradition of children helping on small farms and the innovation of locking them into a hotbox of a factory for 14 hours a day are worlds apart. The reason they may be the only wage-earner in some areas is because adult workers have been laid off in favor of children, who are infinitely more exploitable and provide bigger profits for prosperous factory owners. And nations that really want to compete in a global economy will educate their kids, not work them half to death before they've even reached puberty.
After the bad publicity of the Senate hearings, Liz Claiborne announced that it was ditching the Honduran contractor, then decided instead it would "work with the facility" to "meet our human rights standards." A few American companies have been ahead of the curve; Levi Strauss and Reebok, for instance, had already demanded that their contractors overseas hire only workers over age 14. In India a consortium of carpet makers has started an industry campaign that tags those products made without child labor. That's the least Americans deserve, some assurance that what they buy has not been manufactured by kids.
Amid attempts to protect elephants from ivory poachers and dolphins from tuna nets, the rights of children go remarkably unremarked. "This is the last vestige of slavery sanctioned in the world today," said Senator Harkin. If GATT passes, an opportunity to end these children's servitude will have been shunted aside for the alleged bonanza of free trade. But consumers can vote with their credit cards only if products are labeled. At the very least the slogan "Not Manufactured with Child Labor" should shame those companies not in a position to affix it to their products.

HEADLINE: The Cheering Over, Haitians Face New Trials

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having lived in and reported on Haiti on and off for five years, I've found your coverage reflects an exclusively Northern perspective. 
 On Oct. 15, Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti's presidential palace, where, flanked by Northern diplomats and standing behind a bulletproof-glass encasement, he released a dove. Less than a month later, President Clinton has announced the withdrawal, by Dec. 1, of the first 6,000 American troops. The crisis, it seems, is over.
But for the Haitian people, a new trial is at hand. President Aristide's term is nearly elapsed. The grass-roots organizations that elected him have been coerced, co-opted and killed off. The military leaders have been legitimized by golden exile and even honored by Jimmy Carter, who invited Gen. Raoul Cedras to teach his Sunday school class; their underlings remain at large.
The international lending agencies have already taken command of Haiti's economic future with a program allowing the Haitian elite along with foreign businesses to continue exploiting Haiti's "price-competitive" labor force (the lowest paid of the region).
Many of the Haitian poor have welcomed the United States troops, who they believe will rescue them from the military's thugs. Haitians were asked to bring known criminals to the Americans, who in turn are supposed to escort them to local jails. So far, the faith of the Haitian poor has been misplaced. Those arrested at the front gate are released out the back.
On Oct. 30, more than 100 prisoners "broke out" of the national penitentiary when guards opened their cells. The problem is that the jailers are good friends with the jailed, having worked side by side with them during the military rule.
Haiti's remaining grass-roots leaders have been more wary of the occupation. Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, a cabinet member in President Aristide's Government and leader of Haiti's largest peasant movement, returned to his base in the town of Hinche after three years in exile and hiding. He warned the cheering crowd not to count on the United States Army. "Only Haitians can free Haiti," he proclaimed.
Three years ago the United States responded to Haiti's bloody coup with overt indignation and covert support. Secretary of State James Baker declared to the Organization of American States in October 1991, "Until President Aristide's Government is restored, this junta will be treated as a pariah, without support, and without a future."
But the military and their sponsors in the Haitian elite were given no reason to believe that the United States would interfere.
President Bush delayed a month in joining the O.A.S. embargo adopted just after the coup. By February 1992 Mr. Bush actually lifted the embargo for United States companies with factories in Haiti. Sears, Wal-Mart and American baseball manufacturers continued to profit from the junta -- and indirectly insure its future.
President Aristide, meanwhile, became the victim of a Central Intelligence Agency propaganda campaign that questioned his human rights record and leaked false documents that diagnosed him as a psychopath. C.I.A. complicity did not end there. Last winter Toto Constant, head of the violent paramilitary group Fraph, handed me a thick binder, complete with color copies, documenting Mr. Aristide's maniacal tendencies.
As I interviewed Mr. Constant in his sitting room, he looked me straight in the eye and began every sentence with the phrase "The C.I.A. has found that . . ." You finally reported last month that Toto Constant was on the C.I.A. payroll.
The generals retire to honorable exile, earned at the cost of thousands of Haitian lives, while Mr. Aristide stands in a glass box, caged by his American saviors. The Haitian people have lost all that they won in their first free elections. Though the crisis seems to be over from America's perspective, it is no victory for Haiti.

Making it work when opposites attract.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
LAST summer one of my sons, the product of a Swedish-American father from a Lutheran Minnesota family and a mother of Russian-Jewish descent from New York, married a Filipino-born Presbyterian woman from California. Next spring his twin brother will marry a Korean-born woman who grew up in a Methodist family in Ohio and New York.
But according to the findings of the newest and best survey of sexuality in America, my family's melting-pot mix of ethnic, religious and racial heritages is relatively rare. Despite the fascination many claim to have with the exotic and the popular belief that opposites attract, this survey found that the overwhelming majority of Americans choose their sexual partners and their lifetime mates from a pool of people very much like themselves. 
 The survey, published by the University of Chicago Press, found that choices of sexual partners seem to follow the same rules of social behavior that friendships do: "Birds of a feather flock together." Although you may think you can choose from among an endless variety of potential partners, or that your choice will be determined by some irresistible spark ignited without regard for social background, the survey findings and the way the researchers have interpreted them indicate otherwise. Few of us are as free as we might like to think we are, ready to pursue an unfettered sex life and mate and marry at random.
Indirectly, the findings also suggest that couples like those in my family who break out of cultural confines do so at more than the usual risk to a harmonious relationship.
 
Limited Choices
 The authors, an economist, Dr. Robert T. Michael, two sociologists, Dr. John H. Gagnon and Dr. Edward O. Laumann, and a graduate student in sociology, Stuart Michaels, point to strong incentives that prompt people to date others who are like themselves. In a companion volume, "Sex in America (Little, Brown $22.95) written with Gina Kolata, a science writer for The New York Times, they explain: "Not only do the man and woman in a partnership have sex together, but they share conversations and meals, they decide which movie to see on a Saturday night and which radio station to listen to when they drive there. The more alike the individuals are -- the more they have similar intellects and interests, for example -- the easier it is to share their lives. If a man and a woman also have similar levels of education, are of similar ages and similar social and religious backgrounds, it may be even easier for them to share their lives."
If only from a logistic perspective, people with similar backgrounds are most likely to meet one another -- at school, work, parties, clubs or social organizations or through introductions made by family members or friends. Sixty-three percent of the couples in the survey met through people who knew them both, and 60 percent met at places where people who are alike tend to congregate.
Many outsiders exert their influence. Those who feel they have a stake in a match pass judgment on its suitability and thus affect the stability of the relationship. How well will the partner you choose fit into your social, professional and family milieu? Will the partner get along with your friends? Will he or she be accepted -- or better yet, welcomed -- into the family fold? A professional woman with a graduate degree is not likely to choose a mechanic who never finished high school. Nor is a white man from a politically and religiously conservative family likely to bring home a woman who is a Black Muslim.
Personal issues enter in as well. The researchers say, for example, that people with similar ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds are more likely to be sexually compatible. "Some sexual preferences, like oral sex, are closely related to a person's race and social class," they point out. Partners with similar backgrounds are also more likely to agree on how to bring up children, sharing views on discipline, guidance and nurturing.
The bottom line, according to the survey authors, is that "likes attract each other because the partnerships between similar people work best."
 
Solving Problems
 Although my husband and I are thrilled with our expanding international family, our own experience in reconciling differences in our backgrounds should serve as a warning to our sons that they may face more than the usual challenges involved in making a marriage work. While open communication is essential to the success of any close relationship, "mixed" couples especially need to be certain that their messages are not only spoken and heard but understood and dealt with.
A reticent Garrison Keillor type who is a master of indirection speaks a different language from that spoken by an aggressive New Yorker who always says what is on her mind. The Keillor type may take the voluble woman too seriously, whereas the woman may not even hear, let alone appreciate, the significance of what the man is saying.
Also important is to try to avoid behaviors -- social, sexual and relational -- that, as a result of the partners' disparate backgrounds, are embarrassing or distasteful to either of them. Rather than ignoring such sensitivities or constantly trying to change one another, the couple must acknowledge and accept differences or else equitably resolve them in ways that preserve the individuality and self-esteem of each partner without undermining the integrity of the relationship.
Molly Haskell, a film critic who describes herself as "a Southern WASP, repressed, poised" and "totally committed" to her marriage to a man of Greek heritage who is "rumpled, swarthy, explosive," concluded that "the success -- or failure -- of these seemingly odd couples depends to a great extent on the success of both partners in establishing their viable independence. At the first sign of weakness or failure, the difference in background can become more exasperating than exotic."
For some mixed couples, the societal obstacles are especially difficult to surmount. The survey authors note that "some of the most vehement proscriptions are against homosexual couples; almost as forbidden is interracial dating." The adjustments required of such couples can be made even more challenging if, as in the case of Romeo and Juliet or Abie and his Irish Rose, families oppose the match or disapproving friends desert the couple. Love does not always conquer all.

HEADLINE: One Nation, One Vote? That's Not Fair

SERIES: CLINTON & CONGRESS -- An occasional series.

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind is a senior editor at Harper's Magazine.

 BODY:
When Congress takes up the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next week, it should focus on diplomacy, not economics. It should give particular scrutiny to the treaty's proposed offspring, the World Trade Organization, which could cause immeasurable damage to American diplomacy for years to come.
Contrary to the claims of Vice President Al Gore and other Administration spokesmen, the future of world trade does not depend on GATT. Whether the treaty is ratified or not, world trade will continue to grow as it has for half a century. Nor, despite the claims of right-wing isolationists and left-wing consumer advocates, is sovereignty -- ours or anyone else's -- at stake. By definition, a treaty requires signers to forgo certain exercises of authority or "sovereignty." 
 The most important thing at stake in the debate over GATT is American power. Can America still convert its military and economic power into preponderance in international organizations? Apparently not, on the evidence of the treaty that the Bush Administration negotiated and that President Clinton is pushing.
For four decades, the United States has protected its interests and made the most of its influence in trade negotiations under GATT. In effect, the U.S. has always had a veto in GATT, which has operated by consensus since 1959 (the last time a formal vote was taken). But that veto is about to be taken away.
If Congress ratifies the new treaty, GATT's loose working arrangement will be replaced by the World Trade Organization, which has frequently been described as a United Nations for world trade. That analogy is off the mark.
When negotiating the U.N. Charter, American diplomats were careful to balance the General Assembly, in which every country has one vote, with the Security Council, whose permanent members -- the great powers -- are able to protect their interests with a veto over any collective action. The World Trade Organization would give the great powers no such advantage; it would be nothing more than a General Assembly of world trade.
The U.S., despite its enormous importance in the world economy, would have neither a veto nor a weighted vote (as it has in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank). The treaty provides that in most cases decisions "shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast" and that "each member of the W.T.O. shall have one vote."
Cuba would have as much voting power as the U.S. Eighteen members would have populations of less than a million; the votes of many of these tiny countries might be up for sale in return for investment or arms.
Japan might round up enough ministate votes to bar U.S. trade laws intended to pry open its markets. The European Community has already published lists of U.S. trade measures it would like to see struck down. It could use the trade organization to do so, perhaps with the help of Eastern European and African proxies.
The consequences for American diplomacy may be even more serious. If the U.S. endorses the rule of one nation one vote in the World Trade Organization, other countries may insist on that principle in the design of other international bodies.
Suppose that the U.S. decided to support the creation of a new Pacific security forum. The best institutional arrangement for the U.S. would give weighted votes or vetoes to the great powers -- America, China and Japan, and perhaps India, Russia and Indonesia. But tiny countries like Singapore, grown accustomed to having as much pull as the U.S. in the World Trade Organization, might insist on the right to outvote the U.S. in Pacific security matters.
GATT's proponents argue that the U.S. will be protected by a clause allowing members to quit the World Trade Organization on six months' notice. But if we join, the same voices will be heard stridently denouncing the very idea of withdrawal as a threat to the world economy and an abandonment of U.S. leadership. Countries hostile to our economic interests will correctly dismiss the threat of American withdrawal as a bluff.
Yes, GATT contains minor market-opening measures that would benefit us. But these can be obtained by future negotiations. In fact, we don't really need global consensus on trade matters. Most world trade takes place among the U.S., Europe and Japan. Other countries have little choice but to go along with the arrangements they agree upon.
The potential benefits of the treaty are not worth the endorsement of the one nation one vote principle as the basis for the first major international organization to be established after the cold war. By torpedoing the World Trade Organization, Congress would not damage America's prestige, as the Administration claims. Rather, it would demonstrate that the U.S. is still a great power that insists on its prerogatives in international organizations.

HEADLINE: Dole and Clinton Strike a Deal on World Trade Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton today struck a deal with the prospective Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, that appeared to rescue a world trade agreement scheduled for a vote at a special session of Congress next week.
The compromise with Mr. Dole raised the hope of a measure of bipartisanship in foreign policy between the White House and the new Republican-controlled Congress. 
 After weeks of haggling with Administration officials, Mr. Dole received many of the concessions he had demanded. At noon today he appeared in the Rose Garden, shook Mr. Clinton's hand and declared that his reservations about the 124-nation accord, an expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, had been resolved.
The major concession by the Administration, he said, was to give Congress a "trigger mechanism" that would enable it to vote to withdraw from the agreement if it felt the United States was subject to unfair rulings by a newly created court of international trade. "I think we've fixed it," said Mr. Dole, who had come under tremendous and conflicting pressures in recent days from businesses that declared the pact vital to American competitiveness and from conservatives who said it would give panels of foreign judges the right to override American laws. "It may not be perfect, but it answers a lot of the concerns."
To reach today's compromise, Mr. Dole backed away from an effort he began last weekend to get the Administration to go along with a cut in the capital gains tax, long a Republican objective, in exchange for his support for the trade pact. In the end, he settled for a letter from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to consider the issue next year.
The agreement accomplished two goals for Mr. Dole: he appeared to have toughened the agreement -- though not enough for his conservative critics -- while satisfying corporations that would be his most vital source of support if he decided to seek the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
By making concessions to Mr. Dole, Mr. Clinton is sidestepping what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a floor manager of the bill, termed near-certain defeat in the Senate, where 60 votes will be required to approve the agreement.
"We did not have the votes," Mr. Moynihan said today. "We weren't going to get them. The problem was, there were 35 Republicans who were Senator Dole's supporters." Without Mr. Dole's support, he said, "it can't be done."
The House is scheduled to vote on the trade agreement next Tuesday. Passage there, by a simple majority, seems nearly assured. The Senate vote is set for Thursday.
Both White House officials and Mr. Dole's aides, while differing somewhat on the nuances and effects of the agreement they struck, declared that the trade accord had demonstrated that the President and the future majority leader could work together and that paralysis was not the destiny of the 104th Congress.
"We have moved one step closer toward gaining broad bipartisan support for GATT," Mr. Clinton said today, clearly relieved that passage of his Administration's largest international economic initiative now seemed assured. "This agreement requires all trading nations to play by the same rules, and since the United States has the most productive and competitive economy in the world, that is good news for our workers and our future."
But the Administration paid a price for Mr. Dole's support. It agreed to create a commission next year that will ultimately give Congress a far greater voice in the question of whether the United States should remain a member of the newly created World Trade Organization, the institution that will act as a rule-setter and a judge in the disputes over international trade.
The commission, consisting of five Federal appellate judges, will review all the organization's rulings against the United States and determine whether they were fairly reached. Under what Mr. Dole termed today a "three strikes and we're out" rule, if the commission finds three unreasonable rulings, Congress can initiate moves to withdraw from the World Trade Organization. Under the rules of the agreement, any country can withdraw with six months' notice. Before the Administration's concession to Mr. Dole, that was assumed to be solely the decision of the President.
Mr. Dole is hoping that the change he extracted will be enough to silence opponents of the agreement. That is a disparate group that includes consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, trade hawks like Ross Perot and conservatives like Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
All of the pact's critics have contended that the new trade organization will effectively have the power to rule against any American laws -- from environmental protections to laws against the purchase of goods made by child labor -- that it judges to be a barrier to imported goods. The result, they argue, is a loss of sovereignty for the United States.
The Administration responded that the concerns were vastly overblown, because the World Trade Organization would have the power not to force a change in American law, only to impose trade penalties if the United States refused to go along with its rulings.
Still, the complaints about the loss of American sovereignty left the Administration in a quandary. It could not open up the trade agreement and change provisions without renegotiating its terms with all 123 other member nations, a step that would have undoubtedly killed an agreement that took a dozen years to negotiate.
On the other hand, defeat of the treaty in Congress would have killed any hopes of expanding GATT, an agreement that began in 1948 and has expanded in fits and starts since. It would have wiped out the broad tariff cuts that would aid American exports, and killed provisions providing new protections for intellectual property -- whether computer software or music -- and services in which American industry is most competitive.
But Mr. Dole clearly was not able to satisfy the right wing of his party, which has abandoned its traditional commitment to free trade and begun to describe agreements like the GATT as a sell-out of American economic interests. Today, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who sought the Republican Presidential nomination in 1992 on a platform of "America First" in trade, said that the message of Mr. Dole's decision was that "money talks."
"All the big money in the Republican Party is pro-GATT, and all the populists are against it," Mr. Buchanan said today. "The party went with the big money, and stiffed the populists, to pay its campaign debts."

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Off 1.5% In First Drop Since July

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Orders for long-lived manufactured products, a closely watched predictor of economic activity, fell last month for the first time since July in what some economists regarded as a sign the business expansion might be slowing.
"This does perhaps indicate that the economic boomlet may be subsiding," said Lynn Reaser, senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, as the Commerce Department reported a 1.5 percent decline in orders for durable goods, which range from camcorders to tanks. 
 But other economists disputed the idea that the report, though somewhat weaker on its face than expected, pointed to diminished activity in the nation's factories.
"There's an awful lot of orders in the pipeline," said Mark P. Vitner, economist at the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., noting that orders for capital goods were 14.7 percent above those of October 1993. "I just don't see the slowdown out there."
Another skeptic was Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. Factories are "very much alive and well," he said, noting that durables figures are highly erratic and that main sectors that fell in October -- transportation and the military -- had surged in preceding months.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits were unchanged at 326,000 in the week ended last Saturday, with the four-week average edging up 500, to 326,750.
And the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence eased to 91.6 in November from 92.7 last month, according to subscribers to its survey.
The report on durable goods, products made to last at least three years, was dominated by a 9.4 percent drop for transportation orders. But analysts said this was not a sign of real weakness because of various production problems in the auto industry, where, because vehicles can be turned out virtually on demand, there is no distinction between orders and shipments.
Transportation equipment was about unchanged in September but had soared 20.1 percent in August. Excluding transportation, orders for durables climbed 1.1 percent in October.
Similarly, military orders slumped 16.9 percent in October, the first month of the new fiscal year, after gains of 11.6 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, in September and August.
Not counting this sector, durable goods would have fallen eight-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed.
But the other major categories all posted gains, albeit fractional ones -- industrial machinery eight-tenths of 1 percent, electronic equipment five-tenths of 1 percent and primary metals three-tenths of 1 percent.
For capital goods alone, new orders fell 5 percent but this drop was pared to 2.9 percent, mainly reflecting communications equipment, when the military is excluded and to four-tenths of 1 percent when both the military and the aircraft and parts categories are excluded.
Shipments of durables last month fell 1.2 percent, the second straight decline and the third in four months, but this also reflected the big decline in auto production.
Unfilled orders edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $424.8 billion, the report also showed, with industrial machinery up 2 percent and primary metals up 3.4 percent.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, pointing to a 1.7 percent advance in unfilled orders for nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft, said this indicated "growing backlog problems in the manufacturing sector of the economy and continued momentum going forward."
On the other hand, Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said the decline in orders "clearly indicates the economy is slowing down."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Ukraine has a good chance of winning its dash for capitalism.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LEONID KUCHMA, the President of Ukraine since July, made the rounds this week to convince Americans to come to the aid of his country. To no one's surprise, the blunt, poised politician -- once the manager of the Soviet Union's premier nuclear missile factory -- argued that Ukrainians were finally ready to take the plunge to free markets.
"We have no other choice," Mr. Kuchma said. 
 What may be surprising is that a lot of analysts jaded by the unfulfilled promises of post-Soviet reformers take his words seriously. Indeed, among Western advocates of a rapid conversion to a market economy in the ex-Soviet nations, enthusiasm for President Kuchma's plan borders on the unbridled.
"Ukraine," says John Mroz, director of the Institute for East-West Studies in New York, "could be the economic success story of 1995."
Before 1991 all lines of authority ran directly from Ukraine's bloated state enterprises to ministries in Moscow. That left the newly independent country of 52 million people without experience in managing the government budget or the economy. Even worse, says David Snelbacker, associate director of the Project on Economic Reform in Ukraine at the Kennedy School at Harvard, the long-Sovietized nation could not draw on the "collective memory of capitalism" enjoyed by Poles and Czechs.
Still, when the empire collapsed, Ukraine seemed to have a reasonable shot at economic success. Like Russia, the country was well endowed with natural resources and an educated work force. Unlike Russia, it had a decent transportation system and did not need to resort to police-state tactics to maintain ethnic peace.
Anything that could have gone wrong, though, did. The first nationalist government, led by Leonid Kravchuk, "was more interested in politics than policy," Mr. Snelbacker says. President Kravchuk refused to make unpleasant choices. He propped up obsolete industries, ran gigantic budget deficits to support social spending and financed imports -- notably, natural gas -- with loans from the other former Soviet republics.
The result was hyperinflation and a collapse in production. The World Bank estimates that prices doubled in 1991, rose fifteenfold in 1992 and another 41-fold in 1993. Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and an adviser to the new Government, says he believes national output is down by half since 1991.
As Mr. Mroz baldly puts it: "Ukraine was desperate for change, on the verge of economic and political collapse."
And change is what it is about to get. At first, Mr. Kuchma hardly seemed the sort to break the crucible. He was, after all, a man, in Mr. Mroz's words, from "the pinnacle of the military-industrial complex." But Westerners underestimated his pragmatism and political skill.
Apparently with little direct knowledge of economics, Mr. Kuchma surrounded himself with competent technocrats. Equally important, he alternately bullied and flattered the parliamentary opposition into submission.
President Kuchma's economic policies look like an amalgam of the shock therapy imposed in Poland in 1990 and the rapid privatization under way in Russia. Prices have been decontrolled. And thanks to the quiet resistance of the central bank in the waning months of the Kravchek administration, inflation is down to a level that is almost tolerable.
The next steps are more ambitious. One goal is to curb industrial credit, allowing nonmonopoly enterprises to profit from deregulation so that markets are used to determine the survivors. Another is to phase out the budget deficit, largely by eliminating subsidies. Still another is to raise domestic energy prices and eliminate barriers to exports. All these measures are to be buttressed by privatization financed by vouchers.
Mr. Aslund, who has seen equally grand plans scaled back in Russia, is nonetheless optimistic about Ukraine's dash for capitalism. For one thing, he argues, the collapse of obsolete industry has virtually run its course. For another, Ukraine's "social fabric is pretty much intact."
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- chastened by criticism of their bureaucratic inertia elsewhere in the former Soviet empire -- stand prepared to finance a good portion of the stabilization effort. What is unclear, however, is whether the rich industrialized countries will do their part: Neither the United States nor the European Union seems inclined to lend more than token sums for the effort.
Mr. Kuchma, who recently rammed through legislation confirming a promise to dismantle strategic nuclear weapons, makes no secret of his frustration. This may be the last chance for a long time, he suggests, to create a prosperous Ukraine to anchor stability in eastern Europe.
"It is a lot better to have visits from President Kuchma," explains the ex-missile maker, "than from the products he formerly produced."

HEADLINE: A Day to Give Thanks for Balloons;
A 'Balloonatic' Makes Air Sculptures for Macy's Parade

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
For 30 years, Manfred G. Bass has dreamed up and guided the creation of the balloons and floats of Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. It is the only job Mr. Bass, a 59-year-old artist, has ever held, and the only one he ever really wanted.
"It's a work of love," he said, as he matter-of-factly fastened his official metal parade badge to his canvas overalls with industrial rivets, as always. "It's what makes the world go round. They're all giant toys, you know?" 
 So it was that Mr. Bass was at work yesterday, checking to make sure his beloved balloons were properly packed in their huge boxes for today's parade, handling all manner of last-minute transportation planning. He was far from alone in the former Tootsie Roll factory in Hoboken where what he calls his "air sculptures" are born. Volunteers, some from as far away as Michigan and Australia, were helping his staff of 20 pack boxes and load trucks with such wonders as his grinning new Cat in the Hat balloon.
"This is my favorite place in the whole world," said George Behn, who was there to escort the convoy through the Lincoln Tunnel and today will drive the emergency repair truck. He began doing this as a Macy's employee, then kept on volunteering after getting a job as a salesman for a competitor. "This is like Santa's workshop and I feel like a little kid in the middle of it."
It was part of a long tradition that appears likely to continue. Mr. Bass said that despite the recent purchase of Macy's by Federated Department Stores, he has neither seen nor heard of any change in Macy's commitment to the parade. In Cleveland, Dixie Barker, a Federated spokeswoman, confirmed his observation. "You can't mess with tradition like this," she said.
The actual event is the culmination of a long process. Already, he and his 20 self-described "balloonatics," including artists, sculptors, draftsmen, welders and animators, are thinking of ideas for the 1995 parade. In January, the serious brainstorming will begin, escalating through the months to this week's frenzied, sleepless pace.
Design, Mr. Bass said, can take many months. An important question is whether a figure is best presented vertically, like Bart Simpson, or horizontally, like Spiderman. Some like Big Bird are in between: the Sesame Street hero is about three-quarters vertical.
The presentation of the Cat in the Hat, the Dr. Seuss character making his premiere appearance in the parade this year, presented certain opportunities and definite challenges. His large, striped stovepipe hat provided a lot of volume to fill up with helium, helping to support him. But the cat as drawn in the book was woefully skinny.
This was solved by placing the cat on the vacuum-cleaner-like contraption he uses to clean up his extensive mess in the last part of the book. This provided valuable volume to be filled with buoyant helium gas.
By contrast, this year's other new character, Barney, the saccharine purple dinosaur, needed no such calculations. "Barney is a full-bodied character," Mr. Bass said.
Mr. Bass, the oldest of seven siblings, has always lived in New Jersey, except for a stint at the New York Phoenix School of Design in Manhattan, where he studied storybook illustration. In the Army, he worked as an artist and sculptured a 12-foot-high statue of an infantryman for Fort Benning, Ga., that was dedicated by President Eisenhower. Then in 1960, he became an assistant to the Thanksgiving Day parade designer, then an outside contractor.
Several years later, Macy's took over the parade as an in-house production, and named Mr. Bass chief designer. He attributes much of the success of the parade to the nearly 3,000 Macy's employees who volunteer their lunch hours to be drilled in how to handle the big balloons. A dozen or so others sit inside the turkey float, moving eyes and wings as internal puppeteers. Others help dismantle floats at Macy's even as others are just getting started from the American Museum of Natural History at 77th Street and Central Park West.
Leaders are also anointed. Some are trained in the intricacies of balloon flight and are called pilots. Others are captains, and taught to bark orders in the event of sudden wind shifts. "Move right, fast!" they scream, as crowds ooh and ahh.
"This is something you can't capture on TV," Mr. Bass said. "The effect is that of a huge sailing ship coming down the parade route."
The parade begins at 9 A.M. at the Museum of Natural History, follows Central Park West to Columbus Circle, then goes south on Broadway to Herald Square and east on 34th Street to Seventh Avenue.
Yesterday, the chief balloonatic was constantly on the phone, handling last-minute strategy. "Oh, brother," he muttered when informed of a windy weather forecast. Ahead was the task of getting some of the biggest floats, particularly the 40-foot-high Swan Princess through the 12 1/2-foot-high Lincoln Tunnel. Balloons, which travel in eight-foot-long boxes, are easier.
But the journey was made, and the inflation of the balloons began just after 3 P.M. at the staging area outside the museum.
"Just don't use the word blow up," Mr. Bass cautioned. "We get a little nervous when we hear that word."

Chart: "AT A GALNCE: The Birth of a Balloon"
The balloons feature each year in the Macy's Thankgiving Day parade are complex undertakings. Making his debut this year will be the Cat in the Hat, the Dr. Seuss character. When the Cat in the Hat, along with 17 other balloons, heads down Central Park West this morning, it will mark the culmination of a long process.
 
THE BEGINNING
Workers begin brainstorming in January. First, a drawing is made, followed by a clay model from which is made a plastic mold. This is used to make a working model. Small patches are plces on the model's surface and used to create larger pieces for the actual balloon.
 
THE CONSTRUCTION
Volunteers, working in a loft on Hoboken, take about three months to construct a balloon. Each balloon takes 320 to 450 pounds of nylon, which is coated on both side with urethane. The seams are heat sealed.
 
THE DESIGN
This balloon has 14 chambers, which help in stabilization. Helium is used in the upper chambers, and a mixture of Helium and air is used in the lower chambers.
To allow for additional volume, the balloon's creators places the cat on a simplified version of the contraption he rides in the book. (Source: Macy's)

HEADLINE: Many Turn Holiday Into Mini-Vacation

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Spurred by bargain air fares and stable gasoline prices, a record number of Americans were expected to travel over Thanksgiving week, traditionally the busiest travel time of the year.
And although many people have long taken off the Friday after Thanksgiving, this year, travel experts say, more are viewing their long weekend as a time for both holiday visits with families and friends as well as a chance to sightsee, shop or ski. 
 "Instead of journeying to Grandma's house near home, many families will spend Thanksgiving a good distance from home, treating the holiday as a mini-vacation," said Jerry Cheske, who monitors travel patterns for the Automobile Association of America.
Henry Blinder, a spokesman for Thomas Cook Travel/American Express, said, "We're noticing that more people than usual are also taking off Friday this year, in addition to Thanksgiving Day, and using it for vacation travel."
A record 30.4 million Americans will travel at least 100 miles this holiday, one million more than last Thanksgiving, according to the automobile association's estimates, and 66 percent say they will stay with friends or relatives.
But the actual number of Americans traveling is likely to exceed even those heady estimates, since the survey, prepared for the automobile association by the U.S. Travel Data Center, the research arm of the Travel Industry Association of America, was taken before a recent spate of discount airfares -- most notably United Airlines fares as low as $9.97 between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
All 5,600 seats offered at that fare, valid for travel from noon today to noon Saturday, sold out in just over 24 hours. The airline originally planned to charge $9.99, said Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, but it settled on the even lower fare when its obdurate computer insisted on rounding off $9.99 to $10. The revenue from those fares, about $40,000 after taxes, is going to homeless groups in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Other airlines have also offered Thanksgiving bargains, most of them aimed at leisure travelers, said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association. As a result, Mr. Chiames said, the discounts should enable the airlines to fly with planes fuller than even the early predictions. The association estimates that the percentage of seats filled on Sunday, the day most travelers will head home, will average a whopping 80.3 percent, or almost 1.7 million passengers, compared with a usual percentage on other days of roughly 65 percent.
While neither the Air Transport Association nor the A.A.A. necessarily recommend it, both organizations agreed that Thanksgiving Day is the least hectic day during this holiday for travelers to get where they are going and back.
Even before the latest holiday discounts, average domestic air fares were down 3.3 percent from last year. And the 2.6 percent rise in the cost of travel for the 12 months through September 1994 lagged behind the 3 percent rise in consumer prices, according to the U.S. Travel Data Center.
Moreover, most travelers will journey by car this holiday, and while gasoline will cost almost a nickel a gallon more than last Thanksgiving, averaging $1.17 for self-service regular unleaded, the price of gas adjusted for inflation remains a travel bargain. And the two-thirds of travelers who will stay with family and friends presumably will save enough on hotel bills to help offset other expenses.
One such traveler is Rick Putro, 34, a Portland, Ore., hairdresser, who flew last night to a friend's house near Santa Fe, N.M., to enjoy what he described as "some fun, sun and snow." Four other friends were coming from Dallas, Los Angeles and San Louis Obispo, Calif.
Yet the change in traditional travel patterns is also spurred by the increasing attractiveness of shorter and more frequent getaways among families that have to juggle conflicting home and work schedules.
This is true for Clement G. Motten's family. A widower, he has two daughters in suburban Philadelphia, a daughter in Seattle and a son, daughter-in-law and two grandsons in Durham, N.C. All will gather today for a reunion in Williamsburg, Va., the restored colonial city that served as the British capital and the capital of Virginia.
"When the kids were growing up we used to go there once a year for a winter weekend," said Dr. Motten, a retired professor of history at Temple University and a resident of Haverford, Pa. Williamsburg not only remains steeped in history and tradition, but, Dr. Motten said, it was most convenient place to get together.
Kim Rawlings, 25, a paralegal in Houston, has things other than football on her mind once she arrives at her parents' home in Baton Rouge, La. -- things like eating a big dinner, watching a parade on television and doing lots of talking with her parents, maternal grandparents and two older brothers. "Most of the time my grandmother grills me on my personal life," she said. On this holiday, many hotels will be relatively empty, but Manhattan hotels expect to do well. "All 805 of our rooms are sold out and our four restaurants are already booked solid," said Tom Civitano, executive vice president of marketing at the Plaza hotel. The guest list, he said, is top-heavy with families.
The occupancy rate at Manhattan hotels has already risen to 74.8 percent through September, from 69.6 percent during the same period last year, according to Coopers & Lybrand, but many hoteliers expect a further increase because of the recent repeal of the 5 percent state tax on hotel rooms costing $100 or more.
Even visitors who do not check into Manhattan hotels were expected to swell city streets for Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and for visits to museums and shops.
Partly to offset the drop in their restaurant business, hotels from Niagara Falls, N.Y., to Newport Beach, Calif., were advertising Thanksgiving Day dinners and buffets. The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Phoenix has added a twist -- turkey dinners to go, aimed mainly at households with people who do not have time to cook for their Thanksgiving visitors.
One of the most unusual Thanksgiving treats was be offered yesterday at the 20-room Morenci Motel in the tiny mining town of Morenci, Ariz., which served a free turkey dinner that was offered to all elderly people in the area.
"We usually serve about 400 people from all over the area," said Jackie Lindhorst, the motel manager. For the motel and the community, she added, "It's one of the most special days of the year."

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Hint the U.S. Could Use Port Again

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Fearing China, Vietnam has begun to signal an interest in inviting American naval forces back to Cam Ranh Bay, the large port installation built by the United States during the Vietnam War.
The United States Navy seems interested in returning. Adm. Richard C. Macke, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, said on his recent trip to Vietnam that Washington and Hanoi could begin talking about military cooperation after settling their final differences over accounting for missing American servicemen from the Vietnam War. 
 On Cam Ranh Bay, he said, "I'm a naval officer and naval officers are always looking for good ports." He was responding to reporters' questions at a news conference in Hanoi on Oct. 26 after meeting with the Vietnamese Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet.
After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Hanoi made Cam Ranh Bay's deep-water harbor and port installation available to the Soviet Pacific Fleet, whose submarines and surface warships were regularly stationed there for more than a decade.
But China has expressed its opposition to a renewed American presence at the base.
"We are opposed to any foreign country establishing a military base or stationing troops on foreign soil," said Shen Guofang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
The United States has been without a major naval base in the region since 1992, when the Philippines decided not to renew the American lease on the base at Subic Bay. The importance of finding forward bases in the Pacific for American forces and their equipment was underscored in discussions last week between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Southeast Asian leaders.
Mr. Christopher tried to persuade Thailand to reconsider its opposition to accepting "equipment afloat ships" in its coastal waters as a means of positioning tanks, artillery and ammunition that could support an American military expedition to the region.
For Vietnam, which fears that China will one day use military power to enforce its claim over the entire South China Sea and its potentially rich oil reserves, the desirability of inviting American forces back into the disputed neighborhood is a form of insurance against what is seen as Chinese hegemonism.
At the time of Admiral Macke's visit to Hanoi, Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials expressed a keen interest in opening talks with the United States on an "access agreement" on Cam Ranh Bay.
In Beijing, Mr. Shen, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that China welcomed the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi, but he admonished the two former belligerents to focus on economic development and not military cooperation.
"We believe that all countries in Asia are committed to their own economic development and that all countries in this region will benefit from regional peace and prosperity," Mr. Shen said.
Some American diplomats in the region cautioned that the United States, which takes no position on the disputed islands and oil leases of the South China Sea, should try to avoid being pulled into a territorial dispute.
"Of course the Vietnamese would love to have us back in Cam Ranh Bay," one Western diplomat said, indicating that Washington would have to take care not to be manipulated by the parties in the dispute.
China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines all assert territorial claims to islands in the South China Sea.
But in 1992 China asserted sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea and its islands. It has twice clashed with Vietnamese naval forces, ejecting them from one set of islands in 1974 and from another set in 1988.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan have been the most aggressive in patrolling the area and in establishing a continuous presence on some of the larger islands.

HEADLINE: OPEC Move May Spur Sharp Rise in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Oil prices could rise by $2 to $3 a barrel within a year because of the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to freeze production at current levels while world consumption rises, industry analysts said yesterday.
The decision to hold the group's total production at 24.5 million barrels for another year was announced on Tuesday, at the conclusion of a meeting of OPEC's oil ministers on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. 
 "Taken all together, it seems to mean higher prices," said Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil.
Oil prices rose yesterday for the second day, with crude for January delivery gaining 33 cents a barrel, to $18.15, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Higher prices for oil and products like gasoline seem likely, the analysts said, because all the requisite trends are running in OPEC's favor.
World demand outside the former Soviet Union is expected to climb by 3 percent this year, a rise of 1.8 million barrels a day, to 63.3 million barrels of oil consumed daily.
Next year, the demand is projected to increase by another 1.6 million barrels, or 2.5 percent, unless the economies of some large countries like the United States experience sharp declines.
But some experts and analysts say prices will begin to rise significantly in the latter half of 1995.
If the United Nations lifts the embargo imposed on Iraqi oil exports because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the increased production could undercut the OPEC freeze. But some analysts said that scenario might not be realistic.
Mr. Tahmassebi said OPEC's strategy would be to have each member of the group cut back on production so the flow of new Iraqi oil could be absorbed and the overall production level maintained.
Analysts also doubted that Iraq could revive its production so fast.
"It will take years for them to get to three-million-barrels-a-day production," said John H. Lichtblau,chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a private consulting firm based in New York. In the early stages, he estimated, Iraq may be able to export only 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day.
"That's a level that would not be difficult to absorb," he added.
In general, OPEC hopes to tighten supplies as demand increases. In the past, that has forced consuming nations to find alternate sources of oil like those in the North Sea, an area that developed rapidly after the oil embargo in 1973.
Higher recovery rates from existing North Sea fields have led to more oil being produced than was anticipated. In the last two years, that helped hold down oil prices. The extra North Sea production is now expected to level off.
Analysts agreed that there were no other significant new sources that could disrupt OPEC's strategy.
Adam E. Sieminski, an oil analyst with NatWest Securities in Washington, said Russia was the only country outside OPEC with a big reserve production capacity.
But, he said, Russian oil exports have dropped to about 2.2 million barrels a day this year. That is down from the 3.5 million barrels a day that Russia used to sell abroad. Production has been disrupted by the turmoil in Russia's move toward a free-market economy.
But the poor maintenance of the Russian pipelines and terminals that are needed to ship oil overseas also makes it unlikely that Russia can increase its exports if the world price goes up.
At the same time, Mr. Sieminski said, Saudi Arabia, which has taken the lead in advocating OPEC's present course, will have to be careful not to let oil prices escalate too much, because they could disrupt the robust growth of some economies and ease demand.
"It's a delicate balance," he said.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
For Giuliani, a Checklist; For Pataki, Opportunities

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WHEN the big day finally comes next week, and the pending power of Albany finally meets the reigning regent of New York City, what will they say to each other? The imagination roars.
Maybe they will exchange home phone numbers so they can reach each other before 9 A.M. and after 5 P.M. Maybe they will thank each other: Governor-elect George E. Pataki could thank Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for boosting his chances, maybe even for electing him, by endorsing Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and campaigning upstate for him. And the Mayor could thank the Governor-elect for giving him even more acceptance with New York City Democrats than he already had. 
 But since such expressions of gratitude are not too likely at this ice-breaking session, it is more realistic to assume that the two men will discuss at least some substantive issues, the kind Mr. Giuliani said he considered when he endorsed Mr. Cuomo. New York City's problems are still there. Mr. Pataki has, as a peace offering, already agreed to veto two bills that Mr. Giuliani opposes -- one that would prevent the Mayor from using state school aid to help close his budget gap, the other that would increase public employee pensions.
WHAT else could be on the Mayor's wish list?
The budget: A fifth of the city budget comes from the state, not counting separate payments for Medicaid. Any reduction in state aid, or even a failure to keep pace with inflation, would hurt.
Education: Mayors have long argued that the city doesn't get its fair share of state money for education. With 37.4 percent of the state's students, it gets 34.5 percent of the state aid, because of opposition from the Republican-dominated State Senate, of which Mr. Pataki has been a member since 1992. Perhaps being Governor will change his perspective.
Two other huge costs are special education, with 139,500 students at an annual cost of more than $1.5 billion, and language education for 147,531 students with limited English proficiency, at a cost of $167 million. Any effort the Mayor and Governor made together to push the Board of Education to cut expenses and improve the programs would have to help.
The next Governor could also help the Mayor get more control over the Board of Education.
Mass transit: Will Mr. Pataki help the city avoid a fare increase and renovate its subway stations?
Medicaid: It is, after education, the second largest city expense -- $2.5 billion out of the $32 billion budget. That's why Mr. Giuliani wants a state takeover of Medicaid.
Mr. Pataki has said he would support a takeover only if the state can pay for it in Medicaid savings -- a highly unlikely prospect. The Governor could also try getting the Legislature to restrict Medicaid spending, like putting time limits on the very expensive personal care program for the elderly and disabled.
Pensions: A Pataki veto of the pension bill would help, but the new Governor could do more. The exorbitant pension system allows police officers and firefighters to qualify for generous, tax-free disability pensions if they say they injured themselves on the job, even if the injury was slight and they continued to work. The infamous "heart bill" is a controversial state law qualifying officers and firefighters with heart ailments for higher disability pensions on the presumption that the condition is work-related.
The watershed: If the state fails to protect land surrounding the upstate reservoirs from development, the city will have to build an expensive filtration plant. The plant might have to be built anyway, but it surely will if the reservoirs are despoiled. Mr. Pataki's ambiguity on this figured heavily in the Mayor's decision not to endorse him.
The homeless: The next Governor could lift a state rule requiring the city to house its homeless immediately. Because New York often fails to comply, a judge has cited the city for contempt.
Welfare: The Mayor might ask Mr. Pataki to pick up more of the city's Home Relief bill. Home Relief is a welfare program for adults without children that gets no Federal money; the state and local governments share the cost.
Secession: Mr. Pataki supports the secession of Mr. Giuliani's stronghold, Staten Island, from New York City. Perhaps the Mayor can get the Governor-elect to reverse himself.
Appointments: The Governor makes appointments to a number of boards and agencies that wield considerable influence over the city's finances. Mr. Giuliani might ask the Governor-elect to consider that when he names members of the Financial Control Board, the Urban Development Corporation, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other panels.
Relations with Congress: If they get along well enough, Mr. Pataki could volunteer to act as a liaison between Mr. Giuliani and the man in line to be the next chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
A Family Comes Back From a Slow Descent Into Poverty

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Twice a day she leaves the half-light of her apartment and gingerly circles the block, savoring the sharp air and grasping at normalcy after months of illness and loss.
Life as Mary Wolfe knew it ended last October, when the security-guard company she ran with her three sons failed for lack of business. As they searched fruitlessly for new jobs, hope turned to panic, and Mrs. Wolfe, 57, developed a heart condition. 
 By March, her family owed $12,000 in rent on its home in Bayside, Queens. Mrs. Wolfe had lost 40 pounds, and her fine dark hair was streaked with white. One morning she had a seizure, ending up in the emergency room. It was the first of five hospital visits.
"All of the sudden, everything was coming to a end," she said. "Some people see these problems coming for years, but they hit us out of the blue."
Too sick to fight her impending eviction, Mrs. Wolfe called the Community Service Society of New York. It won her a two-week extension in housing court, then helped her negotiate the welfare bureaucracy. With the extra time, Mrs. Wolfe and her sons found a small apartment near their old home. Her former landlord forgave most of her debt, and the Community Service Society paid the arrears on her phone and electricity bills.
In this city of extremes, Mrs. Wolfe is among thousands of poor and sick people who received help this year from the Community Service Society and six other charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The fund is to begin its 83d annual appeal on Sunday and, as in past years, thousands are expected to contribute. The Times pays for the overhead of the campaign, giving donations directly to the charities.
This year, as state and city budget cuts threaten social-service programs and the percentage of poor New Yorkers receiving public assistance is falling, charity officials say the need for private donations is urgent. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed budget cuts would phase out money for soup kitchens, cut 1,900 openings in day-care centers and reduce financing for substance-abuse programs, among other things.
"For the first time in our history, we will have to use private donations to supplement public funds," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of The Children's Aid Society, which receives Neediest Cases money. "Individual contributions will be crucial to keep our programs functioning."
New York City is finally recovering from a long recession, but the going has been painfully slow. Although jobs are gradually returning to the metropolitan region, many of them pay minimum wage, and increasing numbers of employed people have incomes below the poverty level. Most charities supported by Neediest Cases say donations have remained flat or decreased this year.
That points to another problem: many New Yorkers, charity officials say, are nonchalant about and even resentful of the ever-growing ranks of the poor.
"There's a lot of free-floating anger toward people who can't defend themselves," said Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another of the seven organizations helped by Neediest Cases. "More than ever before, we have made the poor into pariahs."
The Neediest Cases Fund dates to 1911. Even then, poverty in New York City was as obvious as homeless families huddled on the sidewalk, and as hidden as elderly couples who survived for months on soup and bread. In 1912, 117 contributors gave $3,630.88. Last year, nearly 13,500 people donated $4,590,568.69, the second-highest amount in the campaign's history.
The campaign will have to be at least as successful this year to keep pace with charities' growing needs, said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Foundation, which administers the fund.
"Field caseworkers trying to restore wasting lives, especially those of children, need our support more than ever," Mr. Gelb said. "Our goal is to make this a banner year so we can help fill the harsh void created by the cutbacks."
Neediest Cases money supports programs as various as day care for the elderly, job training for immigrants and pregnancy prevention. It has supplied shelter for victims of domestic violence and birthday parties for homeless children. And it has provided emergency money for people who, like Mrs. Wolfe, plummet unexpectedly into poverty.
Last week, Mrs. Wolfe sat in her sparsely furnished living room and wept as she recounted her recent good fortune. Her 27- and 24-year-old sons have found steady jobs, and her heart condition has improved thanks to medication and daily walks. When Mrs. Wolfe was hospitalized this summer, social workers at the Community Service Society offered emotional support and helped her apply for Medicaid and other benefits. When her 22-year-old son was injured in a car accident, the charity paid his portion of the rent for a month.
There are still obstacles to stability. Mrs. Wolfe's youngest son is still recovering from the accident, and the others work long hours to make the $1,100 monthly rent. Food stamps don't provide enough groceries, so the family often turns to a local church for necessities. And an ungentle reminder of bad luck -- instructions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- hangs on the refrigerator.
But hope has returned, and Mrs. Wolfe said she does not look back.
"They gave me my life back," she said, leaning over a vase of artificial flowers as if their smell had a sweetness only she could detect. "If you've got someone promising that you're going to get through, I tell you, it means a lot."

HEADLINE: Late Season's Greetings From PC Shopping Plans

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Everyone knows Santa can deliver his gifts in a twinkle, and overnight delivery services are only hours slower. The real bottleneck in the holiday shopping season is the time it takes to go shopping.
Two new companies are trying to solve the problem, turning to a combination of computer-based on-line information services and interactive CD-ROM disks that can store dozens of product catalogues. 
 If all goes as planned -- and the history of home shopping technology suggests that it will not -- shoppers may become cyber-Santas, soaring through virtual malls where the only creature stirring is the computer mouse. But most experts predict the new services' impact will not be felt until holiday season 1995, rather than this year.
There is little likelihood, of course, that CD-ROM and on-line service sales will do away with printed catalogues any time soon. The nation's 100 million households are pelted by an estimated 15 billion catalogues in the course of the year, according to Jupiter Communications Inc., a research firm in New York. Some companies send glossy catalogues as frequently as 13 times a year, while others send them only before the holidays.
Computer-based shopping systems are more efficient than home shopping by cable television or even by printed catalogues, advocates say, because consumers can search quickly for specific items of interest. One system even uses automated assistants to help select the perfect gift for a hard-to-buy-for relative, and even remind the shopper of birthdays and holidays ahead of time.
"People don't have enough time," said Thomas C. Burt, chief operating officer of 2Market, a computer-based shopping service announced this week by Apple Computer Inc., America Online Inc. and Medior Inc. "Convenience was the key word in the '80's, but we've got to go a step past convenience in the '90's."
The 2Market system stores more than two dozen product catalogues on a single CD-ROM disk, which can be viewed on a personal computer screen. The company has begun to send out 275,000 CD-ROM catalogues that are linked to America Online's information network. America Online currently has 1.2 million subscribers.
The system also provides a software helper that can recommend a list of gifts if the shopper provides criteria like a cost range for the gift, the age and sex of the recipient and the recipient's special interests.
Another new company, Contentware Inc. of New York, has persuaded J. C. Penney, Spiegel, Marshall Field and other retailers to place their catalogues on 400,000 CD-ROM disks and on the Internet's World Wide Web, as well.
"2Market and the others are basically coming to market too late," said Lisa Johnson, a research analyst with Link Resources Inc. of New York. "Christmas catalogues start arriving in August and these guys are coming after Thanksgiving." She did predict that interactive shopping's impact on gift sales will be felt next year.
Ms. Johnson noted that the promise of PC-based, push-button shopping has been touted for several years without noticeable results. But several developments could give the technology the legitimacy it now lacks, she and other analysts said:
*The installation of millions of multimedia computers with CD-ROM players in the home, expected to reach 15 million households in 1995.
*The rapid growth of consumer on-line information systems, which now have nearly six million subscribers in the United States, not counting the Internet.
*The entrance into the on-line information and Internet businesses of giants including Apple, AT&T, I.B.M., MCI Communications and Microsoft.
*The rising cost of producing and delivering billions of glossy paper catalogues to millions of households year-round.
*The emergence of more secure methods for transacting business over computer networks.
But if the technical framework is coming into place, the psychological and behavioral foundation of consumers may prove more intractable. Many consumers have balked at on-line shopping, in part because the mechanisms for ordering and paying for products are clumsy and insecure, even in the newest systems.
"People have varied needs when it comes to shopping," said Mr. Burt of 2Market. "Some are mission-oriented and practical, while others are browsers who love to shop. By using CD-ROM and on line, we can deliver advertising in ways that meet the needs of both those who love it and hate it."
Kathey Hale, senior analyst for Dataquest in San Jose, Calif., said the market research company recently convened a focus group of several dozen "big-income people with limited amounts of time" and discovered, to her surprise, that "their biggest hot button was being able to shop at home by themselves with their computer."
Yet because the 2Market and Contentware systems are making their debuts so late in the year, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on this year's holiday sales.
"But next Christmas should be very merry indeed for on-line providers if these early adopters are any indication," Ms. Hale said.
The Dataquest findings would seem to contradict a nationwide survey of 1,000 adults reported last month, in which computer-based shopping ranked last among 14 possible services when Americans were asked to rank their interest in interactive services. The ability to "shop for and buy goods and services you called up on the TV or computer screen" elicited a "very interested" response from just 6 percent of the people surveyed. Only 32 percent cited any interest at all.
The survey, sponsored by the newsletter Privacy & American Business and conducted by Louis Harris & Associates, found 64 percent of respondents had made a purchase from a catalogue or brochure sent to their home or office.
Companies like 2Market and Contentware, as well as some analysts, say the national survey was misleading because it asked people to comment on technologies many of them had never heard of. Surveys of people who already use computers at home reveal a marketer's dream, these parties said.
"The demographics of catalogue shoppers are higher than those who do home shopping by cable," said Gene DeRose, editor in chief of the New York-based newsletter Consumer Information Appliance. "Computer users tend to have higher education and income levels than the average consumer and are more prone to do this kind of shopping from home because it is more efficient, it saves time and in many cases gives greater value."
Given those factors, Mr. DeRose said: "We expect to see significant displacement directly from catalogue to CD-ROM. Cataloguers are definitely aware of this and are going with the flow."
While the initial round of CD-ROM disks will be distributed next week without charge, both 2Market and Contentware plan to release updated CD-ROM disks quarterly and to sell them to consumers for the cost of postage and handling, typically $5 a disk.
CD-ROM offers several advantages over the on-line services, including ease of use, high-resolution color images, stereo soundtracks and the ability to search quickly through large amounts of information. The on-line services offer the advantage of nearly instant updates, allowing sellers to offer sale prices and special promotions that are not possible on a CD-ROM disk updated quarterly.
Also, the global reach of the Internet allows shoppers to peruse the contents of stores in New Zealand as easily as they would stores in New York.
There is no standard currently for secure financial transactions over the Internet or on on-line services, although several shopping services have proprietary data-encryption methods to safeguard credit-card numbers and other sensitive information.
MCI reported Monday that it planned to offer Internet-based shopping services using what it said would be a secure data system, and Microsoft has indicated it, too, will use some form of data security on its forthcoming Microsoft Network.

HEADLINE: Lower Stocks Aren't a Worry for the Fed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The steep fall in stock prices this week is not expected to prompt any policy review at the Federal Reserve, where officials have been surprised at the stock market's resilience until now.
While the Fed did not set out last week to bring down the stock market when it raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, its officials have not worried about such a prospect. 
 Fed officials are aware that falling stock prices hurt consumer confidence and make people feel poorer. Both effects can help the central bank in its goal of preventing the economy from growing so fast that shortages of raw materials and skilled workers develop, feeding inflation.
"To the extent people have been buying cars and houses with gusto, this cools things off," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board.
Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said, "For many at the Fed, it's probably a not surprising byproduct of rising interest rates."
The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 4.4 percent in the last five days of trading while broader market indexes have dropped almost as much. Many market analysts have attributed the drop to a decision by money managers to shift assets from the stock market to the bond market. As the yields on bonds increase, 2 or 3 percent dividends on stocks become less attractive.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, warned in Senate testimony in May that stock and bond prices might have risen to unsustainably high levels by the beginning of this year because of the long drop in interest rates from 1989 through 1993.
"The resulting attractiveness of holding stocks and bonds was further enhanced by a nearly unbroken stream of capital gains as long-term rates fell, which imparted the false impression that not only were returns on long-term investments quite high, but consistently so," he said on May 27. "The recovery of the stock market after the October 1987 crash, along with the successful fending off of any significant adverse consequences from that event, may also have contributed to investor complacency."
The Fed did not change interest rates at the beginning of April, when long-term interest rates were soaring, stock and bond prices were tumbling and Wall Street traders were clamoring for another increase in short-term interest rates to reassure investors that the central bank would hold inflation under control.
"I don't think that we should be in the business of trying to, in effect, speculate ourselves on what long-term interest rates should be," Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor, said on April 4.
Mr. Greenspan waited until April 18, when financial markets had settled down, before raising rates by another quarter-percentage point.
Even if the Fed wanted to help the stock market, it might not be able to do so, said David C. Munro, an economist at High-Frequency Economics, a New York consulting company.
Further increases in short-term interest rates would worsen investor fears of a possible recession, while any reversal of last week's increase might so create an air of such uncertainty in policy that stocks and bonds might both fall, he said.
"It isn't obvious what if anything they could do that would be a help," Mr. Munro said.
Preston Martin, who was the Fed's vice chairman from 1982 to 1986, said the central bank would not worry about the stock market unless the recent downturn accelerated into a rout that threatened to disrupt the nation's financial system.
"I think they should be reasonably content, as long as you don't have 70 points, 90 points, 200 points, then 300 points," he said.
The Fed was sufficiently concerned about the possibility of market turmoil earlier this year that its first three rate increases, beginning on Feb. 4, were limited to a quarter of a percentage point each. "Many of us were concerned that a large immediate move in rates would create too high a dose of uncertainty, which could destabilize the financial system, indirectly affecting the real economy," Mr. Greenspan said on May 27.
The Fed stepped up its pace of raising interest rates with half-percentage-point increases on May 17 and Aug. 16. And on Nov. 15, it raised rates three-quarters of a point.
