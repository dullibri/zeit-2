HEADLINE: LTV Corp. Reports a Loss Of $46.3 Million for Quarter

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The LTV Corporation, the giant aerospace and steel company, reported a first-quarter loss of $46.3 million yesterday, citing depressed conditions in the steel industry. The company said the recession and lower demand from auto makers had contributed to the loss.
LTV, which is based in Dallas and has been in bankruptcy reorganization since 1986, also said it expected to file a preliminary reorganization plan with the Federal Bankruptcy Court by next Monday. The company said that although all creditors and equity groups had reviewed the plan, "further negotiations covering many key issues will be required." 
 In the quarter last year, the company earned $44.2 million, or 32 cents a share. Sales for the quarter were down, to $1.43 billion from $1.49 billion, the company said. The quarterly results include a $10 million charge against earnings to cover the costs of layoffs in the steel business.
 
Decline in Demand Cited
 "Demand for steel products declined across the board," said David H. Hoag, the company's president and chief executive. "LTV's quarterly results, and those for the steel industry in general, were negatively affected by weak consumer spending for automobiles and major appliances."
LTV said that even though the steel business posted a loss, its aerospace and military businesses had higher operating income -- $7.3 million, up from $1.9 million last year. Sales in these businesses rose to $550 million from $432 million, largely, the company said, because of sales on the B-2 bomber, the Army's tactical missile system and the Boeing Company's commercial aircraft programs.
LTV said its operating income in energy production rose slightly, to $1.8 million, from $1.7 million in the 1990 quarter.
 
Link to Auto Industry's Woes
 Analysts said that LTV's steel business was more vulnerable than its major competitors' to the woes of the automobile industry. They explained that nearly 50 percent of LTV's steel goes to autos, far more than at other steelmakers. LTV owns the nation's third-largest steel operations.
"Their steel results show that if you have all your eggs in one basket and the basket drops, you're in trouble," said John Jacobson, a steel analyst with AUS Group in Philadelphia.
The company's steel business had an operating loss of $48.8 million, compared with operating income of $41.1 million in the period last year. Steel sales dropped to $797 million, from $981 million last year.
During the first quarter, the company said, LTV's steel plants were operating at 74 percent of capacity, compared with 89 percent in the first quarter of last year.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, LTV's share price fell 25 cents, to $1.625.

HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's Cuts Rating of Issue For New York City

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
As New York City prepared to sell $1.2 billion in short-term notes to help pay its bills, Standard & Poor's, a major rating agency, yesterday downgraded the notes to its lowest investment grading -- and the lowest level of any municipal notes.
In downgrading the notes, the agency cited the complicated interplay between the city and state budgets as both Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Coumo struggle to cut spending in the face of a recession that has cut deeply into tax revenues. The city was forced to go back to sell more notes -- after selling $2.4 billion in notes earlier this year -- mainly because a budget impasse in Albany is delaying promised state aid. 
 The rating agency said the city, trying to close a $465 million gap in its current budget, had an "aggravated cash position" that would leave the city at risk if the state was unable to forward promised state aid before the end of the city's fiscal year on June 30.
Asked who was primarily responsible for the downgrading, Maury Cooper, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's, said, "It is a combination of both."
Mr. Dinkins pressed ahead yesterday with efforts to close a $3.6 billion gap in next year's budget, calling for a consolidation of a hodgepodge of six city economic development agencies as a way to cut both red tape for business and the cost of city government.
City officials, quick to blame the state for the downgrading, said they would go ahead with the competitive note sale today. After talking to the firms that underwrite the city's bonds, they were confident of at least getting enough bids to complete the sale.
Yesterday's decision lowered the rating on $1.3 billion in city revenue-anticipation notes issued previously and $1.2 billion in notes to be sold today by one notch, from SP-1, to SP-2, the lowest investment grade rating with "satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest." No municipal notes are now rated any lower, the agency said.
Moody's Investors Service, another major rating agency, was also due to issue a rating on the city's note sale yesterday morning, but postponed the release of its decision until today. The downgrading was issued late in the day and did not have an immediate effect on note yields yesterday.
City officials, including Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, when asked if they pressed the underwriters -- who have no direct connection with the note sale but are beholden to the city for a piece of its $4 billion a year in bond sales -- to bid, declined to comment.
 
'Costing Us Unnecessarily'
 "All of this shows the failure of the state to get its budget act together is costing New York City and costing us and costing us unnecessarily," Ms. Holtzman said. The Mayor's acting press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said, "S.& P. is expressing a concern, one that we share about the confusion and delay at the state level in adopting a budget that is timely."
While the sale will go forward, the city will pay a price in the form of higher interest rates when the bonds are sold. But since the notes are due to be paid off on June 28, 51 days after they are issued, the increased cost would be limited because of the short duration of the notes.
If city revenue anticipation notes, which were trading yesterday to yield investors about 6.70 percent, cost the city a half of a percentage point more, the city's cost would only go up about $800,000 this fiscal year, one city budget official said.
City tax anticipation notes, $1.1 billion of which were sold to be paid back with city property tax revenue, remain rated at SP-1+, the agency's highest rating -- since the city has already set aside all the taxes due the noteholders in a special account.
Moody's already rates city revenue notes at MIG-2, which is roughly comparable to Standard & Poor's SP-2, and has done so explicitly because of the fiscal problems of the state, whose notes are also rated MIG-2.
The Governor immediately sought to turn the city's downgrading to his advantage in continuing his pressure on the State Legislature for swift adoption of an executive budget. In a statement released soon after the downgrading, Dall W. Forsythe, the state budget director, said the city note sale "would not have been necessary if the Legislature had passed a budget on time."
"This is just one more regrettable example of the growing costs of budget delay," he said.
In Albany, the Governor and legislative leaders reported little progress on the state's budget, although Mr. Cuomo reported agreement on at least one item -- deferring the state income-tax cut scheduled for this year.
Yields on city notes climbed in the last few days as some large investors sold off notes. In the last 10 days or so, one bond trader said, city note yields rose from a low of about 4.3 percent to more than 6.70 percent, only about a percentage point of which could be attributed to overall market trends.
In the event the state budget delay continues into June, Standard & Poor's noted that the city would have to seek legislation in Albany enabling it to sell notes that extend into the next fiscal year. In previous years, the agency said, the city would have been able to come up with the cash to pay off the notes on its own.
 
Raising Level of Concern
 But one city budget official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Governor's jockeying in Albany might have itself contributed to the downgrading. The official said Mr. Cuomo had repeatedly and publicly warned that the state might worsen the city's problems by not adopting a state budget until the end of the city's fiscal year -- raising the level of concern among the rating agencies.
But the same official acknowledged that the failure of the Dinkins administration to put together a concrete plan to close the $465 million gap this year may also have contributed. The city provided the rating agencies with a list of options, without making final choices, that the city said could be used to close the gap.
The consolidation of the city's economic development agencies proposed by Mr. Dinkins would eliminate 70 of 510 economic development jobs and save the city $5 million a year.
Under the proposal, parts of which require approval by the City Council, six separate economic development, financing and support agencies and offices would be consolidated into two new agencies: a Department of Business Services, to deal with day-to-day concerns of businesses, and an Economic Development Corporation, which would foster creation and expansion of new businesses.
At least two city commissioners -- David A. Smith, the head of the Office of Business Development and Leressa A. Crockett, the head of the Office of Financial Services -- would lose their $100,000-a-year jobs under the reorganization. Both were offered other positions in the administration.
In another budget move, Mayor Dinkins has rejected the proposed closing of eight drop-in centers that offer hot meals, showers, counseling and medical checkups to more than 1,000 homeless men and women each day, administration officials said yesterday.
The program, costing $3.8 million a year in city funds and a matching amount in state dollars, may still be trimmed but will not be eliminated, the officials said.

HEADLINE: Albania Is Rife With Disease, Short on Essentials

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Albania is facing chronic health and medical deficiencies, including serious malnourishment and shortages of such hospital essentials as disposable syringes, members of a United States Government emergency relief team have concluded.
One member of the team, Dr. Richard Kunkel, director of emergency services at the Latrobe Area Hospital in Pennsylvania, said there were no documented cases of AIDS in Albania, but an outbreak was "just waiting to happen" because syringes and intravenous tubing were sterilized and reused. Contaminated syringes can transmit the AIDS virus. 
 The State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance sent the team to assess the needs of the 3.5 million people of Europe's poorest land.
Over the last several years, the country's Communist economy has deteriorated, its problems intensified by drought, political upheaval and, most recently, the flight of 80,000 Albanians to other countries.
Dr. Kunkel and another member of the team, Cynthia Vlasich of the American Red Cross, said Albanian hospitals must cope with aging medical equipment, some of which is in disrepair. Dr. Kunkel also noted shortages of medications.
Dr. Kunkel linked the syringe problem to the level of hepatitis-B in Albania, about 13,000 cases a year.
Ms. Vlasich said she visited a family of five living in a 10-by-10-foot hovel near the town of Berat whose principal meals consisted of spinach.
"There was no infant formula," she said. "Thirty percent of Albanian infants are hospitalized for malnourishment. One glaring lack is that there are no baby bottles." She said she learned that 70,000 Albanian infants are treated each year for malnourishment.
 After a few months of breastfeeding, most infants are fed a gruel consisting of milk, sugar, soya oil and grain, Ms. Vlasich said she was told. "They give it with teaspoons," she said. "Those are two needs I see right off the bat: prepared infant food and baby bottles."
Reports by Dr. Kunkel and Ms. Vlasich will be submitted to the State Department, the International Red Cross and Albanian-American organizations to help determine what assistance might be sent to Albania.
Asked how she rated Albania's needs compared with those of Kurdish refugees or famine victims in East Africa, Ms. Vlasich said: "Speaking personally, people who are dying every day obviously have a higher priority. The Albanian situation is not new, but there is a unique opportunity to step in and prevent worse developments."

HEADLINE: A Decade Into the AIDS Epidemic, The TV Networks Are Still Nervous

BYLINE: By STEPHEN FARBER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 29

 BODY:
 Julie Andrews, dressed in an elegant white blouse, black slacks and black beaded jacket, is the very image of a high-powered, immaculately tailored executive. Ann-Margret, in a platinum-blond bouffant wig, garish purple slacks and shawl, cuts a vividly contrasting figure. When these two polar opposites meet in a movie, there are sure to be fireworks. "We hate each other on sight," Miss Andrews said.
What brings these two women together is a new ABC TV movie, "Our Sons," scheduled to be shown on May 19. Miss Andrews plays Audrey Grant, a wealthy widow and business tycoon who thinks she has come to terms with the homosexuality of her son (Hugh Grant). When she learns that his companion (Zeljko Ivanek) is dying of AIDS, she tries to effect a reconciliation between the young man and his mother, Luanne Barnes (Ann-Margret), who has not spoken to him since she discovered he was gay. But Audrey's confrontation with this bigoted working-class woman forces her to confront some of her own unspoken prejudices about her son's homosexuality. 
 The disparity between the grim subject matter and the glossy soap opera-ish format illustrates the nervousness with which television approaches AIDS some 10 years into the epidemic. In 1985 television broke ground with the first movie about AIDS, "An Early Frost," which received critical acclaim and high ratings. Since then there have been a few other network TV movies about children and hemophiliacs with AIDS, and a few series like "L.A. Law" and "Midnight Caller" have touched on AIDS in isolated episodes. But "Our Sons" is the first network movie since "An Early Frost" to look squarely at AIDS in relation to gay men, who have been the main sufferers from the disease up until now.
The networks fear that any film about homosexuality will stir controversy. When an episode of the ABC series "Thirtysomething" showed two men in bed together, advertisers withdrew their sponsorship of the episode, which meant a considerable loss of revenue for the network. Allen Sabinson, the executive vice president in charge of motion pictures for television at ABC, concedes that he is nervous about potential advertising losses on "Our Sons" as well.
"Homosexuality is one of the biggest taboos on Madison Avenue," Mr. Sabinson said. "But my sales department has told me that if they have the film in plenty of time to show to advertisers, they can insure there will be no last-minute pullouts. And if some sponsors do back out, we will have the time to find others."
To defuse the controversy, all of the film makers downplay the AIDS plot line in talking about the movie. "AIDS is just the catalyst that brings these two women together," Ann-Margret said. "It's a story about what these women learn from each other, and it's ultimately about a mother's unconditional love for her children."
The executive producer, Robert Greenwald, said: "We don't want to hide the fact that the movie is about homosexuality or AIDS. But we don't want to put it into the ghetto of illness movies that have been done so often on television."
Mr. Sabinson said: "The primary thrust of the promotion will be the two actresses. We will play up the emotion of two mothers dealing with tragedy. We are not going to hit people over the head with the notion of AIDS and homosexuality. Yes, the media will focus on that in news stories. But most people get their information about television movies from our own on-air promos, and those will be much more directed at the emotional story of the two women."
 
A Story of Reconciliation
 Despite this subterfuge, Mr. Sabinson declares that his major motivation in developing "Our Sons" was to draw attention to the horror of the disease. "AIDS is a very big issue, especially in the big cities and especially in the entertainment business," he said. By dealing with the impact on the families, I think we have found a new way to deal with AIDS."
It was Mr. Greenwald, the producer of "The Burning Bed" and "Forgotten Prisoners: The Amnesty Files," who suggested this approach after seeing a television documentary called "Too Little, Too Late," which dealt with the families of people with AIDS. He hired William Hanley, who had written "Something About Amelia" and "The Kennedys of Massachusetts," to write the script. "The movie we presented to ABC was a story about reconciliation," Mr. Greenwald said. "Everyone has been estranged from someone close to them, so I hope a lot of people can relate to this who have never been touched by AIDS."
Mr. Hanley said: "When the producers first contacted me, I thought there must be 17 scripts on the subject of AIDS in development at the networks. Instead, I learned that nobody wants to touch it. There has been a very long silence since 'An Early Frost.' "
 
No 'Early Frost II'
 John Erman, the director of "Our Sons," also directed "An Early Frost," and he did not want to repeat what he had done in that film. "I got Bill Hanley to take out everything possible concerning the disease," Mr. Erman said. "We only shot three days in the hospital. I think people are sick of disease shows."
Mr. Erman reports that ABC's broadcast standards department was far more relaxed about the subject of homosexuality than NBC was when he directed "An Early Frost" six years ago. He recalls that in "An Early Frost" the grandmother of the main character was not allowed to comment that she liked her grandson's lover because that might be interpreted as an endorsement of homosexuality. "We didn't have those problems on this film," Mr. Erman said.
Mr. Sabinson suggests that one reason for ABC's acceptance of the story was that Ann-Margret's character is outspoken in her feelings against homosexuality. "So that provides balance and also makes for good drama," he said. "Also, we pick up the story when one man is already in the advanced stages of the disease. There are no intimate scenes between two men."
To Mr. Erman, the movie's chief value lies in exposing an undercurrent of homophobia in ostensibly enlightened people. "A lot of liberals think they accept homosexuality," he mused, "but when it really hits home, how do they feel?"
Yet he admits to feeling frustrated that television will tackle a story about AIDS and homosexuality only indirectly. "I wish television were taking bigger steps than it's taking," he said. "It's much safer to take the route of dealing with the two mothers. But I do think this script has a great deal of humanity. I hope that it encourages compassion."
Given the economic pressures on the networks, it is probably unrealistic to expect a more daring film than "Our Sons." "A movie focused on the gay community would be too narrowly focused," Mr. Sabinson said. "That is not the audience for network television. I think we would drive viewers away if we emphasized the two men. With Julie Andrews and Ann-Margret in the leads, we may have given the story broader appeal."

HEADLINE: Review/Television;
The Financial Burden of Old Age

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
For more and more people, the golden years do not glitter. They bring sickness, separation and, as tonight's somber edition of "Frontline" reports, impoverishment. "Who Pays for Mom and Dad?," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, brings out the emotional and economic pain of providing long-term care for old people.
The ordeal of many is seen through the experiences of a few families, like the Lombards of Massachusetts. Rose Lombard, who is 73 years old, has had Alzheimer's disease for about 6 years. Her husband, Dan, who is 80, has been trying to care for her on his own. But that has been getting harder, and when he breaks an arm, there seems to be no choice but a nursing home. "Into the warehouse," says their sorrowing son. 
 The cost in sorrow and guilt cannot be measured, but the cost in dollars is easily figured. The average charge of a nursing home in the Boston area is $40,000 a year. For a family like the Lombards, that means rapid exhaustion of savings -- the term is "spending down" -- until there is only $2,000 left, when Mrs. Lombard will qualify for Medicaid and the Government takes over.
The program probes on. With the help of lawyers specializing in "elder law," many families are taking advantage of loopholes, to keep at least some of their savings. "If you understand the system," says Harley Gordon, a Boston lawyer, "if you are willing to work at it, you can protect money. If not, you will lose your life savings."
It is easy to sympathize with middle-class people who have worked and paid their own way all their lives and want only to hold onto what they have managed to earn. But just as you are rooting for them, critics point out that when those who have money take advantage of a program created for those without, the bill goes to the taxpayer. Jane Bryant Quinn, a columnist on money matters, calls taking advantage of legal loopholes "immoral, outrageous and unprincipled."
The hour manages to be softhearted and hardheaded at the same time. Congress has done little except hold hearings into a problem that keeps getting worse. Almost half the residents of nursing homes are being paid for by Medicaid, and the nation's health costs keep soaring while nursing-home owners complain they are having trouble staying in the black.
Most documentaries on the subject make it easy for viewers, stirring indignation against unscrupulous nursing-home operators and compassion for helpless patients. "Who Pays for Mom and Dad?" raises much more difficult issues even as it touches some of the same feelings. Yes, the old deserve the best of care; no, families should not have to be reduced to poverty to obtain it. But what to do, especially when Federal and state governments are cutting back on everything else?
The program predicts that the number of people in need of nursing-home care will triple in the next 40 years. One proposal for addressing present needs would come to $32 billion a year. Where can Washington find the money?
To the credit of "Frontline," it does not pretend to have any answers. It leaves viewers with the aching questions and the bleak picture of Jack Pelfry, an Alzheimer's patient in a nursing home, cutting short a visit by his wife and daughter. "Goodbye," he says, into space. "Goodbye . . . goodbye . . . goodbye . . . goodbye . . ."

HEADLINE: A Big Step Toward Salvador Peace

 BODY:
Can a political settlement of El Salvador's endless civil war really be near? Hopes have been raised before, only to fall victim to new rebel offensives or death squad outrages. But the agreement on constitutional reform announced in Mexico City on Saturday could prove more durable.
Typically, cease-fires have been painstakingly arranged only to crumble amid haggling about the substance of institutional reform. This time, Government and rebel negotiators, aided by an adroit United Nations mediator, boldly tackled the institutional issues first. 
 They agreed to provisions establishing civilian control of the military, providing for independent oversight of elections, strengthening the judiciary and assuring systematic investigation and prosecution of human rights abuses. These must now be approved today by the outgoing legislature, and confirmed by its recently elected successor.
Agreement on cease-fire terms remains essential for an overall peace. That probably means sharp disputes about who actually controls what territory. But the prior agreement on constitutional reform gives both sides incentive to resolve such conflicts. Knowledgeable diplomats now talk of a cease-fire as soon as next month.
Why the breakthrough? Both sides seem at last to accept the impossibility of a purely military victory. The guerrillas understand that their original Castroite revolutionary model is now obsolete. And the Government knows that it can at best contain the guerrilla threat, but can never completely eliminate the rebels' military potential or their appeal to El Salvador's poorest people.
This new realism led to the U.N.-sponsored talks, strongly backed by the U.S. and Mexico, two regional powers that have not always seen eye to eye about El Salvador. But President Salinas of Mexico has taken a more constructive approach to Central American conflicts than his predecessors, while the Bush Administration has had little taste for Congressional aid battles poisoned by the atrocities of the Salvadoran military right.
A right-wing Salvadoran Government and hardened guerrilla commanders agreed to Saturday's pact. Their extremist credentials may have made compromise easier than it would have been for centrists. Yet there remains a danger that hard-line followers of Roberto D'Aubuisson, linked by Washington to death squads, could yet try to sabotage the emerging peace.
President Cristiani, through economic reforms and political skill, has emerged from the shadow of Mr. D'Aubuisson, his onetime sponsor. But he will need Washington's strong and visible support as he proceeds down the peacemaking path. That's a U.S. policy even critics of past arms aid to El Salvador can gladly support.

HEADLINE: Freeing Kuwait Didn't Justify Destroying Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
During President Bush's war against Saddam Hussein, he stated many a time that the conflict was not with the people of Iraq, but only with Saddam Hussein.
After 42 days, the war was over with a great United States victory. But the balance sheet is puzzling. The people of Iraq, against whom Mr. Bush had no hostile intentions, have paid a high price of some 200,000 civilians and military dead and maimed. There are three million to four million Kurdish, Shiite and Sunnite Iraqi refugees within Iraq and in Turkey and Iran. Iraq and its people have been reduced to a preindustrial age by American bombing. The Persian Gulf has been polluted, and some 600 oil wells in Kuwait are burning at the cost of $100 million a day. 
 Yet Saddam Hussein is in power!
Americans also paid a high price, including some 350 killed and about $1 billion a day spent to destroy and kill the Iraqi people. The social and economic problems in the United States are the same as before.
Kuwait has been liberated. But this was everyone's goal, including Arab and Muslim peoples and governments. The world community had an opportunity to experiment with a new device, economic sanctions, to stop aggression and get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. George Bush sabotaged it by insisting on the traditional means of force. Was that wise, and was the high price worth it?
The balance sheet is puzzling on another level, too. The great victory seems to be based on big lies. One of the big lies circulated by the Pentagon, and parroted by the submissive news media, was the assertion that the Iraqi paper tiger was the fourth largest army in the world.
Iraq cannot produce even a simple screw without first importing the raw materials. It is evident that as a third world country it might have had the largest army on paper, but not in the field. By contrast, the United States produces tanks, airplanes, bombs, missiles, rockets, A-bombs. Probably the United States and its allies were 1,000 times stronger than Iraq on paper and in the field. The war was not so much a military achievement as the victory of the big lies.
Saddam Hussein is a thug, and his repression of the people of Iraq, war against Iran and invasion of Kuwait have been denounced by Iraqi Sunnites, Shiites, Kurds and other minorities. By jumping the gun, George Bush wrecked the possible success of the economic sanctions and created for the people of Iraq, not for Saddam Hussein, near apocalyptic conditions.
May Allah forgive George Bush!

I.B.M. Forecast

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 29

 BODY:
Business prospects for the International Business Machines Corporation will remain weak for the remainder of the year, the computer maker's chairman told shareholders at the company's annual meeting today. "While we'd like to believe economic recovery is just around the corner, we'll have to wait and see," John F. Akers said. "We have seen no evidence yet to indicate any improvement in the near term, and consequently the year remains uncertain."
The company had reported a first-quarter loss of $1.73 billion, largely because of an accounting change. Wall Street reacted negatively to Mr. Akers's comments. I.B.M.'s stock fell $2.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $104.875.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 2, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a brief report on the Company News page of Business Day on Tuesday referred incorrectly to the outlook for the International Business Machines Corporation. The company's chairman, John F. Akers, said at the shareholders meeting that prospects for the rest of the year were uncertain; he did not say "weak."
