HEADLINE: Greenspan's Remarks Send Stocks Higher

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Despite a report that the nation's confidence in the economy had fallen this month, stock and bond traders had their ears cocked for only one man's opinion yesterday, and Alan Greenspan did not disappoint.
When Mr. Greenspan told Congress he saw an economy with inflation at 3 percent or less, low long-term interest rates, as well as steady expansion, all the leading stock markets and the bond market rallied. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.20 points yesterday, to 3,911.66, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 3.77 points, to 471.46. The smaller-stock Nasdaq composite index rose 2.30 points, to 791.15.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index rose 1.61 points, to 261.48, on volume of 270.9 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,139 to 1,003. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.43 points, to 472.38.
 
Economically Sensitive Stocks
 The rally benefited economically sensitive stocks like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and Caterpillar; interest-sensitive stocks like Pacific Gas and Electric and the Texas Utilities Company, as well as high-technology stocks like Intel and Apple Computer.
The price of gold, a familiar inflation indicator, declined and the dollar, a more recent inflation gauge, fell, too. Currency traders slowed their buying of dollars when Mr. Greenspan seemed to indicate that he planned no immediate increases in interest rates, diminishing the dollar's appeal.
Yet traders ignored the flip side of Mr. Greenspan's remarks: short-term rates are more likely to rise than fall. And the Fed will not announce its next move, as it did when it increased short-term rates on Feb. 4, rattling the bond and stock markets.
Traders also ignored an indicator that is designed to speak for millions more people than Mr. Greenspan. The Conference Board, a private business-research group, said yesterday that consumer confidence in the economy in February had fallen for the first time in three months, based on a survey of 5,000 households.
But traders apparently heard what they wanted to hear in Mr. Greenspan's testimony, analysts said. "The markets are in a spook mode," said Michael G. McGlone, a bond options trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "He didn't say anything new, so he didn't spook the markets."
Alfred E. Goldman, director of stock market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said, "What Greenspan said was very good for interest-sensitive stocks, the best of all possible worlds, in fact." "If the market had plunged further," he said, referring to the 96-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Feb. 4, "then the rally would have been even stronger."
The Dow industrials, the most scrutinized stock indicator, is still nearly 67 points below its peak of 3,978.36, reached on Jan. 31, and 56 points below 3,967.66, its Feb. 3 peak just before the Fed's quarter-point increase in short-term rates.
 
Dow Industrial Issues
 Seventeen of the 30 component stocks of the Dow industrials rose in price, with three stocks contributing as much as 15 points to the rise. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 2 3/4, to 107 3/4. Caterpillar rose 2 1/2, to 110 5/8, and Procter & Gamble rose 1 1/2, to 58 7/8.
The most actively traded stock yesterday was the American depository receipts of British Petroleum, which rose 3/4, to 64. 5/8. A British Petroleum A.D.R. equals 12 ordinary B.P. shares. Chevron, the operator of a project of which British Petroleum is a major partner, said yesterday that a Papua New Guinea, site showed signs of oil and gas. Some 18.8 million A.D.R.'s of British Petroleum were traded yesterday.
The second-most-active stock, at 7.5 million shares, was Novell, a computer-networking company. It rose 5/8, to 24 1/2, in part because of an inexpensive $300 computer networking kit that might expand Novell's market.

HEADLINE: Fund for Neediest Lags; Forgotten by Delayers?

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund enters its last week, dozens of readers have suddenly begun to heed the gnomic six-word warning, "To delay may mean to forget," that has served as the fund's unofficial motto for decades.
The maxim is usually included in small lettering at the end of articles about contributors to the fund or about the assistance the fund gives to hundreds of thousands of indigent New Yorkers every year. 
 While it may seem inconspicuous, it has registered in the minds of many contributors, who quote it in their letters as if it were an 11th commandment, against procrastination.
" 'To delay may mean to forget,' and I nearly did," wrote Janet L. Schultz, who was raised in Los Angeles but spent seven years in New York City as a graduate student at Columbia University.
Ms. Schultz, now a post-graduate fellow in genetics at the University of Oregon in Eugene, sent $50 to do her part. "I get such hope for humanity reading the articles about how people are helped by this fund," she wrote.
She added yesterday that she has contributed for several years but forgot to give last year in what she called "a classic case of procrastination."
"I had a baby in October, and the time got away from me," she said. "But this year, I told myself that I wouldn't let it get by."
Some late givers have gotten an early start learning about timeliness: "I'm Alessandro Presti, I'm 8 years old and I live in Brooklyn," wrote one recent contributor. "I'm sorry I'm sending this 50 dollars late, but I haven't forgotten. For Christmas my grandmother sent me 100 dollars, and I would like to share it with a person who needs it."
 
The Times Pays Expenses
 As in the past, The Times is paying the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven social-service agencies. The money finances many forms of relief, including food for the hungry and shelter for the homeless. The charities also use the money to provide medical care to poor children, pregnancy-prevention workshops for teen-agers and home helpers that enable the disabled and elderly to remain in their homes.
Already during this campaign, three men who were unemployed for several months found jobs shortly after their stories were included in The Times.
But the fund, now in its 82d year, remains about $90,000 behind where it was last year at this time, endangering its ability to help the charities to maintain even their current services. With the continued generosity of donors from around the country, the gap can still be bridged before the campaign ends on Sunday.
It will, however, take realizations like the one that occurred to Matthew H. Klein of Monmouth Beach, N.J., early this month when he sent $25 to the fund and wrote: "You're right. I've put it off too long."
Or the one that occurred to Anne Jackson, the actress, when she read a story about a contributor who, to spur giving, quoted Samuel Johnson: "Let him that desires to see others happy make haste to give while his gift can be enjoyed, and remember that every moment of delay takes away something from the value of his benefaction."
In appreciation, Ms. Jackson matched the contributor's gift of $75.

HEADLINE: Albert T. Sommers, 74, Analyst Of Shifts in American Economy

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Albert T. Sommers, an analyst of national economic trends, died on Sunday in Boca Raton, Fla., where he was vacationing. He was 74 and lived in Manhasset, L.I.
He suffered a heart attack on a tennis court on Feb. 7, his family said. 
 Mr. Sommers strove to explain the mysteries of business cycles, statistics and the volatile changes at work in vital economic forces. He took a historical perspective, set the American economy into a worldwide context and explored the the social, political and ethical pressures that influence -- and inhibit -- economic performance.
Since 1950 he was associated with the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization supported mostly by American corporations and trade associations. He started as a senior economist, was director of economic research from 1961 until 1972, and was senior vice president and chief economist from then until 1985. Since then he was senior fellow and economic counselor to the Board.
 
Published The Sommers Letter
 One of Mr. Sommers's principal vehicles was The Sommers Letter, which he started in 1981 to present the outlook on financial, industrial and policy matters.
Mr. Sommers wrote many books and articles published by the Conference Board and elsewhere. His book "The U.S. Economy Demystified," written with Lucie R. Blau, was issued by Macmillan in 1992 and went into a third updated edition last year.
Albert Trumbull Sommers was born in Milford, Conn., graduated from Columbia University and served with the United States Army in World War II. He earned a master's degree at New York University in 1949.
In his years with the Conference Board, he advised hundreds of companies on economic conditions and what was ahead for them and the United States economy. Along the way he won top professional honors in his field.
He served on numerous panels and advisory boards and as an economic adviser to the Ford Foundation, the American Express Company and Bankers Trust Company, among others. In 1979 and 1980 he was chairman of the price advisory committee to the Carter Administration's Council on Wage and Price Stability. At the time of his death he was the president of Albert T. Sommers & Company, a business consulting firm he founded in 1980.
He was a director of several industrial and financial institutions and of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a fellow of the National Association of Business Economists and a former member of the Columbia University economics faculty.
Among the publications he wrote or edited were: "Reconstructing the Federal Budget: A Trillion-Dollar Quandary" (1984), "Understanding the GNP: Keeping Track of the U.S. Economy" (1983), "U.S. Economic Policy Issues in the 1980's" (1981), "A Collision of Ethics and Economics" (1978) and "The Balanced Federal Budget: An Orthodoxy in Trouble" (1978).
Mr. Sommers is survived by his wife of 47 years, Jean Marvin Sommers; a daughter, Elizabeth Sommers Strevey of Pelham Manor, N.Y., and a son, John, of Oakland, Calif.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher In Carry-Over From Holiday

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most foreign currencies, but the gains in the United States reflected those made overseas on Monday, when the New York financial markets were closed in observance of Washington's Birthday.
Moreover, the American currency failed to gain any additional strength from yesterday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. 
 Mr. Greenspan said real short-term interest rates were more likely to rise than to fall in the period ahead. He also said evidence was mounting that the economic recovery was well entrenched.
 In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan gave no hint of when another interest rate increase was coming. The dollar rose three weeks ago when the Fed nudged up rates. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive relative to other currencies.
 "The dollar picked up overnight, but we've been slowly selling off ever since," said Bruce English, head of institutional sales at ABN-AMRO.
 The report of a drop in the consumer confidence index, to 80.8 in February from 82.6 in January, also put a lid on dollar buying yesterday.
 The dollar posted strong gains against the German mark and the Japanese yen overnight and in early United States trading amid reports that the Bank of Japan bought dollars overseas. The dollar retreated, however, on sales by Japanese exporters.
 Dealers also cited talk that European central banks were selling the dollar at about 1.7300 marks in afternoon trading in the United States.
 In late New York trading, the dollar was at 106.65 yen, up from 104.61 on Friday. It rose to 1.7255 marks, from 1.7133 marks Friday.
 Gold prices slipped from Friday's levels. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $2.40, to $379.20 an ounce.
Also in New York, the British pound was quoted at $1.4785, down from $1.4825 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4495 Swiss francs, up from 1.4425; 5.8625 French francs, up from 5.8238; 1.3383 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3427, and 1,677 Italian lire, up from 1,666.

HEADLINE: In Hell's Kitchen, Savory Temptations

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
The temperature is rising in Hell's Kitchen. After nearly a decade, its main thoroughfare, the stretch of Ninth Avenue between 35th and 55th Streets, is emerging from the gray chrysalis of economic woe to beckon diners and shoppers back to its crumbling sidewalks, its venerable groceries and a new generation of restaurants.
Former hardware stores have been reincarnated as fancy bakeries, former smoke shops have become Afghan and Caribbean restaurants, and mom-and-pop cafes have been reborn as -- is it possible? -- trendy restaurants. 
 In the last two years, nearly 30 restaurants have opened in the area. The catalysts for the changes are low rents, easy access to Broadway and Off Broadway theaters and a flood of new businesses like film editing studios, publishing and advertising concerns and architectural, design and photography studios. In addition, blocks of brownstones have been gentrified and acres of former garment factories have been converted to residential lofts. In a decade, four high-rises have been built in the area as housing for some 20,000 well-educated professionals.
"There's a lot of energy, and you can feel a change," said Joan McNaughton, who has lived in the neighborhood for three years and is one of the four partners who opened the restaurant Revolution in November. "We chose the name because it's a borderline neighborhood, with a past, and there is a definite circular motion: it's revolving back to being vital and lively."
Sidewalk traffic is heavier, restaurants are more crowded and in early evening brings delivery bicycle gridlock. Relative newcomers fear the kind of nonstop chic that conquered Columbus Avenue. But longtime residents are unfazed. Hell's Kitchen is eternal, they say.
"Call it Clinton, the Lower West Side, Ninth Avenue, Paddy's Market," said Lili Fable, whose husband's family has owned the Poseidon Bakery on Ninth Avenue for 50 years, referring to the names of different parts of the area from 34th to 57th Streets, between Ninth and 12th Avenues. "It's all Hell's Kitchen. Like I told the guy who tried to open the pornography shop next door to the bakery, 'We serve food, not filth, in Hell's Kitchen.' "
By any name, Ninth Avenue has been to New York what Les Halles was to Paris: a breadbasket, an international bazaar and a seedy stretch. The neighborhood still has a lot of traffic, which means a lot of potential customers, as well as a large and mostly unskilled immigrant population eager to work, said Sal Dell'Orto, whose father opened Manganaro Groceria, an Italian grocery and restaurant on Ninth Avenue, almost a century ago.
And Hell's Kitchen is still an intimate neighborhood. "If I need to borrow a bottle of this or that, I run across the street," said Richard Gusoff, who opened Pietrasanta six years ago and Rachel's, a French bistro, last fall. "If the guys at the Japanese restaurant need a couple extra chairs, they run down and borrow them from me. There's more camaraderie than competition."
Recently opened food stores -- including African Imports, which sells books, crafts and specialty food products, and the Halal Meat Market, with meat that satisfies Islamic dietary law in the cases up front and prayer rooms in back -- reflect an eternal fact of Ninth Avenue: it is a major thoroughfare, running through a United Nations of a neighborhood.
Other new groceries and specialty stores suggest that the hardscrabble neighborhood is becoming better-heeled. Natura, a grocery that opened two years ago, has a cheese section to rival that of Fairway Market on the Upper West Side. Two recently opened bakeries, St. Famous and Amy's, turn out the crusty rolls and seeded buns, breadsticks and focaccia that nouveaux epicureans crave.
The Hell's Kitchen restaurant boom also reflects the old and the new. In lower Hell's Kitchen, Philippine Fast Food serves hefty portions of kare-kare, a meat and vegetable stew with peanut sauce and thick rice soup as solid and old-fashioned as the Italian food across the avenue at Supreme Macaroni. Around the corner on 39th, Rinconcito Mexicano, a cafeteria, serves authentic Mexican peasant food to crowds of Mexicans who do piecework in the garment district.
Up the avenue, Marta Lemos, a Brazilian cook with an Italian flair, has set up shop under an awning that reads "Rice and Beans Restaurant." At lunch, her black bean soup, beef stew and country chicken lure cabdrivers, neighbors and a "nanny brigade" pushing strollers.
In addition to the authentic flavors and humble prices, the restaurants have an intriguing only-in-New York clientele. The casts and crews from nearby theaters and local residents (some retired, some very young) turn the better dining rooms into a demographer's dream. "Where else in New York are you going to get Chita Rivera at one table, MacNeil of 'MacNeil/Lehrer' at another, and the solid middle-class people who live here at another?" asked Antonios Manatakis, who opened Uncle Nick's, a Greek restaurant, four months ago on 51st Street near Ninth Avenue.
A similar crowd packs the Afghan restaurants that have sprouted along the avenue. Of them, the oldest, Afghan Kebab House, which opened four years ago, continues to turn out the most succulent chicken and lamb kebabs. But a newcomer, Ariana Afghan Kebab, is vying for best Afghan in Hell's Kitchen with delicious appetizers like leeks and lamb, mashed potato and pumpkin turnovers with yogurt sauce and spicy dumplings with yogurt and lamb sauce.
Appetizers are the mainstay of a spate of Middle Eastern restaurants that have claimed former shoe repair, smoke and news shops. Of these, the Lemon Tree Cafe is one of the best, with toothsome falafel and good hummus and baba gannouj, stuffed grape leaves, kibbe and tabbouleh. Turkish Cuisine is sensational, offering sweet, crisp fried calamari, tender potato croquettes and wonderful zucchini and parsley cakes. The grilled chopped lamb patties and lamb simmered with fresh cheese are as sprightly as the belly dancer who performs on weekend nights.
A handful of storefronts have begun sounding the curry bugle. The two best are Bengal Express Indian Restaurant, whose curries and tandoori dishes are fine and inexpensive, and Banjara, a larger, fancier restaurant that makes wonderful vegetable and keema samosa and rich soups.
The Asian restaurants are probably the most certain harbinger of things to come: they are a far cry from tiny holes in the wall with Cantonese cliches. For instance, Mee Noodle Shop, with big bowls of Suzhou-style soups, is modern and airy and designed for a clientele as occupied with dietary concerns as it is smitten with Asian flavors. The neighborhood also supports the Little Saigon Cafe, which serves wonderful Vietnamese specialties at its four tables. Bali Burma, a fanciful storefront, serves the sweet and sometimes peppery dishes of Myanmar; the coconut milk and chicken soup with noodles, thousand-layer bread with potatoes and red-curry fried rice are the stars of the show.
Many restaurants are emblems of a changing population. "The people who move here now come because they want to, not because they have to," said Mrs. Fable, noting that well-educated, relatively affluent people with expensive tastes are as much a part of Hell's Kitchen as first generation immigrants once were.
Mangia e Bevi, a warm and campy reincarnation of Little Italy with unobjectionable, old-fashioned Italian food, has become an everyday restaurant for new Hell's Kitchenites. The tidy storefront known as 44 Southwest has done the same; it features decent versions of food from the southwests of Italy, France and America.
"There are actually two Hell's Kitchens now," said Mr. Gusoff of Pietrasanta and Rachel's, who has worked in restaurants in the area for more than a decade. "There's the solid, workaday, family-oriented Hell's Kitchen and the sort of hip, younger, artistic Hell's Kitchen."
His restaurants serve both. The crowd at Pietrasanta, his Italian trattoria with big plates of garlicky pastas, thick-crusted pizzas and huge salads, looks like Rotary Club meets SoHo. A similarly bifurcated crowd has found common ground at Rachel's, Mr. Gusoff's snug bistro, with unremarkable, although entirely acceptable French food.
Revolution, with its disco music and softly psychedelic murals, is bidding to become the P. J. Clarke's of Hell's Kitchen, an end-of-the-day watering hole. But the food is better than in most saloons, with meaty crab cakes, a tasting of pan-Asian egg rolls and a small menu of carefully prepared pastas, chicken and fish.
"We just wanted to open a bar for all the artists and theater people," Ms. McNaughton said. "But along with people like Petula Clark and the cast from 'Tommy' who stopped in for drinks, we got just as many locals who wanted dinner, too."
But while some restaurants spring from the fertile ethnic mix of Hell's Kitchen, and some reach beyond it with trendy menus and affect, three newcomers strain the traditional blue-collar image of the neighborhood with bids to become "destination" restaurants, like the better pretheater places along Restaurant Row on West 46th Street.
Uncle Nick's is an irrepressible Greek taverna with big cases of fresh fish in the front and a cubbyhole of a back room with red walls and rickety tables and delicious food: spinach pie, moussaka, pastichio, taramosalata and tiny meatballs. The fish is so fresh and carefully grilled that, especially at the price -- about $20 for a three-course meal with wine -- it is worth traveling for.
Upscale vegetarians have traveled to Zen Palate, a food shop and dining room with artful vegetarian cooking. The restaurant uses soy products to confect faux meats. More interesting are the stuffed eggplant, mushroom caps smothered with garlic and delectable Vietnamese-style spring rolls.
In keeping with the Italian roots of Hell's Kitchen, Avanti is turning out stylish, contemporary renditions of traditional Italian food from four different regions. The focaccia is rich with olive oil, the shrimp has a heady blast of fresh rosemary and the homemade mozzarella is some of the best, even in a neighborhood long known for its fresh cheeses. The pastas -- tender gnocchi with fresh tomato sauce; linguine blackened with squid ink and tossed with garlic and clams; spinach parpardelle with smoked tomatoes and porcini mushrooms -- are delectable. Already, the restaurant is pulling in pretheater crowds and local residents.
Even with artful, forward-looking menus and an increasingly cosmopolitan clientele, despite more and more business meals and the pretheater crowd, there is something enduring and very intimate about Hell's Kitchen restaurants. Mr. Manatakis of Uncle Nick's said the feel of the dining rooms mirrors the neighborhood.
"It's a real neighborhood," he said. "By that I mean your people have good hearts and high hopes. They don't spend a lot of money; they spend time with each other. It's not a normal New York."

HEADLINE: In America;
Counting the Jobless

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The Government has changed the way it determines the national unemployment rate, which has resulted in a number that is marginally higher. But the new and supposedly improved methodology does not provide anything close to an accurate picture of a devastating jobs crisis that is becoming ever more entrenched.
Legions of Americans who once felt secure in the workplace are now stunned to find themselves caught in the hideous undertow of long-term unemployment. You don't hear much from them after that. The jobless tend to go quietly. One day they're at their work station, the next day they're not. When enough time passes, they're no longer even counted as unemployed. 
 If you take this group, which increasingly includes middle-class and middle-aged men and women, and link it up with the people who have been forced into part-time or temporary work, and with people who are calling themselves self-employed but who are really making little or no money, and with the underclass of inner-city Americans who have long been among the permanently unemployed, you have a problem with frightening implications.
You cannot deal effectively with public safety, health care reform and welfare reform without engaging the employment crisis.
In November 1991, when President Bush signed a bill extending jobless benefits, there were 1.3 million Americans officially designated as long-term unemployed, meaning they had been out of work for six months or longer. Those benefits have been cut back, but last month the number of long-term unemployed was 1.7 million.
Inevitably the official rates of unemployment are much lower than the true rates. The Government is not concealing the real numbers. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does a remarkable job of documenting those who are working and those who are not. But the raw numbers get whittled down by the complex procedures and definitions used to arrive at the official statistics.
For example, discouraged workers -- people who have given up looking for a job -- are not counted as unemployed. The bureau will readily tell you how many people fall into the discouraged category, but that number will not be factored into the official unemployment rate.
And even the discouraged category is being shrunk by the bureaucracy. Under the bureau's new rules, a discouraged worker who has not looked for a job for a year is no longer considered discouraged. That worker falls off the statistical charts. Actually, there were a lot of them. Before the change, the bureau counted 1.1 million discouraged workers. After the change, 600,000.
There are endless examples of people who are out of work but not counted as unemployed. Laid-off workers have traditionally been considered unemployed, even though there was a time when they could reasonably expect their jobs to return. Now laid off pretty much means fired. But during the survey that is used to determine the unemployment rate, laid-off workers are asked how active they have been in looking for a new job. If the answer is that they have simply been checking the want ads, they are not counted as unemployed. They sure are out of work, but officially they're not unemployed.
The jobs crisis is not limited to the unemployed. Recent statistics show that college-educated men in their 40's and 50's -- ordinarily considered an elite group at the peak of their earning powers -- are experiencing a sharp decline in wages.
Katherine Newman, a social anthropologist at Columbia University, was quoted in The New York Times as saying: "This was the first generation to be widely educated in college. They followed the recommended path, but their education has failed to insulate them."
The official unemployment rate for January was 6.7 percent. The more we focus on it, the less we understand the extent of the problem. A better indicator of prevailing conditions would be a statistic that showed the number of people who wanted a job but could not find one. That number would be astonishingly high.
Keith Brooks, director of the New York Unemployed Committee, made the essential point: "Does our Government recognize the depth of the jobs crisis in this country? I think not."

Flatiron Italian
Mark Strausman, the chef at Coco Pazzo on the Upper East Side until last spring, has signed a lease for his own restaurant, Campagna, at 24 East 21st Street. The space formerly housed the restaurant Luxe. Since leaving Coco Pazzo, Mr. Strausman has been doing consulting work and most recently has been cooking at Tavola, at 1481 York Avenue (78th Street).
With his new venture, he will be adding his brand of lusty, Italian peasant cooking to the Flatiron district, where a number of young chefs have recently opened their own places. Mr. Strausman, backed by a group of silent partners, said he plans only slight changes in the decor of the 130-seat dining room. 
 Reflecting an increasing trend among chefs, he said he plans to do as much of his own smoking, pickling, brining and curing of ingredients as possible. He also plans to start an off-premises catering company.
 
New but Familiar Faces
 When La Colombe d'Or opened on East 26th Street in 1976, it was a pioneer among French bistros. Now, after nearly two decades of dining-room and kitchen watch, Helen and George Studley, the owners, are beginning to let go. They have arranged for the management to be assumed by Wayne Nish and Joseph Scalice, the owners of March on East 58th Street.
"We want to be less tied down to the restaurant," Mrs. Studley said. "And if this works out it may lead to an eventual sale of the restaurant."
Mr. Nish is no stranger to La Colombe d'Or. During his tenure as chef there from 1988 to 1990, it was awarded three stars by Bryan Miller of The New York Times. Mr. Nish left the restaurant with Mr. Scalice, who was the manager, to open March. Naj Zougari, the chef of La Colombe d'Or, is staying on.
 
Importing the Stars
 To celebrate its 40th anniversary tomorrow, Relais et Chateaux, an association of luxury hotels and restaurants, is importing chefs from France to cook at its American properties.
In France, it hasn't been easy to sell expensive dinners in the countryside on weekday evenings, even with Michelin-starred chefs at the stove. Many are not sold out. In the current economy, some French chefs aren't even able to fill their own restaurants night after night.
At the Old Drovers Inn, in Dover Plains, N.Y., Robert Lalleman from the one-star Auberge de Noves in Provence will cook a five-course meal for $125 tomorrow through Monday; wines will be from Chateau Cordeillan-Bages near Bordeaux. For reservations, call (914) 832-9311. At the Inn at Sawmill Farm, in West Dover, Vt., Andre Daguin, from the two-star Hotel de France in Auch, will prepare a six-course dinner tomorrow night for $135; (802) 464-8131.
At The Point in Upper Saranac Lake, N.Y., the star will be Michel Lorain, a three-star chef from La Cote St.-Jacques in Joigny.Only a couple of places remain for tomorrow night's dinner. No wonder. Half the rooms at the inn were taken by invited press; (800) 255-3530.
 
A Training Program

Last Thursday, Ellyn Rosenthal, the executive director of the Food and Hunger Hot Line, a nonprofit organization that provides meals for homeless people, signed a lease for the space previously occupied by Fourteen and, before that, Quatorze, at 240 West 14th Street. By the fall, she said, the organization hopes to open One City Cafe, a restaurant with a training program for homeless people who live in shelters.
One City Cafe will be open to the public, serving what Ms. Rosenthal calls "cross-cultural comfort food," like meatloaf and mashed potatoes and rice and beans, at low prices.
The training program will accept 24 people a year and will be conducted by the hotel management school of New York University. The group is now seeking corporate sponsors to subsidize the students, to the tune of $15,000 a year.
 
A Taste of Piedmont
 Two visitors from Italy, Tonino and Claudia Verro, the owner and chef of La Contea in Neive, one of the best restaurants in Piedmont, will be preparing a five-course dinner Sunday at 6 P.M. at Tommaso's Restaurant, 1464 86th Street, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. The food will be paired with the wines of Bruno Giacosa, a premier wine producer of that region, which is in northwest Italy.
The cost of dinner, including wines, is $55. Reservations can be made by calling (718) 236-9883.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 25, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Off the Menu column in The Living Section on Wednesday included an erroneous description of the status of the restaurant La Colombe d'Or, provided by an owner, Helen Studley. The restaurant is to be sold on Monday to the owners of March, Wayne Nish and Joseph Scalice, not merely to be managed by them.

HEADLINE: Big Board and Amex Uncovered Short Sales Rise

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Short-selling activity, usually done as a bet that stock prices will fall, rose significantly earlier this month, evidently as a result of the sharp fall in stock prices that followed the Federal Reserve's move to raise the Federal funds rate on Feb. 4.
The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the total short position in its stocks -- the number of shares borrowed and sold short, but not yet covered by repurchasing the shares -- rose 3.7 percent in the month that ended Feb. 8, to a record 1.32 billion shares. That was the largest increase in five months, perhaps reflecting renewed confidence among bears. At the American Stock Exchange, the short interest position rose 3.5 percent, to a record 104.9 million shares. It was the largest rise in three months on that exchange. 
 The three largest short positions -- in RJR Nabisco, the Walt Disney Company and the Chrysler Corporation -- all rose as shorts increased their bets. Of the three, only Chrysler has moved significantly since Feb. 8, falling more than $4 a share.
During the month the shorts cut back on bets against United States Surgical, with the number of shares shorted falling by 1.7 million, to 12.4 million. That may have been prompted by the stock's rising amid talk by analysts and company officials that it was likely to benefit when a jury issued a verdict in a patent-infringement case against Johnson & Johnson. Instead, the jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson and the shares have plunged. They closed yesterday at $18.25, down $9.625 since Feb. 8.
Not all rises in short positions are related to negative opinions. For example, the short position in Stone Container leaped 4.1 million shares, to 9.4 million. In part, that may have been related to the company's sale of 16.5 million shares, at $15.25, on Feb. 3. To the extent the shorting was a forecast of lower prices, it has not worked out. The price has climbed back to $16.50 a share.
The sharp reduction in the short position in Columbia Health Care, to 17.7 million shares, a drop of 4.6 million, was related to the fact that its big merger with HCA was about to close. Traders betting on the deal going through had bought HCA and shorted Columbia. The profit from closing out that position became attractive as regulatory hurdles were cleared.

Companies
Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications called off their merger. A decline in the value of Bell Atlantic's stock and the potential impact of cable television rate cuts on Tele-Communications apparently led to the decision to end the $33 billion deal. [Page A1.] Raymond W. Smith and John C. Malone once seemed to be the shapers of a new information age. Today, they are two tired executives who could not meet their own deadlines for completing the deal.[D6.] The collapse of the merger was not a complete surprise to analysts who had wondered how the conflicting styles and goals of the two companies could be resolved. [D6.]
Microsoft was ordered to pay $120 million in damages to Stac Electronics Inc. The judgment came in the first patent infringement suit against Microsoft ever to reach a trial. [D1.] 
 The Winter Olympics telecasts have been a hit for CBS, producing the highest-rated week in its history. The network's success has also been a boon to advertisers. [D1.]
Kiwi, a fledgling Newark-based airline, is a prime example of how employee-ownership can break down the us-versus-them mentality of labor-management relations. Many corporations are now trying to copy the success of Kiwi and other employee-owned companies in creating an entrepreneurial culture. [D1.]
Documents detailing how B.C.C.I. diverted billions of dollars from the ruling family of Abu Dhabi were made public. [D2.]
Federal prosecutors are preparing to charge more than a dozen current and former American Honda executives with accepting bribes from dealers in exchange for franchises or cars. [D4.]
Macy's creditors were examining where they stood after Cyrus R. Vance was appointed mediator in the bankruptcy. [D4.]
Spectrum Information Technologies posted a loss of $12.1 million for the third quarter. The loss included a $4.7 million charge to cover an expected settlement of a shareholder suit. [D4.]
Chrysler will sell a large portion of its Acustar parts-making subsidiary to Yazaki of Japan, a maker of wiring systems. [D4.]
McDonald's banned smoking in all of its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants. And a trade group representing McDonald's and other chains backed a law to end smoking in all restaurants. [A16.]

International
U.S. trade policy with Japan was sharply criticized by Senator Bill Bradley. He accused the President of putting the United States' long-term interests at risk for the sake of "Japan-bashing." [D1.]
The Japanese Government partly retracted statements suggesting it would abandon its high-definition television system after the nation's big electronics companies protested. [D1.]
Markets Blue-chips stocks retreated after short-term interest rates rose sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.98 points. [D8.]
Treasury prices declined after short-term rates jumped. The yield on the long bond rose to a seven-month high. [D16.]

HEADLINE: South Korean Expects Atomic Backdown by North

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 23

 BODY:
In South Korea's most optimistic assessment yet of the tense standoff on the Korean Peninsula, President Kim Young Sam said today that he had become "very sure that in the end North Korea will accept the nuclear inspections" that the United States and its allies have demanded for more than a year.
That upbeat view, expressed by Mr. Kim in an interview at the presidential mansion in Seoul, was a sharp turnaround from his tone just eight months ago. At that time he warned the United States against being "led on" by North Korea and suggested that "time is running out" because North Korea would be able to produce plutonium by early 1994 in large enough quantities to make nuclear weapons. 
 But over the last few weeks, he said, after "receiving a lot of information about the nuclear issue," he has concluded that there is "no clear evidence of North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons yet."
This time the 66-year old former dissident politician, who took office a year ago this week as South Korea's first civilian President in more than three decades, talked only of the carrots he was prepared to offer his Communist rivals in the north. He declined to mention any sticks, for fear of angering the North Korean Government "at a sensitive time."
 
Keeping Up the Pressure
 President Kim's comments, and those of several of his aides in recent weeks, make clear that South Korea is far less worried about what kind of nuclear weapons North Korea may already have than it is about keeping up the pressure to bring its development program to a slow halt.
A week ago, after bitterly resisting renewed inspections, the North said it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct limited inspections -- not including two suspected nuclear waste dumps. Mr. Kim seems to be betting that his best strategy is to reward the North for the first glimmerings of flexibility rather than immediately press for better access.
Today, for example, Mr. Kim said that it would be "a wise opinion" for the United States to delay the deployment of Patriot missiles to defend the 35,000 American troops here. He was speaking of testimony in Congress on Tuesday by Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the deployment was likely to be held up because "we do not want to give some excuse to the North Koreans to derail a process."
South Korean officials concede that they have often switched from sounding hawkish to sounding dovish about the North, usually to provide a counterweight to the prevailing mood in Washington. It is a shift that has often frustrated the Clinton Administration, which South Korea has variously accused of being manipulated by the North or of jeopardizing the talks by taking a hard line.
"I think it is not accurate to describe it as inconsistency," Mr. Kim said. He called it "tactical flexibility," saying that the basic strategy being pursued by Washington and Seoul -- to convince the North that there are economic and political advantages to abandoning the nuclear weapons effort -- "is proving quite effective."
 
A Cautionary Word
 "This is only the beginning of the solution of the problem," he said, cautioning that talks between the two Koreas and additional inspections would be necessary before aid and investment in the North began.
North Korea has demanded that, before it allows the nuclear agency to begin its inspection, the United States give it a written commitment making explicit a long-understood deal: Once inspections begin, Washington will announce the cancellation of the the annnual "Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea and set a date for high-level talks with Washington. Meanwhile, the North will appoint envoys to restart talks with South Korea.
At the next stage of talks, probably next month, there will be discussion of a new deal. That would trade far more intrusive inspections, something the North still says it will never allow, for political and economic benefits.
Mr. Kim talked expansively about the reforms his Government has initiated to cure what he called "Korean disease," the corruption and loss of direction that afflicted his country's economy in the late 1980's and early 1990's. His most striking action was a purge of more than a third of the top military leadership, which he said had become a "hotbed of corruption."
"The presidents who came to power through coups," he said, talking of most of his predecessors, "were worried that the same could happen to them. So their only solution was to give the military great power."
Now, he said, using the legitimacy gained with 42 percent of the vote in a three-way election, he has returned the military to its defense mission and removed it from politics. "Morale in the military is high now," he added.
The bureaucracy has also been through a shake-up, with more than 200 senior officials forced out of their posts because of what the Government calls "financial irregularities." Mr. Kim's critics, and there are not many, say that his biggest failing is that his reform effort has yet to trickle through most layers of Korean society.
"It is too much to think you can change the habits of a society in just one year," he said.

North Korea Resists Pressure
 VIENNA, Feb. 23 (Reuters) -- North Korea refused to bow to mounting international pressure today for rapid inspection of its suspect nuclear sites, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, meeting in Vienna, could only appeal again to Pyongyang to open its sites to examination without further delay, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Wants More Spending Control

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Hoping to wield greater control over New York City's finances, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would seek new powers to oversee budgets of independent authorities or agencies receiving money from the city, including the Health and Hospitals Corporation, Board of Education and Transit Authority.
Neither the Mayor nor his senior aides gave details of how they hoped to do so, but changes in the structure or fiscal management of such agencies would require approval of the Legislature and the Governor. 
And that remains far from certain. For example, Assemblyman Albert Vann, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, said yesterday that he would not support turning over fiscal control of the Transit Authority to the Mayor. "I don't think it would make any sense," he said.
Still, Mr. Giuliani's remarks reflected a desire, expressed by mayors in the past, to have more say over the spending of agencies that get money from the city but whose budgets are adopted by boards with a degree of independence. His comments could also serve as a reminder that the Mayor himself now has little control over what those agencies spend.
He argued that while those agencies were created to run independently, they lacked "political accountability" and had grown fatter and more wasteful than agencies directly controlled by the Mayor's office.
"Some of it has to do with the fact that although originally envisioned and put together for very good purposes, being independent, they are now politically unaccountable," Mr. Giuliani said. "I'm accountable. If I don't reduce the expenses of the city, then three and a half years from now, people can throw me out of office."
In his State of the City Address earlier this month, Mr. Giuliani proposed the creation of an independent fiscal monitor to oversee spending at the Board of Education. The proposal followed several days of public clashes with the Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, over how best to cut the board's budget, with the Mayor demanding cuts of 2,500 administrators at the central headquarters.
Yesterday Mr. Giuliani said such a monitor would be one approach to gaining greater control over the budgets of the independent agencies.
 
A Different Approach
 Another approach, according to Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, would be to give the Mayor's four appointees on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority control over the city's contribution to the Transit Authority, which operates the city's subways and buses. In 1993 the city contributed $634 million of the authority's $3.6 billion operating budget, as well as $105 million of its capital budget.
Mr. Powers said the administration would focus initially on wresting more control over the spending at the authority, the Board of Education and the Health and Hospitals Corporation because they are the largest, accounting for about $4.5 billion of the city's $31.2 billion budget.
In the future, he added, the Mayor would also consider greater oversight of the smaller agencies -- from the Economic Development Corporation to the Water Board.
"We have to be able to approve how the money is spent," said Mr. Powers, who first disclosed the policy when he appeared yesterday at a breakfast forum sponsored by the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Crain's New York Business. "If we can't get the ability to monitor it, then we're just writing checks, without accountability."
In recent years, the city has taken some steps to put the "off budget" agencies under greater mayoral control. Two years ago, for example, Mayor David N. Dinkins created a task force to monitor the Board of Education's budget. He also sought unsuccessfully to expand the board from 7, to 11 members, with 6 appointed by the Mayor.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, expressed tentative support for such approaches.
"Most of these agencies were moved off budget so mayors would not have to make decisions," he said. The new Mayor's desire "really shows a change in time."
 
Depth of Opposition
 An indication of the depth of opposition such proposals are certain to encounter came from Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council. While expressing support for fiscal oversight, he said he did not believe the oversight should rest solely in the hands of the Mayor. He called for passage of legislation now before the State Senate and the Assembly that would force the agencies to submit their budgets to the City Council for review.
Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization, said the real value of considering such an idea, even if never enacted, would be the message. "To the extent the Mayor pushes an idea like this," he said, "maybe the heads of those quasi-independent agencies will cut him some slack."

HEADLINE: Tight Logging Limit Set in Northwest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 23

 BODY:
In what is likely to be the final blueprint for managing 24 million acres of public forests in the Pacific Northwest, the Clinton Administration today announced a plan to protect a host of endangered species by significantly reducing logging from the high levels of the 1980's.
The new policy, which came in one of the most extensive environmental impact statements ever done by the Government, is largely similar to a draft that President Clinton presented last summer. The final plan further reduces logging and nearly doubles estimates of the number of jobs that will be lost, to 9,500 from 5,500 in the draft. 
 Under the Clinton plan, which was put together after the President held a conference last spring among the warring factions in one of the nation's major environmental disputes, logging would be reduced to levels that are 20 percent of those in the peak years of the mid-1980's.
About 5 billion board feet of timber used to be cut every year in national forests in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. Now, the plan calls for cutting slightly more than 1 billion board feet a year. It takes about 10,000 board feet to build the average house.
 
Criticism on Both Sides
 While the plan drew harsh and immediate criticism from both sides in the debate, it is a major reversal of policy from the last three decades. In large part, the report shows scientific acceptance of years of criticism from environmentalists. They have long said excessive logging in national forests was a violation of environmental law and could not be sustained without wreaking havoc.
With this plan, which is intended to protect endangered species like spotted owls, more than 1,000 plant and animal species that depend on old growth forests will also be helped. The Clinton Administration hopes the policy will help it avoid future legal disputes over species like salmon, which are now in decline.
"This is an attempt to get ahead of the endangered-species-of-the-month club," said Tom Tuchmann, director of the Federal Office of Forestry and Economic Development, one of more than a half-dozen agencies that put together the new policy.
Logging would be permitted on about 4 million acres, most of it in areas that are sliced up by roads or were first cut long ago and now have new growth.
The Government estimates that there are 5.3 million acres of old growth forest left in the Northwest, with about 1.5 million of that protected in national parks or wilderness areas. The Administration would allow logging on 693,000 acres but keep most of the remaining old-growth forests off limits.
 
Report Goes to Judge
 The remaining old growth areas would not be given formal wilderness protection, a designation that usually requires an act of Congress.
The report, which could be altered in the next 30 days, will be submitted to Judge William L. Dwyer of Federal District Court in Seattle. Judge Dwyer issued an injunction halting logging in Federal forests here three years ago, saying it violated the law.
If Judge Dwyer accepts the plan and lifts his injunction on logging, a much smaller timber-sale program could resume in national forests in the region.
But some environmental groups are already raising objections to the plan, saying it still leaves some species in jeopardy. And the timber industry has filed a lawsuit charging that open meeting laws were violated in developing the plan.
Among the major changes in this plan from the earlier draft were these:
*Estimates of job losses increased, with up to about 9,500 expected with this plan, leaving about 115,000 timber workers in the Northwest. The higher estimate came because of a change in the model that was used to predict economic consequences.
*No-logging zones around streams increased. The old plan required a 50-foot strip of trees to be left standing on either side of some streams, but the new plan doubles that to 100 feet.
*Slightly more logging would be allowed in Northern California than earlier estimated.
Timber industry officials say President Clinton broke his promise to present a plan that would balance the need for jobs with conservation concerns. Last July, when the President first announced the forestry plan, Administration officials said they hoped to speed up logging on about 1 billion board feet of timber not covered by court orders.
But last year, less than a third of the promised amount was cut, leaving some timber mills short of logs.
"They have been making promises since last year, and they have broken every one of them," said Chris West, a vice president of the Northwest Forestry Association, an industry group based in Portland, Ore.
In the meantime, large private timber holders, who are not affected by these environmental restrictions, have reported record earnings, and continue to send logs overseas in a booming export market.
"We don't need to liquidate the public's last remaining ancient forest treasures in order to provide enough wood for our domestic mills," said Jim Pissot, an official with the Audubon Society.
The timber industry leaders have said they hope that Congress will override the Clinton Administration and propose higher logging levels, even if they violate environmental laws. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a strong ally of the timber industry, had called the earlier Clinton plan unacceptable. But he is not likely to support overturning the new policy, said Jeff Biggs, a spokesman for Mr. Foley.

HEADLINE: Republicans Say Congress Could Balk on Bosnia Force

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
As the United States begins pressing the Bosnian Government to make peace, key Republican Senators questioned today whether Congress would approve the Administration's plan to send American troops there if a settlement is reached.
At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned that Bosnia's Muslim-led Government would not sign a peace treaty without an American pledge to send troops to take part in peacekeeping in Bosnia. 
 Mr. Christopher also confirmed that the United States had decided against imposing tighter sanctions on Haiti, at least for the moment, and announced that he would make his first trip to China as Secretary of State early next month and demand that Beijing improve its human rights record.
But much of the hearing today centered on developments in Bosnia, where a NATO threat of air strikes this week obtained a partial withdrawal of Serbian guns around Sarajevo.
 
A New Urgency to Issue
 Until two weeks ago, the Administration's pledge to send American troops to enforce a durable settlement in Bosnia seemed largely theoretical. Now that the United States has abandoned its hands-off policy toward the Bosnian talks, and the Americans, the Russians, and the Western Europeans are all actively pressing for a settlement, the question of how to enforce any accord has taken on new urgency.
Mr. Christopher emphasized that Congress would be fully consulted and its approval sought before United States forces were sent into Bosnia.
But in a reflection of the anxiety in Congress over American involvement, Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican, asked how Mr. Christopher could be involved in negotiating a peace that would require American troops "without your being able to give that assurance" in advance.
And Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, warned that the Administration was putting itself into "sort of a Catch-22" situation by making promises that it might not be able to keep and urged Mr. Christopher to consider consultations with the Congress even before Bosnia's warring Muslims, Serbs and Croats negotiated in earnest.
 
U.S. Force 'Fundamental'
 Mr. Christopher said that the Administration did not know how many troops would be necessary to enforce a settlement, but that they would not constitute more than half of a special peacekeeping force. But he emphasized that American participation would be "a fundamental building block" in enforcing peace.
Other American officials have said recently that the United States would support deployment of about one-third of an anticipated force of 50,000 soldiers, not one-half, as the United States initially suggested.
"Talk to the leaders of Bosnia," Mr. Christopher told the committee. "The only way they would enter into a settlement is if the United States is involved in the implementation."
Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, made a similar point after meeting with members of Congress today. "Bosnia could not be solved without American engagement," he said. "You have to have force to make peace."
 
Advantages of Reconciliation
 The stalled peace negotiations among the Serbs, Muslims and Croats have centered in recent months on a proposal to divide Bosnia into three ethnically based provinces. In recent days diplomats have focused on improving the relations between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims in the hope they will form a political alliance.
Mr. Christopher did not refer directly to the cease-fire agreement signed today by Bosnia's Muslim Government and the Bosnian Croats, but he said a rapprochement between the two factions, which were allies early in the war, would have "many, many advantages."
"If they could get together, it would make for a more viable state," Mr. Christopher said. Such a rapprochement would not only make an accord easier to enforce, he said, but "solve a number of problems" like guaranteeing the Muslims "access to the sea."
After Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the Administration would have to prove it had an exit strategy before deploying troops, President Clinton laid down a list of conditions last September for doing so.
He said the United States would commit troops only if a NATO commander was in charge of the operation, if there was a clear timetable for withdrawing the force, if the financial burden on the United States was acceptable and there was clear support from the Congress.
Since then, there has been a growing sense within the Administration and among the allies that the United States will have to send troops if a fragile peace is to take hold in Bosnia.
Senior State Department officials told the French, British and German Governments two weeks ago that the United States was prepared to send one-third of the troops that might be needed to enforce a peace accord. And in a meeting on Monday at the State Department with Mr. Silajdzic, Mr. Christopher pledged American troops as a condition of peace, Mr. Silajdzic said in an interview afterward.
Mr. Christopher's testimony today contrasted sharply with his remarks before the same committee in November, when he dismissed the crises in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti as "difficult situations" that had not gone exactly as the United States had planned.
Today he said that the United States had important strategic, political and humanitarian interests in bringing peace to Bosnia. His speech reflects the shift in public statements by the Administration on Bosnia as it begins to prepare the public for the deployment of American troops there.
Today Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, proposed a one-day summit meeting with four Western powers to end the war in Bosnia. But the Clinton Administration reacted coolly to the idea, saying that such a meeting "would require a lot of preparation" and that it was devoting its efforts to more basic "groundwork" on a negotiated settlement.
 On the issue of Haiti, Mr. Christopher said that the United States had decided not to press for further economic sanctions to step up pressure on Haiti's military because "there is no plan that we can be promoting effectively with the sanctions."
Mr. Christopher did not directly criticize Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, for resisting an American-backed plan that would restore democracy and return him to power at an unspecified date.
But he said the Administration was urging Father Aristide to appoint a new Prime Minister and to meet with a "centrist" group in Haiti, something that he has so far refused to do.

HEADLINE: Rise in Interest Rates Sends Stocks Lower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stock prices slumped yesterday after short-term interest rates rose sharply.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.98 points, to 3,891.68. Telephone, household product, electric utility, chemical and drug stocks were among the session's biggest decliners. 
 The market slid after a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, said yesterday that the Fed would raise rates again if either inflation or expectations of inflation picked up. On Tuesday, the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that short-term rates were more likely to rise than fall.
"The signal from the Fed is that short rates are going up, and bonds are going down in price," Michael Metz, the chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said.
As long-term interest rates move to 7 percent, "that's not a real negative for the economy, but it could cause a cessation of funds into mutual funds," prompting a 15 to 20 percent decline in stocks, Mr. Metz said.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.77 point, to 470.69. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.04 points, to 789.11, hurt by weak technology stocks including Novell, Oracle Systems, Intel and Cisco Systems.
Declining stocks led advancers, 1,177 to 948, on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume advanced to 309.9 million shares, from 270.9 million Tuesday.
Investors "realize the Fed is still in a tightening mode, and for right now, it's probably putting a lid on the market," David Butler, head of equity trading at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said. "I think you're looking at higher rates."
 
Retailers See Gains
 Retailers were among the best-performing stocks yesterday. Home Depot Inc., which yesterday reported a 16 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, climbed 2 1/4, to 42 3/8; Lowe's Companies gained 1 1/8, to 62 3/8,and Wal-Mart Stores added 3/4, to 29.
Nordstrom Inc. rose 2 7/8, to 39 3/4. The Seattle-based retailer said fourth-quarter earnings rose to 74 cents a share from 61 cents in the prior year. The results exceeded analyst expectations of 69 cents.
Novell fell 7/8, to 23 5/8. After the market closed, the maker of computer networking software said net income in the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31 was unchanged at 23 cents a share, a penny ahead of forecasts.
Deere & Company rose 1 1/2, to 84. An analyst at S. G. Warburg raised his rating on the company because of better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.

HEADLINE: Goals for Recycling May Change

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
A day after New York State's highest court ordered New York City to comply with its own 1989 recycling law, a senior official in the Giuliani administration said the Mayor might seek to renegotiate the law's timetables with the City Council because of the costs of complying with the statute.
Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers suggested that the recycling goals set forth in the law were no longer affordable given the fact that the law was passed "when the finances of the city were nicer." 
 He said the administration wanted to talk to Council leaders to see if it were possible to change the law, which originally called for the city to be collecting 4,250 tons of recyclable material a day by this April, or about 25 percent of the city's total waste. The city currently is collecting about 15 percent, said Sanitation Commissioner Emily Lloyd.
 
'Got to Get Realistic'
 "We've got to get realistic about things," Mr. Powers said at a breakfast forum with business executives. "We set goals with certain economics in mind. We no longer have those economics. So we've got to revisit those goals. The Mayor's in favor of recycling. He wants to achieve it. He wants to achieve it as fast as we can. But he also has to put a lot of services out there for the people of the city with not enough money to do it."
But City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone yesterday hailed the ruling by the State Court of Appeals and said the money could be found for recycling. "The job of the executive branch now is to comply with the recycling law," he said. "If it can't comply with the law, it has to come back and tell us why."
The 1989 law, signed by Mayor Edward I. Koch, requires the city gradually to increase the amount of residential garbage that is recycled. But as the recession took hold, Mayor David N. Dinkins imposed budget cuts that delayed the expansion of the recycling program.
The Court of Appeals found in a ruling on Tuesday that the recycling measures in the law are mandatory and not goals that could be delayed by fiscal constraints as the Dinkins administration had argued. The ruling sent the Giuliani administration and the plainfiffs -- the Natural Resources Defense Council and two City Council members -- back to court to draw up a new schedule for meeting the recycling requirements.

Short- and Medium-Term Rates Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Short- and intermediate-term interest rates rose sharply yesterday, one day after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, tried to reassure bond traders and investors not to be concerned about inflation in the near term.
Traders said there were two reasons for the jump in short-term rates, which took the yield on the three-year note to 5 percent, its highest level since January 1993, when it was 5.08 percent. 
 One reason was that Mr. Greenspan made it clear Tuesday, when he testified before a House Banking subcommittee, that the central bank would have to raise short-term interests in the near future. The only uncertainity is the timing. The Fed raised its target for short-term interest a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25 percent, Feb. 4. It was the first increase in five years.
Traders said concern over the impending rate rise seemed to dampen investor demand at yesterday's auction of two-year notes. The yield at auction was 4.66 percent, up from 4.11 percent in January and the highest since December 1992, when the yield was 4.71 percent.
 
A Big Leap in Yields
 It appeared that this leap in yields also weighed on the market. By late in trading in the when-issued market, the yield on the new two-year note had inched up to 4.67 percent, as the price slipped.
In addition, the poor results in the $17 billion auction of two-year notesraised concern among dealers and traders that today's sale of five-year Treasury notes could also do poorly.
And even though long-term interest rates did not jump as much as short-term rates yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond by late in the day was 6.64 percent, the highest in seven months. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 19 32 .
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, added his voice yesterday to the chorus of officials warning of higher short-term interest rates. He said that the central bank would raise short rates again if the rate of inflation picked up. Mr. Greenspan said Tuesday that real short-term rates, which are adjusted for inflation, were more likely to rise than fall.
Talk among traders ahead of the two-year auction indicated that they did not expect great demand. One trader said, "This is not the issue you want to buy if short-term interest rates are going up."
Analysts at MMS International said rumors and speculation about the Fed tightening kept short maturities under selling pressure for the whole session.
The analysts said there was some talk about a Fed increase coming sooner if today's durable orders report for January was strong. But the analysts doubted the Fed was ready to pull the trigger this soon, speculating that it more than likely would come late March.
Alan Kral, a portfolio manager for Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., an investment management firm, said: "Most everyone expects rates will increase. If short-term interest rates are not increased, there is the risk that inflation expectations, and possibly inflation itself, would rise."
Among the new municipal issues priced yesterday was a $125 million revenue bond sale by the Ohio Turnpike Commission through an underwriting group led by Paine Webber Inc., which was initially priced to yield a maximum 5.65 percent for a bond due in 2024. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 3.10 percent for an issue due in 1995 to 4.50 percent in 2000, 5.05 percent in 2005, 5.45 percent in 2010, and 5.55 percent in 2014
Underwriters said the deal was rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's.
Following are the results of the auction of two-year Treasury notes yesterday:

High Yield . . . 4.66%

HEADLINE: B.C.C.I. Details Misuse Of Arab Ruler's Funds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In 32 pages of handwritten and typed notes, Swaleh Naqvi, chief executive of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, outlined to the bank's majority shareholders the parameters of the financial crisis the institution faced in April 1990, but chose not to admit that more than $2.6 billion invested by the shareholders had been used to conceal B.C.C.I's huge losses.
Copies of Mr. Naqvi's explanation to the ruling family of the Persian Gulf sheikdom of Abu Dhabi were made public for the first time yesterday. That document was accompanied by hundreds of pages of documents detailing the manner in which B.C.C.I. diverted billions from the investment account of Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan. 
 The supporting documents show the extremes to which Mr. Naqvi and a handful of the bank's executives went to deceive those who handled Sheik Zayed's account. Among other things, B.C.C.I. kept two sets of records on Sheik Zayed's assets. Reports sent to his advisers showed the funds invested in a wide range of conservative financial instruments, from certificates of deposits to Treasury bonds, as well as stock in B.C.C.I.
 
Diversion of Funds
 An internal set of books, however, showed that funds had been diverted to cover up losses by the bank's Treasury division and through bad shipping loans.
"There was never, and has not been, any element of conspiracy or collusion," Mr. Naqvi wrote at one point in explaining what went wrong at the bank. Rather, he said, "it was a matter of confidentiality for the sake of the bank and not myself."
Details of the manner in which Sheik Zayed and his associates had been deceived by B.C.C.I. were released outside the United States in December, when Abu Dhabi's ruling family and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority filed a $7 billion civil suit in Abu Dhabi against Mr. Naqvi; B.C.C.I.'s founder, Agha Hassan Abedi, and 11 other bank executives for mismanaged and stolen funds.
Those bringing the suit said $7 billion was what their $2.6 billion investment, made between 1981 and 1990, would have been worth today, had it been conservatively invested.
Documents relating to Sheik Zayed's investment portfolio came from B.C.C.I. (Overseas) Ltd., an affiliate incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The documents were not released in the United States in December because Sheik Zayed was then the defendant in a $1.5 billion civil suit filed by the trustees of First American Bankshares, the bank B.C.C.I. secretly and illegally controlled.
 
Comprehensive Deal
 The charges against Sheik Zayed were dropped in January as part of a broad-based agreement by Abu Dhabi, the United States Justice Department, the Federal Reserve Board and the Manhattan District Attorney's office.
In exchange for dismissing all charges against Sheik Zayed, the agreement requires Abu Dhabi to furnish a staggering quantity of B.C.C.I. documents, including 6,000 of Mr. Naqvi's files. In addition, it stipulates that Mr. Naqvi, who is currently on trial in Abu Dhabi, and faces Federal and state charges here, be brought to the United States in May.
The first shipment of B.C.C.I. documents, a load totaling 310,000 pages, was delivered to Federal Reserve offices on Tuesday. A team of 15 to 20 investigators from the Justice Department, the Fed and the District Attorney's office are expected to go to Abu Dhabi next week to review documents and interview former B.C.C.I. officials.
B.C.C.I. was closed by bank regulators around the world in July 1991 amid charges of wide-ranging fraud.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Slight Gains On Rise of Short-Term Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished somewhat higher against most other currencies yesterday after spending most of the day trading in a narrow range influenced mainly by technical factors.
Traders said the dollar gained support late in the day after short-term interest rates rose on the Treasury securities market. Higher rates tend to increase the popularity and price of the dollar because investors earn higher returns on dollar-denominated investments. 
 During the day, the market's attention was mainly focused on the Japanese yen, which strengthened after falling early in Tokyo. In New York, the dollar ended at 105.65 yen, unchanged from Tuesday.
"People are still very, very nervous in that market," said Ken Gettinger, head of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
The yen swung during the day on unconfirmed reports of large moves by investment funds and an intervention by the Bank of England, which was rumored to be acting on behalf of the Japanese central bank to support the dollar. But traders said they believed the rumors about the British central bank were untrue.
 
Ministers' Meeting Awaited
 Traders were also wary of statements that may emerge this weekend from a meeting of the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
The yen has risen sharply against the dollar in the last two weeks after the breakdown of bilateral trade talks between the United States and Japan on opening Japan's markets.
The dollar posted gains against the German mark, ending in New York at 1.7290 marks, up from 1.7245 marks on Tuesday. And the pound finished at $1.4780, down from $1.4790 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Tuesday, included: 1.4545 Swiss francs, up from 1.4495; 5.8750 French francs, up from 5.8620; 1,682 Italian lire, up from 1,676, and 1.3380 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3367.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Platinum Continues to Slide On Concerns Over Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices steepened their slide from a six-month high yesterday as traders turned their attention from possible South African supply disruptions to prospects for Russian sales of the metal.
Gold futures also retreated, while silver posted slight gains. 
 Platinum for April delivery fell $5.90 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at $391.20 an ounce. It was the fourth consecutive daily drop for platinum, which hit a six-month high of $406.50 on Feb. 16.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, April gold, the most active contract, slipped 30 cents, to $378.90 an ounce. But March silver rose 1.5 cents, to $5.23 an ounce.
Talk circulated that Russia, a leading platinum producer, may sell some stocks to raise hard currency to trim the Government budget deficit, according to William O'Neill, senior strategist for Merrill Lynch Futures.
The possibility of Russian sales diverted attention from political developments in South Africa, another big platinum producer, he said. South Africa will have its first multirace election in April, and there are fears that racial strife could lead to platinum supply disruptions.
"I think the justification for the rally was not there to start with," Mr. O'Neill said. "Platinum is just getting back down to earth here."
Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metal trading for Credit Suisse in New York, agreed that platinum "was starting to do too much too soon."
"It looks to me that it just ran out of steam," he said.
Mr. MacDonald said platinum was also under pressure as a result of comments this week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that short-term interest rates may have to rise to help stave off inflation. Investors often buy precious metals as a hedge against inflation.
Elsewhere, in energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for April delivery rose 2 cents, to $14.41 a barrel; March heating oil rose 0.39 cent, to 47.22 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline sank 0.28 cent, to 43.32 cents a gallon, and April natural gas fell 6.4 cents, to $2.232 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
After tough talk, can the U.S. and Japan get back to business?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE President's line on trade with Japan apparently played well with corporate America -- and for that matter, with the public. Typical of the reaction was the comment from Kenneth Kay, spokesman for a trade association of computer makers: President Clinton was "smart to let the Japanese Government know in no uncertain terms that the lack of progress is unacceptable," he cheered.
But now that the adrenaline rush is winding down, a lot of people are wondering how the interdependent economies are going to get back to the all-important business of business. For unlike earlier trade disputes, this one does not offer an obvious way out. 
 In their meeting in Washington, President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed to disagree -- and then sent aides scurrying to control the damage. Senior White House officials volunteered soothing words to a group of visiting Japanese executives. And Tokyo is reportedly busy drafting a plan to show this Saturday to finance ministers meeting in Germany.
But ideas for a fix are scarce, and optimism that the scars from the confrontation will soon disappear is even scarcer. "One reason we can't solve this problem is that we don't seem to know what the problem is," said Robert Z. Lawrence of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Under Mr. Hosokawa's predecessor, the issue was access to the Japanese market. Now the Administration is making no effort to correct the impression that the problem is the ballooning bilateral trade deficit -- a deficit that has little to do with trade barriers and much to do with the fact that the American economy is growing while Japan remains hubcap-deep in recession.
Another reason this wound is likely to fester, argues Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, is the inconvenient loss of a mutual enemy. Trade relations could become quite bitter in an era when the American-Japanese alliance was seen as the first line of defense against Communism in Asia. But in the end, geopoliticians in both countries would always reassert cold war priorities. "Japanese prime ministers were judged at home by how well they got along with the Americans," Mr. Hormats recalled, with just a trace of nostalgia.
Last, though hardly least, is the emotional subtext of the seemingly technical debate over "numerical indicators." Unhappy with earlier trade deals that never seemed to bear fruit, the Administration wants "targets" for market share. The Japanese argue that would amount to a big step down the road to "managed trade" in which world markets would be carved up by cartels.
For what it is worth, even most economists who believe the Japanese market is difficult to crack sympathize with the Japanese: As a comparable 1986 deal on semiconductors suggests, trade targets have a way of metamorphosing into entitlements. But Mr. Hormats thinks the point is beside the point. "The real issue is trust," he says: If policy makers in the two countries were sure their counterparts could be held to explicit commitments, there would be less haggling over semantics and more discussion of how to use numbers as benign indicators of market opening.
What, then, is to be done? Diplomats, like physicians, are inclined to temporize on the theory that problems often solve themselves. And there is certainly something to be said for allowing Mr. Hosokawa some room to patch his perilously weak political coalition.
But delay here is full of peril, if only because the Clinton Administration raised expectations that tough deeds would follow tough talk. Mr. Clinton is under pressure to invoke his broad powers to punish alleged Japanese trade perfidy. And even if he resists, Congress probably will not. That, among other reasons, is why many experts would like to see a fresh initiative from the American side.
"We already have an agreement on objective indicators," Mr. Lawrence noted. The trick now, he says, is to be creative in reassuring the Japanese that the numbers would only be used to level the playing field.
Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics, would like to "recover the high moral ground" by using very different policy weapons to force market access. In the case of auto parts, for example, he would like to see an antitrust suit charging collusion in restraint of trade. And in other products, he would like America to take the Japanese to a GATT dispute panel for a ruling.
But Job One, almost everyone agrees, is getting the Japanese to spend their way out of their own recession, thereby increasing demand for imports and sucking potential exports back into the Japanese market. "The big money is in macro-stimulus," Mr. Bergsten said.
Indeed, the big hope is that the very same action that would diffuse trade tensions would also shore up the Japanese Government's standing among recession-weary voters. "If we have the wits, we could still be allies with Hosokawa," Mr. Bergsten concluded.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
With a rival falling to a suitor, First Chicago gets Wall St.'s eye.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
LAST month's surprising announcement that Bank of America planned to pay nearly $2 billion in stock and cash to acquire Continental Bank was taken as good news by investors in the First Chicago Corporation, Continental's longtime rival for banking pre-eminence here.
First Chicago had already gone a long way toward repairing the damage to its reputation created by a series of misguided strategic moves and bad investments in the 1980's. Earnings reports have come in above Wall Street's consensus estimates for the last six quarters. 
 Now the Continental deal has focused new attention on First Chicago's recovery, including the overhaul of corporate banking operations and the value of a strong position in credit cards and local consumer banking.
First Chicago's common shares reached $49.375 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 2, up more than 15 percent in the two weeks during which the bank released its fourth-quarter earnings and the Continental deal was announced. After being caught with other banks in a selloff related to fears of rising interest rates, the shares have begun to edge up again, closing yesterday at $47.625 a share, down 37.5 cents.
"We saw it as extensively undervalued for a long time and it is still undervalued at current prices," Diane Glossman, who follows banks for Salomon Brothers in New York, said.
Almost half of the 25 analysts who have recommendations about First Chicago's stock rate it as a buy or strong buy, and the rest have it as a hold, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc., a Chicago-based firm. The consensus earnings estimate for 1994 is $5.94 a share, and among those recently changing their projections the average is $6.07, according to Zacks.
"The management team isn't distracted by major problems," said Henry C. Dickson, a Smith Barney Shearson analyst who projects the stock will reach $60 in 12 months and who recently lowered his risk rating from high to medium. "That's a relatively new experience for them."
Analysts who are less enthusiastic say the proliferation of low-interest cards is putting pressure on the credit card business, which has been First Chicago's crown jewel. They also cite the dangers of counting too much on earnings in activities like trading and venture capital investments, both of which surged last year.
"We don't see any particular down side but I'd be surprised to see the stock up 15 percent," said Lawrence Cohn, who follows banks for Paine Webber and is neutral on First Chicago. "It's still a wholesale bank with a decent regional component that is in transition toward being more of a regional. Regionals like Norwest, Banc One and NBD still have a competitive advantage."
Analysts say that First Chicago is an unlikely takeover target given its size and the likelihood that its board would fight hard to keep Chicago's biggest and most influential bank locally based.
Still, it has not yet rebounded far enough to be able to expand easily through acquisitions of its own. That may be a problem as numerous other domestic and foreign banks angle to strengthen their presence in the Midwest and especially in the Chicago region, which is one of the most fragmented metropolitan areas in the country for banking.
Some analysts are afraid such pressures may push First Chicago to overspend on growth, a fear heightened by its decision to pay $323 million, or 2.5 times book value, for Lake Shore Bancorp Inc. in November.
"That deal undercut the reputation they had been building for discipline," Judah Kraushaar, who follows banks for Merrill Lynch, said.
Doubts may grow if First Chicago follows the Lake Shore deal with other high-priced takeovers. But that seems unlikely. Indeed, some analysts say the next significant news is likely to be a comforting dividend increase this spring.

HEADLINE: Imperfect Spies, Imperfect World

 BODY:
When James Jesus Angleton died in 1987, he was regarded with justification as brilliant but unbalanced. In his long career as chief of the C.I.A.'s counterintelligence operations, Mr. Angleton was so suspicious of Soviet trickery that he even dismissed as a charade Moscow's break with Chinese Communists. He seemed to see potential "moles" everywhere and talked continually of "dangles," "false flags" and "disinformation."
Yet there was also method in Mr. Angleton's view of "the wilderness of mirrors," his term for the duel between Soviet and American intelligence agencies. He would not have been surprised by the allegations that Moscow paid more than $1.5 million since 1985 to Aldrich Ames, who once headed the agency's Soviet counterintelligence bureau. 
 "Think of an espionage service as a highly specialized employment service," Mr. Angleton told a sympathetic chronicler, Edward Jay Epstein. He compared rival services to corporate "headhunters" -- which is evidently how Mr. Ames, in trying to recruit Soviet assets, was ensnared himself. The only way that an espionage service can safely steal documents, Mr. Angleton said, is to recruit an agent with legitimate access to secret data.
As he put it in Mr. Epstein's 1989 book, "Deception," the potential mole can be incrementally drawn into an "a subtle web of irresistible compromises." That is what Federal prosecutors say happened to Mr. Ames and his wife. To foil such penetration, Mr. Angleton instituted lie detector tests and other security measures. But his methods and suspicions got so out of hand that in 1974 he was forced to resign. But as the Ames affair suggests, the agency appears to have paid too little heed to what was valid in his warnings -- and to the potentially fatal consequences for undercover agents in the former Soviet Union.
President Clinton is right to express outrage, and he needs to grill the C.I.A. about why Mr. Ames's betrayal went undetected for so long. But the scandal should not be permitted to derail U.S.-Russian relations. Spying is an unfriendly act, but it is not an uncommon one nor an exclusively Russian activity. Does anyone seriously doubt that the C.I.A. was busily recruiting K.G.B. employees from the rubble of the Soviet empire? In the game of nations, there are no friends, only provisional allies, and even they spy on one another.
In any event, it does not take spies to know the deeper truths that shape U.S.-Russian relations. Espionage and military competition are not the keys to the two nations' future. It is fine to let Boris Yeltsin know that he has stuck his thumb in the eye of a potential ally. But neither Washington nor Moscow can let the Cold War game of spy vs. spy throw them off the path of economic and political cooperation.

HEADLINE: Virginia, Say No to the Mouse

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company excels at creating artificial wonderlands aimed at 10-year-old, television-nurtured sensibilities. Nothing wrong with that, in Anaheim or Orlando. Neither place was ever known for its cultural or natural treasures.
Prince William County, Va., is another matter entirely. It is a region of natural beauty and historical importance, flanked by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Civil War shrines of Manassas. Its rolling farmland preserves a piece of rural America, with roots in the country's earliest settlement. 
 In its midst the Walt Disney Company now proposes to erect something called Disney's America -- an amusement park with American history as its theme. The people from Anaheim say they have something valuable to add to 3,000 rural acres as yet untouched by suburban mallification, next to the site of the two battles of Bull Run at Manassas, where almost 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers lost their lives in 1861 and 1862.
The nearest town to the proposed park is Haymarket, population 375. To this bit of earth Disney would bring a new city of 7,000 and 30,000 visitors a day. The usual Mickey Mouse fantasy stuff would be supplemented with a roller coaster ride through a reproduction of an early steelworks, a depiction of plantation life (complete with slaves), whizzbang "Audio-Animatronics" images of dead Presidents, and other history-related entertainments.
The Disney Company is hoping to capitalize on the flow of tourists to the Washington area, and to sell its idea with ersatz history. Make no mistake: What the kids would remember about such an experience would be the technology and the thrills, not the history. This is not an educational undertaking; it is a business venture.
Disney wants Virginia taxpayers to cough up more than $150 million to build roads and other infrastructure. Virginia's new Governor, George Allen, says the project is the keystone in the state's "economic renaissance." Members of the Democratic-controlled state Legislature are not so sure. But even the skeptics seem about to bow to the pressure of Disney lobbying in Richmond. The debate in Virginia's House and Senate is not whether they should spend money but how much.
Have these politicians forgotten who they are? Virginia is not an Alabama or a South Carolina that must pay investors to settle there. Virginia is one of the jewels of the Eastern Seaboard, home to Jamestown and colonial Williamsburg. It is a state with a relatively low unemployment rate; the northern counties where Disney wants to build have low unemployment even by Virginia standards.
Taxpayers would have no guarantee of a return on their investment. And Disney doesn't need the money. The company is merely hoping Virginia will come up with the cash under the threat that The Mouse -- as locals have begun calling it -- will scamper home. That is precisely what Virginians should let it do.
Fortunately, the House has attached a rider to its bill requiring a second look at the proposal and a second vote before adjournment this spring. That should give legislators time to come to their senses, and opponents more time to bring reason to bear on the Governor's cries of economic emergency.
Boosters will no doubt protest "outsiders" taking an interest in a "local" issue. But the proposed Disneyfication of this unique countryside raises questions of national importance. Haymarket is not 42d street or Florida piney woods. Putting a theme park there degrades a scenic and historic resource for a project that can be built elsewhere. This is precisely the sort of exurban zoning issue that will proliferate in a 21st-century America with more people and fewer well-preserved natural areas.
If Disney walks away, Virginia's economy will still be sound, and its role as a custodian of important national resources will be stronger. As for parents who want to give their children history, let them -- like generations before them -- make the trip to Prince William County. Let them sit still at Manassas, and listen for the presence of the dead.

HEADLINE: Officials Say 'Cut!' to Subway Violence on Film

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The New York City subway system, the setting of the chaotic chase in "The French Connection," the train hijacking in "The Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three" and countless other cinematic scenes of crime, is seeking a more pristine image by refusing to allow producers to film scenes in the subway that officials think are too violent.
Transit Authority officials say such scenes are at odds with a reduction in subway crime in recent years and create an impression of a dangerous system that could threaten ridership. But representatives of the film industry in New York say restrictions by the Transit Authority smack of censorship and could harm the health of the city's film industry, which spent $1.3 billion in the five boroughs in 1992.
 
Contrary to Reality?
 "We've been very successful in the last two or three years in reducing violence and increasing ridership." said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman. "We want to protect our investment and increase ridership. We don't look fondly on projects that depict the system as being out of control." 
 Although Mr. Lebow and other transit officials say there is no written policy covering what kind of scenes they will allow to be filmed, he said: "We don't want bullets whizzing around subway cars. We don't want bloody bodies strewn all over the subway cars."
Al Gallardo, the agency's director of government and community relations, said officials were particularly concerned with protecting ridership, which has finally begun to recover after years of decline. "We don't want to create this image that the subways are not safe," he said. "You don't want to have senseless violence -- shootings, bombings in the subway system. That affects ridership."
Jeffrey Hayes, producer of the television series "Law and Order" which is filmed in New York, called the Transit Authority's move curious. "What else are you going to film there, a love story in the subway?" he said.
Many movies and television shows use scenes of characters riding the subway as a way of evoking the city's atmosphere. But its dark, ominous tunnels are still a draw to producers who want to portray the underbelly of city life, as was done in "Carlito's Way" and "King of New York."
Mr. Lebow said transit officials recently declined to cooperate in a film about a mob chief who, unbeknownst to the authorities, is headquartered in the subway system. "We said no," Mr. Lebow said. "It's such a fantasy. It suggests we don't know what's going on in the subway system."
Mr. Lebow said the agency has been trying to restrict scenes of violence over the last year or so. The move comes amid an increase in the number of movie projects since the end of a boycott of the city by major film producers caused by contract disputes with movie unions.
 
Claims of Censorship
 Richard Brick, a film producer who until last month was the commissioner of the mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting, said the agency should not be making judgments based on script content. "They should only be concerned with issues of safety as a condition of their cooperation," he said.
"The subway and buses of New York are characters as much as the Empire State Building and the Brooklyn Bridge, and film makers are drawn here in part to portray those icons," Mr. Brick said. "I hope they would be permitted to portray realistically the conditions in the subway system or on the buses."
Bruce Feinberg, the director of the Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development, who met with the authority president, Alan F. Kiepper, because of concerns that the Transit Authority was being too restrictive, said yesterday that he was told that the authority had no "hard and fast policy" but that "they are concerned about violence, about how the system is portrayed."
"I know he would love to see a love story, a warm and fuzzy love story that takes place in the subway," Mr. Feinberg said of Mr. Kiepper. He said Mr. Kiepper pledged cooperation on films about darker subjects as well.
 
Exploding Stations
 Mr. Feinberg said Mr. Kiepper agreed to work with city officials and officials at Columbia Pictures who are developing a movie called "The Money Train," about police officers' hijacking of a subway train that collects tokens from stations.
Mr. Feinberg said "The Money Train" was expected to have a $45 million budget. He said he told Mr. Kiepper that if films set in New York were not able to be made in the city, producers would simply make a new location look like New York.
Robert Curran, the director of the Pittsburgh Film Office, said yesterday that his office was contacted by people involved with "Die Hard 3" interested in getting information on the city's subway system. He said he understood they were looking at subway systems across the country.
A spokesman for the movie's producer, Cinergi, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., said it was too soon to talk about plans for the movie.
Charles Darby, deputy commissioner for the city's film office, said the movie was tentatively planned as a violent action film staring Bruce Willis set in the New York City subway system, complete with exploding subway stations.
Mr. Curran said any limits placed on the content of films shot in the New York City subways would help other cities win movie business. "I think the more important message it would send, that would ultimately benefit Pittsburgh and other cities trying to take business from New York, is New York is not a cooperative place to work," he said.
Mr. Lebow said while officials were sensitive to the economic concerns of the city, "we feel we have a responsibility to preserve a realistic portrait of the system."
Mr. Lebow said proposed scripts were reviewed for issues of safety and feasibility as well as content. If the authority agrees to cooperate, producers are required to pay any costs incurred by the subway system.
Mr. Darby said the Transit Authority historically is not enthusiastic about having film makers in the subway system. In fact since its anti-graffiti campaign of the 1980's the authority has forbidden film makers to depict graffiti in the system.

HEADLINE: Bradley Rebukes Clinton on Japan

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
In an unusually pointed rebuke of his own party's leader, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey charged today that President Clinton's hard line on Japan trade policy was "gratuitous brinkmanship" that puts the United States' long-term economic and strategic interests at risk in pursuit of domestic political gain.
"I mean, it's kind of Japan-bashing for domestic constituency, without regard to the long-term strategic interests of the country, not even achieving the short-term objective, which is getting the bilateral trade deficit down," the Senator said in an interview in his office that he solicited to talk about Japanese trade. 
 Mr. Bradley, an outspoken advocate of free trade, has occasionally weighed in with a dissenting Democratic voice on a range of policy issues. However, he is one of the Administration's most reliable backers in the Senate and has rarely so sharply criticized Mr. Clinton, a fellow Rhodes Scholar whom he declined to challenge for the Presidential nomination two years ago.
 
 
Risk Cited
 He said that by allowing trade talks with Japan to collapse two weeks ago and threatening retaliation, the United States risked undermining Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's nascent efforts at internal reforms that could open markets and strengthen the Japanese economy.
Indeed, by insisting on specific numerical benchmarks to show whether Japan was opening various markets to goods from the United States and other countries, the White House could force Mr. Hosokawa, he said, into greater reliance on the labyrinthine Japanese bureaucracy, which has resisted change.
At the same time, Mr. Bradley said, the Administration had left Mr. Hosokawa -- and not Washington -- looking like the advocate of free trade in the developing economies of Southeast Asia, which would be a major target of future American exports.
"This opens it up for the Japanese to become the champions of free trade, and for us to become the country pushing for that which is clearly seen as not in the interests of some of these other Asian countries, which is where most of the growth, most of the investment, most of the exports and most of the jobs in this country are going to be created in exporting," he said.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, the Administration's top trade negotiator, responded tonight: "The Japanese have had a sanctuary market, which they have protected for decades. It has resulted in a failure to open markets not only to the U.S. but for other countries, which has created economic and political problems in the world trading system."
Mr. Kantor said the Administration respected Mr. Bradley as a friend but could not understand his comments.
"When the Senate Finance Committee was briefed on this, he could not attend," Mr. Kantor said, "and I think part of it may be a misunderstanding of what we are attempting to achieve. Part of it may be the frustration that we all feel that these markets remain closed and have such a pernicious effect on world trade."
Since the talks collapsed, some Democratic politicians have quietly worried that taking too hard a stance could prompt an all-out trade war. But Mr. Bradley, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's panel on international trade, was the first to voice his concerns so publicly.
 
 
Dispute Resolution 'Mechanism'
 He said today that he favored a dispute resolution "mechanism" to end arguments over access to market sectors that American companies cannot penetrate -- like pulp and paper and telecommunications -- because of Japanese restrictions.
But he left unclear precisely how such disputes would be arbitrated, saying, "I don't have all the details worked out, but the idea is if you have a problem in the flat-glass sector, you have a procedure set out where, publicly, you lay out what all the facts are, and then you kind of have a way of determining is that correct or not."
Mr. Bradley also said the two countries were dependent on each other to confront the nuclear threat in North Korea, and to deal with Russia and China, and should not risk impairing cooperation.
 
 
'We're in Control'
 Asked what political constituency Mr. Clinton was playing to, Mr. Bradley said, "You'd have to talk to the pollster. I don't know." But he said of the public debate, "I think that people want to believe that somehow or other we're not in control of our destiny, that somebody is victimizing us. I mean, we're in control of our destiny." He added: "It's easy to say it's their fault. It's harder to say, O.K., well, let's think a little more strategically here than some sector-specific number."
The Senator also said he believed the debate was tinged with decades of anti-Japanese sentiment, noting that early Japanese immigrants had sought to assimilate into American life, joining political groups and serving in the military, "right up until they were interned" during World War II. "At the same time this was happening," he said, "American officials were saying, 'Oh, you can't trust the Japanese.' So now when you hear the words, 'Trust, but quantify,' there's a historical resonance that goes back to the early period of Japanese immigration."
Noting that some of the architects of the Clinton trade policy had dealt firsthand with Japanese barriers as private investment bankers, Mr. Bradley said: "When you are representing a client, your objective is to get the client into the market. When you are leading a country, your objective is to further the strategic interests of the country, which are geopolitical, political and economic, in the broadest sense of the words, particularly at a time of significant transition in the world."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking to Ease Restrictions On Export of High-Tech Products

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today proposed the first major overhaul of American export controls since the cold war, aiming to ease the sale abroad of machine tools, telecommunications equipment and other devices that had been restricted because they could be used to make sophisticated weapons of mass destruction.
Clinton Administration officials said the legislation to rewrite the 1979 Export Administration Act, which expires in June, is intended to balance the Administration's commitment to nonproliferation with its desire to promote and increase American exports, a driving force in the economic recovery. 
 But the proposed legislation satisfied neither the business community, which found it still too restrictive compared with other countries' export laws, nor the arms control community, which said it would open the floodgates for rogue regimes to acquire advanced weapons-making technology. Leading business groups said they would continue to support competing proposals.
The introduction of the export-control legislation was coupled with a Commerce Department announcement that it was further relaxing restrictions on the sale abroad of powerful computers, making high-speed mainframe computers widely available for export to all but a few outlaw countries. This fulfills part of the President's commitment last September to reform outdated export controls on computers.
The Commerce Department maintains rigorous safeguards on the export of all supercomputers. But today it revised its definition of a supercomputer from a machine that can perform 195 million theoretical operations per second, or mtops, to one that can perform 1,500. Mtops is a measure of computer performance created by the Government. Any computer under 1,500 mtops -- which is most high-performance computers -- can now be more easily sold abroad.
Administration officials said the easing of restrictions on computer exports alone had the potential to unleash some $30 billion in computer sales abroad. The rewriting of the overall export-control law, if passed, would add to that figure, by opening the way for more American exports of certain advanced machine tools, telecommunications equipment, chemicals and other high-tech equipment that had been banned for export because of their weapons potential.
The Administration said that many of these high-tech electronic devices or chemicals were already widely available on the world market and that only the United States was holding back its exporters.
Officials acknowledged that some of the equipment that will now be released for export could be helpful to weapons manufacturers. But they said the new legislation, which Congress began debating today, would continue to control exports of the most advanced technologies that could be used to develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.
Introducing the Administration's legislation, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said, "We feel it strikes the critical balance between nonproliferation concerns and economic interests."
 
 
'Christmas Tree' of Exports
 But the arms control organizations disputed that assessment.
"Rather than a balanced law, Clinton has created a Christmas tree for American exporters, with presents beyond their wildest dreams," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. "As with Iraq, we will have to send U.S. pilots again to bomb things our industry has exported.
"The basic problem with this law is that it sacrifices U.S. national security to a misguided quest for quick export dollars. This bill pays Clinton's debt to Silicon Valley, which backed him early and backed him big."
Moreover, critics say that at a time when Russia's future direction seems increasingly cloudy, and when it is no longer certain whether Moscow is friend or foe, the changes will also make it easier for Russia to upgrade its military industries and quickly ship more exports abroad to the likes of Iran or Libya.
The export controls were originally imposed during the cold war to keep sensitive computer, composite materials and telecommunications technology out of the hands of Communist countries. There was much interagency squabbling over how far the bill should lift unilateral American controls on sensitive technology exports, with the Commerce Department pushing for the cold war lid to come off as far as possible and the Defense and State departments trying to hold it down a little more. The interagency tussle forced the Administration to delay the introduction of its proposal twice.
These are among the highlights of the revised bill:
*It would give individual American companies broader new rights to petition for the elimination of export controls when they have an unfair business impact -- usually meaning that the proposed export is widely available from other countries.
*It would set much tighter restrictions on the United States Government's ability to impose or renew export controls on products that other nations are already widely selling on the world market.
*It would require that all licensing decisions be made, or referred to the President, within no more than 90 days, with the vast majority of decisions made at lower levels. If no decision was made, the exporter would be allowed to go ahead by default.
*It would provide for an interagency dispute mechanism, so that if the Commerce and State departments disagreed about a proposed sale, cases could be quickly shifted to the highest levels for a decision.
*It would require clearer and more complete statements as to why any controls were being maintained.
 
 
Focus on Military Uses
 The legislation is based on the principle that when the Government tries to control everything, it controls nothing well. Therefore, having stripped out many of the outdated controls, the bill tries to focus on technologies with dangerous military applications that would directly threaten the United States or its allies. For instance, the bill would maintain tight controls on the export of any American stealth technology that could be used to conceal aircraft from advanced radar.
The bill eliminates controls for technologies that are already widely available, but it maintains certain restrictions on exports to unfriendly regimes like those in Iran or North Korea, no matter how available the goods may be from exporters in other countries. "We're not going to sell cattle prods to Iran, no matter who else is selling them," one senior official said.
Nevertheless, groups representing manufacturers of computers, telecommunications equipment and chemical products denounced the Administration's bill for not going far enough and said they would continue to support a less restrictive package put together by business interests and sponsored by Representative Toby Roth, Republican of Wisconsin, and and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.
 
 
Competitive Concerns
 Business groups complained that the new law would still leave them at a competitive disadvantage against big European exporters, whose governments put few restrictions, if any, on where businesses from their nations can conduct business.
Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "As an initiative to reform the export-control system, the Administration's proposal just doesn't measure up."
He and others argued that too many unilateral American controls would persist on high-technology products that are easy to buy elsewhere in the world. They also asserted that the law would not clearly establish who was authorized to make decisions and accountable for making them, and that the law would not clearly tell American companies what not to export, or to whom.

HEADLINE: Homeless Seeing Less Apathy, More Anger

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

 BODY:
The old man stands so still against a wall at Grand Central Terminal that he seems part of it, a rundown monument to homelessness rising from the cigarette butts. Charlie Buchanan never begs, he watches, and what he sees is the end of an era.
New York was never a gentle city, but for years it let him drift along the currents of its sidewalks. Now he says police officers treat him like a trespasser. People who used to smile or nod do not even look at him, as if they left their heart in their other suit. 
 "It's not that people are meaner," Mr. Buchanan said. "It's that they're weary."
He glimpsed it first in 1988 or '89, the start of what would be a growing national impatience with the ever-increasing presence of dirty and desperate people. Over time that frustration turned to apathy and then anger, not just here but in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and other cities where ideology has given way to an uncomfortable reality.
 
Indifferent Passers-By
 In Seattle, the homeless are fined if they sit on sidewalks during business hours. In San Francisco, where the sheer number of homeless was strangling the downtown, even liberals agreed to push them out of sight and mind. In Miami, a homeless enclave burned its bayside shantytown rather than watch the police rip it down.
The homeless and their advocates fight back with the usual lawsuits, but the clear consensus, at street level, is that they have lost the crusade for the public conscience.
Many passers-by seem to have become numb. As the homeless crisis moves through a second decade, New York has tens of thousands of street people and legions of beggars in midtown and lower Manhattan.
"The sight of them generates a sense of the future very much at odds with the American dream," said William Erlbaum, a New York criminal courts judge who teaches on the homeless at York College, the City University of New York. "People, in this case, turned their anger on the victim."
Not all signs are bleak. The number of volunteers to help the homeless has never been higher, said Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York. And, as Mr. Buchanan acknowledged, the really good-hearted people, the ones who are not afraid to touch him, are still good.
"The ones we're losing are the ones in the middle, the ones on the fence," said Wayne Elliott, echoing other homeless people. "They're the ones that are changing."
The evidence of the shifting attitude is not hard to find. Three weeks ago in Little Italy, two well-dressed men stood over an older homeless man, cursing him as two police officers stood by laughing. In Times Square two weeks ago, a man shoved a homeless man to the sidewalk because he approached his date for money. Last week in the East Village, five teen-agers shouted curses at a crippled homeless man. They used to give him cigarettes.
Jozel Williams, who walks with a limp and lives in a box in front of an old warehouse in the meatpacking district, said he does not know why people who used to be nice to him now either ignore him or try to abuse him, but it happens almost every day. People tell him to get a job, or to take a bath.
"It's like they got to rub your face in it," he said, warming his feet by a fire in a garbage can.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said he would prosecute homeless people for assault if they intimidate people by begging too aggressively, who has granted the police more latitude in dealing with the homeless, has been blamed by some homeless people for creating the mean atmosphere. But the longtime homeless say the Mayor is just a product of the times.
"City Hall, the cops, they're only mean when they know the people are on their side," said Mr. Elliott, who sells Street News, a newspaper that the homeless peddle to make money.
Subway signs ban panhandlers. For Roger Robertson, homeless for four years, unemployed forever, the signs are insults, like the old "NO COLORED ALLOWED" signs. The subway signs should read, "NO HOMELESS," he said.
"Because that's what they're really saying," he said.
 
Looking for Peace But Finding Abuse
 In a city filled with beggars, the 61-year-old Mr. Buchanan never asks for one thin dime.
"It's not that I think this city owes me a living, because I don't," he said three weeks ago, pressed up against the wall at Grand Central Terminal.
He just wants to lie down at night and not feel the dehumanizing tap of a nightstick, telling him to move on. He wants to enjoy the warmth of a fourth blanket, and the flavor of a free sandwich. Because when everything else has fallen through, the sidewalk is solid ground.
But it is harder to live peacefully now; more and more police officers force him to keep walking. "I ain't mad, not at them," he said. "They're just doing it because they're told to keep people moving. People like me."
A laid-off packing house worker from Attleboro, Mass., Mr. Buchanan looks 20 years older than he is, his face half hidden by a gray beard that, because he eats most meals on the move, often has soup in it. "I don't bother nobody," he said, but that hasn't saved him.
One night recently, as he lay in an alcove on Madison Avenue, a car came screeching to a stop at the curb and several young men jumped out.
The first thing he thought was that they were going to burn him.
All they did was throw eggs at him.
"I just covered up my head," he said.
Mr. Buchanan can live with a certain amount of cruelty. The thing he hates about the hardening attitude is that it gives people the excuse to ignore him. In a world where the daily pain of living tugs people off into madness, he is anchored by the occasional kind word.
To have them look but not see him does something to him inside. It may not seem too important, in a city where people do not even look at one another in elevators, but the way people ignore the homeless is different.
"It is the worst thing," Mr. Buchanan said.
 
Counting on Coins In Others' Pockets

It has happened before, in the late 1800's, during the Great Depression, when the presence of the homeless intruded too far into the mainstream, Judge Erlbaum said.
Roger Robertson may be the greatest intruder of all.
He is certain that, deep in some pocket, there is money for him. One night in late January he tracked five teen-agers four blocks on 51st Street, followed them to a delicatessen, and waited outside till they came out with some change. It took 20 minutes and he made 17 cents.
Life is changing.
"They'll walk out in traffic now, to keep from walking close to you," he said.
The city seems smaller now. Businesses that would let him stand inside and get warm shut him out. The free coffee no longer flows. Day-old pastries, the little delicacies that he could always count on, he finds in the garbage bags now.
He used to like to sleep on the trains. It was warm, and as long as he paid his token he had a right. But now transit officers shake him awake and order him off the train if he rides it too far or too long.
"The truth is they don't want me on it," he said. "The people don't like to sit by me."
When the police see him working the corners near the hotels in midtown, they tell him to leave, Mr. Robertson said. He is 28, and says he has not had a real home since he was 18. This, is home.
"They're telling me I don't have the right to stand on the sidewalk," he said. "They're telling me I have no right to stick my hand out. Everybody's got their hand out in New York City."
Farther down 51st Street, a homeless man waits until people refuse him, then shoves the stump of his left hand in their face so they can get a good look.
Around the corner at Rockefeller Center, a cold-looking, ghostly pale young woman drifts out of the dark and begs for her children.
Mr. Robertson has news for New York. People like him have always been here, and always will be.
 
Growing Impatience From Working Poor
 Devon Service rides by them in his taxi, and any pity he used to feel is gone.
" 'Give me a quarter, give me a quarter,' that's what they say to me," he said. "I have to drive four blocks to make a quarter."
He is Jamaican. He understands poverty. He does not understand people who beg, who go dirty. If it was up to him, people who make homelessness a life style would be shot.
"I guess I don't have a soft heart," Mr. Service said.
Rosalee Curcio works in a restaurant for minimum wage and tips. She puts her change in a jar, the only savings account she has. She wants to buy a stereo.
For a long time, she would drop a nickel, never more, into the cup of a man who worked the corner near her house. But it has been months now, he is still begging and she is still hoarding her fortune in a jar and dancing to a cheap radio.
Now she keeps her money. Recently a different panhandler followed her for several blocks until she screamed at him, begging him to leave her alone.
"The cops have to do something," she said, "or we won't be able to go outside."
Advocates for the homeless say the impatience is citywide.
"As we entered the second decade of this crisis, we stopped seeing them as people in pain," Ms. Brosnahan said. "We started seeing them as fixtures, like mailboxes and lamp posts. After 12 years there are more homeless than ever out there.
"People started to think there is no solution."
Judge Erlbaum said many people have tried to redefine homelessness, to remove people in genuine need from the genre. It makes it easier for conservative politicians to pass laws that restrict their very presence, he said.
"How can it be a crime," he asked, "to give alms to the mendicant?"
 
Finding at City Hall, A Get-Tough Policy
 To the homeless, he is the personification of the public attitude, a man who rode fear and prejudice into the Mayor's office, blaming them for adding to the sense of chaos in the city.
Mr. Giuliani said he has been misunderstood. Homeless people who break no laws have no reason to be afraid of him.
"The people engaged in aggressive or criminal behavior, those people have found there is a difference now in the enforcement of the law," Mr. Giuliani said.
"They do have more latitude and discretion," he said of the beat officers. "We want them to have more discretion to solve problems on the street, to tell someone to move on, tell people to stop aggressive activity. The reason why they are there is to prevent crime. If they are going to do that, we have to empower them."
Mr. Giuliani said those changes must be accomplished without brutality.
But several police officers, who did not want their names used because they fear retribution in the department, said officers now feel free to use their nightsticks on belligerent homeless people, because of Mr. Giuliani's get-tough attitude, and because they believe the public is behind them.
This comes at a time when the Federal Government, for the first time in 12 years, has called the homeless crisis a full-scale national problem.
Mr. Elliott, the homeless vendor, has it figured out.
"There's too many of us."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Fights Restriction on Filming in Subways

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday criticized the Transit Authority for restricting the filming of violent movie and television sequences in the subway system, saying attempts to screen the content of films raised freedom-of-speech questions and gave the mistaken impression that the city did not welcome movie producers and their big budgets.
"I don't think you get the choice, if you want movies made in your city, to say, 'Well, the movie has to be favorable with regard to the subways,' or 'The movie has to be favorable with regard to the city,' " Mr. Giuliani said. He said that by seeking to do that, "you're getting into pretty dangerous grounds with regard to the First Amendment." 
 He said that other than determining if a proposed film project poses logistical or safety problems, ruling on the content of a script "is an area where government doesn't really have a role."
 
A Decrease in Crime
 Transit Authority officials said they were refusing to allow the filming of violent scenes because they do not accurately portray the system, which has shown a decrease in crime in the last three years, and because they feel it threatens its ridership. Jared Lebow, an authority spokesman, said yesterday that since the authority was a creation of the city and state governments, it would "not turn a deaf ear" to suggestions by the Mayor or by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that its position on movies was losing business for the region.
The director of the Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development, Bruce Feinberg, met with Transit Authority officials on Wednesday to discuss the policy and said he was satisfied that despite their concern over the image of the subway, they would not be overly restrictive.
Mr. Giuliani also said that the city was actively trying to attract producers of feature films, commercials and television shows to work in the city and that "I wish the M.T.A. would be a little more sensitive here." The Transit Authority is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
A recent city study said film work added about $1.3 billion to the city's economy in 1992. "We want people to come to New York and make movies," Mr. Giuliani said. "We want them to do it in a way that enhances this city ecnomically."
He noted that "Serpico" was made in New York with the cooperation of the city even though it portrayed corruption in the Police Department.

HEADLINE: Option May Doom Budget Amendment (for Now)

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Democratic opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget offered a counterproposal today that seemed likely to lead to the defeat of all versions of the plan.
The substitute version was intended to serve as a political fig leaf that would allow some Senators to vote for the measure and then, after its near-certain defeat, vote against the original version and still tell constituents they had supported a balanced budget amendment. 
 The strategy would divide the Senate and probably insure that opponents would have the 34 votes needed to block adoption of any constitutional amendment.
The substitute, offered by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, would open several additional loopholes in the basic amendment, which has already been frequently attacked as ineffective and no more than a political smoke screen.
 
Gimmickry Is Charged
 Each side denounced the other's proposal as a political gimmick.
Senator Paul E. Simon, the Illinois Democrat who has pushed the basic balanced budget amendment for years, called the substitute version "political gamesmanship." He said it was "cover for those who want to go back home and say, 'I voted for a balanced budget amendment' " and then "vote against the real thing."
But Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, scoffed at the Simon forces for inserting provisions that would delay the amendment's taking effect until 2001 and would prohibit the courts from acting on it. He said the pair of provisions "pushes it off into the next century and makes it certain that it can never be enforced."
The basic amendment says that "total outlays for any fiscal year cannot exceed total receipts" unless Congress agrees to a deficit by a three-fifths vote in both houses. It would require separate three-fifths votes to add to the national debt.
The Simon amendment does not say how the deficit is to be eliminated, leaving Congress to choose among the full range of increased taxes and cuts in discretionary spending and entitlements like Social Security.
Opponents have repeatedly called the proposed amendment sloganeering instead of action. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, said, "The promise it makes today is that tough decisions will be made tomorrow."
Senator Reid's substitute would free Social Security spending from any risk of cuts, would allow the Government to establish a separate budget for capital spending outside the deficit rules, without defining what a capital expenditure was and would remove the ban on deficit financing during a recession. Like the Simon proposal, it would also declare that the courts could not enforce the amendment.
Senator Reid was the only supporter of his amendment to declare tonight that he would vote against the Simon amendment if his proposal failed.
But foes of the Simon proposal thought the chance to vote for the alternative would make it easier for them to get others to vote against Mr. Simon's version. Several singled out Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, Senator Mitchell's deputy leader, as a senator who might vote for the substitute and then against the Simon amendment. Mr. Ford said tonight that it was too early to say what he might do.
Twenty-six senators have publicly declared their opposition to the Simon amendment. Six others are seen by their staffs or their colleagues as almost certain to vote against it.
So to get the 34 needed to reject the Simon plan, opponents would have to find two votes from among another six senators, including Mr. Ford, who have either voted for the proposal before or have expressed some sympathy for it this year. Some, like Mr. Ford, have even been one of its sponsors.
 
A Vow to Continue
 Tuesday's votes in the Senate will not end this year's battles over the issue. In the House, 218 supporters of the basic amendment announced plans today to force a vote late next month. Even if the Senate defeats the proposal first, a successful two-thirds vote in the 435-member House would set the stage for a renewed effort, though probably not until next year.
Senator Simon's chief Republican ally, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, warned: "This pressure is not going to go away. If we fail to do it this year, we'll be back again."
The Reid amendment would also take effect in 2001, and would require a three-fifths vote for deficit financing, except in wartime, or during a recession, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office. It would not require three-fifth majorities to raise the national debt.
Mr. Hatch called the Reid substitute "a sham." He said that its undefined exclusion of capital investments demonstrated it was phony.
"Why, it could cover everything from education to transportation," he said. "Virtually anything could be excluded from being covered by a balanced budget amendment."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Muslims and Croats To Discuss Proposal in U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Administration said today that it would play host to talks in Washington this weekend on an American-backed peace plan for Bosnia that would unite those parts of the country held by Muslims with those held by Croats, a senior State Department official said today.
The goal of the plan, which is only beginning to take shape but has the backing of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is to avoid a three-way partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic and religious lines. 
 Rather, it is intended to create an independent state of at least the Muslims and Croats, who were allies against Bosnian Serb nationalists in the first stage of the civil war that began nearly two years ago.
The obvious gap in the plan is that it does not deal concretely with the Serbs, who control more than 70 percent of Bosnia's territory and would not have much reason to accept such a proposal without some inducement.
Under the plan, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats could unite territory under their control into a number of municipalities defined as Muslim or as Croat depending on who forms a majority.
 
Talks to Last Several Days
 The talks, which could begin as early as Saturday and are expected to last two or three days, are another sign that the Administration is moving rapidly to seek a diplomatic settlement in Bosnia after abandoning its hands-off policy two weeks ago.
Charles E. Redman, the United States envoy to the former Yugoslavia, plans to bring together Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic; the political leader of the Bosnian Croats, Kresimir Zubak, and Croatia's Foreign Minister, Mate Granic. Mr. Christopher is also expected to meet with the officials at some point, said the senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Silajdzic, who is in Washington meeting with senior Administration officials and key members of Congress, welcomed the development and Washington's expanded role.
"The Administration is being helpful," the Prime Minister told reporters as he met with Mr. Christopher. "We are focusing on the possibility of a rapprochement with the Croats. We believe it to be the first step toward peace in Bosnia."
 
Last Year's Plan Revived
 The plan, which grew out of talks last year between Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, and Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, was revived two weeks ago by the Bosnian Government.
In a suggestion of how ambitious, and perhaps remote, the plan's goals may be when compared with the situation in Bosnia, the official even said it called for unifying the military forces of the Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
The two sides, which have been fighting in central and southwest Bosnia for more than 10 months, signed a cease-fire agreement only on Wednesday.
The Administration's strategy is to help work out a joint Muslim-Croatian entity in Bosnia that would then join in a financial and economic confederation with the Croatian Republic, the official said. That relationship could include freedom of travel and goods, a common currency and cooperation on issues like the environment.
 
Call for 'Greater Croatia'
 Some of the Bosnian Croat leaders have called in recent months for creating a "Greater Croatia" by joining Bosnian territory they hold to the Croatian Republic. Asked if the Administration's plan would put the Muslims at risk of being swallowed up by Croatia, which has several thousand troops fighting in Bosnia, the State Department official dismissed that danger.
In theory the Muslim-Croatian entity would then ask the Bosnian Serbs to join it. The Administration's notion is that the Serbs will somehow prefer to be aligned with what the United States envisions as a democratic, economically vibrant entity, rather than try to secede from Bosnia and link their territory to a "Greater Serbia."
Senior Administration officials stressed today that the Muslim-Croat initiative still requires the Bosnian Serbs to make territorial concessions. The United States has been pressing Bosnia's Government to define its exact territorial requirements.
The idea is to build on a plan in principle endorsed by the three factions last August for a loose Bosnian union of three republics. Under that agreement, 33.3 percent of the territory would go to the Bosnian Government, 17.5 percent to the Croats and the rest, almost 50 percent, to the Serbs.
 
Carrots for Croatia
 As an inducement to the Bosnian Croats and the Croatian Government, the United States plan holds out economic and political incentives.
Croatia would no longer be threatened by economic sanctions because of its military and financial backing for the Bosnian Croats. Both the Bosnian Government and the Croatian Government could be given access to Western European economic organizations and would be invited to take part in a NATO offer of a loose security alliance (but not NATO membership).
The Muslims have dismissed earlier proposals that envisioned the union of two Muslim and Croatian pieces of territory, rather than a federated state, because they feared that the Croatian fraction of Bosnia would be annexed by Zagreb or secede to it.
At the moment, the Bosnian Croats are resisting the idea of creating "ethnic" municipalities, fearing that they will be dominated by the Muslims, who outnumber them. Senior Administration officials said the Bosnian Croats are seeking guarantees that their interests will be protected in areas where a Muslim population is predominant.
Muslims made up 44 percent of Bosnia's prewar population of 2.2 million, while the Serbs made up 31 percent and the Croats 17 percent. Vast shifts of refugees during the 22 months of fighting have made it difficult to update those estimates.
In some respects, Washington's plan resembles the now-defunct Vance-Owen plan, which sought to preserve the ethnic mix of the Bosnian state by dividing the country into 10 ethnically based provinces.
One idea under discussion is that the Muslim- and Croat-controlled territory be governed in a complex, three-layered arrangement. Each of the ethnic municipalities would have a local government; two higher governing bodies would represent all of the Muslim and all of the Croatian regions, and a unified federal government in Sarajevo.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Tudjman Seems Supportive
 ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 24 (AP) -- President Franjo Tudjman seemed to bow to international pressure this evening and to accept the idea of a Croat-Muslim state within Bosnia.
Embracing such an idea marks a sharp shift for Mr. Tudjman, who has long flirted with the idea of dividing Bosnia between Croats and Serbs without yielding Muslims any land.
He appeared to indicate in his speech that a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia would join in some way with Croatia. But a senior official in Washington said that an entire two-republic Bosnia, with separate Muslim-Croat and Serb areas, would have some sort of federation with Croatia.
"The international community is persuading us that the Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina should live together with the Muslims," Mr. Tudjman said. "The outcome of this could be federation of Muslims and Croats within Bosnia and federation with Croatia. This is acceptable to us."

GRAPHIC: Maps: "Visions of Peace vs. Bosnia's Reality" shows the following geographical representations of Bosnia and Herzegovina:
 
The Vance-Owen Plan
January to May 1993
 The first plan, drafted by the United Nations and the European Community, called for dividing of Bosnia into 10 semiautonomous provinces with a shared zone and weak central government in Sarajevo. It ultimately rejected by the Serbs.
 
The European Plan
July 1993 to February 1994
 The European Community proposed that Bosnia be divided into three republics along ethnic lines. The Muslim-led Government has rejected several drafts, demanding more land, several strategic towns and better access to ports on the Sava River and the Adriatic Sea.
 
Who Holds What Now
 Serbian forces have kept mainly Muslim towns in eastern, central and northwestern Bosnia under siege in recent months, while Muslims and Croats battle in the central and southwestern regions.

HEADLINE: For Lease: A Sweet Suite

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE 

 BODY:
The body is not quite cold yet, but already people are carefully examining the carcass of Shea & Gould, the large and influential New York law firm that announced last month that it was dissolving.
And what a carcass: nearly 220,000 square feet of custom-built space -- including conference center, law library, computer room, kitchens, mahogany work stations, custom lighting and 180 offices with a view -- spread over floors 42 through 46 at a prestigious Manhattan address, the former Exxon Building, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets. 
 "We have had more than 40 law firms and financial institutions looking at it as their potential home," said Barry Gosin, chief executive officer of Newmark & Company Real Estate Inc., the leasing agent for the building, which is owned by Mitsui Fudosan (New York).
Wendeen Eolis, chairwoman of Eolis International, a legal consulting firm, said: "Most law firms don't want to move right now; it's an expensive proposition, and they are only just recovering from a complex recession. But we've told any that do want to move that this space shouldn't be missed."
Thus far, Mr. Gosin said, seven law firms and three financial institutions have submitted bids for all or some of the space, which is leasing for "the low $40's" a square foot, a competitive price for that location. That would be about $10 million a year for the entire space, although it will probably be subdivided.
Mr. Gosin declined to name the bidders, saying only that they were "serious contenders" and not the "curiosity seekers who simply wanted to see how the space looked."

HEADLINE: Welfare Plan May Require New Taxes

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Finding it difficult to produce a welfare plan that could be financed through spending cuts alone, the Administration is contemplating tax increases, with gambling establishments among the targets, officials said today.
No decisions have been made on whether to propose the taxes. But the talk of taxes contradicts the Administration's previous contention that President Clinton can pay for his ambitious plan to change the welfare system simply by cutting other programs for low-income people. 
 The White House budget director, Leon E. Panetta, acknowledged today that a gambling tax was among the possibilities to supplement cuts in programs. "We're looking at 40 or 50 options and that's one of them," he said in an interview.
The search for possible tax increases is the latest turn in a scavenger hunt for money that has left Mr. Clinton with few happy alternatives. Democrats have denounced suggested program cuts as Draconian, while Republicans are quick to threaten a revolt over any tax increase.
 
Searching for Money
 "We haven't done a good job analyzing the political impact of any of these," said Mr. Panetta, speaking of potential taxes and program cuts.
As they search for money, officials also say they may take as long as a decade to phase in a new welfare program. This latest strategy is intended to avoid overburdening administrators, to reduce costs and to concentrate at first on the youngest mothers, who are at greatest risk of longterm dependency on welfare.
State officials have applauded the idea because they say they cannot instantly run a new program for millions of people.
But Mr. Panetta said the phase-in schedule was one of many important decisions that remain. "I don't think, frankly, right now we have a very good handle on the policy," he said.
Mr. Clinton's pledge to drastically change the welfare system was one of his most popular themes in the 1992 campaign, and he has vowed to send Congress a bill this spring. He said it would expand training opportunities for the five million families receiving welfare and then force those who were unemployed after two years on welfare to join a work program.
 
Rethinking the Financing
 The Administration has been drafting its welfare plan for almost a year, but a serious discussion of financing has begun just in the past month.
While officials did not previously rule out a tax, they did leave the impression that new taxes were not on the table. As recently as Friday, Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said that "welfare reform would be paid for by offsetting cuts in other programs."
Budget laws require any new spending to be offset with tax increases or corresponding cuts in entitlement programs. But the search for those cuts has proved difficult and put a group of Democrats in the unusual position of scouring the antipoverty programs they have spent the past decade defending.
The idea of supplementing program cuts with tax increases is being quietly encouraged by welfare officials who fear that cuts alone may go too deep.
 
$7 Billion in Possible Cuts
 In late January, the Department of Health and Human Services presented the White House with a list of six possible cuts, totaling about $7 billion.
Some of those remain under consideration, including reductions in a program aimed at preventing homelessness and cuts in benefits for legal immigrants. But others, like taxing welfare and food stamps, were publicly discarded after they drew fire from both Democrats and Republicans.
The talk of taxes is very sensitive, since Republicans in Congress are already threatening to block any such proposal and Mr. Clinton does not like to be reminded of his 1992 campaign pledge not to increase the tax burden on the middle class.
House Republicans have put forward their own plan to put welfare recipients in a work program after two years. But they would finance that plan by eliminating virtually all assistance to legal immigrants, a move the Democrats have called Draconian.
 
Gambling Tax
 Several of the tax measures that the Administration is considered involve gambling. One option is to place a new excise tax on some gambling establishments, like casinos and racetracks.
Administration officials said such a tax would probably exempt state lotteries and small charities, like church bingo games, and gambling operations on Native American reservations. They would not say how much money such a tax might raise.
A second gambling measure focuses on the enforcement of existing taxes, rather than on raising new ones. It would increase the amount of the tax, to 36 percent from 28 percent, that is automatically withheld when gamblers win more than $50,000. By withholding more money up front, the Administration hopes to reduce tax evasion.
Administration officials also acknowledged that the lists compiled by the Treasury Department included new taxes on alcoholic beverages, but they would not elaborate or say how likely they were to propose them. The Treasury Department also has a task force examining the earned-income tax credit, to see if savings are available from reducing fraud or abuse.
Bruce Reed, a co-chairman of the task force drafting Mr. Clinton's plan, said the likeliest option for phasing in changes would apply the time limit on welfare receipt only to mothers born after 1969, or perhaps 1972. That would target the youngest mothers, who are considered most likely to benefit from the training and work programs.
Under this scenario, about 1.3 million of the 5.4 million families expected to be on welfare in 1997 would be subject to the work requirements, with more being added each year.

 BODY:
No one wears or solicits credentials, so almost anyone can hang around the annual gatherings of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council, organized labor's 35-member ruling hierarchy, and bend the ears of the presidents of the nation's leading unions.
At this week's events, which end today, one visitor had gall enough to roam around the council's immense meeting room one day in the half- hour before the doors closed and business began. 
 The man was James P. Hoffa, a staff member of the Michigan teamsters's joint council who also happens to be the son of the late James R. Hoffa, one of a string of presidents of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to be imprisoned on corruption charges. Mob infiltration of the union, which flourished in the Hoffa era, was such that the federation ousted its biggest member union in 1957 and waited 30 years to re-admit it.
Today, the president of the teamsters is Ron Carey of Queens, who won the presidency three years ago after promising to rid the union of abuses. And it is Mr. Carey, not scions of the former leadership, who occupies the seat at the council table. So why was James P. here, natty in a green polo shirt and a blue blazer, stalking the halls of the Sheraton Bal Harbour?
"I'm down here to meet with all the delegates, especially the Michigan delegation," he said.
When told of Mr. Hoffa's explanation, Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the letter carriers union, said: "What delegation? There is no Michigan delegation."
In the way of an explanation, Mr. Sombrotto noted, "It's rumored he's positioning himself to run" for Mr. Carey's job in the 1996 union election.
"It's a possibility," Mr. Hoffa said. "I've not made any announcements."
For campaign positioning, however, this place would seem a barren venue. The only vote around was that of Mr. Carey.
 
Taking No Chances

In many ways, Mr. Carey cuts a very different figure among the 35 council members here. He never sheds his suit and tie, much less appears in a bathing suit, even though he was a star high school swimmer. He also refuses, unlike his peers, to take an ocean-front suite. Instead, he stays with friends in the area or at cheaper hotels nearby.
And he is the only council member who rarely takes a step without a companion. Mr. Carey's sidekick is Rick Blaylock, an amiable former coal miner and organizer, whose titles and functions include special assistant, field coordinator, driver, alter-ego and bodyguard.
Mr. Blaylock has the girth to stop a truck. Mr. Carey, who has had difficulty in fulfilling his promises to tame an entrenched stratum of mostly unelected old-guard regional officers, receives periodic death threats. "I'd say about two a month," he said.
Mr. Carey brought his two biggest current causes to the meeting to curry support of other unions and to draw news attention.
One was his complaint over the United Parcel Service's attempt to raise the weight limit of packages that workers had to lift, to 150 pounds from 70 pounds, resulting in a one-day strike earlier this month; the other, his long strike against Diamond Walnut, a growers cooperative in Stockton, Calif., where management has permanently replaced the strikers. The strike started in 1991 and continues today.
In the first case, he flew in 2 of 10 U.P.S. workers who had injured themselves lifting the bigger packages. And to put pressure on Diamond Walnut, he enlisted union leaders here to join a demonstration at an Entenmann's Bakery plant in Miami to persuade it to stop buying Diamond's walnuts.
As planned, he got himself arrested for trespassing, along with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, Lane Kirkland; the president of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers union, Frank L. Hurt, and a striker from Stockton, Frances Hatilano.
 
Renewal of Relevance

Of big American institutions, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s leadership is among the thinner skinned. Its members bristle over comments on the sex and age of the council members, nearly all male, white and past 60. They are even more annoyed by the drumbeat of reports of declining membership. Unions represent just 11.2 percent of the private sector work force and 15.8 percent of all workers.
For this week, however, the gloom dissipated, thanks partly to six sunny days as well as an unexpected deluge of Democrats seeking campaign support. If unions have lost some relevance in the economy, they retain it within the Democratic Party.
No one knew exactly how many came courting, but at least 30 or 40 -- and far more than veterans of these affairs could recall. Among them were Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bob Graham of Florida; Kathleen Brown, the California treasurer who is running for governor, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who is seeking re-election.
The only Republican sighting was that of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, who has a condominium nearby and was walking on the beach.
 
A Healthy Alliance

Organized labor and the Clinton Administration helped set this tranquil tone because they believe they really need each other in overhauling the health care system. "They're essential," Vice President Al Gore said of the unions during his stop here. "Organized labor are our key allies in this fight."
The struggle over health care has drowned out most of labor's rancor over the Administration's victory in the fight for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it is wrong to assume, some union leaders here said, that Democrats who voted for the agreement are home free.
The union's prime target appears to be Representative Jim Cooper, the Tennessee Democrat who has drawn up the leading alternative to President Clinton's health care proposal. He also was a supporter of Nafta. Unions think the Cooper proposal undermines the notion of universal coverage, a principal feature of the Clinton plan.
Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.2-million-member union of state, county and municipal employees, said he expected the members of his Memphis local to go after Mr. Cooper. "We've got some juice down there," he said, "and his record is very, very bad."

HEADLINE: Law Firms Begin Reining In Sex-Harassing Partners

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE 

 BODY:
Fourteen years ago the Federal Government adopted guidelines that encouraged employers to eliminate sexual harassment on the job. The guidelines promoted the ideal of a workplace free of hostility, and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations of them enhanced sex harassment suits' chances of success if defendant employers had no effective anti-harassment policy.
It was Government lawyers who wrote the guidelines, and it is private lawyers who have been advising employers on the implications ever since. But with a myopia variously attributed to arrogance, ignorance or innocence, most law firms themselves long declined, or simply neglected, to police sexual harassment in their own offices. Many simply had no written policy against it. 
 That has begun to change.
To be sure, it is still easy to find law firms whose female associates will speak -- not for attribution -- about the straying hand or the lewd aside of a male superior, and of fearing to turn in the offender.
 
Rainmakers Lose Immunity
 But specialists who track the progress of women in the profession agree that at a growing number of firms, the atmosphere of fear is receding. Even "rainmakers" -- those partners with a knack for luring lucrative clients -- are no longer necessarily immune from discipline for lavishing unwanted sexual attention on the women in the office.
"Law firms' policies used to be a one-paragraph boilerplate statement in a handbook no one read saying that 'sexual harassment won't be tolerated at this firm,' " said Freada Klein, president of Klein Associates, a Boston-based consulting company that helps employers deal with workplace bias. "That is starting to give way to detailed statements, offering examples of what constitutes sexual harassment and many options for dealing with it."
Although there are no comprehensive national statistics illustrating the trend, what numbers there are tend to confirm it.
Two months ago, for example, 73 percent of the lawyers responding to a survey by The National Law Journal said the firms where they worked had adopted detailed sexual harassment policies, almost double the 38 percent who so reported in a survey by the publication four years earlier.
The later survey, which drew responses from nearly 800 lawyers, both men and women, at more than 70 firms in 14 cities, also found that in most instances where a policy had been adopted, someone in the office had been specially designated to oversee it.
 
Costly Battlefield
 While there are a number of reasons for the change in environment, one overriding theme is firms' own self-interest.
First, events of the last few years, from the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings to a number of highly publicized suits against partners of leading law firms, have underscored the costliness, whether political or financial, of the sex harassment battlefield.
Lawyers who have defended firms or their partners against harassment suits say the cost of litigating, win or lose, easily exceeds half a million dollars. In the event of defeat, tack on a jury award that will amount to many thousands more. Last August, for instance, a Philadelphia jury found that Richard Glanton, a top rainmaker at Reed, Smith, Shaw & McClay, had "engaged in pervasive and regular sexually discriminatory conduct toward" a female associate, who as a result was awarded $125,000 in damages for defamation.
Negotiations now under way in one of two sex harassment suits against the venerable Chicago firm of Baker & McKenzie could make the Glanton verdict look like so much spare change. Those cases involve Martin Greenstein, a premier rainmaker at the firm's office in Palo Alto, Calif., who is accused of harassing a former associate there, Mary Rossman, as well as a former secretary, Rena Weeks. Mr. Greenstein has left the firm, and lawyers for all sides confirm that talks aimed at reaching a settlement in the Weeks case involve sums that are "substantial."
 
Women's Ranks Expand
 If firms needed yet further incentive for subduing harassment, they have found it: the evolving look within their own offices.
Fully a quarter of the nation's lawyers are now women, up from just 3 percent only two decades ago. More striking still, women will account for almost half of this year's law school graduates. And the best of them, eagerly recruited by leading firms, are not too shy to ask how they will be treated if they sign on.
The change of environment at law firms took its time in arriving. Indeed, with the steps that are only now becoming commonplace, the profession has generally lagged behind big employers as a whole by a decade or so.
"In a strange way, many lawyers saw themselves as above the law; these policies were for the hoi polloi, not for professionals like us," said Drucilla Ramey, executive director and general counsel of the Bar Association of San Francisco. "So they handled sexual harassment problems in a peculiarly poor way," which often meant not at all.
"It was like the cobbler's children who have no shoes," said Ron M. Green, a labor and employment lawyer at Epstein, Becker & Green in New York. "What lawyers forgot is that as partners in a law firm, they are regulated employers, not just owners of a business who can do what they want."
 
'Dead in the Water'
 Even now, few would contend that the profession is anywhere close to being harassment-free.
"At most small firms and a hefty number of mid-size ones, complaining about sexual harassment is not exactly a career-enhancing move," said another New York labor and employment lawyer, Rachel J. Minter. Many small firms have no sexual harassment policies at all, she said, and a medium-size firm may well depend on a large revenue earner or two and therefore feel compelled to protect them.
"These firms think that by having a policy, that will insulate them from liability," Ms. Minter said. "The reality is that you're generally dead in the water if you make a claim against a powerful partner at these places."
Several female associates at medium-size Manhattan firms, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed.
"I don't care what our sexual harassment policy says," said one such woman, who described how her supervisor, a senior partner, had touched her, subjected her to sexual jokes and made comments about her body. "It may protect me if I want to complain about an unimportant or unpopular partner, someone the firm would like to jettison anyway. But by attacking this firm's money earner, I would be jeopardizing the livelihood of everyone here. I'd never get away with it.
"And if I left, who would hire me? I'd be considered a troublemaker, and the job market out there still isn't that hospitable to troublemakers."
Further, lawyers who counsel victims of harassment say the increasing presence of women within firms' senior ranks does not always offer protection: some female partners have little sympathy for young associates, whom they perceive as either competitors or, in the event of a harassment complaint, predators -- a threat to the firm that feeds all of them.
 
One Risk, and Another
 Still, experts on women in the profession say that at most medium-size firms and particularly at larger ones, where the partners are many and their power more diffuse, harassed women now feel freer to complain. Ms. Klein, the Boston anti-bias consultant, said, "The risks to a firm's reputation of allowing a rainmaker to continue his harassing behavior are fast approaching the risks to the firm's finances of stopping him, including forcing an unrepentant harasser to resign."
Palmer & Dodge, a 160-lawyer firm in Boston, has even created the position of ombudsman to resolve sexual harassment complaints, the only law firm in the country to have done so.
The ombudsman, Elizabeth Walsh Pino, says that in the two years since her post was established, she has handled accusations against three partners, all by associates, and that the complaints have been handled firmly, quietly and to the satisfaction of all parties.
Sometimes the matter is resolved more firmly still. Although declining to name names, Mr. Green, the New York employment lawyer, says that with growing frequency he has seen partners -- even major billers -- suffer financial consequences for acting in inappropriate ways with young female associates: either their end-of-year compensation is reduced, or they must contribute to a settlement with the aggrieved woman. Occasionally the offender leaves the firm; many times he undergoes counseling as a requisite for staying.
 
Compelling Demographics
 "I'd love to say that we would discipline a partner because we want to do the right thing, and there is an element of that here," said Jane L. MacLennan, managing director of professional development at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in New York. "But there are also business and economic interests at stake. Certainly our law school recruitment levels would be affected, especially given the demographics of law school graduates."
Those demographics are compelling. Forty-four percent of this year's law graduates will be women, as against 4 percent in 1970, said Cory M. Amron, chairwoman of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession. And Colleen McMahon, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York, noted that even in the worst of economic times, leading firms compete for the best graduates from the best law schools.
"If almost half of those graduates are women, and the word gets out -- and it will get out -- that your firm is inhospitable to women, well, your recruitment efforts will be dead," said Ms. McMahon, who is also chairwoman of the New York City bar association's Committee on Women in the Profession.
One other place where women are becoming more populous is at the American corporation, as general counsel. Ms. Klein says that any number of these women were driven from law firms years ago by harassment or bias, and the significance of that is not lost on her. "Guess," she said, "who is hiring the outside counsel for their corporations."

HEADLINE: City Hall's Job Targets Center on Agency for Poor

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has identified many of the city jobs it hopes to eliminate by offering an ambitious severance package to employees beginning next month, and almost half of them would come out of the agency that serves New York City's poor, officials said yesterday.
About 3,600 of the jobs the administration plans to cut would fall in the Department of Social Services, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Those cuts would come on top of the 1,000 positions that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed eliminating when he unveiled his preliminary budget at the beginning of this month. Before the cuts the department had a total of 23,700 positions. 
 The administration also hopes to cut another 250 jobs from the Department of Parks and Recreation and about 700 more from the Department of Transportation, the officials said. In all, the Mayor plans to eliminate 7,600 municipal jobs under the severance package, a linchpin of his plan to close a $2.3 billion gap in the city's budget for the fiscal year that begins in July.
 
Goal of 15,000 Jobs
 Mr. Giuliani has vowed more than once that he would reduce the city's municipal work force by 15,000 jobs in all without causing a drastic impact on essential services. But officials said yesterday that the depth of the cuts raised questions about how that was possible.
"In some places agencies are already operating so close to the line that it makes it impossible not to have a significant impact on services," one agency official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The details also emerged as other officials and independent budget monitors have increasingly criticized the Mayor for exempting the Police Department, the Fire Department and teachers -- more than 110,000 employees in all -- from job cuts. Mr. Giuliani has insisted that his electoral mandate was to spare those employees.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who presented a highly critical response to the Mayor's preliminary budget yesterday, said the Mayor's plan was "a municipal version of trickle-down economics" and "inequitably targeted" city agencies.
"It's ridiculous to say the people who voted for him wanted fewer maintenance workers in their parks," Ms. Messinger said.
The Mayor's aides are still cobbling together the details of administration's severance proposal, including how large a payment the administration will offer to entice workers off the payroll, the budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, said yesterday. Top administration officials have said that if the severance package does not reduce the municipal work force enough, layoffs would be necessary.
 
Plan Could Collapse
 The administration has also not yet received the agreement of the Municipal Assistance Corporation to use a $200 million surplus to pay for the severance packages. Without that money, the plan would collapse.
Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said on Wednesday that the severance packages would include health benefits in addition to cash payments. Speaking at a breakfast forum, he said that extending benefits, possibly for as long as a year, was one of the "creative ideas" the administration learned after consulting with private companies that have used severance offers to cut jobs.
"Some people find that's a very good inducement," Mr. Powers said. "A lot of people would rather get less money and have their benefits extended over a period of time."
Randy Levine, the Commissioner of Labor, who will lead the administration's negotiations with the city's labor unions, said that the Mayor and his top aides would prepare an initial offer to present to the unions by next week. The administration plans to offer the severance packages during a three- or four-week period beginning in March.
One administration official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the administration wanted a concession from the unions that would allow more transfers of municipal employees from agency to agency. That, the official said, would allow the administration to fill positions considered essential that are vacated by workers who accept the severance package, thus easing the potential impact on services.
The roughly 7,500 jobs targeted for elimination in the severance plan would be in addition to the 4,089 the Mayor identified in his preliminary budget plan. Most of those would be eliminated by not filling existing vacancies. The remainder of the 15,000 jobs are expected to come from the Board of Education, which has been told to reduce administrators at its headquarters by 2,500, and by attrition.
 
Extended Deadlines
 The Mayor's budget officials required the city's agencies to submit their targets by yesterday. Some agencies, however, have had problems identifying expendable jobs, officials said, and have been given an extension until Monday, including the Department of Homeless Services, which has a total of 3,200 jobs in the city's shelters.
In addition to the targeted cuts of 3,600 jobs at the Department of Social Services, the administration wants to remove 275 jobs from the Department of Health, 191 from the Department of Environmental Protection, 258 from the Department of Santitation and 331 from the Department of Corrections.
Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens' Budget Commission, a nonprofit fiscal monitor whose proposals have received support from Mr. Giuliani, said yesterday that the administration could ease the potential impact of the job cuts by spreading them across a wider pool.
Mr. Giuliani has remained steadfast, however.
"I ran for Mayor with the clear understanding that the priority would be public safety," Mr. Giuliani said this week. "It would be crazy for me to cut the Police Department."

HEADLINE: 7 Companies May Back A South African Code

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Seven major American multinational companies, uncertain what will be expected of them after the South African elections this spring, are considering support for a new code of corporate conduct being developed by South African churches.
The seven -- Borden, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Colgate-Palmolive, Ingersoll-Rand, International Paper, Kimberly-Clark and Pfizer -- all indicated a willingness to talk with the South Africans about how they could help put the code into practice, according to the Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based organization that coordinates stockholder activities by church groups. 
 In return, the Interfaith Council, which had placed shareholder resolutions concerning South Africa on the agendas of the companies' annual meetings this year, said yesterday that it was withdrawing those resolutions.
The 10-point code contains broadly worded provisions on equal opportunity and affirmative action programs, training and education, labor union rights, community relations, consumer protection, environmental practices and support for local black-owned businesses. It also assumes, but does not spell out, a system to monitor each company's adherence to the code.
"At this point, several different models are being discussed and no one has been asked to endorse a monitoring system or to pay anything to develop one," said Donna Katzin, director of the Interfaith Council's South Africa program.
 
Reasons for Corporate Support
 One reason the companies are showing interest in the code is their belief that it will have wide backing in South Africa and may serve as an alternative to harsher legislation.
In addition, many of them believe that a code developed by South Africans would be applied to all multinational companies, creating a more level playing field than existed in the 1980's, when they were under greater pressure from advocacy groups and politicians in the United States to actively fight apartheid than were their European and Japanese competitors.
Monitoring is the major point of contention. Church groups and some other investors eager to support South Africa's move to majority rule want a system that will allow them to grade corporate behavior. The companies endorse the goals in the South African churches' code and similar codes developed by South African unions and the African National Congress, saying their own performance in recent years has exemplified what the codes call for.
But they want to be free of reporting responsibilities that they feel will add unnecessary costs to their operations, and some companies have come out against the codes.
"It's another layer of costly reporting that would be superfluous," said Richard Kryzanowski, general counsel of the Crown Cork and Seal Company, which along with the United Technologies Corporation has decided to oppose shareholder resolutions calling for support of the code.
 
A Cost of Doing Business
 Most multinational companies that stayed in South Africa have contended with performance ratings, which they considered burdensome and hoped to see disappear after the elections on April 27. The ratings began in 1977 when 12 American companies embraced a code of conduct developed by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, who believed that American companies could undermine the apartheid system by supporting economic and educational opportunities for blacks.
Eventually, more than 190 companies endorsed the Sullivan Principles. The endorsers submitted annual data on their treatment of ethnic and racial minorities, community investment and other matters to Arthur D. Little Inc., which was retained to rate them. Starting in 1985, those that did not submit the data and had more than 25 employees were required by a Presidential order to make similar reports to the State Department.
In 1987, Mr. Sullivan moved away from his earlier set of principles, advocating corporate divestiture to fight apartheid. An Industrial Support Unit, set up by companies determined to keep the Sullivan Principles alive, now has just 55 members and is scheduled to dissolve after April 27.
The State Department program could also be dismantled if President Clinton determines that the election was free and fair.

HEADLINE: Beyond Budget Debate Hyperbole

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Balancing the Federal budget by the beginning of the 21st century, as the Constitutional amendment now before the Senate would require, would not be easy.
It could not be accomplished, as some conservative advocates of the amendment seem to believe, simply by eliminating wasteful programs, by placing a cap on Government benefits and by cracking down on welfare cheats. And it could not be done, as some liberal supporters seem to think, just by raising taxes on the wealthy and slashing spending at the Pentagon. 
 Balancing the budget would probably take all those steps and much, much more. The amendment would not say how the goal should be accomplished.
Presidents and Congresses could resort to accounting devices to ease the pain. The basic balanced budget amendment before the Senate would preclude exempting certain programs like Social Security or the military or establishing a separate capital budget. Yet other creative methods could probably be found to make the budget appear in balance when it really is not.
 
Onus on Middle Class
 But if the policy makers are serious about spending no more than the revenues the Government brings in each year, the middle class would have to pay for it. It would probably mean that working American families earning, say, $30,000 or $35,000 a year and struggling to make ends meet would have to give up an additional 5 percent or more of their income each year in higher taxes and reduced Government benefits they receive.
Still, a balanced budget would not necessarily have all the Draconian effects that Clinton Administration officials have suggested.
It would not have to mean, for instance, that Social Security and Medicare benefits would be reduced by more than $1,000 for each retiree. Or that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would lose 2,000 agents. Or that 26 percent fewer research grants at the National Institutes of Health would be issued. Or that burial in national cemeteries would be denied 14,000 veterans a year. Or that 600,000 more military and civilian jobs would be lost at the Defense Department.
Nor would it have to mean that New York State would be hit with $14 billion to $16 billion a year in higher taxes and reduced services or that Connecticut would be hit with up to $3.4 billion and New Jersey with up to $7.1 billion.
 
Selective Cuts
 Those estimates by various Cabinet members last week were based on the notion that taxes would be raised and spending cut evenly across the board to reach the $600 billion in total deficit reduction that would be needed over the next seven years to bring the budget into balance. Presumably, the President and Congress could be more selective than that.
But while the Administration officials may have engaged in hyperbole in their specifics, their point is on the mark. There is no way to balance the budget without enacting measures that would be enormously unappealing politically -- so unpopular, in fact, that they could cost the politicians who support them their jobs.
The most credible plan put forward to balance the budget by the beginning of the next decade was described by Peter G. Peterson in his new book, "Facing Up: How to Rescue the Economy from Crushing Debt and Restore the American Dream" (Simon & Schuster, 1993).
Mr. Peterson, who has become something of a public scold on the evils of a budget deficit, was Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon Administration. He is now an investment banker in New York and president of the Concord Coalition, a group that lobbies to reduce the deficit.
 
Test of Affluence
 He would subject all Federal benefits, including Social Security, to what he calls an affluence test. The higher one's income, the less one receives. Only retirees with incomes below $35,000 a year would be spared.
Among other proposals, Mr. Peterson would also raise the retirement age to 68 from 65, substantially increase the out-of-pocket share of medical expenses the elderly pay under Medicare, require income taxes to be paid on a portion of Medicare benefits, reduce military spending and sharply cut aid to farmers.
And there would be big new taxes under his plan: a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax and a 5 percent national tax on retail sales. He would raise billions in new revenue by limiting the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and employer-paid health insurance premiums.
These measures would mean that on average, families with incomes above $20,000 a year would have their incomes cut by 4 percent or 5 percent because of higher taxes or lost Government benefits. Mr. Peterson calculates that the average loss to a family with an income between $30,000 and $40,000 would be $1,817.
 
Well-Off and Elderly
 The elderly, perhaps the single most powerful lobbying force in the country, would be hit hardest. Mr. Peterson writes, "If one group (the nonpoor elderly) bears a somewhat disproportionate share of the sacrifice in my plan, it's because they now receive a vastly disproportionate share of our public largess."
Such a policy might be political suicide for those who voted for it. But every realistic plan for balancing the budget involves sweeping new taxes and deep cuts in sacred cows like Social Security and Medicare.
Politicians who want a balanced budget do not have to accept Mr. Peterson's new taxes, but if they reject them, they must have a better idea for picking up the $204 billion Mr. Peterson's taxes would raise in 2001. And they may object to trims in Social Security and Medicare. But where else would they get deficit reductions worth nearly $90 billion a year by the turn of the century?
This is why Ronald Reagan and George Bush, both of whom advocated a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget, never said what specific steps they would take to reach the goal. It is also the reason no member of this Congress has said how he or she would achieve a balanced budget. The ways to get there from here are impossible for an elected politician to fathom.
 
Will Nature Cooperate?
 The fact is, a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is like an amendment guaranteeing that the catastrophe caused by the flood of the Mississippi River last summer will never recur. Perhaps billions of dollars should be spent to make sure the levees hold the next time the river rises. Perhaps thousands of families should be relocated from the flood plain. Absent specific solutions like that, a Constitutional amendment would be meaningless.
The balanced budget amendment's sponsors say it would put pressure on the Government to find ways to bring its accounts into balance.
But Mr. Peterson is ambivalent about that argument. "Its great virtue would be its symbolism," Mr. Peterson writes. "But we must be aware that in that very symbolism there is also a danger. It might persuade us to think we have solved our problem and thus divert our attention from the real business at hand: making choices."

HEADLINE: Albany Tries Putting Minds Over Other Matters;
With New Slogan, New York Attempts to Sell Itself as the Home of Intelligent Workers

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
It won't replace "I love New York," that's for sure.
But from the people who brought you New York's venerable tourist slogan, here's a new one meant to appeal to business: "I.Q.NY: A State of Minds." 
 Get it? Gov. Mario M. Cuomo yesterday unveiled the twist on the state's famous "I<heart>NY" logo as part of an initial $3 million advertisting campaign to trumpet what government officials see as one of New York's greatest economic virtues: its intellectual resources and many knowledgeable workers.
"In this business, if you don't blow your own horn, there's no music," Governor Cuomo said at a breakfast meeting at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan.
Many states, particularly in the South and West, have long marketed themselves as good places to do business. Much of their effort was aimed at luring companies from New York and other states in the Northeast, which have often suffered from an anti-business reputation because of higher taxes, costly regulations and an aging infrastructure.
Now New York, battered by a recession and job losses worse in this region than in most other parts of the country, is trying to fight back. Following in the footsteps of Connecticut and Massachusetts in particular, New York will tout itself to business executives in national newspapers and magazines and on television and radio spots that will mostly be broadcast in the New York region. "New York State is pro-actively pro-business, and we want everyone to know it," said Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development. "It's a smart place to set up shop."
The campaign, the first of its kind for New York, is sponsored by the Alliance for a New New York, an association created last year by 11 major public utilities and the state government to attract new business to New York and convince companies already in the state to stay.
The campaign is scheduled to get under way on March 7 around New York City and on March 21 elsewhere in the state. National advertising will also begin next month, and some international advertising is planned. Companies that respond to the ads will be told about an array of economic development programs run by the state and its utilities.
The utilities are putting up most of the money to kick off the campaign, which could cost as much as $5 million a year over the next few years.
 
Smug Responses?
 State officials in Hartford and Trenton, long at odds with Albany in the intra-regional struggle for jobs, tweaked New York for jumping on the pro-business bandwagon after them.
"I get a kick out of this," said Alan Steinberg, the new Assistant Commissioner for Economic Development in New Jersey, which is now thinking about ways to follow up on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's statement in her inaugural address that the state is "open for business."
"Governor Cuomo is now singing our song that state government should look at business as a friend, not an enemy to be taxed and regulated to death," Mr. Steinberg said.
After Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. took office more than three years ago in Connecticut, the state began its first campaign to overcome an image as hostile to business with the slogan, "The New Connecticut: Jobs Are Our First Order of Business." Now Hartford is phasing that logo out, replacing it with a more recent business drive underwritten by its utilities and the state government: "Connecticut: The State That Thinks Like a Business."
"We like to think we've been ahead of other states in the region," said Joseph M. Cohen, spokesman for Connecticut's Department of Economic Development. To bolster its claim, he said, the state cut sales taxes, pared several business taxes and took steps to reduce red tape and ease workers compensation expenses.
 
A Swedish Start
 The "I.Q.NY" slogan and the campaign built around it were created by Anderson & Lembke, an advertising firm that originated in Sweden, first set up shop in the United States in Stamford, Conn., and then moved its American headquarters to New York City. "They proved themselves in Triple A ball," Governor Cuomo said. "Now they've come to the major leagues."
It does not take a genius to figure out that the heart of the marketing campaign is the not-so-subtle suggestion that New York attracts many of the best brains in the country. And it probably does not hurt that the campaign employs a little flattery of companies already here in its approach. "Even the dumbest person wants to think of himself as smart," the Governor said.
There is evidence, though, to back up the campaign's theme. Workers in New York are, on average, almost 20 percent more productive than the national average, according to state officials, who say that New Yorkers are typically better educated and more involved in cutting-edge business activities than employees elsewhere.

Stocks Fall On Fears of Rate Rise

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS 

 BODY:
The growing conviction that interest rates in the United States will continue to rise pushed world stock markets down yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 51.78 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 3,839.90.
In Europe, the slides were steeper. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index in London fell 2.23 percent, or 74.4 points, to 3,267.5, its biggest one-day drop in 16 months. Stocks also fell more than 2 percent in Sweden and Switzerland. 
 On the Paris Bourse, the CAC 40 index fell 1.94 percent, or 43.71 points, to 2,208.29, while in Germany the Dax index fell 1.76, or 37.38 points, to 2,090.29.
"It's mostly interest rates," said William Lord, a trader at UBS Securities, referring to recent jumps in both long-term and short-term interest rates in the United States. "That's where all the volatility is coming from."
 
More Rate Rises Expected

 
 Since the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target to 3.25 percent from 3.00 percent Feb. 4, long-term rates have jumped four-tenths of a percentage point. These increases, along with the expectation that the Fed will soon raise short-term rates again, is unnerving the bond market here and, in turn, the stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq combined index suffered declines similar to the Dow's fall.
And European investors worry that a sharp downturn in the American markets would have a ripple effect there.
In Europe, traders said, disappointment that short-term interest rates are not falling faster there made the stock market declines much sharper.
Michael Metz, market strategist for Oppenheimer & Company, said he saw far broader problems. "There's a worldwide meltdown in the bond markets of leveraged positions," he said. "And remember that most of the money that came into the stock market was searching for yield."
 
'It's Ominous'

 
 That meant, Mr. Metz said, that the higher yields now in the bond market could draw money out of equities and "give the stock market a real problem."
Mr. Metz also noted that the Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodities prices rose 91 cents yesterday and that the outlook for oil prices was higher, "both negative developments for the stock markets." "It's ominous," he concluded.
A day after the failure of the largest attempted merger in history, the $33 billion deal between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., the aftershock barely made the trading Richter scale. While shares of cable companies and their suppliers slipped, those of telephone companies were mixed, and no broad impact was discernible, traders said.
After the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders rose 3.7 percent in January, largely because of aircraft orders, bond yields began to climb. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond climbed to 6.74 percent, from 6.65 percent at Wednesday's close.
As rates rose, the Dow began to slide, and by noon was off more than 40 points. In the next 100 minutes it regained nearly 30 points, then zigzagged downward for the balance of afternoon. At 3:33 P.M., the Dow was off 50 points, and the New York Stock Exchange imposed a "collar," putting the brakes on index arbitrage trading to contain volatility.
Dragging down the Dow were Caterpillar, which fell 2, to 108 5/8; General Electric, also down 2 to 105 3/8; Allied Signal, down 1 3/8, to 77, and General Motors, down 7/8, to 59. In fact, only three of the 30 industrials avoided a loss yesterday.
Other big losers were Royal Dutch Petroleum, down 3 3/4, to 103 1/2; Motorola, down 2 7/8, to 103, and CNA Financial, the big insurer, which ended down 5 3/4, at 72 1/4, after it was announced that it would be dropped from the S.& P. 500 to make way for Keycorp.
 The S.& P. 500 ended at 464.26, down 6.43 points, or 1.37 percent, while the Nasdaq combined index was down 1.23 percent, or 9.67 points, to 779.44.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 342.9 million shares, up from 309.9 million on Wednesday and 270.9 million on Tuesday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing stocks by a 4-to-1 ratio.
One conspicuous exception was Bell Atlantic, whose shares rose 1 3/4, to 54 1/2, with 1.9 million shares changing hands, a day after it called off its planned merger with Tele-Communications and Liberty Media.
 
Debris From a Wrecked Merger

 
 By contrast, Tele-Communications, left to face growing concern in Congress and the Federal Communications Commission about cable television, saw its class A shares fall 1 7/8, to 22 3/8, in the day's heaviest Nasdaq trading. Liberty Media's class A shares fell just 5/8, to 22 1/2, but its preferred shares tumbled 16 1/2, to 75.
Shares of Cablevision Systems, another cable television company, fell 5 1/4, to 62 1/4, on the American Stock Exchange. General Instrument, which makes cable television equipment, plunged 6 1/8 in heavy trading, to 44 5/8, after Tele-Communications said it would cut its spending. More than 4.5 million shares were traded, 10 times the stock's average daily volume. Cowen & Company also lowered its rating of General Instrument shares to "hold" from "strong buy."
Shares of Scientific-Atlanta, which also makes set-top cable boxes, fell 2 3/8, to 26.
Oracle Systems was another casualty of the failed merger. Shares of the company, which is creating the software that will be used to store movies and distribute them over phone and cable lines as video-on-demand services, fell 1 1/4, to 32 1/4.
In a generally weak technology sector, one winner was Novell, which makes networking software for personal computers, whose shares rose 1, to 24 5/8, after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and several analysts raised their ratings on the stock.
But Microsoft's shares slid 1 1/8, to 79 7/8, a day after it lost a patent infringement case and was ordered to pay a $120 million judgment to Stac Electronics. Stac's shares soared 2 1/8, or 48.6 percent, to 6 1/2, in heavy Nasdaq trading.

Interest Rates Surge on Pace of Economic Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates surged again yesterday as traders and investors continued to worry about the steady pace of economic growth and inflation. But the Federal Reserve tried to play down their concerns.
Long-term interest rates jumped to an eight-month high, with the yield on the 30-year bond finishing at 6.73 percent. Shorter-term rates also shot higher, with the yield on the three-year note at 5.07 percent, its highest since December 1992. 
 "Bond investors are growing a little concerned, while the Government is off saying there's nothing to worry about," said Roger W. Marshall, president and managing director of the Riggs Investment Management Corporation in Washington. "More and more, investors are coming around to realize that the last quarter-point increase by the Fed was a token gesture and nothing to make any real impact on the economy."
In an effort to cut off a jump in inflation before it began, the Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates to 3.25 percent from 3 percent on Feb. 4. But rather than reassuring traders and investors, the move seemed to create new concern about inflation, and long-term interest rates have jumped almost half a percentage point since then.
The Commerce Department report yesterday that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods increased 3.7 percent in January, the sixth straight advance, did not help calm inflation concerns because it signaled that the economy is still growing at a steady pace that could eventually push prices higher. [Page D2.]
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, apparently did not have a soothing impact, either. He repeated his recent assertions that there was no near-term threat of a jump in inflation.
In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan was asked if it was true that he saw no significant inflationary pressures in the economy. "That is correct," he replied.
By late in the day the Treasury 30-year bond was trading at a price of 9327/32 , down 11/32 , to yield 6.73 percent, up from 6.64 percent on Wednesday. This is the second time in a week that the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped this much in one day.
"For a pre-emptive strike, which one correlates with a stronger move, it was a wimp gesture," said Barbara L. Kenworthy, a portfolio manager for taxable fixed-income funds for the Dreyfus Corporation, of the Fed's quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. "Had the Fed raised rates earlier and to a greater extent, we would not be where we are today," she said.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said the market's unraveling yesterday began with the release of the durable-goods report. He said the 3.7 percent increase in orders might have appeared stronger than it really was.
"However, the trend was up and I expect it will continue up," he said. Some traders viewed the increase as resulting entirely from the volatile sectors of transportation, up 23.9 percent, and defense, up 25.3 percent. And they said the odds were low that the durable goods report would be a reason for another jump in short-term interest rates by the Fed.
 
'Grizzly Running Amok'
 By the time that yesterday's five-year Treasury note auction was priced, the market had stabilized somewhat. But Mr. Fine said that it appeared that bond dealers were not able to entice enough investors into buying at the auction, so selling resumed in the afternoon. "It was like a grizzly running amok," Mr. Fine said.
The five-year note at auction was priced to yield 5.61 percent, or 51 basis points higher than at the last auction, another sign of how much the interest-rate environment has changed in only a month. In late when-issued trading, dealers had lowered the price and raised the yield to 5.65 percent to attract more buyers. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Marshall of Riggs noted that Mr. Greenspan was not alone in trying to reassure the bond market on inflation. He said Robert D. McTeer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, was also trying to calm the waters, saying long-term interest rates were likely to come back down and that the bond market overreacted to the tightening and will reverse itself.
Mrs. Kenworthy of Dreyfus said she thought the selloff may have gone too far. "This may afford some investors a buying opportunity," she said.
MMS International, an economic analysis firm, said the Fed continued to stress the proactive nature of its current policy tact, "and we expect this message to eventually be driven home with the bond market, such that the last interest hike will ultimately be appreciated by the long end of the market."
The following are the results of auction for the new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Increase, But Effect Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In a report less robust than it appeared at first glance, orders for long-lasting manufactured goods increased 3.7 percent in January, the biggest of six straight advances, Commerce Department figures showed today.
But while the rise surpassed expectations, analysts noted that the strength was highly concentrated in civilian and military aircraft, which involve long lead times in development and production, and that orders for durable goods were up just three-tenths of 1 percent when the transportation industry was excluded. 
 "There is no reason to think the economy is accelerating further," said David Orr, chief economist for the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C. The Commerce Department report showed manufacturing to be firm, but not likely to reignite inflation, he added.
Today's report was presumably welcomed by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who in House testimony on Tuesday made an unusually specific reference to a coming economic indicator.
"Anecdotal evidence does indicate continued underlying strength in manufacturers' new orders and production," Mr. Greenspan told a banking subcommittee, "but we will have a better reading on new orders on Thursday."
Still, many traders and investors interpreted today's durable goods report as another sign that economic growth continued to move ahead at a strong pace. This contributed to a another drop in bond prices, pushing up interest rates.
 
Increase in Jobless Claims
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 25,000 last week, to 385,000, increasing the four-week moving average to 378,000. This was the seventh increase in the latest eight weeks and brought the average to its highest level since October 1992.
Analysts had expected a modest decline in claims last week but cautioned that these statistics were subject to unusually big gyrations because of the California earthquake and the severe weather elsewhere.
Still, some analysts suspected the job market might be sagging again after a few months of clear recovery. Pointing to the deteriorating trend in benefits claims so far this year, Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said economic growth depends heavily on gains in productivity and that "labor market conditions remain sluggish."
The bright side, at least to the Federal Reserve, is that upward pressure on wages should remain minimal, Mr. Straszheim added.
And while orders for durable goods advanced in January, shipments fell for the first time since July, the Commerce Department found. Bad weather was a factor in this decline of four-tenths of 1 percent and also in a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in unfilled orders, the first such increase since February 1993.
New orders for aircraft and, to a much lesser extent, motor vehicles drove transportation orders up last month $5 billion, or 13.9 percent, to a level almost one-third above that of January 1993, the report showed. And orders for electronics and electrical equipment increased $1.4 billion, or 6.5 percent. But orders for industrial machinery and equipment slipped 2.6 percent, the first decline since June, and primary metals eased two-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Insistently Optimistic
 Nonetheless, analysts remained generally optimistic about the economy. "When you get six straight months in the same direction, it's telling you something," said James W. Coons, economist at the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, referring to the often-gyrating orders report. "The fact that orders moved up yet again is very encouraging."
But Mr. Coons said that bond traders might be worrying as much about tensions with Japan as about an overheating economy, the fear being that a reduction in the Japanese surplus means a reduction in dollars available to buy American securities.
Overall orders for durable goods in capital-goods industries surged 8.5 percent last month, but without military products, this gain was cut to 5.9 percent, the report showed. And when aircraft and parts were also removed, the increase was transformed into a 6.7 percent decline.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft are a widely followed indicator because it shows how much companies are investing in new facilities, a process that helps sustain economic momentum in the short run, and by raising capacity, tends to keep a lid on inflation.
Total orders for durable goods last month were $147.87 billion, a 3.7 percent increase that followed gains of 2.1 percent and 2.2 percent in December and November, respectively.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Brazil's Market Boom Is Not for Faint-Hearted

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After Brazil's stock markets more than doubled last year, analysts warned investors to proceed with caution in 1994.
So much for the experts. 
 The stock exchange in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest, kept climbing and is up 55 percent since Jan. 1, making it one of the world's hottest markets this year. Now the Sao Paulo and Rio exchanges are Latin America's fastest-growing stock markets, attracting foreign investment at the rate of $1 million an hour.
Cheap stocks, an American passion for emerging markets and a recovery for Latin America's largest economy are making Brazil's markets boom.
 
 
'Significant Earnings'
 From an anemic volume of $16 million in daily trading three years ago, the Sao Paulo exchange now has daily trading volumes averaging $350 million. In the same three-year span, Telebras, the state-controlled telephone company and the exchange's most heavily traded stock, has appreciated 1,500 percent in dollar terms. "In the short term, this could be a bubble that comes down," said Wayne A. Perkins, vice president for equity investment at Chemical Bank's affiliate here, Banco Norchem S.A. "But in the medium and long term, Brazil can't fight world history. There will be significant earnings coming out of this country in a few years."
Not for the faint-hearted, however. Brazilian markets are notorious for their volatility. Over the last five years, Brazil's roller-coaster markets have suffered 50 percent drops on four occasions, said Stephen Rose, president of Stephen Rose & Partners, a London brokerage firm specializing in Brazil's markets.
One news weekly, Manchete, reflecting widespread distrust among local investors, said, "Stock Markets: At the moment of decision, all caution is too little."
Indeed, stocks could skid this fall, experts say, when portfolio managers often sell to take year-end profits. Markets may also get the jitters if political polls strongly favor Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a Socialist labor leader, in Brazil's October presidential election.
Still, many analysts interviewed this week predicted continued growth. Latin America's other major markets have maintained their levels since the growth spurts of the early 1990's. In Brazil, many analysts believe that the current run-up is for real.
"The market could grow another 100 percent in 1994," said Roberto Serwaczak, director of sales and trading in Sao Paulo for Baring Securities do Brasil. Of Brazil's nine exchanges, Sao Paulo accounts for 85 percent of trades, while Rio lags behind with 12 percent.
The fashion for emerging markets has put Brazil, with an economy 50 percent larger than Mexico's, firmly in the sights of overseas portfolio managers.
"The Brazilian market is the cheapest in Latin America," said Tamzin Hobday, director of Latin American research for Baring Securities Inc. in New York. "Last year, we saw a lot of money going to Southeast Asia. This year, we should see a lot of that money going into Latin America."
Based on Baring's analysis of the ratio of stock market prices to the book value of the shares, Brazilian equities average a bargain basement 0.8. Elsewhere in Latin America, by contrast, countries that have already undergone stock market booms have ratios that are much more pricey: 4.5 for Chile and Peru, 3.4 for Argentina and 3.1 for Mexico.
Growth stocks for 1994 could include Telebras; Marco Polo, a bus manufacturer, and private steel companies like Usiminas and Acesita. Because Brazilian banks usually profit handsomely from high inflation, which Brazil has had in spades, analysts recommend buying Banco National, Bradesco and Itau. Last year, Brazil's inflation rate was a stunning 2,500 percent.
Only four years after opening Brazil's markets to foreign investors, about 1,000 foreign mutual funds invest here, estimated Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. For American investors, popular funds include the Brazil Fund, and the Brazilian Equities Fund, both of which hit their 52-week highs this month and are trading at double or better than their prices a year ago.
Foreign investors, overwhelmingly American, are encouraged by the general direction of Brazil, a capitalist behemoth with an economy larger than Russia's.
Despite a recent radical cut in import tariffs to an average of 14 percent, Brazilian industry has proved to be agile and competitive. Brazil's imports surged 25 percent last year, to $26 billion. Nevertheless, an increasingly efficient export sector gave Brazil a $13 billion trade surplus.
Over all, Brazil's economy grew by 5 percent, the highest since 1986. Industrial productivity in Sao Paulo grew by 6 percent, and foreign car makers announced plans to invest $1 billion a year through 1997. Brazilian businessmen formed almost half a million new companies last year, 15 percent over the 1992 level.
"Brazil's problem is not the private sector," Mr. Vidigal of the Sao Paulo exchange said. "Brazil's problem is the public sector."
A modest privatization program is picking away at a huge state sector. This year, the Government is to auction off 32 midsized companies, largely petrochemical producers. With no company expected to sell for over $100 million, the list leaves untouched the three sacred cows of Brazil's state sector -- Telebras; Petrobras, the state oil company, and Electrobras, the state electric company. In March, Congress is to start reviewing Brazil's constitution, a process which could lead to the privatization of these state monopolies.
Brazil's small investors hold only $1.2 billion in local mutual funds -- 1 percent of the $120 billion held nationally in savings accounts. Because of this lack of liquidity, the huge presence of foreign money could moderate future downswings.
"It would be very difficult for domestic savings to absorb the foreign investments," said Daniel Dantas, managing director of Banco Icatu, a private investment bank here. "So, in fact, the aggregate of foreign investment is making a long-term comittment to Brazil, even if the individual portfolio managers do not have that intention."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Drops Sharply; Gold Loses $1.30 an Ounce

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped sharply yesterday, hurt by a selloff on Wall Street and fresh indications that the Clinton Administration wants the dollar to weaken against the Japanese yen.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.95 yen, down from 105.65 yen on Wednesday. 
 Gold prices also declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery lost $1.30 an ounce to settle at $377.60.
Currency analysts said the dollar had initially advanced after the Commerce Department said orders for goods lasting three or more years had surged in January.
But foreign exchange traders began selling the dollar when the Federal Reserve failed to nudge up interest rates in response to the data on durable goods, contrary to expectations. Higher rates make dollar-denominated investments worth more.
Dollar selling intensified as investors moved out of stocks and bonds because they continued to be worried about inflation, despite reassurances by the Fed.
"The lower stock and bond markets contributed to the selling pressure we saw in the dollar during the day," said John Nelson, director of foreign exchange for the New York branch of Barclays Bank P.L.C.
Others ascribed some of the dollar's weakness to remarks by Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen before a meeting of finance ministers from the richest industrial nations in Frankfurt this weekend.
 
News Reports Denied
 Mr. Bentsen denied Japanese news reports that the United States wanted an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar, about 5 yen higher than its current level. He also said he would meet separately with his Japanese counterpart, Hirohisa Fujii, but gave no indication of any new policy initiatives.
Talks between Washington and Tokyo on reducing Japan's trade surplus collapsed earlier this month. After that, the dollar had weakened against the yen, as traders feared Washington would seek to depress the dollar's value against the yen to reduce the imbalance. That would make Japanese goods more expensive in the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Had January Surplus

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Government took in $15.61 billion more than it spent in January, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.
The surplus in January was not as large as in January 1993, when there was a $29.82 billion surplus. But it was a sharp reversal from December's deficit of $8.25 billion. 
 In the first four months of the 1994 fiscal year, which will end on Sept. 30, the total deficit has fallen by 16 percent, to a total of $76.44 billion, from $90.65 billion in the comparable four months of the 1993 fiscal year.
One factor that helped January's numbers was a speed-up of payments scheduled for Jan. 1 to members of the military and to some Social Security recipients. The payments were made in December instead of January, which had the effect of keeping January's spending down.
The Clinton Administration estimated on Feb. 7 that the total deficit would fall in the current fiscal year to $234.8 billion from $254.7 billion last year.
In January, the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to oversee the bailout of ailing savings and loan institutions, took in $74 million by selling off assets of savings and loans it had taken over. That contrasted with spending of $2.47 billion by the agency in December.
Interest payments on the public debt cost the Government $17.9 billion in January. But that was down from $52.71 billion it paid in December and from the $18.1 billion paid in January 1993.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Major Discontent

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The Conservative Party has been in power in Britain for nearly 15 years now, and it is showing the inevitable signs of that long a hold on office: weariness, stumbling, public disaffection. Many feel about Prime Minister John Major and his Government what Oliver Cromwell said to the Rump Parliament in 1653:
"You have sat here too long for any good you have done. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" 
 In a poll last month, more than two-thirds of those asked said they were dissatisfied with Mr. Major. Only about 15 percent thought the Government was doing a good job.
A particularly grim sign for Mr. Major is the contemptuous tone of pro-Conservative newspapers. The weightiest of Rupert Murdoch's, The Sunday Times, said this week that the Major Government "singularly lacks the country's confidence."
What Mr. Major hoped would be a winning new political slogan, "Back to Basics," has become a public joke. It suggested a return to moral values, but over the last two months a series of Tory members of Parliament, some in the Government, have been caught out in sex scandals.
That may be regarded as bad luck. But the Government has legislative troubles that are a matter not of luck but of ineptitude.
A tough-sounding crime bill should have been popular, since crime is a worrying issue here as in the United States. But it was drafted to centralize police powers in political hands, and that outraged the police. Key clauses were thrown out by the usually compliant House of Lords.
Conservatives pride themselves as being the low-tax party, but tax rates are now actually above the levels in the last Labor Government. A further jump in April will have the average family paying $35 a week more than a year earlier: a savage increase.
The country is just inching its way painfully out of a long recession. Unemployment remains high. In the 15 years of Tory Government, Britain has had the lowest economic growth of any of the industrialized countries.
Then there's foreign policy. Mr. Major and his Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, have been the leading opponents in Europe of intervention against Serbian aggression. A one-time Conservative Minister of Defense, Sir John Nott, published a bitter attack on the Government's foreign policy in The Evening Standard the other day under the headline "The Weak Man of Europe."
With all the battering he has taken at home, Mr. Major must be grateful for the red-carpet treatment he is about to get from President Clinton on a visit to Washington. On Monday night he will sleep in the White House: the first British prime minister to do so since Winston Churchill. Earlier that day he will fly on Air Force One with the President to Pittsburgh, where his grandfather lived.
Some here see Mr. Clinton's gestures as a sign that the President now understands the value of the Anglo-American "special relationship." But that has long been in the category of myth. Mr. Clinton likely wants to soothe ill feeling over the recent grant of an American visa to Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein.
The political realities to which Mr. Major will return include a series of elections over the next few months: for local governments, for seats in the European Parliament and a by-election for a traditionally Conservative seat in the House of Commons. In all, the prospects are gloomy for the Tories.
The Prime Minister can nevertheless soldier on, and almost surely will. He won the last election against the odds, after the sudden party dumping of Margaret Thatcher and his choice as her successor, and friends say he has faith that he can do it again.
The Labor Party might do something silly enough to blight its long-awaited recovery. Labor and the third party, the Liberal Democrats, might get in each other's way. Mr. Major projects a personal decency and reasonableness. But still, time has its claims. A disaffected Conservative here said:
"The only thing that matters after all these years is a change of government. That applies anywhere in the world."

HEADLINE: Let's Make a Start on Environmental Justice With Brooklyn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am pleased that "Environmental Justice" (editorial, Feb. 11) praises President Clinton for asking Federal agencies to insure that their environmental programs do not inflict disproportionate environmental harm on the poor or minorities. Unfortunately, you do not support environmental justice in New York City. 
 The city is in the last stages of obtaining permit approval for construction of the Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator in my assembly district, a project that you have wholeheartedly supported. Time after time, I have expressed my outrage over the environmental injustices placed upon my low-income, multiethnic community. The Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Fort Greene area, which I represent, is subjected to more environmental health hazards than any other area in the city.
There is a myriad of manufacturing corporations in my community, which pour noxious fumes into the air. It is the home of the largest number of garbage transfer stations in the city, as well as a radioactive waste holding company called Radiac. Daily, my constituents are subjected to the stench of the Newtown Creek sewage treatment facility, along with pollutants emanating from the Greenpoint incinerator.
It seems to me that the Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Fort Greene communities are a perfect case study to justify the need for the new Clinton environmental policy.
I commend President Clinton for addressing this problem, which has been going on far too long in communities all across the country. The color of skin or economic status of a community should play no role in determining the site of an environmental facility.
To preserve the future of this great country it is essential that all localities, regardless of their race or economic class, begin to carry a fair share of their environmental responsibilities.

HEADLINE: North Korea Agrees to Some U.N. Nuclear Inspections

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The tense international standoff over North Korea's suspected covert nuclear weapons program eased tonight when the North Korean Government reached an agreement with the United States that will allow United Nations inspectors to visit some of the North's nuclear installations.
As part of the agreement, the United States and North Korea have also agreed to hold a third round of high level diplomatic talks in Geneva starting on March 31. The talks could lead to inspections of North Korea's most secret nuclear installations in return for steps integrating North Korea into the world community and diplomatic recognition from Washington. 
 The United States representative at the talks, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom C. Hubbard, said: "We have reached agreement on arrangements which will enable International Atomic Energy Agency inspections to begin on March 1. Our agreement involves understandings on other issues such as the date for the next round of talks between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
During the last year or so, North Korea has been caught in a growing confrontation with the atomic energy agency as well as with the United States after the Vienna-based agency said it suspected that North Korea was building an atomic bomb. The agency asked to visit secret nuclear sites that North Korea has never declared, even though the North, as a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, is required to open all its nuclear installations to inspection.
Under an emerging compromise a few weeks ago, North Korea was to allow agency representatives to resume normal inspections of seven nuclear sites that fall under the terms of the treaty. Such access was to have paved the way for a third round of talks between United States and North Korea during which Washington intended to offer North Korea trade and other advantages, including possible recognition, in return for ending its secret nuclear program.
But the deal went sour at the last moment when North Korea refused to grant entry visas to inspectors. The agency responded by warning that if its inspectors did not get visas by Monday it would report to the United Nations Security Council that North Korea had breached its obligations under the treaty, opening the door to possible trade sanctions.
After tonight's talks, North Korea's United Nations representative, Pak Gil Yon, said the inspectors' visas were being granted "as we speak."
He said North Korea and the United States had agreed to take "four simultaneous steps" to ease the crisis on March 1.
On that day, he said, the United States will announce that it intends to suspend its annual joint military exercises with South Korea's forces, which are known as Team Spirit.
 
Exchange of Special Envoys
 At the same time the nuclear inspections are to start and will be completed within a time span North Korea and the agency have agreed to.
Meanwhile, working level contacts will resume between North and South Korea on an exchange of special envoys. Finally, North Korea and the United States will announce their intention to begin the third round of talks on March 31 to resolve outstanding issues.
At that time, the United States has indictated that it will help North Korea integrate into the international economy, giving it new opportunities for trade and aid, and hold out the possibility of diplomatic recognition.
But in return North Korea must agree to inspection of all its nuclear installations, including waste disposal sites it has never declared. American negotiators say such a move would effectively end any hopes North Korea may have of becoming a nuclear power.

Some of the nation's most powerful bankers pledged to support the Federal Reserve in a dispute with the Treasury Department over a plan to centralize bank regulation. The Clinton Administration wants to create a Federal Banking Commission that would absorb most of the regulatory roles of the Fed, the F.D.I.C. and the Treasury. But the bankers endorsed the Fed's plan, which calls for it to take over the bank supervision role of the F.D.I.C. [Page 39.]
 
Cigarettes may be subject to regulation, the F.D.A. suggested, saying there was mounting evidence that cigarettes are sold to satisfy an addiction. [1.]

 
Markets
Big global investors have taken hits recently because of a rise in U.S. interest rates and the collapse of trade talks between Japan and the United States. One of the biggest hits was taken by George Soros. The financier, famous for his successful investments in currencies, gold and real estate, lost $600 million in a single day's trading, betting the wrong way on the direction of the yen. [39.]
 
A big mutual fund had to withdraw a $1.1 billion public offering because of an incorrect chart in the offering's prospectus. Stock prices, meanwhile, were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped, but broader indexes gained. [40.]
 
Market watchers were stopped cold as their Bloomberg Business News monitors ground to temporary halt, overwhelmed by subscribers trying to read a single news brief: Nancy Kerrigan finished second in the women's figure-skating competition. [41.]
 
Treasury prices bounced back a bit, and a jittery market was calmer after a week of rising interest rates. [48.]
 
The dollar fell against most major currencies amid wariness before a meeting of the Group of Seven. Gold prices rose. [47.]
 
Lumber prices declined as demand for building materials was smothered by snow. Crude oil prices retreated. [47.]
 
The total number of shares sold short in Nasdaq trading rose to record levels in the month that ended on Feb. 8. [51.]
 
 
Companies
Bell Atlantic's loss of a merger deal may be A.T.& T.'s gain. A merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications would have created a company with lines running past nearly 40 percent of all American homes. The emerging marketplace for interactive services needs such a company with the power to combine disparate telephone and cable television networks, and only A.T.& T. appears to possess that kind of technological might. [39.]
 
Hearst decided it would keep its book division, which includes William Morrow and Avon Books, after months of negotiations on a sale. Putnam Berkley Group had been seen as the likely buyer. [39.]
 
America West's board has endorsed a $220 million bid from an investment group led by the chairman of Continental Airlines. The interest in America West, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, shows a renewed confidence in formerly troubled airlines.[41.]
 
Woolworth said it would report a loss for the fourth quarter, surprising investors. The retailer also said it would take a larger charge than originally estimated in the sale of a Canadian unit. [41.]
 
Westinghouse will acquire the radar and electronic surveillance unit of United Technologies for an undisclosed price. [41.]
 
 
Your Money
Owning a house may be the American dream, but renting one makes more sense for many people. [37.]
 
A private hedge fund is one vehicle that allows investors to make money in falling markets as well as rising markets. [37.]
 
Errors in a a brokerage account can happen, often because of human failing or a computer glitch. But correcting errors requires a quick response and detailed records. [37.]
 
Some mortgage lenders are willing to help borrowers with flexible terms and assistance when there is a disaster like the California earthquake. Others are not so accommodating. [38.]

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks U.N. to Condemn Sudan on Bombings

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Alarmed that the refugee and food crisis in the Sudan could grow to rival the suffering in Somalia, the United States is pressing the United Nations Security Council to condemn the Sudan's Islamic fundamentalist Government for bombing Christian towns in the south of the country.
Administration officials say the ground and air offensive ordered by the Sudanese Government has put two million people in the south at risk of famine by forcing people to flee their farms and refugee camps and by thwarting food distribution efforts by relief groups. 
 If international condemnation of the offensive fails to get the Government to desist, American officials warn that they might then seek economic sanctions, perhaps an oil embargo or the discontinuation of international lending. In light of the difficulties the American military encountered in restoring order to Somalia, including the death of 18 soldiers in October, American officials say they have ruled out sending troops to the Sudan.
A draft text of the statement the United States is circulating at the United Nations states that the Security Council is "gravely concerned" that the military offensive "has increased the suffering of Sudanese people" and "seriously undermined the international relief effort."
France, Britain and Russia support the statement, American officials said, adding that China is hesitating to support it because of its traditional reluctance to see countries criticized over their internal affairs.
American officials say the Sudanese Government has taken advantage of the dry season to escalate the civil war and to try to wipe out rebel strongholds in the largely Christian and animist south of the country.
According to Administration estimates, the recent offensive has caused the displacement of 200,000 people within the Sudan, which comes on top of the almost 400,000 Sudanese refugees who have already fled to neighboring countries.
The Clinton Administration, pushed by Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, who is a longtime student of African affairs, is trying to train the spotlight on the Sudan, in part to get relief groups and donors to combat the famine there.
But in seeking to focus attention on the Sudan, an effort that will undoubtedly encourage television news programs to run images of starving Sudanese children, the Administration runs the risk of later being accused of not doing enough to stop the crisis.
The problems in the Sudan place the Clinton Administration between two conflicting impulses. On one hand, officials see the United States as a big-hearted superpower that has a responsibility to help bring peace and reduce hunger. But on the other hand, officials do not want to send troops to a distant land where they see no vital national interests at stake.
"There is no thought being given by the U.S. or anyone else in the international community to introducing troops," a senior Administration official said. "They would meet systematic, armed opposition. Instead, our strategy is to increase international pressure on the Government of Sudan, which is not our favorite government, in any case."
Last August, the United States put the Sudan on the list of nations that sponsor terrorism.
As a result of a severe drought and a failed harvest in the southeast, hunger was already going to be a problem this year, but with the military offensive, American officials fear that the hunger crisis could be worse than the famine in 1988, when about 280,000 people died.

HEADLINE: Rose Law Firm, Arkansas Power, Slips as It Steps Onto a Bigger Stage

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
With Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White House and three other partners taking influential jobs in the Clinton Administration, the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark., seemed to be on the verge of national prominence a year ago.
But things quickly went awry. The Rose firm, which made itself a dominant power in its home state, is now suffering under the unforgiving glare of publicity. 
 Vincent W. Foster Jr., one of the partners who moved to Washington, serving as a top White House lawyer, committed suicide. A coveted spot on the national scene has failed to materialize. And last month, an independent counsel opened an office in Little Rock to investigate accusations of fraud and conflicts of interest that uncomfortably keep leading back to the converted Y.W.C.A. building that is the Rose headquarters.
Instead of basking in the glory of its ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton's White House, the firm has had to hire its own lawyers to defend itself and cope with the counsel's requests for confidential files. He has ordered the firm not to shred any documents related to the Whitewater Development Company real estate venture. The Clintons were partners in Whitewater with the proprietor of a failed Arkansas savings institution. The independent counsel is investigating whether the institution, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, improperly funneled money into Whitewater or into Mr. Clinton's 1984 re-election campaign when he was Governor of Arkansas.
The Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee made the Rose firm the target of their scorn during a hearing on Thursday on savings institutions, saying the firm improperly used its connections throughout the 1980's. They denounced as a whitewash a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report clearing Rose of a conflict of interest in a case involving Madison Guaranty.
This morning, the chairman of the F.D.I.C ordered the conflict investigation reopened.
The turmoil and the independent counsel's request for client files has made some Rose lawyers apprehensive that they may lose some business, although so far there is no indication of defections from a list that includes most of the state's biggest companies, like Stephens Inc., one of the largest investment banks in the United States, and the Worthen Banking Corporation, the largest banking company in the state, Tyson Foods, one of the world's largest poultry companies and Walmart, the country's biggest retailer.
"It's been a roller coaster ride with its ups and its downs," Herbert C. Rule 3d, a senior partner who has been at Rose for 30 years, said in an interview in Little Rock recently. "It'll pass. It won't be like a kidney stone passing. It will just sort of drift away."
Even if that happens, the brush with power will have left some lasting wounds. After Mr. Foster killed himself in July, the firm delayed its plans to open a small office in the capital until October. "We lost our stomach for the whole idea of Washington," said Allen W. Bird 2d, the partner who opened the office.
 
Pedigree
White Shoe Firm Grew in the 80's
 The Rose firm bills itself as the oldest legal establishment west of the Mississippi, tracing its history to 1820. It gets its name from a founder of the American Bar Association, U. M. Rose, who joined the firm at the end of the Civil War.
Among Arkansas firms, Rose is viewed as the whitest of the white shoes. It is dominated by white men, most of whom came from privileged families in the state and graduated from one of the two accredited law schools in the state. Only a handful of women, and no blacks, have been made partners. Law professors at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock say Rose is among the most sought-after employers by the state's top law students.
Until the mid-1970's, Rose was little more than a loose confederation of a small group of lawyers.
But it changed direction largely because of C. Joseph Giroir Jr., the first full-time securities lawyer in Little Rock, who joined Rose after doing corporate-finance work at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. With his help, the firm quadrupled in size as its list of clients, a Who's Who of the Arkansas corporate elite, grew during the explosive economic growth in the 1980's.
By the early 1990's, according to Federal filings, the top partners at the firm were billing clients as much as $185 an hour, among the highest rates in the state, though considerably lower than the top rates of the large firms in bigger cities.
While Mr. Giroir forged one set of connections, another set began to grow with the hiring of the firm's first woman lawyer, Mrs. Clinton. She joined the firm as an associate in January 1977, about the time her husband was being sworn in as State Attorney General.
She became a partner at the age of 32, in 1979, just as her husband was being inaugurated as the nation's youngest governor.
 
Little Trial Work
 Although Mrs. Clinton was described as a trial lawyer in some news accounts both before and during the Presidential campaign, many former colleagues cannot remember any cases she tried, and court reporters in Little Rock say she appeared in court infrequently, perhaps as seldom as once every two or three years.
She was the primary wage earner for the family, since Mr. Clinton's salary as Governor was $35,000. But income tax returns and interviews with other lawyers indicate that she was among the lower-paid partners for much of her time at the firm, in large part because the pay scale was based on how many hours a lawyer billed and the clients the lawyer brought in. Her income did eventually grow, however. She made $203,172 in 1992, the year she left the firm.
Since she was also Arkansas's First Lady, Mrs. Clinton in effect held two jobs, spending considerable time away from Rose. And she would occasionally take leaves from the firm when Mr. Clinton was involved in tough races.
But Mrs. Clinton lent prestige to the firm's letterhead and served as director of several of Rose's biggest clients, including Walmart and TCBY, the large yogurt-franchise company. In a 1992 interview, William H. Kennedy 3d, the head of the firm's executive committee, said she was a leading "rainmaker," the term for a partner who drums up clients for a firm.
Mrs. Clinton was also among the most important state figures involved in the selection of judges. Lawyers, judges and former aides to Mr. Clinton in Arkansas say she played a crucial role in deciding who would fill the unexpired terms of judges, dealing directly with candidates for the jobs. Although state judges are elected, the governor makes appointments to complete terms of those who resign or retire. These appointees, given an advantage by incumbency, are often then elected to the bench.
 
Regulatory Work
 One of the firm's biggest attractions was its ability to help clients navigate the rocky regulatory shoals of state government. When, for instance, Stephens wanted to enter new finance businesses that required Federal or state approval, it was Rose lawyers they turned to. When Tyson wanted tax breaks or had potential environmental problems, it was Rose lawyers who lobbied the state legislature or regulators.
For large companies outside of Arkansas, like General Motors and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, Rose was the firm they turned to when they had local matters to attend to.
At its peak, Rose represented several Arkansas government and quasi-government institutions as well, including the Little Rock Airport Commission and the Public Service Commission. Partners at Rose say that to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest, Mrs. Clinton's compensation excluded any profits from municipal and state clients.
 
Accusations
Conflict Questions Occasionally Raised
 Along with the Rose firm's pre-eminence have come accusations that the firm on occasion has been involved in conflicts of interest. Many of the questions involve one of the firm's smaller clients, Madison Guaranty, which has become a central focus of the Whitewater investigation. Madison was controlled by James B. McDougal. In 1978, the Clintons joined Mr. McDougal and his wife, Susan, in buying the Whitewater land, a 230-acre vacation home development along the White River in northern Arkansas.
The independent counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., is studying whether Madison improperly put money into Whitewater to prop it up, or funneled money through Whitewater into Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns.
The Madison connection has provided fodder for critics who contend that the Rose firm looked the other way when it came to potential conflicts of interest. For one thing, they say, Mrs. Clinton represented her own business partner before state officials appointed by her husband. Other accusations center on work Rose did after Madison failed, when Rose represented the Government in a suit against Madison's auditors.
Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Lisa Caputo, said accusations that Mrs. Clinton was in a conflict over her representing Madison were unfair and politically motivated.
"It's yet another attempt to pile on Hillary," Ms. Caputo said. "It reminds me of the Republican convention of 1992, when the Republicans tried to attack Bill Clinton's wife."
The issue of possible conflicts has also arisen in other savings and loan cases handled by Rose lawyers.
In January 1988, the firm and its insurer paid $3 million to settle conflict accusations raised by Federal regulators in connection with the failure of First South Savings and Loan, the largest savings institution to collapse when it was seized in 1986.
 
Firm Switches Sides
 In another instance, a former savings and loan executive in Arkansas has asserted that the firm had a conflict after it represented him and his family in many matters. The executive, Royce Barrett, said Rose switched sides in December 1985 and represented the Government in taking the savings association away from the Barrett family. Mr. Barrett charges that it was improper for the firm to side against his family once it had handled confidential matters that could be involved in the Government's lawsuit.
"They drew our wills, they knew our assets, they helped set up our trusts," Mr. Barrett said, adding that they had also set up the savings association's holding company. "I felt like it was a conflict of interest."
Mr. Rule of the Rose firm disputed Mr. Barrett's account.
"There is not any conflict, and there never was any suggestion of a conflict," he said, declining to elaborate.
In another episode, lawyers criticized Mr. Clinton's selection of a judge in a case involving the Rose law firm. The Governor appoints special Supreme Court justices in cases in which any justice steps aside because of potential conflicts. That occurred when a lawsuit against Alcoa came before the Supreme Court.
A closely divided Court overturned a $1.1 million judgment won by a man who accused the company of negligence after he suffered a serious injury. The opinion was written by a special justice who had been selected by Mr. Clinton. Alcoa, it turned out was represented by Rose, although the firm says Mrs. Clinton was not involved in the case.
Still, Ted Boswell, the plaintiff's lawyer and a prominent lawyer in Arkansas, charged in court papers that Mrs. Clinton did assist in the Alcoa defense.
Lawyers for the Rose law firm denied that Mrs. Clinton was involved in the case or had influenced the selection of the special justice.
Ms. Caputo, the First Lady's spokeswoman, said the accusation of a conflict was outrageous.
"There was no evidence to support the claim, and the court shot it down," Ms. Caputo said.
 
Prospects
Tough Atmosphere To Attract Clients
 In the months after the four ex-partners went to Washington, representatives of several foreign governments and Pentagon contractors traveled west to Little Rock, hoping to capitalize on the Rose firm's bright new connections.
The mood today is far different. Lawyers at the firm say the last few weeks have been as tumultuous as 1988, when Mr. Giroir left the firm after several lawsuits over his business dealings. Now, many of the firm's senior partners are finding themselves distracted from their work.
"This atmosphere undoubtedly makes it difficult for them to build their practice," said W. Jackson Williams Jr., a partner at Little Rock's Williams & Anderson, which over the years has been on both the same and opposite sides as Rose lawyers. "All the publicity can't be terribly helpful."
Only a few years ago, the Rose Law Firm was looking forward to a large expansion. It built a large addition to its headquarters and planned to double its size to nearly 100 lawyers. Now, some partners at the firm say that projected growth may have been overly optimistic.
To finance the new construction, the firm took out a large loan, which now accounts for more than $3.9 million of the nearly $6 million that the firm and its partners have borrowed from the Worthen Bank of Little Rock.
The firm continues to comb its records for material that has been sought by Mr. Fiske. The latest order issued to the firm by Mr. Fiske about preserving documents was prompted by an article in The Washington Times quoting an unidentified employee who claimed to have seen business records that relate to the Clintons' real estate interests being shredded this month.
Ronald M. Clark, the firm's administrative partner, said those records were not shredded this month, although other unrelated material was destroyed and may have been the source of confusion.
Mr. Clark said the Rose Law firm began a policy of shredding confidential client material in 1992, as the law firm was become the focus of more attention because of Mr. Clinton's campaign.
"Every firm in America destroys sensitive material," he said. "There is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
 
 
 
THE FOUR WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON
 They were the four closest partners at Rose, working on cases, socializing at the same country clubs and participating in the same charitable and political efforts. Together, they came to Washington to take the some of the most powerful positions in Government.
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
She arrived at the firm in 1977 after teaching for two years at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, and became a partner two years later. While at Rose, she served on several corporate boards and state task forces.
 
Vincent W. Foster Jr., deceased.
In Little Rock: Courtly and widely respected at Rose among partners and associates, he was Mrs. Clinton's closest confidant. He graduated at the top of his class at the University of Arkansas School of Law and was top scorer on the state bar. He was one of the firm's top litigators. His wife, Lisa, taught Chelsea Clinton how to swim.
 
In Washington: Mr. Foster, who became a deputy White House counsel, continued to handle personal financial matters for the Clintons. He committed suicide in July 1993 and an independent counsel is now looking into the circumstances of his death.
 
Webster L. Hubbell, Associate Attorney General
In Little Rock: A former college linebacker drafted to the Chicago Bears, he never made it to the pros because of a knee injury. At the firm he was the top administrative partner in the 1980's and the chairman of the conflicts committee. Mr. Clinton appointed him briefly to serve as chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and he also was the mayor of Little Rock.
 
In Washington: Since he arrived at the Justice Department in the first days of the Clinton Administration, he has been the subject of regular criticism by Republicans who say he is the behind-the scenes-conduit for improper White House influence. He remains a regular golfing companion of Mr. Clinton.
 
William H. Kennedy 3d, Associate White House Counsel
In Little Rock: The firm's top administrative partner in the late 1980's and 90's, he was known the firm to be no-nonsense and at times tough. He came to Rose after working as a counsel for Senate Appropriations Committee in the 1977 and at the firm, handled securities and corporate matters. He owns an Italian restaurant in Little Rock.
 
In Washington: A few weeks before Mr. Foster's death, Mr. Kennedy was rebuked in an internal White House report over his role in calling in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the staff of the White House travel office.

HEADLINE: In Response to Spy Case, U.S. Expels Diplomat Russians Refused to Recall

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The United States expelled a senior Russian diplomat today after Moscow refused to withdraw him in atonement for its possible role in employing a Central Intelligence Agency officer who was arrested on espionage charges this week.
The diplomat, Aleksandr Lyskenko, whom American officials described as the top officer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service here, was given seven days to leave the country. 
 Mr. Lyskenko, the first Russian to be expelled by the United States since 1986, was said by the State Department to have been "in a position to be responsible" for the activities of the intelligence agency official, Aldrich H. Ames, and his wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, who was also arrested.
Hours before today's announcement, President Clinton said the United States had been "crystal clear" in demanding that Russia make voluntary amends or face American action. In a formal statement from the White House, however, he also urged that Congress maintain a generous flow of aid to Russia.
Trying to calm the uproar that the case and other recent Russian actions have provoked, Mr. Clinton first summoned Congressional leaders to warn that he would resist calls for the United States to retaliate by slowing or halting the $2.5 billion in aid to Russia.
"Support of the United States for reform in Russia does not flow from a sense of charity or blind faith," Mr. Clinton said in the news conference later. "Our policy is based on our clear American interests clearly pursued."
 
Russians Note 'Factions'
 The Russian Government nevertheless expressed concern that the Ames case could lead to adverse "political consequences." A statement from its Foreign Ministry suggested that Washington should have shared its suspicions about the spy case with Moscow before making them public, and warned that factions in both countries "are not interested in the friendship of the two major powers."
With the evidence of Mr. Ames's spying provoking a powerful response in Congress, and coming on top of other signs of Russia's commitment to a newly assertive foreign policy, the Administration's handling of diplomatic dimensions of the case has displayed a distinct aversion to punitive action.
Rather than moving immediately to expel Mr. Lyskenko, who was known by American authorities to be Russia's station chief for the successor agency to the K.G.B., the Administration spent the three days after the arrest of the Ameses pursuing a policy that Mr. Clinton described today as giving the Russians time to "take whatever action they wanted to take."
Only after Russia showed no sign of taking the steps recommended by United States diplomats and by a special C.I.A. delegation that traveled to Moscow, was Mr. Lyskenko's expulsion announced today.
The State Department spokesman who disclosed the expulsion, Michael McCurry, said the United States did not rule out further action, but his warning was softened by Mr. Clinton's call on Congress to maintain a "steadiness of purpose" in reaching out to Russia.
The President's remarks at the White House provided the clearest view yet of his Administration's perspective on a week in which the Russian Government has left little doubt about its determination to maintain an independent role in the world.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and others have argued that the United States should, at least for now, withdraw its hand of friendship to Russia because of that country's new bid for an equal role in the Balkans, and because of the accusations that it has maintained a spying operation here.
 
Not a 'Straight Line'
 But today, Mr. Clinton said it would be a mistake for the United States to judge Russia too harshly.
"What I think is naive in this whole element is the suggestion that we should have ever believed for a moment that every event and every speech made by every Russian politician in every election of every Russian parliament would somehow be in a constant straight line toward a goal that we wanted to predetermine," the President said.
Despite the recent setbacks, Mr. Clinton said, it was still in the interest of the United States to work with Russia to lower the nuclear threshold, promote democracy and a market economy and forge a partnership in international diplomacy. He also expressed some frustration at those who seemed to expect that Russia must either be ally or adversary.
"This is not black and white," he said. "This is gray."
In seeking Russia's help in quieting this week's furor, American officials said the United States had been explicit in identifying Mr. Lyskenko as the diplomat Moscow should agree to withdraw. As the Washington station chief for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, known by its Russian acronym as S.V.R.R., Mr. Lyskenko had abided by an informal agreement between the two countries and identified himself to his American counterparts.
They said a C.I.A. delegation that made a hasty trip to Moscow on Thursday had also asked Russian intelligence officials to identify formally, though not to withdraw, three other intelligence officers now in the United States, including the Washington station chief for the Russian Military Intelligence Service, or G.R.U., and the S.V.R.R. residents in New York and San Francisco.
 
Matching the Numbers
 In addition, they said, the C.I.A. delegation had asked Moscow to abide by a previous commitment to reduce the number of intelligence officers in the United States to the same level maintained by American intelligence services in Russia. But they said Russian officials had given no sign that they would agree even on the minimal demand of Mr. Lyskenko's withdrawal.
At his news conference, Mr. Clinton said he had avoided abrupt action on the advice of his national security advisers. But the main purpose of his public comments, scheduled only an hour in advance, was to inject a note of calm into a debate that White House officials said they feared had grown too alarmist.
The United States is scheduled to deliver $2.5 billion in aid to Russia this year, and the Administration is asking Congress to approve an additional $900 million for next year. In the last week alone, however, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia has raised some American unease by dispatching 400 Russian peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo without warning, by asserting a leading Russian role in the former Yugoslavia and by warning Russia's neighbors not to join NATO.

HEADLINE: WEST BANK MASSACRE: Diplomacy;
Clinton Calls Peace Talks From Cairo to Washington

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Hours after he awakened to news of the massacre at a mosque in the West Bank, President Clinton today asked negotiators for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to move their Cairo peace talks to Washington. They immediately agreed.
Mr. Clinton and other American officials said they feared that the attack, carried out by an American emigre who sprayed the historic mosque with gunfire during morning prayers, would derail the peace negotiations that were revived in September on the South Lawn of the White House. 
 "Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back into the darkness of unending conflict and bloodshed," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference at the White House where he explained his decision to intervene in the talks for the first time. "We must prevent them from extinguishing the hopes and the visions and the aspirations of ordinary people for a life of peaceful existence."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel once and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., twice today.
 
Condolences to Arafat
 State Department officials said Mr. Christopher called Mr. Arafat shortly after 7 A.M. to express condolences on behalf of the United States. Two hours later, he interrupted a meeting at the White House to speak to Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat in turn and invite them to move the talks to Washington.
Mr. Christopher also spoke to Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, who until now has acted as a host for the bilateral talks.
The offer appeared to serve the needs of everyone involved. For Mr. Clinton, it was a quick, relatively easy and concrete gesture to demonstrate American concern and willingness to take action. American officials said Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat had said they appreciated the urgency of the matter and the need to keep their citizens calm and immediately made arrangements for the new round of talks, which could begin as soon as next week.
Mr. Clinton's call signaled an abrupt shift in the arms-length policy the United States had adopted in the months since Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat left Washington to flesh out the terms of their historic agreement in September.
 
Trying to Avoid Intervention
 The State Department has stayed almost entirely out of the negotiations, and Mr. Clinton said today that he still believed that the two sides must "freely agree" without undue international intervention.
But a senior Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said today's events rendered mere expressions of shock and sympathy inadequate. "There was a general concern that this event could swamp the progress that had been made," the official said.
Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin initialed an agreement two weeks ago that removed many of the obstacles that have delayed carrying out the accord, which would grant Palestinians limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. In a breakthrough, both sides agreed to the terms of control of the border between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan.
Negotiators have been meeting in Paris to work out the economic details of the agreement while the political details have been discussed during talks in Cairo and in Taba, Egypt.
 
Progess in Talks Cited
 "They've made enormous progress in the talks they've had to date," said Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman. "And I think the purpose in convening here in Washington is to accelerate that process."
American officials who began hashing out a response to the Hebron killings said today that the agreement had restored a sense of optimism about the negotiations that the United States wants to maintain in the face of today's setback. Mr. Clinton said he expected the two sides to remain "in continuous session" until progress is made.
Israeli officials said the negotiating team headed by Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak would leave for Washington Monday, the Associated Press reported.
"I am hoping," Mr. Clinton said, "that statesmanship of the leaders in the region and the attention that this will bring to the terrible problem will not only defuse what could become a much worse round of killings and counterattacks, but will actually be used to thwart the purpose of the murder and to reinvigorate the peace process."
 
Israeli Envoy Endorses Effort
 Mr. Clinton's effort to hold together the fragile peace effort was endorsed by the Israeli Ambassador to Washington, Itamar Rabinovitch.
"This was an act meant to derail the peace process," he said at a news conference. "It only reinforces our determination not only to keep to the peace process but to expedite it and to accelerate it."
Even as American officials sought to present a tempered response to the day's events, Arab-interest organizations echoed Mr. Arafat's calls for more direct American intervention aimed at disarming Israeli settlers.
Mr. McCurry would not confirm what actions the Israeli Government might take to tighten security, but said the United States would support such actions. "We applaud them, and we will certainly be following their consideration of those issues in the coming days," he said.
 
Warning to Travelers
 The State Department warned American citizens against traveling to East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza and advised Americans in the Middle East and Europe to "exercise special caution."
Mr. Clinton said his actions today were intended to "send a signal to the peoples in the region to not overreact to this horrible act."
He left no doubt that American officials believe that today's attack was intended to derail the peace talks.
"It can be no coincidence that the murderer struck during the holy month of Ramadan and chose a site sacred to Muslims and to Jews," he said. "His likely purpose was to ruin the historic reconciliation now under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis."

HEADLINE: A Chancellor Encounters Opposition and Support

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A president of one college of the City University of New York has asked other presidents of the 21-campus system to sign a letter of support for Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who has been criticized this week for spending too much time out of town.
At least eight presidents had signed the letter by yesterday afternoon. It said criticism by some trustees and others of her travel was distracting from what some of the presidents viewed as her important initiatives for the university's future. 
 "Chancellor Reynolds, with her staff, in consultation and close coordination with the president, administrators, faculty bodies and students, is devising a vision for the years ahead while managing the nation's third largest university system in a difficult economy," the letter says.
The letter, addressed to the CUNY Board of Trustees, was distributed two days after an article in The New York Times quoted the presidents of five CUNY colleges as saying Dr. Reynolds's involvement on five corporate boards and other outside activities might have accounted for some of the difficulties she faced in gaining acceptance for her proposed academic streamlining. They said they believed the chancellor did not spend enough time cultivating ties to each campus.
 
'It's a Witch Hunt'
 Yesterday, some of the presidents, who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution, said the letter was tantamount to a loyalty oath, and said they thought it was part of a pattern by the chancellor to try to identify those who disagree with her and her policies.
"It's a witch hunt," said one president. "Some people believe she is trying to find the dissenters."
But Jay Hershenson, the vice chancellor for university relations, said neither his office nor that of the chancellor was involved in writing or distributing the letter.
"Our presidents are independent and any matters that they wish to take up individually or collectively is entirely up to them," he said yesterday.
The letter was distributed by Baruch College President Matthew Goldstein, who told several other presidents that he thought the chancellor needed their support, the presidents said. Dr. Goldstein did not return telephone calls left at his office or his residence.
 
'Outside' Affairs Questioned
 This week, two trustees questioned whether the chancellor was violating the board's two-day-a-month limit on "outside consultation and professional activities."
Dr. Reynolds serves on the boards of the Maytag Corp., Humana Inc., Abbott Laboratories, American Electric Power and Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. She has said she intends to resign from the American Electric board in April. Together, the boards paid her $140,000 last year, the chancellor said.
The chancellor said her service on the boards helps CUNY by giving it a higher national profile. She earns $158,000 a year from CUNY, although she said she donated $6,000 of her salary back to a CUNY scholarship fund.
Service on the boards and its committees, and her participation in several professional organizations, like the Society for Gynecological Investigation, take her out of town several times a month.
On Tuesday the CUNY board unanimously adopted a resolution asking that the chancellor and other top officials disclose how much money they earn outside of CUNY, and to detail to them how much time they spend on the outside activities.
On Thursday and Friday, Dr. Goldstein began distributing the letter at a meeting of the executive council of presidents, which was attended by some of the presidents, some of them said.
Addressed to the trustees, the letter says in part that "personnel policies must be scrupulously followed." But it went on to say that "recent news reports serve our students poorly."
It also said "so much attention of late is directed to these matters that the public and the media may have forgotten" CUNY's accomplishments.
"As independent thinkers, we may not all agree on some of her initiatives," the letter said. "But we support her leadership."

HEADLINE: A $600 Million Miscalculation

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
With world financial markets roiled by developments including a rise in American interest rates and the breakdown of trade talks between Washington and Tokyo, some of the world's biggest and savviest investors have been taken down a notch or two. Among them is one of the biggest and savviest of all, the financier George Soros.
Mr. Soros, 63, who has developed a reputation as an investment seer for his successful bets on currencies, gold and real estate, suffered a $600 million loss on Feb. 14, the first full day of trading after trade talks between the United States and Japan collapsed. His mistake was that he bet the wrong way on the direction of the Japanese yen's value relative to the dollar, his spokesman said today. 
 Other investors have taken big hits this month, particularly those who owned European bonds, which have suddenly tumbled in value. But few have publicly owned up to their losses other than Mr. Soros, who basked in the positive glow of financial victory a year and a half ago when he bet correctly on a big fall in the British pound and stunned the currency markets with a $1 billion profit.
 
Quantum Group Loses 5%
 The loss, which stemmed primarily from speculation on the Japanese yen, erased nearly 5 percent of the $12 billion of assets held by Mr. Soros's Quantum Group, an intensely private collection of investment funds that are registered overseas and closed to American individuals and institutions. The losses, which occurred in six trading and real estate investment funds, ended a remarkable winning streak for Mr. Soros, of New York.
Mr. Soros's opinions have been so respected that his public predictions about currency movements have become self-fulfilling in several instances, even though he devotes most of his time to running his charitable foundation. Through the foundation, he has directed some $300 million to philanthropic activities, mostly in Eastern Europe.
Much of the responsibility for strategy and day-to-day trading is in the hands of Stanley Druckenmiller, Mr. Soros's No. 2 man. It was in an interview with The Times of London, published Thursday, that Mr. Druckenmiller first confirmed the $600 million loss that had been rumored.
Mr. Druckenmiller and the Soros organization said they decided to talk about the loss because the amounts mentioned in rumors had varied widely.
Mr. Soros had been trading on a belief that the yen would continue to fall in value against the dollar, a strategy that generally proved correct. But he was caught unexpectedly in the fallout from the breakdown of trade talks between Japan and the United States on Friday, Feb. 11. When markets reopened the following Monday, the yen, which had been falling, suddenly surged as traders concluded that the United States would seek to push up the yen as a way to narrow the American trade deficit with Japan.
The Japanese currency closed in New York that day at 102.20 yen to the dollar, a change of nearly 5 percent from its close the previous Friday of 107.18 yen to the dollar. A stronger yen makes imports from Japan more expensive in the United States.
 "Mr. Soros is kept sufficiently informed of what's going on that Mr. Soros would say the buck stops here," said the spokesman, who insisted on anonymity.
The spokesman said that the Quantum funds had been performing well otherwise, and that their value was down only 2.7 percent since Jan. 1. Last year, the Quantum Fund, the group's flagship trading fund, rose 65 to 70 percent, the spokesman said.
Mr. Soros's spokesman said that on Feb. 14 the Quantum funds had a short position of $8 billion worth of yen. That means that $8 billion of yen had been borrowed and sold on the assumption that the value would decline against the dollar and that Mr. Soros's traders could buy back yen later on a lower price and return the currency to the lender. But Quantum was forced to sell yen as the currency jumped sharply in value, contributing to the huge loss.
Mr. Soros is by no means the only investor to have been hammered by unsettled financial markets in recent weeks.
With the Federal Reserve shifting course and raising short-term interest rates, many investors who had been focusing on the likelihood of continued rate declines and bond-market strength in Europe suffered large losses as they were caught flat-footed by a selloff in bonds.
Mr. Soros has long been among the most successful and sophisticated traders in the financial markets, but his reputation reached new heights in September 1992 as Europe's system of semifixed exchange rates tottered near collapse.
Mr. Soros bet heavily that the British pound would come under so much speculative pressure that it would be devalued. His bet proved absolutely correct, and on what is known in London as "Black Wednesday," Sept. 16, 1992, and the days following, he reaped a $1 billion profit as the pound was forced out of Europe's exchange rate system.

HEADLINE: Mutual Fund Is Forced To Withdraw Offering

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Billion-dollar public sales of stocks are supposed to go off without a hitch. But yesterday, one of the nation's biggest mutual funds had to withdraw a $1.1 billion public offering, and the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of the shares, after an incorrect chart in the offering's prospectus was discovered.
The embarrassed investment adviser to the fund is Alliance Capital Management, which has $115 billion of client money under management. It said the prospectus for its new Global Privatization Fund contained a chart that exaggerated the performance of 22 former government enterprises that had been converted to ownership by private investors. 
 The global fund plans to invest in such European, Latin American and Asian ventures, which are known as privatizations. Shares in the fund had traded since Feb. 18.
 
'Doesn't Go Up as Much'
 In a corrected chart now being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the performance line "goes up, it just doesn't go up as much," Linda A. Finnerty, a spokeswoman for Alliance Capital, said. Instead of a 170 percent rise in market value over five years, "it's more in the 100 percent range," she said.
Ms. Finnerty declined to say who exactly made the error. Asked if the mistake was made by a college intern with a calculator, Ms. Finnerty replied, "Oh no, it was analysts and portfolio managers at Alliance."
Few, if any, investors objected when informed of the incorrect chart, she said. Alliance was confident that the sold-out 74.5 million shares at $15 each would again sell out, she added, once the new prospectus is cleared by the S.E.C.
Alliance hopes to market the global fund again within the next few days and perhaps as early as Monday.
 
Stocks Are Mixed
 The stock market put in a mixed performance in relatively light trading, following a depressed session on Thursday. Traders are still stymied about what to do in a climate of rising interest rates and befuddlement about inflation, which so far is not in evidence.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.12 points, to 3,838.78, but the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.81 points, to 466.07. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.34 points, to 783.78.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.82 point, to 258.57, on volume of 273.7 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,169 to 963. The American Stock Exchange market value index gained 1.87 points, to 467.45.
The Dow Jones industrials may have been out of synchronization with the broader market because the Dow is heavily weighted with economically sensitive stocks. Indeed, three such stocks -- Chevron, General Motors and Caterpillar -- nudged the Dow into the minus column. Chevron declined 1 1/2, to 85 3/4; Caterpillar fell 7/8, to 107 3/4, and General Motors dropped 3/4, to 58 1/4.
But the S.& P. 500 could have been nudged into the plus column by just two stocks. Tele-Communications, which broke off merger talks with Bell Atlantic earlier in the week, advanced 1 1/2, to 23 7/8, as securities analysts continued to praise the prospects of the cable television industry, despite negative rulings by the Government. BellSouth, the largest regional Bell, could be a source of joint-venture money for Tele-Communications, according to analysts. BellSouth rose 1 3/8, to 55 5/8.
In Tokyo yesterday, Japanese stocks ended a strong week with a modest gain. The Nikkei index of 225 issues edged up 37.90 points, to 19,803.38. For the week, the Nikkei gained 843.78 points.

HEADLINE: Farrell Is Named Chairman Of Ways and Means Panel

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver today appointed Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a longtime legislator who heads the Democratic Party in Manhattan, as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Farrell, who has represented Harlem and Washington Heights since 1975, is the first black legislator to hold the position, which is the highest-ranking committee chairmanship in the Assembly and one of the top negotiators for passing the $62 billion New York State budget. 
 In filling the position, Mr. Silver cemented the new leadership in the Democratic-led Assembly, which had been in flux since the death of Speaker Saul Weprin on Feb. 11. Until Mr. Weprin's death, Mr. Silver was the chairman of Ways and Means. Mr. Weprin also held the post before he was named Speaker three years ago.
"He brings 20 years of experience in the Legislature," Mr. Silver said of Mr. Farrell, who is known as Denny. "He brings the gift of gab."
"I'm not unmindful of the fact that Denny is an African-American," Mr. Silver said. "I think it is a good message to send that the three leading committee appointments are a woman, an African-American and an Italian male. It shows the diversity of the conference."
 
Top Priority: On-Time Budget
 Helene Weinstein, Democrat of Brooklyn, is chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee, and Joseph R. Lentol, also a Democrat of Brooklyn, heads the Codes Committee.
Mr. Farrell, who is 62, has led the Assembly Banking Committee since 1979. He said his first priority is to pass the budget, which is perenially late, by the April 1 deadline.
"Every time we run late it costs us money and it costs us respect," he said. "I want people to know we are on the road to recovery, and one of the best signs is an on-time budget."
Mr. Farrell, who wears a gray ponytail and is often seen cruising in his red Chevrolet convertible, brushed aside questions about whether he had aspirations to become Speaker. "I haven't even found the men's room at Ways and Means," he said.
 
Won't Resign Other Position
 Despite criticism from governmental monitoring groups, he said he would not resign his position as chairman of the Manhattan Democratic Party, nor had Mr. Silver asked him to do so.
"From the practical standpoint of concentration of power, we wouldn't want that much power in the hands of one Assembly member, even someone with Mr. Farrell's integrity," said Andrew Greenblatt, executive director of Common Cause.
While the Ways and Means chairman is nominally in charge of reviewing the Governor's budget and negotiating it into final form with the Republican-led Senate, the major decisions are reserved for the Speaker.
Mr. Farrell's chief competitor for the job was Assemblywoman Eileen C. Dugan, a Democrat from Brooklyn who like Mr. Farrell played an important role in Mr. Silver's rise to Speaker. Mr. Silver today expanded her powers as chairwoman of the Assembly Committee for Commerce, Industry and Economic Development.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Amid Wariness Before Meeting of Group of 7

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday amid hints that German interest rates might remain high and the possibility of further strength in the Japanese yen after this weekend's Group of Seven meeting.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery was up $2.20, to $379.80 an ounce. 
 Currency traders said they were nervous about this weekend's meeting of finance ministers from seven industrialized countries. The session is expected to focus on developments in Russia, although there have been reports that currencies will be discussed. Traders said the continued lack of progress on American-Japanese trade disputes could weigh on the dollar.
The market's perception is that "the U.S. is prepared to continue to let the dollar slide," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Company.
In late New York trading, the dollar slipped to 104.85 yen, from 104.90 yen on Thursday.
The dollar has sunk against the yen since bilateral trade talks broke down two weeks ago. Many traders believe the Clinton Administration supports a strong yen as a way of pressing the Japanese Government to make trade concessions. A strong yen can hurt Japanese exports, since it makes them more expensive abroad.
Mr. Waxman said the German mark got some support from a German newspaper report predicting higher-than-expected growth in the money supply, a source of inflation. Such a situation would probably mean that the German Government would keep interest rates high, to choke off inflation. High interest rates usually strengthen a currency.
Technical factors also influenced trading, with the dollar's drop below 1.71 German marks setting off pre-arranged orders to sell the dollar, traders said. The dollar fell under 1.72, another crucial point, a day earlier. But the dollar recovered some ground by yesterday afternoon, as bargain hunters bought. It ended at 1.7105 marks, down from 1.7170 marks on Thursday.
The British pound rose in New York to $1.4885 from $1.4865.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Declines

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for February fell to 93.2 from 94.3 in January, people with access to the survey said yesterday.
The preliminary February index, released two weeks ago, was 92.9. 
 The index is based on a monthly survey of households around the country. The base number is 100, set in 1966. As the monthly reading drops further below 100, consumers are becoming more pessimistic about the economy.
Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, set in March 1984. The record low is 51.7, set in April 1980.
The report by the university also included its February index of consumer expectations, which measures how people feel about the future. The index was 83.5, down from 86.4 in January. The early reading was 82.9.
The expectations index is used by the Commerce Department as one of the 11 components of its chief forecasting gauge, the index of leading economic indicators.
The February index of current economic conditions was 108.3, up from 106.6 in January. The early reading was 108.4.

HEADLINE: Cherished Goals Give Way to Hard Facts

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The sluggish real estate market in many parts of the country has prompted some house hunters to wonder whether renting may be a better deal financially than the long-cherished and heavily promoted American Dream of home ownership.
For many people, especially those who hold onto their houses for more than seven years, buying makes more economic sense. Besides building equity, there are myriad tax advantages, like the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, or the rollover of a gain if the seller buys a more expensive house. 
 But putting aside pride of ownership and the tradition of social stability, renting may make more sense than buying. That is especially the case if a tenant lives in the house for fewer than five years, invests the down payment and obtains a rate of return that is significantly higher than the appreciation of a comparable house and pays less to rent monthly than he would after taxes to buy.
Three years ago, Irene A. Wrenner, a technology coordinator, decided to rent a two-bedroom house in Ridgewood, N.J., for $1,213 a month instead of buying a slightly larger house in the same area for $230,000. She and her husband, Kevin, an electrical engineer, calculated that the monthly costs of ownership, after taxes, would be $1,900. "We refused to ignore the bottom line," she said.
If they had bought the house and now had to sell, the Wrenners figured they would have lost part of their down payment and spent thousands of dollars more in mortgage payments, fees and other costs. By renting, investing their down payment and saving the difference between the rent and the monthly cost of owning, they saved thousands of dollars.
"Our money is also liquid and that pleases us a lot," Ms. Wrenner said.
Ted C. Jones, chief economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A& M University, said the time spent in a house is important because during the first few years, there is usually no buildup of equity because most payments during the first few years do not substantially reduce the principal of a loan.
Mr. Jones also said the tax savings of the mortgage interest deduction were exaggerated, given today's rates and the increases in the standard income tax deduction. Further, there may be little appreciation in the value of a house during the first few years. He said not only had sale prices stagnated in many places in the low-inflation 90's, but also most houses automatically declined in value by 6 percent, the standard amount paid to a broker, at the sale.
"If you're going to be in your home three years or less, then rent," he said. "Buying for three years just produces a lot of grief and expenses and the illusion of equity."
Mr. Jones said house buyers stayed in their houses for about the length of the average marriage: seven years. "The longer you are going to be in your house, the longer it is going to make sense to buy," he said.
The length of residency aside, the rest of the equation for figuring whether renting or buying provides the most savings is more complex and weighs numerous factors like maintenance expenses, fees, tax savings, gain on the down payment, appreciation and costs of renting.
There are several books and software programs that can help with the computations. Last year, Mitchell A. Levy, a financial analyst in Cupertino, Calif., published the book "Home Ownership: The American Myth" and a software package that creates spreadsheets to show people whether they should buy or rent.
"If you are going to buy a house, have the right reasons, emotionally or financially," he said. "Don't just jump on the bandwagon because everyone else is doing it or because your family and friends say you have to."
The Real Estate Center at Texas A& M sells similar software. "A lot of people will be surprised in that they will come out richer renting than if they buy," Mr. Jones said.
Marc Eisenson, who publishes a financial newsletter, The Banker's Secret Bulletin, in Elizaville, N.Y., said location was an important factor. He said renting usually made the most sense in places like Southern California, where the cost of buying a house was unusually high and the costs of renting comparable housing were low. Buying, he said, generally made more sense in places like the South and the Midwest where sale prices and rents were low.
Mr. Levy said regardless of location, renters usually fared better than buyers only if the monthly after-tax costs of owning were higher, which was not always the case in today's era of low interest rates. For example, renting a one-bedroom, rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan for $600 a month may be more economical than buying the similar apartment for $150,000. But if the same apartment rented at the market rate of $1,600 a month, buying would be better, providing that the owner kept the apartment long enough.
As for the Wrenners, they are in the fourth year of renting and are aware that the longer they stay the more likely it is they will lose the advantages of renting. "We are looking at it year by year," Ms. Wrenner said.
But, she added, there were intangible benefits to renting. "There is a flexibility," she said, pointing out that corporate layoffs had become pandemic in the Northeast. "We also like not having to plow the snow out of our driveway or having to fix a water leak in the ceiling," she said.

HEADLINE: Studies on Immigrants Prove They'd Rather Give Than Receive

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Donald L. Huddle says that a column by Anthony Lewis and an article of mine are "clearly wrong" in saying that (a) immigrants do not increase native unemployment, and (b) they put more money into the public coffers in taxes than they take out in welfare and public services (letter, Jan. 26). Not so. 
 Concerning unemployment: In the Wall Street Journal article that Mr. Huddle mentions, I quoted verbatim the conclusions of the only six reputable studies (plus my own) on the subject. All conclude that immigration does not displace natives from jobs. None of the authors of those studies have asserted that the quotation was improper, to my knowledge. In that article I also explained why Mr. Huddle's own writing on the subject -- the only one that dissents from the scholarly consensus -- is entirely without validity. (Mr. Huddle's writings are analyzed at length in my 1989 book, "The Economic Effects of Immigration.")
Concerning the fiscal costs and benefits of immigration: Mr. Huddle notes my calculation that on average both immigrants and natives put more into the public coffers than they take out in individual public services. He claims that my calculation that immigrants are net contributors must therefore be wrong because both cannot be true.
But it is not the absolute net contribution of immigrants (whose calculation, like that of natives, inevitably leaves out some nonindividual governmental expenditures) that is the basis of my conclusion. Rather, the conclusion rests on the fact that the net contribution of immigrants is relatively high compared with that of natives; immigrants make greater net contributions largely because they arrive when they are young and strong, rather than at ages when people collect old-age benefits.
Both unemployment and welfare in connection with immigration are hot and important topics. They are also difficult for the layperson to sort out based on Op-Ed articles and letters to the editor. To clarify the matter, I invite Mr. Huddle to bring his work and mine -- and others, as appropriate -- before a "science court" of economists chosen by, say, the American Economic Association. The person whose work is found less valid would be bound to pay the court's expenses.

Inside The System

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
Yvette hasn't changed much since the last time I saw her. She's still working on her weight; she's still warm and optimistic, signs her letters "Fondly," with a big curly F.
It was hot and muggy, that day three years ago, and Yvette was telling me then that a job was right around the corner. And that's what she tells me now, as the snow turns smoke-gray outside the narrow, barred window of her living room, nearly five years after she first went on welfare. 
 Bashing women like Yvette Bell is an American sport almost as popular as baseball, with politicians signing on as captains of the team. But before the President, the governors and the mayors talk about welfare reform, they had better be honest about the truth: that reforming welfare is about the monumental tasks of reforming housing, the economy, child care, health care and schools as well.
Take Yvette, who worked for the phone company for years. She lost her job when she lost her home, and she lost her home because she moved out, she says, when she got tired of her husband messing up her face with his fist. She went into "the system," she calls it, and when she calls it that she makes it sound like the dark fun house at the public policy fair.
When I first met her, in Brooklyn in 1991, she had gotten an apartment and was looking for a job. She made jokes about the crackheads in the hallways. She made jokes about her secondhand clothes, and how when she was working she used to give her own clothes away to the indigent, and now, whatta ya know, she was the indigent herself.
But she stopped laughing. The crackheads took over the top floor of the city-owned building in which she lived with her three daughters. "The police running in and out, the crackheads running in and out, all hours," she says now. "I had to be with the kids all the time. I couldn't even think of going to work when I knew the girls would come home from school and all that was going on."
In October, the fear of who or what might come crashing through her door, the screams and yells and footfalls and shots, got to be too much. "I didn't want to come back into the shelter system," she said, "but I left that place with just what I had on my back."
Two days at a city office sleeping in a chair with a 3-year-old on her lap, several weeks in a transitional shelter. Now Yvette lives in a dark but clean one-bedroom apartment in a building in the Bronx called Seneca House, where 74 families stay until they can find housing elsewhere.
It has as much security as some prisons, with a big clanging metal gate, closed-circuit monitors, guards. Yvette loves that. It's to keep the world out, not to keep her in, and after the crackheads she would just as soon the world took its business elsewhere.
She pores over The Chief, the city civil service newspaper. She took the test for mental hygiene therapy aide and passed. She took the test for a job at the Human Resources administration, and passed that, too. She's just waiting to be called back, waiting for a permanent apartment, to find day care for the baby, to shut off Sally Jesse and Montel Williams and get back into the loop. Outside her building, the out-of-work men shovel snow for a little extra cash.
"You get lazy doing nothing," she says sadly, six months shy of her 40th birthday. Still, she figures she's better off than others who live around her. There's a 14-year-old in one of the apartments who already has two children.
Responsibility, the talking heads yammer about women like Yvette Bell. But responsibilities are slippery things, depending on who's talking about them. Is it more responsible for a poor woman who gets pregnant to have an abortion or a baby? Is it more responsible to care for your kids yourself, or to leave them in iffy situations while you work to support them? Is it irresponsible that Yvette stayed home with her kids when her building was lousy with drugs and violence?
When the President had his economic summit, he invited all sorts of business people to sit around a big table. When Hillary Rodham Clinton was cooking up a health care plan, she put together a panel of people from the industry. And anyone who truly wants welfare reform has this responsibility: to get together a group of women who are in the system and ask them what keeps them there. The answers are complicated; the experts are poor. Yvette'll give them the story, unless, of course, she's found that job by then.

HEADLINE: Q & A;
Investing in Futures

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:

Q. What is a managed futures fund?
 
SHELLY STEINBERG,
Manhattan
 
A. Futures are an investment vehicle. They include not only commodities like grains and meats, but also markets for interest rates, currencies and stock indexes. Many people without the skill, time or emotional discipline to trade in these volatile markets invest instead in managed futures funds, sometimes called commodity funds or pools.
Managed futures funds, which operate similarly to mutual funds, use professional commodity trading advisers to make buying and selling decisions. Minimum investments in these funds are typically lower than they are for purchases of individual futures contracts. Some funds may use more than one adviser for diverse points of view. 
 "The returns of managed futures are generally not correlated to the returns of the stock and bond markets, an attribute which can assist in dampening the fluctuations of the overall portfolio," said Jane E. Martin, executive director of the Managed Futures Association. "In addition, managed futures offer entrance to global markets not otherwise easily accessed."
 
457 Plan Distributions
 
Q. I work for city government and have retirement money invested in a tax-deferred annuity -- a 457 plan. How long after retirement can one leave funds in this account before a distribution must be taken?
 
GLEN H. SHANE,
The Bronx
 
A. Like 401(k) plans in the private sector and 403(b) plans for teachers, 457 plans let government employees tap the assets after they reach age 59 1/2 without paying a penalty of 10 percent for early withdrawal. Plan participants generally have the flexibility to keep funds in the plan until they reach age 70 1/2.
If the money is not needed -- and you are comfortable with the plan's investment performance -- you can achieve further tax-deferred growth by leaving it in the plan.
 "While the general rule on minimum withdrawals from a Section 457 plan is that they must begin by April 1 of the year following the participant's attaining age 70 1/2, certain government employers have tighter restrictions, such as requiring withdrawals to begin by age 65," said Kurt Cerulli of Cerulli Associates, a financial services consulting firm in Boston. "The specifics of your plan should be checked."
 
When Municipals Are Taxed
 
Q. Do you lose the triple tax-free advantage of municipal bonds if they are sold before maturity?
 
FRANK GRIBBON,
Manhattan
 
A. Any interest you receive from your municipal bond investment is tax-free. But if you sell a municipal bond at a profit before it matures, you incur a capital gain and must pay a capital gains tax. For a long-term capital gain -- on an investment held at least a year -- the top tax rate is 28 percent.
 "Investors may also be subject to capital gains if they sell before maturity, bonds issued at a discount, such as zero-coupon bonds," said Heather Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association. "The discount is the difference between the issue price of the bond and its par value."

HEADLINE: Bond Markets Buoyed by Bargain Hunting

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After a stormy week that saw interest rates surge, a still jittery market managed to find itself on firm footing yesterday.
Buyers, looking for value after a number of sharp selloffs had depressed prices, emerged in sufficient numbers to give the market a much-needed lift, traders said 
 The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 8/32 yesterday. The long bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.73 percent on Thursday.
"Today I saw less liquidation and some bottom-fishing by investors looking for value," Peter Hirsch, managing director and head of the government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, said. For the first time all week, he added, he saw buying close to the level of selling.
 
Consumer Sentiment
 Bond prices traded mostly higher throughout the session, with the exception of a slight downturn in the morning after reports of a survey by the University of Michigan showing that although its consumer sentiment index fell to 93.2 in February from 94.3 in January, the number was above the preliminary February index, 92.9, released two weeks ago, and thus raised inflation fears.
Comments by a Federal Reserve governor also caused bond prices to slip at one point. The governor, Susan M. Phillips, said she was reasonably pleased with inflation and called the recent bond selloff a bit surprising.
Investors, however, were less fearful yesterday after buyers were lured back, and the market firmed. But with the prospect of bear markets in both bonds and stocks, traders are worried that large speculative investors like hedge funds will start to sell again and move money overseas.
 
March Tightening Possible
 If the Fed tightens credit again, it might wait until the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 22.
Some analysts, however, said it could do so next week, when the market will have three big economic reports to digest: a revision to the gross domestic product numbers, the National Association of Purchasing Management Index and the monthly employment report.
All are important indicators for the economy, but Mr. Hirsch of Salomon Brothers said, "The market will only be focused on anything with a price component."
The price component of the purchasing management report should be of particular interest to the market, since it rose sharply in January.
Other reports due next week -- new home sales, for example -- will probably not be watched so closely, because of the severe winter weather.
Mr. Hirsch said if a tightening were to come next week, it would be after the purchasing managers' report on Tuesday and before the employment report is released on Friday. "It would give the Fed a free ride for a couple days," he said.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
Loan Assistance Varies For Borrowers in Crisis

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
AS Californians with earthquake-damaged homes recently discovered, all mortgages are not the same. Some lenders are willing to provide flexible terms and other assistance when disaster strikes. Some are not.
 For example, Home Savings of America, the nation's largest savings institution, plans to make interest-free loans to 200 borrowers who have badly damaged houses and no other assets, with no payments until the houses are sold. For borrowers needing a brief respite, Home Savings will stretch out their loans. Along with good publicity, the move is intended to avert bigger losses in foreclosure. 
 Banks and savings and loan associations say their structures allow them to be more accommodating than mortgage banks. But mortgage banks, which make loans and do not take deposits, call such portrayals unfair.
 The debate within the mortgage industry is not new and is based on what institutions do with their loans.
Banks and savings and loans typically keep some loans, especially those with adjustable interest rates, in their portfolios. Mortgage bankers, whose rates are often slightly lower than those of other lenders, typically sell their loans to investors. The institutions that hold loans argue that they can more easily revise the terms in case of hardship or bend to meet a borrower in the first place.
"Because we hold the loans, we can make the decisions and move," said Charles R. Rinehart, chief executive of Home Savings.
 "That's something the public should wake up to," said Mario J. Antoci, chairman and chief executive of American Savings Bank in Stockton, Calif.
Peter and Susan Klamkin found a distinction when they shopped for a mortgage for their first house. The Klamkins had a blemished credit history because it took them a while to pay medical bills for treating their daughter's rare metabolic illness, and many lenders turned them away. "Rates became secondary," Mr. Klamkin said. "We shopped for anyone who would listen to our story."
Loan officials at Shawmut Bank in Hartford listened. The Klamkins got a loan of $147,500 to buy a house in Longmeadow, Mass., last summer.
Mortgage bank executives say they also make exceptions and renegotiate loans for borrowers in a cash squeeze. But because they sell their loans, they must abide by strict underwriting rules and relief plans stipulated by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which package the loans for investors. Even if these two groups grant temporary relief, the mortgage bank is obligated to continue payments.
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aren't doing the lenders any favors," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, referring to commonly used names of the Federal mortgage groups. "They're putting the burden entirely on the lender's back."
Albert Lequang, the national policy administrator for Freddie Mac, could not recall an instance when the agency had agreed to rework a borrower's loan terms other than to pay it off. "Investors don't look kindly on that," he said.
Arranging work-out terms is more difficult with a mortgage bank, said Thomas H. Boone, managing director of the Countrywide Funding Corporation in Pasadena, Calif., the country's largest mortgage lender. "But it can be done, and we do it every day."
Typically, forbearance from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac means delinquencies are not reported to credit bureaus, late charges are dropped and borrowers are given a 60- or 90-day indulgence period, after which they must establish a plan to repay arrears within a year. Such relaxed rules benefited many victims of Hurricane Andrew and the Midwest floods.
Babette Heimbuch, president of First Federal Bank in Santa Monica, Calif., said: "The programs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer are pretty much useless when your house is destroyed."
Of course, not all traditional lenders give customers more leeway than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For hurricane victims, Barnett Banks of Florida stuck with the agencies' guidelines.

HEADLINE: The Pequots

BYLINE: By Francis X. Clines; Francis X. Clines is a reporter and columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
They really are palefaces under the neon lights, all these senior citizens and tourists playing the slot machines, blackjack tables and big-payoff bingo games at the Wisconsin Oneida tribe's casino. The casino booms around the clock in the reservation woods near the luck-hungry bettors of Green Bay. Rick Hill, with shoulder-length hair and a patient, earthen-hued outlook on life, reigns there, counting the wondrously gross receipts with the dedicated eye his ancestors once applied to tracking redcoats for George Washington.
Hailing good fortune's arrival on the rundown reservation, Hill first supplies its historical context -- genocidal defeats and the transcontinental retreat of his people, 27 broken treaties and six million lost acres in New York State alone. Only then, against the bleeping and bonging of fortune's reversal, does he comment on Oneida casino revenues, which have risen to more than $375 million a year: "Compared to the previous 170 years, it's not a lot of money, and there are still third-world conditions on most reservations." 
 A few hours later Hill stands before a dozen graduates at the Oneida elementary school, run on casino profits. "Don't hold back," he tells them. And no wonder. Their reservation, like scores of others, is resurgent. "With the community you've got all the resources you need. We'll back you up," he promises. After an elder says a tribal prayer, the young American Indians march off toward the future, their higher-education expenses already guaranteed by the gamblers just down the road.
The Oneidas are but one of more than 100 tribes across the country working to resurrect themselves with gambling after the long spiral of bad dealings with the white man. And they are not the richest. This turn of luck has come about since 1988, when Congress, prompted by the Supreme Court's bolstering of tribal sovereignty, adopted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Out of that law, which requires states to negotiate compacts with tribes, 170 casinos and high-stakes bingo halls have taken root. Where so recently there was utter destitution, the more fortunate tribes have created a $1.5 billion economy in which revenues have been doubling annually.
"Our day in the sun is arriving," Hill says of his tribe's new life of full employment and new schools, roads, sewers and houses -- the Indian version of a postwar Levittown.
"It's been wonderful. I never had these opportunities before in my life," says Pat Metoxen, who for years did odd jobs in Green Bay for $6.50 an hour. He has become an Oneida pit boss at $15 an hour, joining 2,500 other tribe members who work in the casino. Metoxen has a new house, a new car, and he says his three children "will probably need master's degrees in business, at the rate the tribe is progressing."
Law degrees wouldn't hurt either. Tribal gambling powers and sovereignty have come under increasing legal challenges from dumbfounded state officials crying foul at the Indians' success. The critical juncture for the gaming sachems is to come later this year, when Congress considers amending the act -- a familiar, frightening possibility for tribal leaders, who recall how countless compacts were written then disregarded in Washington.
"We've had 200 years of that process," says Timothy Wapato, executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association. The association has 96 member tribes and can afford an impressive lobbying presence in Washington. In recent months the tribes have been negotiating with state officials, searching for a peaceful common position to present to Congress in the growing conflict over tribal sovereignty and states' prerogatives.
In the face of Supreme Court backing of the tribes' sovereign rights, some experienced officials of the Las Vegas and Atlantic City gambling industry have begun cooperating and looking for a management interest in tribal casinos. Others, like Donald Trump, the owner of three casinos in Atlantic City, see their hegemony threatened. Trump is suing. He contends that his rights are being violated by what he calls a "very limited class of citizens."
"The Indians are only a sovereign nation when it comes to gambling," Trump argues, dismissing the nationhood precedent that tribes say was long abused by Washington to negotiate them into retreat. "Most people think casino gambling will be what alcohol was to the Indians of past generations," Trump says. "I have seen these Indians, and you have more Indian blood than they have."
As if measuring some tabloid-mache Custer, Hill smiles when he hears what Trump has to say. He dismisses Trump as a chronically bankrupt entrepreneur who talks a good game of competition until he's been bested. "Another white man has come to take even the measly beads left," Hill declares, matching Trump movie cliche for cliche.
For the lobbying effort, the 96 tribes of the National Indian Gaming Association elected Hill, a 41-year-old gaming tyro who emphasizes tribal culture, as chairman. His style is more Native American than that of his predecessor, Charles C. Keechi, a button-down executive and former chairman of the Delaware nation in Oklahoma. Hill's victory by a 3-to-1 margin last spring was a tribute to his skills in the art of Indian politics, inherited from his father, and to his success at investing casino profits in tribal welfare.
At the gambling tables, the palefaces seem indifferent to Trump's sudden sense of curtailed citizenship and Hill's recapitulation of the Great White Father's perfidy. "I don't know what I'd do with my days if it wasn't for the casino," a grandmotherly gambler says as her fellow retirees cluster vigilantly at Oneida's morning mega-bingo session.
To anyone who ever rooted for the underdog in tribal America's sad saga, the rise of Indian casinos is as heartening as it is amazing. "It's the return of the white buffalo," says Matt Connor of Gaming & Wagering Business International magazine, invoking the rare American bison, a traditional sign of renewed providence. W. Bruce Turner, a gaming company stock analyst with Salomon Brothers, assesses the Indian's gaming business less romantically -- "capable of 200 percent growth over the next several years." He finds their ability to adapt to gambling "nothing short of overwhelming."
A decade ago, the tribes had zero gross product and 70 percent unemployment. Now there are 70 major tribal casinos with table games and slot machines in 19 states. And dozens more are planned. A premise of the 1988 gaming act was that the reservations needed to be freed from patronizing restrictions that prevented them from amassing economic development capital. The result: they now generate, manage and reinvest betting profits that this year will approach $2 billion, over 3 percent of the nation's legal betting take.
"ISN'T THAT WHAT AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT?" ASKS IRVING Wizenfeld, an enthusiastic regular at the furiously busy Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn. Created by the once nearly extinct Mashantucket Pequot tribe, Foxwoods is unique even in these tribal boom times. In only two years, it has become the single most profitable casino in the Western Hemisphere, raking in an estimated $600 million a year in profits.
A two-and-a-half hour drive from Manhattan, Foxwoods offers "wampum" betting cards, cocktail waitresses in skimpy fringed and beaded tunics, and more than 3,000 slot machines. More than 15,000 gamblers show up every day, on weekends as many as 35,000. The gleaming 24-hour casino is the talk of the country's $30-billion-a-year industry -- a subject of both envy and fear.
Foxwoods was created almost single-handedly by Chairman Richard (Skip) Hayward, a reclusive, canny pathfinder. He cut a bold profit-sharing deal with the State of Connecticut that will eventually allow him to have 4,600 slot machines, more than any other casino on the East Coast. He also took care to hire as his chief executive officer G. Michael Brown, the former director of New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement; Brown built his reputation as a prosecutor who forced Atlantic City casinos to steer clear of underworld ties.
Working in desolate woods, Hayward first had to rebuild his own withered tribe by searching out members from the post-Colonial diaspora, some of them lost in the urban underclass. Twenty years ago, the Mashuntucket Pequot reservation had fewer than a dozen residents; Hayward authenticated more than 200 others and campaigned to get them Federal recognition, the key to sovereignty and legalized gambling. All now profit in well-paid jobs, guaranteed educations and health insurance. The tribe has also hired an archeologist to disinter its history and stock the new museum.
"This is truly a case of the last becoming first," exults Tom Tureen, the lawyer who was lead counsel in the land claim fight that established Pequot sovereignty. "There has never been anything to approach this as a means of providing capital to Indians."
To protect the Foxwoods bonanza from corruption threats, Brown, the chief executive, has used his Atlantic City experience to ease back from the absolute sovereignty so dear to other tribes and has instead invited on-site cooperation with state and Federal law enforcement experts, and exchanges of gambling intelligence with Las Vegas and Atlantic City networks.
Federal law concerning Indians is rooted in respect for sovereignty and defers to state-tribal compacts for regulatory procedures. But Washington insists on professional accounting standards to head off sweetheart deals that could siphon funds from tribal welfare programs. The Pequots run a consultant service for other tribes, stressing the need for high-level security, strict controls in the movement of money and experienced management.
"We've found a predictable mix," notes Brown in reference to studies of two other casinos. "One was excellently run; the other was so lax in controls that it could easily fall victim to illicit dealings." He says the main threat to Indian gaming is not underworld infiltration as much as "bad business deals in a risky area, just as with junk bonds."
The tribes might eventually end up with 250 or more casinos of various sizes, if the Federal gaming law is not radically crimped. The Indians' good fortune has helped spur an even larger boom in legalized gambling off the reservation. And it's not just the Indians who are getting richer; areas surrounding the reservations are profiting too.
Gov. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut has agreed that Foxwoods may add slot machines, in a clever monopoly compact worked out under the Federal act by Hayward. The tribe provides the state at least $100 million a year, so long as competitive slot operations, the main engines of gambling profit, are not authorized in other Connecticut cities now agitating for their own action. Last year, as casino revenues rocketed, Hayward defended his golden monopoly by giving the state an additional $13 million in budget help.
In Minnesota, cooperation between reservation and Statehouse has put 11 tribes in control of 17 high-stakes bingo and gambling casinos that constitute an annual industry with betting in excess of $650 million and a $116 million payroll. Seventy-three percent of the casino workers are non-Indians, hired as unemployment on the reservation dropped toward zero. Minnesota found that in casino regions the economy grew twice as fast as in other areas and that welfare dependency fell 3 percent in casino counties while it was rising 15 percent elsewhere.
Hill says he believes that their new wealth has firmed the tribes' resolve to face up to the gaming act challenge. "Economics gives us more political power," he says.
The main opposition comes from the National Governors' Association, which has been negotiating tentatively with the tribes to find common ground for a proposal that might head off the riskier unknowns of unlacing the gaming act. The tribes' staunchest support comes from Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, who says court decisions demand that the act be amended this year.
The governors resent Indian independence of state control and freedom from taxes. But their problem is that court interpretations upholding Indian sovereignty limit their options. They want to avoid the theoretical possibility that financially pressed cities might, under land-trust arrangements, donate part of their downtown areas to Indians to set up casinos. In California -- a critical battleground because it supplies Las Vegas with one-third of its gamblers -- the state has balked at Federally mandated negotiations with tribes, forcing the issue into the courts.
The Indians know that critics are just waiting for a corruption scandal to bolster a wholesale gutting of the gaming act. Rick Hill, bemused at white society's tolerance of its own savings and loan scandal, stresses a Justice Department finding that tribal management has thus far proved more than a match for underworld intriguers.
"There has not been a widespread or successful effort by organized crime to infiltrate Indian gaming operations," the Justice Department concluded. That was two years ago; some tribes have since begun creating their own Vegas-like anticorruption networks. They also are emphasizing management training, something critics believe is needed to deal with intratribal rivalries and charges of executive profiteering.
This emphasis is clear in the security room at the Mystic Lake Casino, run by the Shakopee Sioux outside Minneapolis. A wall of television screens faces a 24-hour control desk where monitors run a high-speed taping system of closeup surveillance, custom-designed by industry experts to zoom in, from multiple angles, on the fingertips of gamblers and all money-handling employees. Discretion is considered counterproductive: when a worker is caught skimming or a gambler is taped tampering with the floor games, the tribe's policy is to make a dramatic on-the-spot arrest.
Success has brought some discord. Since losing his post as head of the National Indian Gaming Association last year, Charles Keechi of the Oklahoma Delawares has been warning that the casino issue may degenerate into a struggle among tribes. "I'm afraid it's the casino haves fighting it out with the have-nots," he says, speaking now as chairman of Natives of the Americas, a two-continent tribal economic organization.
There has been no move toward an intertribal sharing of profits. Most tribes pool their revenues for reservation development; some pay shared dividends to members, who keep details to themselves. Hill denies that the tribes with casinos would insulate themselves at the expense of weaker brethren in dealings with Congress.
At least 30 more tribes in 19 states are now trying to develop their own casinos. But in a universe of more than 300 Federally recognized tribes totalling 1.9 million people, the reservations of two-thirds of them seem less than fortunate, deliberately set far from tourist crossroads by treaty. Others are rebuffed at the statehouse.
The Indians are only part of a legalized gambling industry sweeping the nation in the recession-heavy years. Riverboat casinos now ply the Mississippi and Gulf Coast, with proposals to spread northeastward. And in the rush for revenues, bogus "boats" are being rushed into trenches like frontier settlements. Keeping up with the tribes is a selling point.
THE HEART OF the Indians' problem with unexpected success lies, as ever, in Washington. Hill and the other tribal leaders are wary of what may develop there. They have put their trust in Senator Inouye and Senator John McCain of Arizona, vice chairman of the committee on Indian affairs, who, under pressure from the governors and state attorneys general, have been trying to mediate the casino fight quietly by calling private conferences and serving, in effect, as diplomats among competing nations. Senator Inouye insists he has obtained reassurances from the governors' association that the states do not wish to attack the tribes' sovereignty or economic resurrection; rather, they would work out a better compact process of mutual profit.
Rick Hill expresses watchful faith in the "Inouye process." But characteristically he declines to hold his tongue in denouncing proposed gaming law amendments from Atlantic City and Las Vegas legislators as a "Trump Act" retrenchment of Indian sovereignty. "The civil war may be over for some, but not in Indian country," he says in the flat tone of determination the tribal chiefs sought to project when they chose him for the looming Congressional fight.
For this contest, Tom Tureen, the lawyer who helped create fresh Indian legend from gambling luck, counsels the greatest vigilance.
"History shows that any time Indians have anything of value, there's been people on the non-Indian side ready to take it away. Look at the Black Hills," he says, recalling how the Sioux were forced to move there by Washington, then illegally routed anew when whites discovered gold. "Look at the United States itself."

HEADLINE: The Native -- and Not So Native -- American Way;
The Apaches

BYLINE: By Erik Eckholm; Erik Eckholm is a project editor for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Arough camp is set up on the outskirts of Whiteriver, halfway up the White Mountains of Arizona and just below the point where terra cotta bluffs and junipers give way to the country's largest stand of Ponderosa pine.
Men chop wood and come and go in pickups. Dozens of women tend large fires, preparing food for the opening rituals of a nine-day celebration of a girl's puberty. Some bake bread and tortillas on open coals, fry steak or simmer a traditional corn brew; others, in the un-self-conscious blend of old and new so common among White Mountain Apaches, roll dough around hot dogs to bake on the fire or pack soda and beer into ice chests. Two medicine-men-in-training, college bound in the fall, stretch inner tubing over metal bowls to make drums. 
 In the printed invitation sent to scores of relatives and friends, Harlan and Caroline Hill Sr., the girl's grandparents, and Steve and Sharon Anderson, her parents, "cordially invite" guests to 12-year-old Shannon's "sacred Sunrise Dance." In this, the primary celebration of Apache identity, girls are temporarily transformed into Changing Woman, a powerful figure in the Apache creation myth. The coming-of-age ritual involves more time, effort and money, in relation to income, than the most elaborate coming-out party or bas mitzvah. Twenty-five years ago, only a few ceremonies were performed each year. Last spring and summer, there was at least one every weekend.
What is striking about this surge in tradition is that it has occurred over the same quarter-century that the White Mountain tribe has aggressively pursued economic opportunities. The tribe of 11,000, which inhabits 1.6 million spectacular acres in eastern Arizona known officially as the Fort Apache Reservation, has yet to abolish the poverty so prevalent among Native Americans. But it runs the largest lumber mill in the Southwest, a major ski resort, a new casino and other ventures that provide more than 1,000 jobs and demonstrate the tribe's ability to manage its affairs to a degree unusual in Indian country. Whiteriver, the tribal headquarters, bustles with plans and events, a virtual rush hour on its main road. Chasing the dollar, far from destroying tradition, has in many ways helped strengthen it. Despite Western education and Christian missionaries, television and rap music, this is one of the country's more intact reservations, a place where the lilting Apache language remains vital.
WHEN I FIRST VISITED THE RESERVATION AS A CHILD IN 1959, PAYING a daily fee for the chance to catch trout in its lakes and streams, many Apaches still lived in wickiups, conical dirt-floored dwellings made of poles covered with branches and grass. A large sawmill owned by an outside company cut logs from tribal forests under rules set by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Today, nobody lives in a wickiup. The tribe runs its own sawmill, sells no uncut logs to outsiders and sets the rules that keep the forest more intact.
White Mountain storytellers have added new legends to their myths of the ancients -- tales of the 1960's and how the Indians took control of their own affairs. And no one enjoys telling them more than Ronnie Lupe, who has been tribal chairman for 20 of the last 28 years and is a dominant figure in White Mountain development. "The B.I.A. called all the shots," Lupe says, gesturing with practiced indignation as he recalls his first days in office in 1966. "They even opened my mail!" A Korean War veteran whose father had once been tribal chairman, Lupe (pronounced LOO-pee) was elected to the top post at the age of 36. As he sits at his desk, dressed in his standard jeans and cowboy shirt, Lupe laughs, remembering the reaction of local B.I.A. officials to his first solo trip to Washington to meet with Federal agencies.
"They were so mad," Lupe recalls. "They asked: 'Where did you stay? Who did you talk to?' I said, 'None of your business.' " The unending struggle to define tribal sovereignty has become part of Lupe's political persona, which he underscores by hanging a painting of the defiant Geronimo outside his office.
This assertion of independence was not so welcome then, though it is now encouraged by Federal law. Until the recent spread of casinos, few of the country's 300 reservations had managed it -- and even many tribes now profiting from gambling have essentially let outsiders run things. A Harvard advisory team that has provided development advice to many tribes says the White Mountain tribe is one of the most successful in managing its future. "We find a pattern," says Joseph P. Kalt, an economist and a director of the Harvard group. "A charismatic leader aggressively pushes the B.I.A. into the background. You see a growth in civic pride, a sense that the tribe is finally doing something." Keith H. Basso, an anthropologist and linguist at the University of New Mexico, identified two traits Lupe and members of his elected Tribal Council share with the most effective Indian leaders: they are rooted in their language and culture and are not afraid to deal aggressively with non-Indians and Government officials to advance tribal interests.
I met with Lupe last June, in between his trips to Phoenix to lobby for the right to open a casino. As we spoke, he broke off to take a call from the tribe's lawyer in Washington, who was pursuing water disputes and a suit against the Government for past mismanagement of tribal lands, then again for a call from his white economic planner down the hall. Out in the waiting room, people were seeking help with personal crises or bureaucratic tangles. Part corporate executive and part small-town mayor, Lupe spends much of his free time at community functions. His wife was out at the camp, helping the Hill family bake bread.
Despite his achievements, Lupe faces a hard-fought tribal election every four years -- the next one in April -- and his life has the air of a perpetual campaign. Last summer, he was already on the offensive. As I listened with an interpreter to his regular radio address, given in cadenced Apache, an occasional English word jumped out -- "hypocrite," "racism," "sovereignty." Lupe offered a ringing defense of his economic strategy, described his battles with the state and slipped a stiletto into his chief political rival, the director of the tribe's fish and game department, whose wife is a Navajo: "You can marry anyone you want to," said Lupe. "But I married a tribal member and she is always out there, helping people."
HISTORY GAVE THE WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHES SOME advantages. Like other Apaches, they raised fierce warriors who augmented food supplies by raiding other tribes and later Mexicans and Americans in astonishing feats of stealth and desert travel. But geographic isolation held down the extent of their conflict with the American military. Choosing accommodation as their survival strategy, the White Mountain group provided many of the scouts who helped the cavalry track down renegades like Geronimo in the 1870's and 1880's. The main high school is named after Alchesay, who won the Medal of Honor for his exploits and was a pre-eminent tribal leader early this century. The legacy stirs ambivalent feelings: Lupe tells me he does not consider "those who wore the blue coat" to be heroes.
Accommodation paid off. Apart from a brief relocation, the White Mountain tribe was allowed to stay on its ancestral lands. Other Apache groups, some mutually hostile, were uprooted and packed together in the San Carlos Reservation, in a more barren region just south of the White Mountains. The San Carlos Reservation was subjected to harsh military rule and to this day is plagued by crippling factional disputes and a sorry economic record.
The rugged range that once protected the White Mountain people became their chief source of wealth. By far the major industry is the Fort Apache Timber Company, which operates a sawmill that employs more than 300 Apaches at wages averaging $8.50 an hour. Another hundred work for logging contractors. In 1993, the sawmill had revenues of some $40 million and paid the tribe about $10 million in timber fees. The Sunrise ski resort provides work for another 200 Apaches, and when snows are good turns revenues of $6 million and profits of more than $1 million. Other smaller enterprises together net only a few hundred thousand dollars, but include the country's best elk hunting; hunters wait years to pay $11,000 for a guided trip. There is also a tribal liquor store, run reluctantly, on the theory that it is safer for drinkers to buy liquor nearby than to make the 45-minute drive to resort towns outside the reservation.
"Apache Aerospace" proclaims the big sign on a building in Whiteriver. It seems preposterous, especially when you get inside and find 15 employees cutting and sewing insulation at $7 to $10 an hour. It seems less so after talking to Marilyn Endfield, an M.B.A. who has just stepped down as chairwoman of the company and is studying public policy at Harvard. In the 1980's, trading on the Apache name, the tribe persuaded McDonnell Douglas Aerospace to form a joint venture to supply sewn parts for the Army's Apache attack helicopter. Endfield stepped up the technology and hiring at Apache Aerospace, starting with light sheet-metal work, gaskets and seals. The company, she says, "gets people to feel good about being Apache."
Not everyone is so directed. In some ways, Kenny Clawson resembles alienated teen-agers anywhere. A husky 18-year-old with hair to his shoulders, he spends his days hanging out at the tribal newspaper office, which he finds more interesting than the days of drinking and pot smoking that led him to drop out of high school, as nearly half all reservation students do. Many teen-agers are enamored of rap music and its stars and some are even gang wannabes. But Kenny says he finds rap "too slow." His passion is heavy metal music, the morbid and frenetic kind known as death metal. His ambition is to form the first all-Apache death-metal band. Kenny lives with his parents and younger brother in a trailer that has seen better days, above the postcard tableau of Cedar Creek, 20 miles from Whiteriver. His father works at the sawmill, but Kenny sees no prospects for himself there.
Still, this is neither white suburbia nor the inner city, and each evening he joins his parents and relatives for a game of volleyball at the high school. He prefers to speak Apache and urges his young cousin to do the same: "We are Apache! Why are we speaking English?"
That attitude is a measure of the tribe's strength, but Kenny's experience also reflects its woes. There are still nearly twice as many potential workers as paying jobs on the reservation. Half the population receives welfare or food stamps, alcoholism is rampant and the median per capita income is $3,805 a year.
And because of the Apache tradition of sharing with relatives, those with jobs do not live on a scale dramatically different from those without. A few White Mountain families, including the chairman, live in ranch-style houses, but most inhabit nondescript wood or cinder-block tract houses built with Federal money; some live in shacks or trailers that lack running water. Few have telephones, though nearly everyone seems to have a television.
Approximately half of the families belong to Christian churches. Lutherans came first, in 1893, only seven years after Geronimo's surrender, followed by other Protestants and then Roman Catholics. But the most popular in recent years have been aggressive evangelical and "miracle" churches. Lupe says he is not a Christian but is tolerant; his father, who died last year, had joined the evangelicals. And while some preachers campaign against tribal rituals, the Catholic priest embraces them as another route to God. Many Apaches say the church has brought welcome structure into their lives and, overall, religious conflict seems less pressing than one would expect: Apaches seem to blend beliefs as they find them useful.
The unending quest for income and jobs has led the White Mountain Apaches to ride the gambling wave. Two months ago, the tribe opened its first casino, at Hon-dah on a highway traveled by tourists near the northern edge of the reservation. It employs more than 75 tribe members and is projected to yield profits of about $1 million this year and $3 to $4 million in subsequent years. The casino's remote location and competition from other tribes, never mind Las Vegas, may limit revenues. Still, tribal planners envisage a bigger take as gaming becomes the focus of a year-round, family-oriented "destination" resort.
Even with a lift from gambling, the tribal council may be shouldering an impossible burden. Population growth of more than 3 percent a year is comparable to third-world rates. Half the tribe is 18 or younger, but no one wants to talk about family planning -- not surprising among people who were the target of policies of extermination within historical memory.
With a virtual absence of entrepreneurship -- not even small family shops -- the economy suffers the rigidity of a miniature socialist state. Lupe says he would like to see more individual enterprise, but tradition works against it: the pressure on working people to share earnings makes it hard to accumulate capital.
Tradition also works against finding employment off the reservation; most Apaches are extremely reluctant to live far from from their families and land. They say of themselves, only half joking, that Apaches get homesick even before they leave on a trip and sometimes talk themselves out of going at all.
THE APACHE BALANCING ACT IS EVERYWHERE VISIBLE AT THE camp where the Hill family prepares for the Sunrise. Though it is still a minority that can pull it off, many parents are ambitious for their daughters. The girl at the center of events, Shannon Pusher (she has the surname of her mother's ex-husband), who entered eighth grade this fall, seems a bit bewildered. I ask why she is doing it; some girls refuse. "I don't know," she says. Then, "My parents told me they wanted to have one since I was 4 years old."
As the women prepare the feast, a cluster of staggering men grab a drum and chant loudly, jamming Apache-style. Even as the rite begins, one dons a sombrero and keeps yelling "amigos." But the drunken rowdies are just shrugged off. Apaches assume that people are doing the best they can; harsh thoughts could force cancellation of the ceremony.
With noon's approach, the women put on their finest camp dresses, the men colorful shirts. A procession forms, led by the girl, her best friend and parents, followed by drumming, chanting spiritual leaders and the rest of the relatives. They set off in a rhythmic shuffle for the camp of the girl's godparents a quarter-mile away for more drumming, dancing and speechmaking. The girl and her family present a feast and gifts to the godparents. They are not related; another purpose of the ceremony is to make a lasting bond between extended families to strengthen the tribe. Over the course of the week, the two families will sleep in makeshift wickiups and the medicine man and his helpers will perform sacred rites.
Early the next Saturday, Shannon dresses in fine buckskin and before a crowd of friends and relatives begins a five-hour ritual in which she is transformed into Changing Woman, temporarily able to cure the sick and bring rain to thirsty crops. On Monday, the ceremonies completed, her family breaks camp and Shannon goes home to ride her mountain bike and play country and rap music on her new stereo. The ceremony has endowed her with longevity, strength, prosperity and a generous temperament. Her family has cemented ties with another. Her community has again been blessed with the protective goodness of Changing Woman.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
The Suburban Connection

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
"IF you build it, they will come," the philosophy expressed in "Field of Dreams," could serve as a history of Westchester County Airport. Still using its "temporary" post-World War II quarters, and without any effort to lure new airlines or passengers, the airport has seen traffic increase, by fits and starts, almost fivefold since 1982.
"If you unbuild it, they will still come" would also work as a motto, because the long-awaited replacement of the Quonset hut terminal has begun, along with construction of a much-disputed parking garage, making life for the airport's passengers nearly impossible. Yet the passenger figure for 1993 showed a rise from 1992, in contrast with the other suburban airports and New York's three big ones. 
 Westchester Airport is usually considered to be in White Plains, although it is actually in Harrison, along the Connecticut line, off Interstate 684. The two other major suburban airports are state-owned Stewart International, near Newburgh in Orange County, N.Y., off Interstates 87 and 84, and MacArthur Airport, off Interstate 485 in Ronkonkoma, L.I. The latter airport is usually known as Islip, for the town that owns it.
These airports follow the general patterns of air travel, and were hurt by the Gulf war and the recession, but they are thriving by providing travelers from the suburbs with a way to avoid highway traffic in the metropolitan area, and giving people from out of town a fast way to reach the Hamptons, Connecticut and upstate New York. Islip's passenger totals have bumped up and down between 1982 and 1993 but show a more than fourfold rise during this period. Stewart got its first scheduled flight in April 1990, and its passenger traffic, according to its spokeswoman, Judy Lekoski-Eurich, has risen steadily except for last year's notch down.
Passenger traffic can be counted two ways. Enplanements is the number of passengers who take off from the airport; total passengers, the number that enplanes and debarks. MacArthur enplaned 587,278 passengers in 1993, as opposed to 604,710 in 1992 -- a 3 percent drop. Stewart enplaned 370,659 passengers in 1993 and 403,351 in 1992, an 8 percent decrease. Westchester County enplaned 474,728 passengers in 1993, a 24 percent increase from 1992's 382,270. Responding to the observation that this was a big jump for a Quonset hut, Ingrid Meyer, who works for the airport administration, said, "Yes, and you feel it every Friday afternoon."
Of course, these numbers could be shrugged off by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Figures for 1993 are not complete but are expected to be down somewhat from 1992, when the total for Kennedy , La Guardia and Newark was 35.8 million enplanements. The 1993 total for the three suburban airports was 1.4 million.
 
The Snowbird Special
 Increasingly, suburban airports are offering direct flights to more distant places, particularly warm-weather areas, where suburban residents may have second homes or relatives.
Stewart, designated SWF, has 36 outbound flights for February, not all of them daily, and the majority to big hubs, where they link to other flights: American to Chicago and Raleigh-Durham (N.C.); Delta to Atlanta; Trans World Express to Kennedy; United Express to Newark, Dulles in Washington and Boston; USAir to Pittsburgh, and USAir Express to Philadelphia, Syracuse (N.Y.) and Buffalo.
For February, Westchester, designated HPN, has 80 outbound flights on eight airlines: American to Chicago; Carnival to Fort Lauderdale (Fla.); Delta to Boston and Philadelphia; Northwest to Detroit and Minneapolis; United to Chicago and New Haven; United Express to Dulles in Washington, Rochester (N.Y.) and Buffalo; USAir to Pittsburgh; USAir commuter lines to Baltimore-Washington, Binghamton (N.Y.), Boston, Burlington (Vt.), Philadelphia, Poughkeepsie (N.Y.), Syracuse (N.Y.) and Washington National.
Islip, designated ISL, lists its February activity as: American to Chicago and Raleigh-Durham (N.C.); Carnival to Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and West Palm Beach, Fla.; Continental Express to Newark; Delta Connection to Albany and Boston; Northwest Airlink to Boston; United Express to Dulles in Washington, and USAir to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington National, Syracuse (N.Y.), Baltimore-Washington, Albany, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) and Boston.
Alfred Werner, the manager, says about 70 flights, not all operating daily, arrive at the airport and a roughly equal number depart.
Carnival, a five-year-old airline owned by Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival Cruise Lines, operates out of Westchester and Islip and is the only one of the start-up airlines to use the suburbs. Max Buck, the marketing director, said the line began nonstop service from Islip to Fort Lauderdale in 1992 because the success that now-defunct Northeast and then Eastern had on this route meant demand was there. The line now has four daily flights from Islip: two to Fort Lauderdale and one each to Tampa and West Palm Beach. In spring, the schedule to Fort Lauderdale will drop to 10 trips a week from Islip.
Mr. Buck said other small airlines may not be trying the suburbs because new aircraft are required to meet noise limitations. Carnival uses new 737-400's.
The airline won in an auction for a takeoff and landing slot at Westchester, Mr. Buck said, and on Dec. 3 began offering an 8:25 A.M. flight to Fort Lauderdale from there daily except Saturday.
 
Terminal Amenities
 The airports offer the usual conveniences: food service, car-rental counters, motels nearby, taxi lines or special phones to call them. They also have places to sit, although in the case of Westchester, there are only about 20 seats. The parking situation, including fees, varies at the airports, although it is generally cheaper to park than at the Port Authority airports.
Stewart, with 10,000 state-owned acres, has abundant long-term and short-term lots, including spaces for the disabled. Fees range from $6 to $8 a day. The lots are managed by Apcoa. For parking information: (914) 567-0276.
Islip has 1,200 parking places that cost $6 a day, also operated by Apcoa, but Mr. Werner said these fill up on major holidays. Parking information for Islip residents: (516) 467-3210. Non-Islip residents: (516) 467-2468.
Westchester is difficult. The garage, recently a wall of snow-shrouded forms for poured concrete, is expected to be usable by August, but, as different plots of ground are ripped up, the parking concessionaire's employees must snake the autos into the sparse long-term spots.
"We have 300 spots to park on the airport grounds, more or less, depending on the day, compared with 1,200 before construction began," said the airport manager, Joel Russell. Mr. Russell said that valet parking off the airport property more than made up the difference. A fee for the valet service, depending on the length of stay, is added to the on-airport parking fee of $7.50 a day; off-airport parking is $12 for the first day and $8 a day after that. For parking information: (914) 946-3846.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S THE WORLD'S PRIORITY TASK?

 BODY:
By presenting apparently contradicting views on the subject of world population growth, it appears that there exist just two diametrically opposed camps: the demographers and the feminist groups. 
 Family planning is a complex issue, one that overlaps many issues, from the environment and economic development to gender equality and the rights of children. It is particularly important, in light of the coming International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, to emphasize that family planning is not a zero-sum game, in which a woman's right to choose is mutually exclusive to efforts to curb global population growth rates.

Charles Westoff is far off base in his indictment of the feminist agenda on reproductive issues.
The feminist agenda is exactly what is needed with regard to population issues. Policies that promote the economic, social, political and civil rights of women infuse reproductive options with real meaning and effectiveness. 
 For example, it is well documented that better educated women and women with employment opportunities have smaller families.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Forcing a Board To Hold a Meeting
 
Q. I live in a co-op that has had serious financial problems with the original sponsor that resulted in an auction sale of his shares in the co-op. During this time the co-op board never kept the owners informed of what was happening. The board does meet on a monthly basis, but the shareholders are not invited. Further, there has not been an annual meeting of shareholders in almost two years. Simply put, the shareholders have no idea what is going on in our building. 
 Is there anything we can do to force the board to have an annual meeting? And can shareholders be barred from attending monthly meetings? . . . Kathleen Carr Rickwood, Manhattan
 
A. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, there is no legal basis to force a board to have open meetings, and most co-op boards have closed meetings, particularly because there are certain legal and financial matters that are more appropriately discussed in a closed meeting.
Mr. Finder added that boards were required to hold annual shareholders' meetings and that if they did not the appropriate action would be to petition the board to hold the meeting and, upon its failure to do so, take the members to court, which can compel to board to hold the meetings.
 
The Right to Sublet A Co-op Apartment
 
Q. Can a co-op apartment board refuse to let an owner sublet his apartment even when it means the owner will be forced to sell at a loss of roughly 40 percent of what he paid for the apartment? . . . B. Swanstrom, Springfield, N.J.
 
A. According to Benjamin D. Lambert, a lawyer in Woodbridge, N.J., virtually all proprietary leases for co-ops provide that boards can refuse to let an owner sublet an apartment, regardless of the potential loss the owner may suffer. "The economic consequence to an owner doesn't really factor into the situation, as a legal matter," he said.
There are, of course, many buildings whose proprietary leases or boards of directors have established more permissive rules regarding subletting. Mr. Lambert suggested that you have your attorney review the building's proprietary lease and by-laws and examine any published building policies to determine whether there is any legal recourse.
Mr. Lambert added, however, that in New Jersey such restrictions were in peril. Last year, in fact, the State Legislature almost approved a bill that would have prohibited co-op boards, condo boards and homeowners' associations from barring or unreasonably restricting rentals regardless of what the underlying documents state. He said that the bill had been drafted in response to the difficult economic times and the belief that many property owners in these communities were being punished. He added, though, that such legislation would be undoing deed restrictions.
"One of the major issues that was raised was that you have a number of communities with restrictions, and people bought into those communities with the expectation that they would be owner-occupied," he said.
The bill, Mr. Lambert said, has already been reintroduced for the current legislative session in Trenton.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
The Quest for Shops Below Bushwick El

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
ASIDE from the fact that the J train still chugs along on elevated tracks above his shop, Ben Stewart hardly recognizes the Broadway he knew when he moved his offset-printing business to the Bushwick section of Brooklyn 19 years ago.
He arrived two years before the Great Blackout of 1977. The blackout set off a spree of looting and fires with effects upon Broadway's commercial life that linger to this day. Many small businesses withdrew from the district, never to return. 
 "It used to be so beautiful -- people came to shop on weekends," said Mr. Stewart. "After the blackout everyone moved out."
Not everyone. Not Pat Adipietro for one. Mr. Adipietro opened Krown's, a housewares and floor-covering business, on the corner of Broadway and Gates Avenue 44 years ago. Then, in 1986, the business moved and expanded, after buying a city-owned building at 1325 Broadway between Linden and Grove Streets. Now Mr. Adipietro has retired and his son Anthony, 35, runs the business in 7,000 square feet of well-stocked space. "We need more stores here," he said.
Stanley Henry also had a hardware store. Two years ago Mr. Henry bought city property -- 27,000 square feet on Broadway at Halsey Street -- with a view to expanding into the building-supplies business. He broke ground but foundered on a familiar rock -- no reasonably priced mortgage financing.
Late last year he found a funding source in the Community Capital Bank, a three-year-old Brooklyn-based, state-chartered commercial bank that specializes in loans to small businesses and nonprofit corporations in low- to moderate-income communities. It committed to a construction loan and permanent financing that will speed development to a conclusion late this year. There will be a 13,000-square-foot store plus on-site parking and storage space.
But the largest commercial project on Broadway since the blackout is about to get under way on five blocks mostly cleared along the northeast side of the street between Gates Avenue and Cornelia Street.
This one is will be an early test of a broad effort by the New York City Economic Development Corporation to generate retail development along commercial strips close to concentrations of recently completed city-assisted residential construction.
The successful respondent to a city request for developer proposals for the sites was the Broadway Bushwick Builders Corporation, a group with Jeffrey Stern and Daniel B. Gerard as development partners and Alex Goldin as the construction partner. They will build a total of 43,500 square feet of stores in two phases, with extensive on-site parking. Its cost is estimated at $5.5 million.
The first phase, already financed, will consist of 13 stores with a total of 21,000 gross square feet of space, plus parking, on two large sites between Palmetto and Woodbine Streets and Woodbine and Madison Streets.
The second phase will bring additional stores to land between Gates Avenue and Palmetto Street and between Madison Street and Putnam Avenue. The fifth site, between Putnam Avenue and Cornelia Street, will be reserved for parking to fulfill zoning requirements.
The first phase has a financing commitment from the Community Preservation Corporation, a consortium of banks whose usual role is as a construction and permanent lender to moderate-income multifamily housing. The project also has been helped by a second mortgage of $184,000 from the Economic Development Corporation and a $721,000 city grant. The State of New York Mortgage Agency has committed to insure the permanent mortgage, which will be sold to the New York City Police Pension Fund.
"SECURITY is important," said Mr. Goldin, the construction partner, in describing the project. The structures will have a precast concrete wall system, and roll-up metal gates will protect the fronts at night. Mr. Goldin, a 40-year-old investment builder who was a civil engineer in Russia before immigrating to the United States, is the principal in Century Building Associates, in Bush Terminal, Brooklyn. He has completed seven residential projects under the city's Vacant Building Program.
Other sites for the Economic Development Corporation retail development program have been chosen on Rockaway Avenue in Brownsville and Memorial Avenue in Coney Island. In the Bronx, sites have been selected on Southern Boulevard in Crotona Park East, on Third Avenue in East Tremont and in the Mott Haven section.
The Broadway stores are coming in the wake of a city housing program that has generated 3,000 new or rehabilitated units in Bushwick. The total includes 104 newly built two-family houses, with 68 more in construction and many more to come.
Eventually there will be about 800 new units in these houses, each owner having one rental apartment. Many more new two-family houses fill several blocks near the store sites on the Bedford-Stuyvesant side of Broadway, a community dividing line.
One residential project just beginning in Bushwick will put attached two-family houses on 40 lots immediately behind the new Broadway stores. The midblock sites are off Gates Avenue, Palmetto Street and Woodbine Street. The Bluestone Organization of Queens is the builder and Herbert H. Warman of Great Neck is the architect. Houses will sell for $126,700; the owner will have one rental tenant.
Build enough new housing and eventually an incoming population will support retail development, the theory goes. Bushwick has certainly "come back" residentially, with substantial financial effort from New York City and its intermediary with private builders, the New York Housing Partnership. The question is how successful the developers will be in attracting and holding financially strong stores that provide services that complement the commercial establishments already doing business in the area.
The developers have so far signed a discount variety store called Saverama to a 9,700-square-foot space on one block and a laundromat to a small store on another. Other tenant prospects include an eyeglass store, a shoestore, a jeweler, a check-cashing service, a pizzeria, a deli, a Blimpie's food operation and a variety store.
Rents at present are about $14 a square foot per year, the developers said.
The largest store is likely to be on the site near the Gates Avenue subway stop. There the prospects are for a chain clothing store or drug store with discount merchandise, said Jeffrey Stern, a development partner.
Assisting the developers in their relations with community residents and officials is the Ocean Hill-Bushwick-Bedford Stuyvesant Local Development Corporation, which prefers to use the acronym Obusty. It is dedicated to commercial revitalization on the entire mile-and-three-quarter length of Broadway from Myrtle Avenue on the west to the Eastern Parkway Extension on the east.
"We need apparel stores, stationers, a sporting goods store, an electronics store, florists," said Charles Sterling, the executive director. "We need family-style restaurants and more professional services. We don't have a bakery. We need that, too."
BUSHWICK once had two movie houses, an R.K.O. and a Loews. Both closed and nothing replaced them. A year ago, Marlowe's, which carried clothing for men, women and children, closed when the proprietor finally retired, Mr. Sterling said.
But new proprietors are always coming along. Many are Korean.
Michael Kim, a heater manufacturer who arrived from Seoul in 1976 and now operates the C.T.K. fish stores and Key Point toy stores in Bushwick, was encountered a few days ago as he supervised renovations at a vacant store at 1571 Broadway, at the corner of Halsey Street.
"It could become a pizzeria or a laundromat or an ice cream parlor," said Mr. Kim's son-in-law, Myung-Soo Lee, 35, who teaches marketing at Baruch College of the City University.
And at the corner of Broadway and Stuyvesant Avenue, Bang Keun Lee, 72, proudly took a visitor on a tour of the handsomely renovated interior of the long-closed limestone-and-marble edifice that was built for the Prudential Savings Bank in 1905. The Lee family bought it from a private owner three years ago and has been at work on a gut renovation with family members for 10 months.
The building will reopen in April as Brooklyn Steps, a dancing and martial arts school, said Mr. Lee's son, Suk Chan Lee, 40, who will run it. Another son, Yeon Chan Lee, an engineer, is in charge of construction.

Spate of Building Applications Heartens Greenburgh

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
SO far this year, the Town of Greenburgh in central Westchester County has had a spate of new-building applications, leading town officials to speculate on a possible economic turnaround.
"Every week, somebody's coming in with plans for a new development," said Paul Feiner, the Town Supervisor. "A lot of them are for little projects, but we're moving in the right direction." 
 Like most communities in the county, Greenburgh had been experiencing a steady erosion of building applications since the peak years of the mid-80's, when they averaged 40 a year in the town's unincorporated area alone, according to Stephen Lopez, the Town Planning Commissioner. Most of the commercial development is in the unincorporated area, which is about a third of the 31-acre town.
Applications to the town, which has jurisdiction over building permits only outside its six villages, hit bottom in 1992, with only 15 requests, Mr. Lopez said. "Then we saw our first significant pick-up last year when we reached 20," he said. And this year looks even better.
"We have 9 applications and I expect 10 by the end of this month," Mr. Lopez said last Wednesday. "That's half of what we had in all of last year."
The applications filed this year are for such diverse projects as a small two-lot residential subdivision, a 3,000 square-foot Boston Chicken franchise and an 80,000 square-foot Federal Express distribution warehouse.
Several of the projects filed last year have been approved or are in the later review stages, Mr. Lopez said. One of the largest is the Town Green, a 105-unit rental apartment complex approved for construction on Taxter Road, near the Saw Mill River Parkway.
"It's the first rental project we've had in the town in 33 years," Mr. Feiner said. "And one of the largest residental projects to be built in the two years I've been in office."
Two weeks ago site clearing began on the project, which, when completed, will consist of 12 buildings with 8 units each and one with 9 units. In addition, there will be a clubhouse and leasing office that will face a swimming pool.
The buildings, which will be on 16.9 acres, will be "New England clapboard style," according to Samuel B. Fuller, a vice president of Avalon Properties of New Canaan, Conn., the developer. One- and two-bedroom apartments, all with balconies, will rent for $1,000 to $1,600 a month, Mr. Fuller said. Construction is expected to be completed in 12 months.
Other projects on which construction is expected to begin this year include Ardsley Estates, a 34-unit one-family development to be built just south of the Village of Ardsley; a 160-bed nursing home on Grasslands Road at Stephens Lane and a 40,000-square-foot shopping center on Central Avenue, just south of the Midway Shopping Center.
Many town residents were surprised and upset, Mr. Feiner said, when two two-screen movie theaters on Central Avenue in the hamlet of Hartsdale closed in January. Joanne Parker, a spokeswoman for General Cinema Theaters, a Boston company that managed the theaters, said they had been closed because such small theaters were no longer economically viable.
BUT Mr. Feiner said he had been approached by two movie theater owners who wanted to build multiscreen theaters in the town.
"One of them wants to build a 10-screen theater," Mr. Feiner said. "And another already owns a 2-screen theater and wants to expand it to a 5-screen complex."
One of the reasons Greenburgh has been successful in attracting such business is "because word has gotten out that we have an open climate to the right kind of development," Mr. Lopez said.
"We're willing to work with developers and community groups to create solutions rather than dissension," he explained, adding that the town was "well-positioned in the county."
"We're not overbuilt like some of the more southern parts," he said. "And we're not really rural like the north county. We're accessible to several major population centers, including New York City."
One indication of the lengths the town is willing to go in order to encourage development can be seen in its current negotiations with Ciba Corporation, the Swiss chemical company, which is considering relocating from its 400,000-square-foot American headquarters on a 60-acre campus near Ardsley to one of four sites in Westchester. It is also considering Connecticut.
In an effort to keep the company in Greenburgh, the town has spent the last year working on a deal that would involve Ciba's moving to 400,000 square feet recently vacated by I.B.M. at the Tarrytown Corporate Center, on Route 119 outside the Village of Tarrytown. As part of the proposal, Halpern Enterprises, a Tarrytown developer, would buy Ciba's 12-building Ardsley campus, which would be used for a commercial and residential development, possibly involving 250 units of housing that would include congregate-care homes for the elderly.
Halpern, in turn, would be given the contract to build a 165,000-square-foot laboratory at the site outside Tarrytown. To achieve all this, the sites near Tarrytown and Ardsley would have to be rezoned and Route 9A, which runs outside the current Ciba property, would have to be upgraded.
The town is continuing to work with state and county officals to put the deal together, and Halpern Enterprises has already filed a rezoning application for the Tarrytown Corporate Park.
ERIC JACKSON, a spokesman for Ciba, acknowledged that his company was negotiating with Halpern, but said that it was too soon to say whether there was a deal. "We've been delighted with the town's help and assistance," Mr. Jackson said. "But there are still a number of issues to be worked out."
Mr. Feiner said it was "98 percent certain that Ciba will remain in Greenburgh," adding that "we're very close to making a deal with them."
In November, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo offered Ciba $13.25 million in low-cost loans, grants, tax abatements and other incentives, including $5 million in utility savings from the New York State Power Authority if it stays in Westchester. Ciba is now a Consolidated Edison customer.
But even if the Ciba deal does go through, and the town continues its present rate of attracting building interest, Mr. Lopez does not expect a return to the boom years anytime soon.
"Historically, when there's a pick-up in building applications, there is usually a lag of several years before we see an actual recovery," he said. "Times have changed. We have such an overbuilt office market now. And even though residential sales have been good, there's still a backlog of homes.
"Until we've absorbed most of that, it won't return to a builder's market. But hopefully, for the next few years, we'll continue to see incremental improvement."

HEADLINE: New York Apartment Rents Moving Up

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
BUOYED by a tightening of the market and an improvement in the regional economy, unregulated rents in Manhattan moved upward in 1993, reversing the previous year's downturn, real-estate agents and analysts said.
The increase, many of them said, was especially notable on the Upper West Side, where rental space is at a premium and which is rapidly becoming a magnet neighborhood for those interested in just that -- a neighborhood, and all that the word means. Agents said that Greenwich Village, SoHo and TriBeCa were also booming. 
 Regionally, however, Federal cost-of-living statistics showed the smallest rent rise in a quarter-century for New York, northeastern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. But Brooklyn and Queens showed larger increases in one survey. And in one trendy location, Hoboken, agents said that a tight market had driven rents considerably higher than they were a few years ago, though prices had recently begun to level off.
"Manhattan has changed from a tenants' market to a landlords' market," said Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a major New York brokerage. "It started at the end of 1992 going into the first six months of 1993, and it happened surprisingly quickly. From an oversupply it became not a shortage but a much more limited supply."
THE change has not created an extreme situation, such as in the mid-80's when prospective tenants would read obituary notices to find vacant apartments and would have to pay money under the table to get a place to live.
But until last year, unregulated rents in New York had dropped about 15 percent since the real-estate recession began in 1988, about half as much as the sale prices of co-ops and condominiums in the same period. And the ball is now in the landlord's court.
"Landlords have stopped giving concessions," Mr. Rogers said. "It hasn't gone all the way over, but it has tipped in the landlord's favor. A market where landlords paid the broker's fee has become one in which tenants do so."
Mr. Rogers said that rents had gone up from 5 percent to 7 percent or more, depending on the location. Inventory has dropped, he said, because many of the apartments on the market have already been rented. Except for some condominium rentals, he said, there was basically no new product, and the improvement in the sales value of co-ops meant that fewer of those apartments were coming on the rental market as sublets. Mr. Rogers said that a smaller factor was the tightening of sublet rules in co-ops.
At the Windsor Court, a 700-unit building at 155 East 31st Street, a one-bedroom unit that rented for $1,525 a month in 1992 brought $1,650 in 1993, an 8 percent rise, Mr. Rogers said. A two-bedroom unit in the building went up from $2,595 in 1992 to $2,730 in 1993, a 5.2 percent increase.
At the Normandie Court at 225 East 95th Street, rents were $1,395 for a one-bedroom in 1992 and $1,465 in 1993, up 4.95 percent. For a two-bedroom, they were $1,840 in 1992 and $1,935 in 1993.
On the West Side, at 30 Lincoln Plaza, a large building near Lincoln Center, a one-bedroom rose from $1,525 in 1992 to $1,675 in 1993, more than 9 percent, and a two-bedroom went up from $2,360 to $2,560.
"What's interesting is that the '93 levels are almost back at the '88 levels," Mr. Rogers said.
Changes in the rent market have little effect on residents of the city's estimated 1.3 million rent-stabilized or -controlled apartments, which make up about 70 percent of the 1.9 million apartments in the city. Unregulated apartments include those in buildings with fewer than six units and those built since 1973 without tax abatements.
The Feathered Nest, a major New York rental agency, said in its annual report, which is based on a survey of 8,959 apartments -- both regulated and market-rate -- that apartment rents in the borough had increased by an average of 5.6 percent in 1993. East Side rents went up 5.9 percent and those on the West Side rose a whopping 10.6 percent, the survey said. A year ago, the Feathered Nest survey reported that rents in 1992 either declined or stayed the same for all types of apartments.
Rents for studio apartments, the report said, increased by 5.6 percent, one-bedrooms 6.7 percent, two-bedrooms 4.1 percent and three-bedrooms 3.6 percent. The average rent of a one-bedroom was $1,550 in 1993, and $1,475 in both 1992 and 1991. A two-bedroom in 1993 was $2,350 a month, compared with $2,275 in 1992 and the same $2,350 in 1991. For a three-bedroom, it was $3,800 in 1993, $3,600 in 1992 and $3,650 in 1991. A studio was $1,025 last year, $950 in 1992 and 1993, $3,600 in 1992 and $3,650 in 1991. A studio was $1,025 in 1991. A studio was $1,025 last year, $950 in 1992 and $1,025 in 1991.
Nancy Packes, president of the Feathered Nest, said that one reason for the rent increases was a more than 40 percent decline in the number of available apartments between 1990 and 1993: 17,498 listings in 1990, versus the 8,959 last year.
ANOTHER index of the market is the number of showings that a prospective tenant goes on and the number of apartments the tenant sees now as against 1992, Ms. Packes said.
"These days, when people rent through us we show them an average of five apartments over two showings," Ms. Packes said. "In 1992, it was 15 apartments and five showings."
Among the reasons for the turnaround, she said, are the fact that there has been very little new construction since 1988, "and that, combined with a low-interest rate environment, has helped the co-op sale market to improve and take the supply out of the rental market."
In addition, she said, corporations are beginning again to relocate employees in New York. "Three out of five of our customers are corporate relocations," she said.
The resurgence of the West Side, she said, is attributable in part to the fact that the West Side is much smaller than the East Side and has fewer apartments available -- only about one-third the number on the East Side.
"But a key reason," she said, "is that people are seeking a more neighborhood-like environment, which the West Side represents and which the East Side doesn't have. The East Side is not a neighborhood."
Clark Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company, also said that the Upper West Side had seen the largest and most consistent rent increases. "There's a perception that people like the West Side," Mr. Halstead said. "They say it's more fun, more vibrant, that it has more texture. It's not as homogeneous as the East Side. Access to parks generally is better. And people feel that transportation, with its two major subway lines, is also better."
In addition, he said, the West Side is relatively small, "while the East Side just goes on and on forever."
Mr. Halstead and Brian Edwards, the head of his rental division, said that also because of the desirability of neighborhood feeling, and because of their proximity to a re-emergent Wall Street, Greenwich Village, SoHo and TriBeCa were also hot properties.
"We don't have statistics to back this up yet, but the downtown rental market has been extremely strong," Mr. Edwards said, "specifically in SoHo and TriBeCa. The prices we see lofts being rented for are really quite impressive." And the renters, he said, "are the young Wall Street people who are making those large salaries and high bonuses."
Ms. Packes said Greenwich Village "is as hot as it could possibly be." Mr. Halstead and Mr. Edwards said that the largest increases they had seen in the last six months were in the rents for units at the upper end of the market.
"The larger units, from 4 1/2 to 7 rooms, have seen increases anywhere from 7 to 15 percent," Mr. Edwards said.
Their survey of 800 apartments on the West Side, for example, showed that two-bedroom apartments with a dining room or a convertible third bedroom in a prewar doorman building now rented for from $2,900 to $3,400 a month, compared with from $2,600 to $3,000 last August. In a postwar doorman building, the figures are $2,600 to $3,100 now, against $2,400 to $2,900 in August.
One-bedroom apartments in prewar doorman buildings on the West Side that were $1,400 to $2,000 last August are now $1,550 to $2,100.
ON the East Side, based on a sampling of 1,000 apartments, their survey found that standard prewar two-bedroom apartments in doorman buildings were $2,300 to $3,000 last August and had gone up to from $2,500 to $3,300. Two-bedrooms in postwar doorman buildings that were $2,200 to $2,500 last summer are now $2,300 to $2,700.
On the lower end of the market, though, Mr. Edwards said, "the increases are more gentle, not as dramatic." And some East Side figures had even fallen: The top studio price in a modern high-rise had slipped from $1,600 to $1,525 in the same period. Similarly, the top rent for a modern high-rise one-bedroom on the East Side was down from $2,100 to $1,900.
But Mr. Halstead said that in general, rents on the very smallest apartments were also moving up. "The number of small units in Manhattan far exceeds the number of large ones," he said, "but so does the demand."
Entry-level employees are coming into New York in larger numbers, he said, taking new jobs and "soaking up the apartments," a big change from the situation three years ago in which people were losing jobs and moving out of Manhattan.
Statistics are tricky things, of course, and often depend on what's being counted; another survey, while agreeing with the general direction of rents, reported different findings for the Upper West Side.
A survey of 900 rental units by the National Cooperative Bank showed that the average rent per room in the New York area -- which in the report includes Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Westchester -- had increased 8.2 percent in 1993, a sharp change from the 6.3 percent decrease the report had shown in 1992.
"The rental market, after the softening in 1992, appears to have stabilized once again," said Grace A. Huebscher, the bank's corporate vice president.
The report saw an increase of 14.6 percent in Lower Manhattan, after a 14.8 percent drop in 1992; 14.5 percent in midtown, after a 9 percent rise in 1992, and 2.8 percent on the Upper East Side, after a 2.7 percent decrease the previous year. But contrary to the other surveys, it said that rents per room on the Upper West Side had decreased 5.5 percent in 1993, compounding a 4.2 percent drop in '92.
"But our report is based on transactions we were doing in the marketplace that year, and the decrease could have been due to our concentrating on a part of the Upper West Side that was weaker," Ms. Huebscher said.
The Cooperative Bank also found in its survey that rents involving its transactions in Brooklyn and Queens had gone up by 8.9 percent last year, after rising 7.5 percent in 1992.
In northeast Queens, Steven Meyer, an owner-broker at Bay-Benjamin Real Estate in Bay Terrace, said that rents have "basically been stable."
"I wouldn't say they've gone down," Mr. Meyer said. "I would say they've been stable and consistent."
But Mr. Meyer, whose area includes Bayside, Bay Terrace, Douglaston, Little Neck, Flushing and Auburndale, said that in luxury buildings, rents in top-of-the-line apartments have in some cases gone up.
CONCERNS about the economy have made some people skeptical about buying, he said, and "sometimes in a luxury building we find we have people waiting in line to get a specific type of apartment."
Available rentals, he said, include condominium and some co-op units, rent-stabilized buildings and apartments in two-family houses. A one-bedroom apartment in a two-family house "could be as low as $650 and as high as $800," he said, while a three-bedroom, two-bath duplex in a two-family would be about $1,200 a month.
At the Bay Club, a 1,037-unit, two-building luxury condominium off 23d Avenue and Corporal Kennedy Boulevard in Bayside, rents have gone up from 5 to 10 percent in the last year, Mr. Meyer said. A two-bedroom apartment at the Bay Club, which has an indoor health club, indoor pool, racquetball courts and gym, goes for from $1,600 to as much as $2,300 or $2,400, he said.
"A lot depends on the demand at a particular time," Mr. Meyer said. "If the inventory is low, prices will go up for that month. But if three or four apartments come on the market at the same time and compete against each other, prices could be a little bit lower."
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that 1993 had seen the smallest increase in rents in a little more than a quarter century on the Consumer Price Index for New York, northeastern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.
The increase, 2.1 percent, was the smallest since 1966, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, adding that in the late 1980's it had been as high as 7 percent.
"It reflects both a weakness in the New York region's economy and a weakness in the rental market," he said. "There is a great deal of resistance to rent increases." He added that he could not provide statistics broken down for specific parts of the region.
The increase, he said, had been 3.4 percent in 1992, 2.8 percent in 1991, 4.1 percent in 1990 and 7 percent in 1989.
In popular sections of the region, however, such as Hoboken, with its proximity to Manhattan, its gentrification, its PATH trains and the Hoboken Ferry to the World Financial Center and Wall Street, rents have gone up.
"There's a housing shortage, pure and simple, and people want to live in Hoboken," said Deno Bogdanos, a broker with Corporate Realty in Hoboken. "People equate Hoboken in desirability with Battery Park City and Brooklyn Heights and Fort Lee. If I have a halfway decent apartment, it's rented in about two days."
Mr. Bogdanos said one-bedroom apartments were renting for from $900 to $1,200 and two-bedrooms for from $1,300 to $1,700, compared with $700 to $900 for a one-bedroom and $1,000 to $1,300 for a two-bedroom three or four years ago.
"There are always apartments that come in a little bit lower," he said, "but about 85 percent of the apartments rent in that price range."
The apartment situation, he said, was in sharp contrast to the sales market, which had "dipped 15 to 20 percent" in price and about 50 percent in volume in recent years.
PEOPLE who were still making good salaries but were holding off buying in an uncertain market were willing to pay "top dollar" for the rental they wanted, he said.
He added, however, that rents had begun to level off about six months ago, because the prices were "all the market will bear."
A major reason for the apartment shortage, he said, was a sewer moratorium that New Jersey placed on Hoboken a few years ago. The moratorium provided that sewage quantity could not be increased on any given parcel of property and essentially prevented the building of any new housing. The moratorium, he said, was lifted a few weeks ago, "but it's too soon to say if there will be any new construction -- though I'm sure there will be."
Stephen Misyak, a sales agent with Wide World Realty in Hoboken, said he thought the lifting of the moratorium would lead to "a little more development."
Rents, Mr. Misyak said, were currently about $650 to $700 for "a shabby one-bedroom or studio, going as high as $1,400." Two-bedroom apartments, he said, began at $900 and went up to about $2,200.
"You can find cheaper apartments on the west side of town," he said, "which is considered not as desirable, scenic or aesthetically pleasing as the east side." In addition, he said, "rents increase as the proximity to the PATH station increases; people love to be able to hop off the train from Manhattan and walk four or five blocks to their home."
A two-bedroom apartment with hardwood floors, an eat-in kitchen, central heating, air-conditioning and an alarm system that goes for $1,450 on the east side of town might be had for as low as $950 on the west side, he said.
Mr. Bogdanos said he thought rents in Hoboken would continue to level off because as the economy improved people were coming back into the market to purchase homes. "The traditional sales market is returning," he said.
But in Manhattan, Mr. Rogers of Douglas Elliman said he thought the 1993 trend of rent rises would continue throughout 1994, taking the market to where it was before the post-1988 dip.
"I see prices going up 5 to 10 percent this year, to the level rents were in 1988, or just above," he said. "Things are going to stay tipped in the landlord's favor."

Beethoven: Quartets and Symphonies

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN 

 BODY:
WORKS by Beethoven are in abundance this week starting at 8 P.M. on Tuesday when the Tokyo Quartet advances its complete string quartet cycle with the fifth of six scheduled recitals at Sprague Memorial Hall in New Haven. On tap this time: Opus 127, and the First Razoumovsky, Opus 59, No. 1.
Three days later and down the street at Woolsey Hall, the Philharmonia Orchestra of Yale welcomes two other university ensembles, the Glee Club and the Camerata, for an 8 P.M. Friday performance of the Ninth Symphony. Tiffany Jackson, Jane Dutton, Matthew Polenzani and Bruce Baumer are the vocal soloists, with Gunther Herbig, music director of the Toronto Symphony, on the podium. The number for reservations for these Yale events is 432-4158. 
 Beethoven's Eighth opens the 8 P.M. Saturday concert of the Farmington Valley Symphony at First Church of Christ Congregational, although the the group's conductor, John Eells, heads on from there to three works of our own century and country, Aaron Copland's "Ceremonial Fanfare" and "Billy the Kid" plus, with Ron Krentzman as clarinet soloist, the "Dance Concerto" by the Hartt faculty composer Stephen Gryc (677-1321 or 651-9962). And Beethoven's C Major Piano Quartet will be on the program, along with chamber music of Brahms, Mozart and Mahler, when Musicians from Marlboro play at 8 P.M. Saturday in the Stamford Jewish Center (322-7900).
The Berlin Chamber Orchestra has included Jorgensen Auditorium in Storrs on its American tour list, its 8 P.M. Wednesday program ranging from Five Pieces for Strings by Corelli and Bach's "Art of Fugue" to a pair of 20th-century Russian masterworks, Stravinsky's "Apollon Musagete" and Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C Minor (486-4226).
The Waterbury Symphony, continuing its music director search, welcomes Philip Greenberg to the podium for its 8:15 P.M. concert on Saturday at the Fine Arts Center. The young maestro, currently music director of the Savannah Symphony, has chosen to start the program with a novelty, the Festival Overture by the Hartford native Dudley Buck. The composition is based on "The Star Spangled Banner" (which, in 1877, was years away from becoming the National Anthem). Thereafter, the program contains more standard repertory: Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 1, with 15-year-old Elizabeth Zeltser the guest soloist, and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 5 (574-4283).
At 8:30 P.M. Saturday, an all-American evening begins at Klein Memorial Auditorium, with the guest conductor Dorian Wilson leading the Greater Bridgeport Symphony in Copland's "Appalachian Spring" and Gershwin's "American in Paris," while the Connecticut-based Elite Syncopation, a quintet named for one of Scott Joplin's most famous rags and devoted to performances of vintage American popular music, contributes additional splashes of ragtime and early jazz favorites by Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington, among others (576-0263).
For 20 years, the South Congregational Choir, under its music director Richard Donohue, has developed intriguing programs of music for Lent and Easter, not only for presentation at its home church in Hartford, but for interested audiences in other communities. More than just choral concerts, these events also involve poetry readings, songs, instrumental pieces and even a certain amount of audience participation. The works this year are typically far-ranging in stylistic content, from a Psalm by Orlando di Lasso to the Kyrie and Sanctus sections of Vaughan Williams's Mass in G Minor to a Bach sarabande for solo cello. The program will be given on three successive Sunday afternoons at 4: next week in Second Congregational Church of Manchester (649-2863), on March 13 at St. Francis of Assisi in Torrington (482-5571) and in Hartford on March 20 (249-8627).
A very different sort of vocal attraction will be on the boards at 3 and 7 P.M. next Sunday at the Garde Arts Center in New London. It's a touring production of the multiple award-winning musical that kept Broadway audiences applauding for more than six years, Joe Darion and Mitch Leigh's "Man of La Mancha" (444-7373).
"Recession and all, we're back for our fourth season of Chamber Music Brunch at Zenny's," the cellist who founded and directs the Sunday recitals at the restaurant in Storrs, Warren Lash, said, "the beauty and intimacy of the room, the gourmet food, and incomparable music played by internationally renowned artists create an ambiance rarely matched at chamber music events." The edibles will be served next Sunday morning at 11:30, followed by music for the soul via the string quintets of Mozart and Brahms, played by Mr. Lash with the violinists Theodore Arm and Ida Kavafian, and the violists Steven Ansell and Steven Tenenbom (429-7510).
The Wilton Candlelight Series, with 45 years of presentations under its belt, concludes its season at 4 next Sunday afternoon, with the Emerson String Quartet doing the musical honors in the Congregational Church with Haydn, Schubert, Webern and Shostakovich (762-9353).
And while in a few months, it'll be time to talk about the 12th annual Connecticut Early Music Festival, next Sunday also closes the circle on the Festival's first winter cycle, the "Soirees Musicales" at Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London. The Tomasini Quartet -- the violinists Carol Lieberman and Julie Levin, the violist Barbara Wright and the cellist Myron Lutzke will appear at the final 4:30 and 7:30 P.M. recitals. The players will use period instruments to perform more Haydn and Schubert, plus a quartet by their namesake Italian composer (444-2419).

HEADLINE: Secession Is the Talk of Rowayton

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
A VISITOR to Rowayton could understandably think of it as a picturesque coastal New England town. It has, after all, a post office, a fire station, a cemetery, a school, a library, banks, churches, restaurants, a variety of stores, its own beaches, even a Civil War cannon. Not to mention a scenic waterfront, complete with marina, boatyards and a ship chandlery.
Indeed, most of its residents perceive Rowayton as a separate community, a place with a special cachet and charm about it. "There's always been a certain distintiveness about Rowayton; it's a special place," said Burton Shatz, a longtime resident and president of the Rowayton Civic Association. 
 Distinctive, yes, and most of its inhabitants, asked where they live, are bound to say "Rowayton." This is, however, hardly a separate entity. Rowayton, in fact, is a village within the City of Norwalk. As some longtime residents like to point out, a writer once dubbed it "the Athens of South Norwalk."
But now a group of Rowaytonites, angered over a recent city revaluation which they contend will disproportionately raise their property taxes starting July 1, is trying to establish a permanent identity by seceding from Norwalk. The idea is to either become an independent municipality or affiliate with Darien on the west bank of the Five Mile River.
"Everyone I've talked to is in favor of secession," said Edward F. Ryle Jr., the leader of the secessionist movement.
About 40 miles to the east, an even larger group has been actively working towards secession from New Haven. The group, formally known as the East Shore Secession Organization, includes residents of the Fair Haven, Morris Cove and Annex sections along New Haven's shoreline. As in Rowayton, taxes have been the main impetus in a secessionist movement which began more than a year ago.
In both cases, secession is an extreme longshot, according to state legislators and other officials -- and even some of the secessionist proponents.
"There's no mechanism in the State Constitution or in any state statutes that would permit secession," said State Representative Reginald Jones of Darien, a Republican who also represents Rowayton. "So the state legislature would have to enact legislation permitting groups to appeal to the state to secede. And given the temper of the times -- when regionalism is becoming increasigly popular -- I don't think the legislature is going to allow secession." If Rowayton does pursue that route, however, "it would be easier to affiliate with Darien then set up their own town," he added.
But despite a long and close link between Rowayton and Darien -- indeed, it has been said that many Rowaytonites feel more closely attuned to Darien than to Norwalk -- Darien does not seem prepared to roll out the red carpet for the would-be secessionists.
"There's a good bond beween Darien and Rowayton, but I truly believe there would not be a favorable response from the town to any proposed affiliation with Rowayton," said Henry Sanders, the Darien First Selectman. "Our schools are already overflowing and it would be hard to add additional services. So it would be a very hard sell."
It would also, no doubt, be a very hard sell to the rest of the city of Norwalk, which would stand to lose a huge amount of tax money from one of its most affluent sections. "First, there probably would have to be a referendum on the issue in Rowayton and then one for the entire city," Donald F. Reid, the Norwalk Corporation Counsel, said. "Then, assuming passage, there would have to be a special act of the legislature for the secession appeal."
State Senator Robert Genuario of Norwalk, who represents all of Norwalk and two-thirds of Darien, said he thought the secession movement has "no chance."
"Secession of affluent areas like Rowayton would further isolate poor sections of cities and aggravate the existing problem wherein cities pay higher property taxes than suburbs," Mr. Genuario, a Republican, said. "The secession movement doesn't go to the root of the problem, which is the overall property tax structure in the state, which has to be examined."
Another Norwalk legislator, Councilman Rollo J. Giannini, a Republican whose district includes Rowayton, described the secession movement as "a little bit extreme." "I can understand their frustrations over the reassessment," he explained. "Something went wrong there on the taxes. I can't see property values going up so high during a recession."
Mr. Ryle, a salesman for Ring's End Lumber Inc. in Darien as well as leader of the Rowayton secession move, said he thought that assessments in Rowayton would double, compared with far lesser increases in most of the city once the new mill rate is set, probably next month.
"It's extremely unfair," he said. "We're sending the City of Norwalk about $7 million a year in taxes and getting back beween $3 and $4 million in services. And I'm willing to bet that if we look at the Grand List, Rowayton alone would compare with about a quarter of the towns in Connecticut. Yet we don't have any representation from Rowayton in the City Council. The city just doesn't take us seriously."
Mr. Ryle and Mr. Shatz have been around long enough to remember when Rowayton had perhaps as many summer residents as it did year-round people. Many of its homes are former summer cottages which from the 1930's to the 1950's attracted such celebrities as the actresses Madeline Carroll and Betsy Palmer, as well as Don Wilson, the announcer on the Jack Benny radio and television programs, and writers including A.C. Spectorsky, the author of "The Exurbanites."
Year-round residents have included the late actor Horace McMahon, a native of Norwalk, and Andy Rooney, the writer and television personality, who has lived in Rowayton for four decades.
 
The Arrival of Commerce
 At the end of World War II, Rowayton had a year-round population of about 2,500. But by the 1980's, that population had doubled, and it remains at about 5,000. Commercial development also increased as a number of office buildings were constructed on the river side of Rowayton Avenue, the business heart of the community.
"Most people in Rowayton were against that development, and we said so, but the city ignored us," Mr. Ryle said. "We've had virtually no self-determination."
Besides its own identity, Rowayton, also has its own budget. Usually about a half-million dollars is raised annually through taxes to maintain the fire station, which is staffed by unpaid volunteers, and pay for library and beach expenses, street lighting and some other services. "Rowayton's always been slightly different, although there's no doubt that a lot of the people feel that they're a part of Norwalk," Mr. Shatz, an architect, said. "But it's changed a bit, and the average age of homeowners nowadays is younger. There are also more houses valued at more than a million dollars than there used to be."
No one seems able to recall when a section of a town or city was able to secede in Connecticut. The last time part of one town became a separate entity was in 1921 when the eastern part of Orange became the town of West Haven. "But that appears to have been mutually agreed upon,' said Peter Bartucca, the manager of Records and Legislative Services for the Secretary of the State's Office in Hartford. "And, prior to that, the last time it happened was when Ansonia split from Derby in 1889. But apparently there was no animosity in either case."
About 20 years ago, a group in Georgetown, a village that takes in parts of Ridgefield, Wilton, Redding and Weston, tried to establish a separate municipality, but was rebuffed in the General Assembly.
"We got George Guidera, who was then a state representative and is now the First Selectman of Weston, to introduce a bill in the Legislature that would have set up an enabling act allowing us to secede," Jerry Edwards, who lives in the Georgetown section of Wilton and who led the drive, recalled. "But all the powers-that-be in the four towns got together and applied pressure, and the bill died in committee."
Now, as then, Georgetown, like Rowayton, has most of the amenities of a town -- post office, fire station, school and so on, as do a number of other villages in the state such as Southport, an affluent coastal enclave in Fairfield.
"Many years ago, when a new town was formed in the State, it often was because of a church," Robert Nye, the Town Clerk of Waterford, and a historian, said. "For example, Waterford was a part of New London until 1801 when it decided to go on its own. That was mainly because most of the residents of Waterford were Baptists and they had a Baptist church in the area where they lived. By contrast, in New London almost everyone was affiliated with the Congregational Church. But even back then, taxes were a factor, and the people in Waterford, being a considerable distance from the heart of New London, felt they weren't getting their tax money's worth. For instance, if there was a fire in Waterford, there was no way the New London Fire Department could get out there in time to put it out."
 
Three Tries for Secession
But even at that, it took three attempts -- in 1795, 1797 and 1801 -- before secession was accomplished, Mr. Nye pointed out. Then, he added, in 1836 sections of Lyme and Waterford in effect seceded and merged to form the town of East Lyme.
But secession supporters in Rowayton and New Haven face an even more difficult battle. "Coming out for secession is a great vehicle for venting frustrations," said Matthew Naclerio, a Democratic alderman whose constituency includes some of the secessionst supporters on New Haven's east shore. "People see their taxes go up and services decrease, and they think that leaving the city may be the answer. But it flies in the face of regionalism, which is the trend throughout the country. So I think the secessionists are going in the wrong direction."
But despite all of the obstacles, the Rowayton group seems undaunted. "We've had enough, and we think secession is feasible," Mr. Ryle said. "We're not planning on giving up."

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
MEMO TO: Hollywood
FROM: New Jersey 
 Congratulations!
Your brilliantly conceived strategy to prevent New Jersey residents from seeing the finest new films in the state's movie theaters has never been more successful!
Because of your calculated distribution decisions, in the last few months, more movie-starved New Jersey residents have been unable to see more desperately sought-after new movies than ever before.
Time to take a bow, Hollywood! It can't have been easy to deny so many movies to so many people.
Oh yes: You know the names of the movies. You kept them away from us for weeks after their opening, limiting their distribution in New Jersey while more supposedly "sophisticated, prestigious" audiences could see them across the country: "Schindler's List," "In the Name of the Father," "Philadelphia," "Short Cuts," "Six Degrees of Separation,' "Farewell My Concubine" and "The Snapper," to name just a few. O.K., not all of these films were made in Tinseltown. But since your distributors control so much movie booking these days, you can understand why we blame you, Hollywood!
To be sure, your deep-thinking marketing plan to keep Garden Staters out of their movie theaters seems really strange. After all, as anyone who lives in New Jersey knows very well, there are clusters of highly discerning filmgoers all over the state. We watch "Entertainment Tonight" and "At the Movies" and subscribe to Premiere. We follow Siskel and Ebert as it moves from channel to channel to channel.
In fact, Hollywood, thanks to your considerable marketing efforts, most New Jersey folk are bombarded by all of the media that assault the citizens of New York City and Philadelphia with dozens of newspaper, television and radio reviews of the latest movies -- as well as ads, commercials and feature stories about these films' stars and directors.
As a result, we talk to our friends about forthcoming films over dinner, and debate their watchability with colleagues at the water cooler. Indeed, this is exactly what your marketing strategists intended, Hollywood: New Jersey moviegoers are primed to see the best new films. We have a large amount of disposable income that we put aside for moviegoing, and we're eager to spend it.
And then what happens? Someone asks the inevitable question about the hot new movie: "Have you seen it?" Which is followed by the unavoidable New Jersey response: "It's not playing anywhere near me." Or: "Yes, I drove 50 miles to see it at a theater on the highway." Or: "Yes. I saw it in New York."
Hollywood, we want to see the hot movies now, not next spring. But what's playing in the plexes? "Terminator IX," "Splash and Splatter VII," "The Obnoxious Undead II," "Rap 2 Kill," "Fatal Screenplay" and "The Happy Hobbit Family." In short, a glut of mass-market films that can be seen in any multiplex in any mall in the country. But we couldn't even go to "Schindler's List" when we really wanted to see it. It's a rarity to have quick access to the quality films that reviewers have labelled "every intelligent person's must-see."
We admit it. We thought: shame on you, Hollywood. You know that there are highly sophisticated audiences in the state for quality new films. You have seen the lines going around the block for the increasing number of sneak previews you've been holding throughout New Jersey to boost new releases. You know that specialized films, like "The Piano," "The Remains of the Day" and "Shadowlands" can do wonderfully well in the right theaters in New Jersey.
So what's the excuse for keeping these winners from us for weeks or even months? "Platforming" -- that's the movie-industry response. It's a delayed distribution plan, Hollywood's version of the time-release capsule. The idea is that some films need time to reach a level of high public awareness. This strategy was used in marketing "The Crying Game" to good effect.
But we've wondered: why not more platform locations in New Jersey? We're not sophisticated or prestigious enough? And furthermore, why is it necessary to delay and delay the release of so many films that we're so desperate to see? Not just the Yugoslavian clog-dancing movie, but also films with such wide appeal as "Schindler's List" and "In the Name of the Father" (breathes there a woman in the state who did not want to see Daniel Day-Lewis in this role after the initial reviews appeared)?
The whole point of marketing is to build anticipation to a fever pitch: then you sell folks the product at the peak of interest. But with new films, again and again, the frenzy of the initial attention is met with delay and missed opportunity.
Therefore, many films have been torpedoed by the time-delay strategy. After the thrill of Hollywood hype is over, and the impulse to see a hot new film has faded, and no one is talking about it at the office. So, all too many moviegoers say: "Wait until it comes out on cable." Or: "I'll wait for the videotape."
Thus, a ton of movie-theater tickets go unsold.
Oh, sure: distributors have pointed to the failure of some special-interest films, and some foreign films that didn't do well at all when they played in the Garden State. But how many of them failed because they came to New Jersey movie theaters weeks, or months, after all the reviews and the buzz?
And so: For the longest time, New Jersey was resentful. Residents thought: this film-rationing is a grave injustice, the basest kind of discrimination against the Garden State. And for the longest time we wondered: how could the film-bookers be so stupid? How could they so misjudge New Jersey residents' level of sophistication? How could they be so ignorant of the mass population shifts of the last decade that have seen so many art-house-loving families from New York City move to New Jersey suburbs?
Finally we realized, of course, that no one could be that stupid, even movie-industry decision makers. That the distributors were crazy like the proverbial fox. That in fact, the whole distribution pattern was intended: all part of a benign conspiracy.
We can surmise that in a back room on a back lot somewhere in Tinseltown, the great entertainment conglomerates of Hollywood must have banded together to make a courageous and generous gesture: they agreed to sacrifice a large portion of profits from moviegoers in the state of New Jersey. What selflessness! It was a magnanimous decision to (1) favor the cable and video industries of the Garden State, (2) support the economies of New York and Pennsylvania, and (3) further family togetherness.
As hard as this is to believe, it must be true. Can you think of any other far-fetched explanation that might account for such an absurd situation?
Consider: More and more New Jersey residents, unable to see the hot new movies, are giving up. They're renting video tapes, or dialing up pay-per-view. Thus, they're giving a vital boost to these important sectors of the New Jersey economy.
Consider: More and more New Jersey film-lovers, impatient with the endless wait for new films, are driving to New York City for their must-see movies (or traveling to Philadelphia, if they live in southern New Jersey). Thus they are giving a much-needed boost to the movie-theater economy in neighboring states.
Consider: More and more New Jersey movie buffs, unable to see the films they want amid the glut of shock thrillers and action movies, are staying home. Clearly this is strong evidence for Hollywood's selfless strategy to support family values and to promote the concept of spending quality time with one's children.
And now, as we anticipate next month's Oscar frenzy, we will also be telling ourselves that it's all in a good cause. Really.
Hollywood, we are in awe of your humanitarianism.
We are trying to feel more grateful.
P.S.: Oh. But have you seen . . .?

HEADLINE: Public Invited To Forum on Anti-Semitism

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
THE Westchester Psychoanalytic Society, which does not often open its educational meetings to the public, is making an exception next month.
On March 7 the society, a group of 60 psychiatrists, will join with the Psychiatric Society of Westchester in presenting "Anti-Semitism: A Historic, Theological and Psychodynamic Exploration." The free meeting will take place at 8:15 P.M. in the main auditorium of New York Hospital-Westchester Division in White Plains. 
 A panel consisting of Dr. Norman Weiss of Scarsdale, Dr. Harold P. Blum of Roslyn, L.I., and the Rev. Robert S. MacLennan, the former senior minister of the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church in Scarsdale, will examine the phenomenon of anti-Semitism as it has evolved from pre-Christian times to the present. In addition, there will be an exhibition of historic anti-Semitic medals, postcards and other items from the collection of William Stern of Scarsdale.
Dr. Weiss, secretary of the Psychoanalytic Society, said he had the idea for the meeting soon after receiving his master's degree in Jewish studies last May from Columbia University. He said he would present a history of the perceptions and fantasies about Jews and show how these perceptions increasingly became dehumanized. For example, he said, a Jew was said to lose his "foetor Judaicus," or Jewish odor, immediately after converting to Christianity.
 
Medieval Perceptions
 "The medieval stories about a stench contributed to stories of the Jew as a demon," Dr. Weiss said. "It was not a leap to see a Jew as vermin, not human."
Dr. MacLennan, a specialist in early Christian anti-Jewish literature, will examine the sources of anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism in second-century writings and will also discuss, Dr. Weiss said, the tendency of some contemporary Christian scholars to "invent the Jews they write about."
Dr. MacLennan now lives in Princeton, where he serves as a consultant and works on independent projects.
In his talk, Dr. Blum will explore the psychodynamics of anti-Semitism, discussing the link between the Jews as "Christ-killer, anti-Christ and historic scapegoat" with an emphasis on the Medieval perception of the Jews as Devil. Dr. Weiss said Dr. Blum would also discuss "the significance of the Jew as a devalued, despised, all bad narcissistic object," which he said was the view that led to the Holocaust.
 
Defying Explanation
 Mr. Stern, who owns Multigon Industries in Mount Vernon, a manufacturer of diagnostic ultrasound equipment, said he met Dr. Weiss through their common interest in collecting ancient Jewish and Roman coins. He said some of the German and Austrian medals he will show at the meeting are engraved with caricatures of Jews wasting corn during years of famine or being hanged as villains. The medals, which date from the 17th century, are also inscribed with texts accusing Jews of evil deeds.
In addition to anti-Semitic postcards printed in France during the Dreyfus trial, the anti-Jewish tract of Martin Luther and other material, the exhibition will include "notgeld," or illegitimate money printed in Austria and Germany after World War I. Mr. Stern said the pictures on these bills depicted "virulently anti-Semitic" scenes.
Dr. Weiss said the meeting will deal with the history of anti-Semitism rather than trying to explain it. The subject "cannot be understood," he said.
"People have tried to understand it economically and sociologically," he added, "but it has gone on for centuries and continues to flourish today in countries where Jews hardly exist any longer.
"If anyone leaves the room with an understanding of anti-Judaism or anti-Semitism, we on the panel will have made a mistake." ROBERTA HERSHENSON

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Higher Rates Sting the Wealthy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
WHETHER you consider it soaking the rich or sharing the burden, the tax law of 1993 is taking a much bigger bite out of the wealthy.
The top tax rung has risen to almost 40 percent, the highest level since passage of the 1986 overhaul. Although people with high incomes will be hit the hardest in April, others will pay more as well. Various provisions of the law affect Social Security recipients and upper-middle-income families, among others. 
 While the number of people affected appears to be larger than has been asserted by the Clinton Administration, probably fewer people will be hit than think they will be. According to a Gallup poll of 1,003 adults in August, 28 percent said they expected to pay "a lot more" taxes, and 47 percent expected to pay "a little more."
With the filing deadline just weeks away, the wealthy, at least, are expressing little surprise, but considerable chagrin, as they contemplate the checks they will soon write, accountants say.
"Now they are facing the realization that they have a substantial tax liability due in April," said David M. Bradt Jr., a partner in charge of the individual services practice at Arthur Andersen & Company.
While the top bracket for 1993 has jumped to 36 percent from 31 percent -- a 10 percent surcharge brings the rate to 39.6 on taxable income of more than $250,000 -- little of the additional tax has been paid in advance because withholding tables were not adjusted until this year.
The law, called the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, does provide for spreading the increase over three years without interest. But the wealthy may find little comfort in this peace offer by the Administration, considering that the increase in many cases will amount to tens of thousands of dollars.
"To say they're not surprised is not the same thing as to say they are happy," said Clint Stretch, director of tax legislative affairs at the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche.
Although the Clinton Administration asserts that fewer than 2 percent of taxpayers will be in the new brackets, which kick in at $115,000 of taxable income for single filers and at $140,000 for joint filers, some people suspect the proportion is significantly higher, perhaps two or three times the official estimate.
The Administration's figure, said William Dunkelberg, dean of the business school at Temple University, is based on a count taken when the economy was at a low point, meaning the number of big earners was lower. "You get a lot of income volatility up in those ranges," Mr. Dunkelberg said.
The tax hit will be heaviest in the Northeast, where high-income earners are concentrated. According to a tabulation by Deloitte & Touche, Connecticut's share of returns with adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000 was nearly twice the national average in 1991. The District of Columbia, New Jersey and New York ranked just behind Connecticut.
The new law, not surprisingly, also adds complexity, forcing more people to make computations for the alternative minimum tax, which has been raised from a flat 24 percent to graduated rates of 26 percent and 28 percent. Connecticut, which finished phasing in a state income tax in 1992, added its own alternative minimum tax last year.
One executive feeling the effects of the Federal Government's decision to reverse the principles of its 1986 tax code overhaul -- lower rates, but fewer items exempted from taxation -- is George J. Wile, head of the Planet Products Corporation, a Cincinnati maker of packaging machinery.
"It's raised my taxes enormously," Mr. Wile said. His tax bracket rose in one swoop to 39.6 percent from 31 percent, costing him $50,000 to $60,000 a year.
And for 1994 the 1.45 percent Medicare tax will be applied to all his earned income, not just to the first $135,000, as it was in 1993.
But Mr. Wile, who kept an eye on the tax legislation and, of course, has professional advisers, was not shocked when he learned of his liability.
Those least aware of the cut-off points tend to be of less exalted means, particularly households with two people who earn respectable incomes. With 75 percent of Americans expecting to have been caught by last year's legislation, some will get a pleasant surprise this tax season.
"A lot of people were expecting to be hit who either are not feeling any impact at all or not as much as they expected," said Doris Cook Ross, a principal in Ross, Langan & McKendree, a firm in the prosperous Washington suburb of McLean, Va. She estimated that 40 percent of her firm's clients, whose income is generally $100,000 to $500,000, are getting better news than they expected.
M. Randy Wright, a Texas accountant, paid close attention to the tax law that was enacted in August and responded promptly. Within weeks, he and his wife, director of corporate finance for Southwest Airlines, decided against paying a contractor an estimated $5,000 to paint their suburban ranch house.
"We canceled with him and did it ourselves," said Mr. Wright, who is head of the tax department in the Dallas office of Grant Thornton. "That was a pretty good way to recoup" the extra tax bite, he added.
While the higher tax rates are retroactive to the the beginning of 1993, many other changes in last year's law, like the removal of the cap for Medicare tax, take effect this year.
William J. Caldwell, associate tax partner in the Rockville, Md., office Bond Beebe, points to a large pocket of distress among one lower-income group: Social Security recipients. In 1993, no more than 50 percent of Social Security benefits could be taxed, but some recipients will have 85 percent of their benefits taxed in 1994.
"That really caught them off guard," Mr. Caldwell said. "They had seen this as a tax on the wealthy." Many retired people complain that their income has already dwindled in recent years as interest rates on investments have declined.
Also in 1994, deductions for club dues disappear, deductions for business meals and entertainment drop to 50 percent from 80 percent, moving and travel deductions are less generous, charitable deductions need stronger documentation, the withholding rate on bonuses jumps to 28 percent from 20 percent and the amount of compensation on which contributions to qualified retirement plans can be made is slashed to $150,000 from $235,840.
Yet there are a few bright spots in the law -- provided that taxpayers are willing to file amended returns for 1992 to claim breaks that have been restored. The most notable are for gifts of appreciated personal property, a 25 percent deduction for health insurance by the self-employed and tax-free treatment of education expenses paid by employers.
The real griping from the wealthy about the tax increase may come from people who choose to pay in three installments. They will find themselves paying 1993 taxes in 1995 and in (can you believe it?) the Presidential election year of 1996.
"There are going to be people paying 1993 taxes in 1996, when it will be still fresh in their minds," said Benjamin D. Patton, president of Patton & Erskine, a small accounting firm in northern Virginia.
Almost as inevitable as taxes is gallows humor by taxpayers. This year, country clubs and other haunts of the rich will no doubt echo with two questions: Which President raised taxes before he was inaugurated? And, if there can be a retroactive tax increase, why can't there be retroactive elections?
Both questions will undoubtedly be answered with a snort of derision about President Clinton, who, as Candidate Clinton, promised to cut taxes.

HEADLINE: Mission to Moscow: Preaching the Gospel of Business

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
"WE use mystery guests," Edward L. Roth, a successful motel operator and practicing Mennonite from Archbold, Ohio, population 3,440, said in explaining his motel business to an advice-hungry audience of Russian business people.
The Russian translator, searching for a word to convey that "mystery guests" are people whom Mr. Roth hires to check up on motel employees, finally settled on "inspectors." 
 But in the audience, Irina V. Korsovskaya, a manager of the Veli Ross travel company in Moscow, knew better. "Spies," she murmured to her neighbor. For the first time in Mr. Roth's peppy speech, "How to Put People Before Profits," she smiled approvingly.
Usually, it is American businessmen who pride themselves on bottom-line realism and Russians who are viewed as impractical romantics.
But at a five-day seminar for would-be entrepreneurs in Russia's fledgling hospitality industry, which was sponsored by Mennonite Economic Development Associates, a nonprofit organization that tries to assist small businesses in the developing world, there was an entirely different kind of cultural clash. Last Monday, the seminar's opening day, the Westerners spoke of bringing God and courtesy into the workplace. The 45 Russians feverishly exchanged business cards and fax numbers.
"To be honest, I am not so interested in the lectures," whispered Nikolai V. Ognev, deputy general director of the Kroppy Company tourist bureau in Moscow. "I came here to make contacts."
Almost every week, there is some kind of business seminar going on in Moscow. And on any day, the finer hotels like the Metropole are filled with Western consultants who flock to the former Soviet Union, many on all-expenses-paid ego trips, courtesy of any number of well-meaning foundations. There are as many missionaries roaming across Russia; some 1,000 have come seeking to make converts over the last three years.
But it is less common to find Western businessmen in Russia trying to serve God and mammon at once.
"This is a mission for us," explained Randy Troyer, a Mennonite businessman who manages the Amish Kitchen Restaurant in Wilmot, Ohio. He, like the six other Canadians and Americans, and unlike so many Western consultants, paid his own way to the sober, frills-free seminar, which was held in a vast, gloomy ballroom of the 10,000-room Ismailovo Hotel in northeast Moscow. There are slot machines in the lobby and no Gideon Bibles in the rooms.
The Mennonites, like the Amish, are a branch of the Anabaptists, and they have a 200-year history in Russia. Long persecuted by the Communists, fewer than 15,000 remain, scattered in remote farming settlements in Siberia and Kazakhstan. Many North American Mennonites have Russian ancestors. "We don't expect to receive anything," Mr. Troyer said. "We want to help these people by sharing our knowledge."
THE Russians, who paid $90 to participate, were owners or managers of small new businesses, mostly in Moscow. But Tatyana A. Khramova, managing director of the Kanikuly travel agency in Tomsk, rode a train for three days from Siberia to attend.
And while many practical sessions were scheduled on subjects like how to run a bed and breakfast and the dos and don'ts of franchising, one lesson all of the panelists were determined to share was that money alone cannot buy happiness.
"How many friends did you lose after you gained your first million?" is how Dr. Aleksandr S. Zaichenko put it. Dr. Zaichenko is president of the Moscow-based Association of Christians in Business in Russia, co-sponsor of the seminar.
A former economics adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev during perestroika (he was secretly baptized in his bathtub in the 1970's), Dr. Zaichenko is also the founder of Moscow's Club for Fair and Ethical Business. He conceded that membership there was select, given the sometimes fast and loose ethics ruling Russian business today. "We try to find a moral approach to business," he explained wryly. "But that is not the way it is working here actually."
Most Moscow restaurants, for example, do not exactly live up to the principles set by Mr. Troyer's Amish Kitchen. Mr. Troyer had planned to speak on how to run a restaurant effectively at the Friday session, but didn't bring notes on protection money, cash skimming and bribes.
Restaurants here are the absolute symbol of corruption in our society," Dr. Zaichenko said, adding that criminal gangs controlled most restaurants in urban Russia. "They are horrible, evil, full of nouveaux riches," he said. "I try to avoid going to them."
There were other areas of confusion. Thrainn Kristjansson of Winnipeg, Manitoba, runs three theme restaurants. The fluent, BBC-accented Russian translator ran into difficulty explaining the mock-medieval theme of Mr. Kristjansson's Round Table restaurant, pronouncing it to be a "seminar-oriented" eatery. When Mr. Roth said he offered his motel guests free papers, meaning newspapers, the translator said he gave them free toilet paper.
And when Mr. Roth was asked about how he rebuked bad employees, he recommended a positive approach. "We talk to them discreetly in private, then we try to find something they excel at, like maybe they smile real good." The translator rendered that as, "Maybe the employee smiles too much, and the guests don't like it."
The power of positive thinking did not inspire all of the participants.
"Yes, of course: be polite to customers," Olga V. Kartashova, president of Visit, a tourism agency in Yaroslavl, said. "That is obvious. But for us today, there are so many more important issues -- like obtaining visas, or transport when there is none."
Vernon Wiebe, owner of the Prudent Travel and Tours company in Hillsboro, Kan., swapped shop talk with Russian tour operators over a lunch of meatballs and rice.
Russia, he learned, is not quite like Kansas. "It is hard to know how to talk to them," Mr. Wiebe said. "It's easy for me to say that I started with just a shoebox and built a business." He paused, and added gamely, "It must be possible here too, but they will have to be awfully ingenious and creative."
The Dale Carnegie spirit did not filter down to the staff of the Ismailovo Hotel. Instead, Christopher Shore, the young, fresh-faced Moscow-based representative of the Mennonite organization, received a lesson in how paid hospitality can sometimes falter even in the new Russia. "I just can't believe they don't have a sound system," he exclaimed after politely reasoning with a coolly indifferent hotel manager. "Somebody is not asking the right people." Dr. Zaichenko delicately tried to explain the Russian system. "They just don't care," he said.
But Mr. Shore, a determined young man, went home during the lunch break to fetch his own stereo system. He returned dejected after an unsuccessful search of 10 stores for a microphone. "I was willing to spend $500," he said incredulously. "You'd think someone around here would want to make some money."

HEADLINE: The American Economy, Back on Top

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
DURING the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton often fretted that the United States economy was fast becoming the world's also-ran. But more and more it looks as if he inherited a winner.
A 3 percent economic growth rate, a gain of two million new jobs in the past year and an inflation rate reminiscent of the 1960's make America the envy of the industrialized world. The amount the average American worker can produce, already the highest in the world, is growing faster than in other wealthy countries, including Japan. The United States has become the world's low-cost provider of many sophisticated products and services, from plastics to software to financial services. And after years of decline, the nation's share of the world export market has been rising. 
 For the most part, these advantages will continue even after countries like Japan and Germany snap out of their recessions. It is the United States, not Japan, that is the master of the next generation of commercially important computer and communications technologies and also of leading-edge services from medicine to movie making. And American managers are not only investing heavily in new equipment, they are also much farther along than those in Europe and Japan in streamlining and re-engineering their companies to make them more competitive. That's one reason that American industries that recently were losers -- like automobiles, machine tools, steel and computer chips -- are back with a vengeance.
The turnaround reflects more than 10 years of sometimes innovative and often wrenching change, driven by recession, deregulation, tougher foreign competition, the threat of takeovers, and, not least, new technology.
The image of the United States as an economic winner, once associated only with apologists for the Reagan era, is catching on. The French newspaper Le Monde and the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun have each run long series on the new American competitive threat. Foreign leaders and executives who once lectured Americans on their shortcomings now speak enviously of this country's cleverness in churning out everything from jobs to Jeeps.
While such sentiments may seem more common abroad, there are signs that America's self-esteem is recovering. Some polls show that Americans once again see the United States as an economic giant. Rush Limbaugh, who likes to brag about America's prowess, is one of the most popular radio talk show hosts. By contrast, Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of dying American factory towns, hasn't had a hit in a couple of years.
"Image and reality have both undergone a remarkable change in the last few years," said Michael Hammer, a business consultant and co-author of the best-seller "Re-engineering the Corporation." "American business -- not just manufacturing -- is again perceived as the world leader."
David Rolley, an international economist at the forecasting firm DRI/McGraw Hill, added: "Everyone thought the U.S. was a basket case, but others turned out to be bigger basket cases. Germany has too many good things, too many vacations. Japan is too much like I.B.M., such a successful model that nobody figured out what to do when it exhausted the model."
None of this is an excuse for giddiness. The gains have come at a high price. Even as the economy created new jobs, tens of millions of people lost their old ones and were forced to pull up stakes, take pay cuts, carve out new careers. The United States is still second best (or third or fourth) in many pursuits. And tomorrow's stars, from Malaysia to Mexico, pose growing challenges for many an American business.
Also, the recovery here and the recessions abroad are bound to highlight American strengths and foreign weaknesses. America's turnaround may look better than it is because reports of the nation's demise were exaggerated to begin with. And, as always, what looks like a lot of improvement to one person looks like too little to another.
Finally, the benefits of economic leadership are mostly psychic. The struggle to make the economic pie bigger and insure that all citizens get a slice is largely a race against oneself, not against other countries. And being the economic leader is no cure for some of the most serious problems American society faces, including crime, inadequate education, the growing isolation of the underclass, the rampant economic insecurity that many middle-class Americans feel, and, for that matter, the malaise that can come with working so hard to do better.
But the changing perception of America is already subtly influencing the way we think. Infatuation with the Japanese or German model of capitalism is becoming less fashionable, and the massive government meddling advocated by so many critics to reverse the nation's supposed decline is less appealing to a lot of people.
For example, despite promises of more government help for so-called strategic industries, the Clinton Administration has not budgeted much money for such an industrial policy. And Washington will probably not lurch toward European-style "managed trade," through which the Government sets targets for how much companies should buy from, and sell to, foreigners -- recent threats to limit Japan's access to the American market notwithstanding. And almost no one expects the big worker-retraining programs proposed during the Presidential campaign to materialize.
In fact, interest is growing in less costly ways to let people roll with the punches -- from getting welfare mothers into jobs to making it easier for workers to change jobs without losing pensions or health coverage.
The climate could still change. A trade war with Japan, while unlikely, is nevertheless a possibility. The Federal Reserve Board could turn a blind eye as the inflation genie slips out of the bottle. There's always the possibility that health care reform, if it happens, will add costs to businesses and therefore stifle job creation. Efforts to protect the people who have suffered in the economic transformation could backfire -- as they have in Europe -- if they take the form of protectionism or laws that make it harder for businesses to shrink payrolls or get out of unprofitable businesses.
But many people, including the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, think that the many recent positive signs, especially the rebound in productivity growth, signal that the United States economy will do even better in the 1990's than in the 1980's. That means, they argue, that more Americans will share in the economy's gains.
 
The Evidence
Glowing Numbers And More to Come
 Some of the evidence of America's impressive economic performance has been around for years but ignored. Most of it is fairly new.
Start with the most basic yardstick of economic health, the growth of productivity, or output per worker. Productivity determines how fast living standards can rise.
The American worker is the most productive in the world by far, producing on average $49,600 in goods and services a year in 1990 -- $5,000 more than German workers, $10,000 more than Japanese counterparts. Moreover, while productivity was growing more quickly abroad than in the United States for most of the 20th century, America has lately been gaining more quickly, as companies here figure out how to provide more and better products and services with new technologies and fewer workers.
Since the start of the economic recovery nearly three years ago, United States productivity has been growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, more than twice as fast as the average between 1970 and 1990, and markedly better than elsewhere.
The United States lead is widest in services. Retailing is twice as productive in the United States as in Japan, where laws protect the shopkeeper from the discount chain. The deregulated American telecommunications industry is at least twice as productive as Germany's government monopoly. The fragmented American banking industry is a third more efficient than Germany's banking oligopolies. The American edge in these industries has recently been expanding, not shrinking.
Gains on the factory floor have lately been even more stellar than for the economy over all: Hourly output has been rising nearly 5 percent a year for three years even as it has flattened or fallen in Germany and Japan. The United States lead in manufacturing, which had been shrinking as Germany and Japan caught up or moved ahead in some industries, has lately been widening again.
"You're seeing today the results of actions undertaken in the second half of the 1980's," said Stanley Gault, the chief executive who helped revive the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Rubbermaid Inc.
THERE are at least two reasons for thinking that the American productivity lead won't evaporate when Germany and Japan recover from their recessions. One is that investment, especially in computers, is booming. The other, more important, reason is that corporate America started the painful task of learning how to make more, more quickly and with fewer resources, earlier than many of its overseas counterparts, especially in Europe.
In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Shintaro Hori, a director of the consulting firm Bain & Company Japan, estimated that Japanese companies will have to shed 15 to 20 percent of their white-collar work forces to match the low overhead in America.
"There are far fewer re-engineering efforts under way in Japanese and German companies compared with the United States," said Mr. Hammer, the consultant, whose firm has trained thousands of American managers to overhaul their companies in the last few years but few from foreign corporations.
Hard evidence is the reward American companies are reaping: Despite the moderate pace of the economic recovery, inflation-adjusted corporate profits are close to an all-time high.
In some smokestack industries -- steel, machine tools and especially cars -- the choice was to raise productivity and quality a lot or cede the field to the competition, as American companies did in consumer electronics. American managers chose the former, lifting productivity in the auto plants, for example, by an average of 10 percent every year during the late 1980's, according to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
Indeed, no sooner did "The Reckoning" -- the book by David Halberstam that focused on Ford and Nissan to tell "the story of Japan's ascent and America's subtle industrial decline" -- appear in 1985 than did Ford begin its comeback and Nissan begin to falter. Ford's market share has since climbed to 25.5 percent of the American market from 21.3 percent, while Nissan, with 5.0 percent today, never improved on the 5.3 percent it held in the mid-1980's.
IN the first half of the 1980's, many American products were not only inferior to, but also pricier than, those offered by other nations. The grossly overvalued dollar -- which made American exports expensive and imports cheap -- was largely to blame. But so were a clutch of bad habits -- from executives' granting fat pay increases to Washington's tolerating too much inflation.
These days, by contrast, American factories ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne and Spandex to Siena (for bicycle pants). America's exports have been rising nearly 9 percent a year since 1985, even faster than Japan's 6.6 percent and Germany's 4.2 percent. Even more telling, the United States' share of exports by industrialized countries, which shrank to nearly 10 percent a decade ago, close to a post-war low, has rebounded to its 1980 level, around 14 percent.
Small wonder. Thanks to the weaker dollar, more moderate wage settlements and gains in efficiency, American production costs have been rising more slowly than those in Europe and Japan: 1.1 percent a year since 1985, compared with 2.5 percent in Europe and 1.7 percent in Japan. BMW of North America Inc. and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. are building their new plants in the American South. And, to hold down the price of their new models, Japanese car makers with plants in America are resorting to a strategy considered unthinkable just a few years ago: raising as much as possible the content of locally procured parts, as Honda said it would do this year.
Contrast this with Germany's cost problem. At current exchange rates German manufacturing workers are paid about $26 an hour, $10 more than American and Japanese factory hands. The problem is so serious that Chancellor Helmut Kohl devoted the German equivalent of the State of the Union message last October to the problem of German competitiveness.
"It seems as if there is still nothing more important than thinking about how we can expand our recreation time," he scolded. "If we want to secure Germany's future, we cannot organize our country as if it were one big recreation park."
Making things less expensively isn't enough to captivate a world full of ever more affluent, increasingly sophisticated consumers. That requires a prodigious stream of new ideas and invention. A case in point is the converging world of computing, telecommunications and television.
"We're in the midst of the third industrial revolution," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, "and the United States is leading it."
The European technology industry is in deep trouble, its stagnant revenue, lack of new products and need for billions in government subsidies evident even before the recession. Japan has been a leader in consumer electronics. But, as its retreat in high-definition television shows, that country is still mainly the master of mass-produced components -- flat panel displays, memory chips, fax machines.
Six years ago, the fear was that Japanese dominance would spread to leading-edge technologies. But Japanese electronics giants like the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, the NEC Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation haven't been able to keep up with changing technology and American companies like the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are in the lead in virtually all the key ingredients of the business- and personal-computer revolution: software, workstations, laser printers, computer networks and the computers-on-a-chip known as microprocessors.
"Everything important gets invented here," said Charles Ferguson, a Cambridge, Mass., technology consultant who a few years ago was warning darkly of the Japanese threat. The growing demand for sophisticated products will probably play to the strengths of American producers. So might the fact that American consumers are already more familiar with new technology than people abroad. Compared with Japan, for example, the United States has more than three times as many personal computers per worker.
"More Americans are familiar with these technologies and are using them in everyday life," Mr. Steinberg said. "And more American businesses have learned to use the technology to improve productivity."
 
The Reasons
Economic 'Vices' Are Also Virtues
 Are there reasons for the American comeback other than inventiveness, streamlining, re-engineering, the adaptability of workers and managers, lower inflation and interest rates, and a weaker dollar?
Yes, indeed. Often overlooked is that some of this nation's supposed vices -- from a reluctance to protect and regulate industries, to an obsession with short-term profits -- have turned out to be virtues as well. And the much-praised features of Japanese and German capitalism -- from managed trade to lifetime employment -- have proved to have drawbacks.
The fact that American companies are regularly exposed to the toughest competitors on their home turf is a blessing as well as a curse. Detroit was forced to compete head to head with Japanese cars. European auto makers enjoyed far more protection from Japan. For a while, the jobs of tens of thousands of European auto workers and their bosses were safe, but now a huge downsizing is all but inevitable.
Lighter regulation in the United States than in other nations proved bracing for many American service companies because it encouraged competition. American shopkeepers cannot fall back on the kind of zoning laws that shield mom-and-pop stores in Japan from certain death by would-be Wal-Marts. A.T.& T. has been at the forefront of communications technology in large part because of challenges from the likes of MCI Communications Inc. and the Sprint Corporation. United Airlines gives passengers a better price because Southwest Airlines does. Contrast the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and United with their German counterparts, which remain carefully guarded state monopolies, though things are beginning to change.
Even the focus by investors and bankers on last quarter's bottom line may turn out to be less of a handicap than some argue. Impatient institutional investors blew the whistle when profits shrank, as did bank lenders without the cozy ties to corporate boards that exist in countries like Germany and Japan.
And the deep pain of layoffs has produced important gains. To be sure, the dislocation caused by layoffs in one American industry after another since the early 1980's is staggering. In the past decade, estimates Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago, 1 in 10 manufacturing jobs -- two million -- vanished every year, even though the net decline in factory jobs over the decade was only about 1 million.
But it is becoming clear that the ability to move workers quickly from one industry to another also has benefits to the economy -- in the form of increased productivity that is essential to raising the standard of living.
For all the layoffs, the fact is that the number of new jobs has far outstripped the number of jobs lost in recent years. The United States economy has added 18 million jobs in the past decade, a net gain of more than 20 percent, including 2 million in the past year. And the unemployment rate has dropped about 1.5 percentage points in the past 18 months, to just over 6 percent. The economies of the European Community, which combined are the same size as the American economy, have added just 7 million jobs in 10 years, a net increase of 7 percent, and have grappled with unemployment rates, now in the double digits, that haven't fallen below 8 percent in a decade.
 
The Dissent
But What About That Trade Deficit?
 Perhaps the most compelling counterargument to the notion that America is doing so well is this: Imports are rising three times faster than exports and the trade deficit, which was shrinking during the late 1980's, is swelling. "How can Japan pay wages that are higher, have productivity that is lower and still sell us $60 billion more than they buy?" asked Lester Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is much in favor at the White House by dint of his book "Head to Head: The Coming Battle Among Japan, Europe and America."
But the trade deficit is not a particularly reliable yardstick of the health of an economy for two reasons. The first is that how much countries buy abroad depends on their income as well as the attractiveness of the foreign products, and America's income (in short, its gross domestic product) is rising more rapidly than that of most other nations.
The more subtle reason is that critics of American competitiveness have a habit of focusing on trade figures that capture only goods that are traded internationally, ignoring the service sector. Yet America's economic performance depends far more on service industries, which now employ three out of four American workers.
So America's back in the lead. But that's no excuse to relax. "Things are going to get different again," said Mr. Hammer. "People think the hard work is over, but hard work is going to be a permanent condition."

Graphs: "HOW THE U.S. HAS REGAINED WORLD LEADERSHIP"
Just a few years ago, America's descent into second-rate status was a widely accepted fait accompli. No more. Europe and Japan have stumbled while the United States economy is growing, inflation is low and productivity and employment are rising. After more than a decade of painful change and dislocation, many American industries are leaner and nimbler and others have seized the leadership of the sophisticated technologies that are ushering in the information age.

HEADLINE: Vital Signs Improve for the Nursing Home Industry

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
AS with virtually all segments of the health care marketplace, change is sweeping through the nation's $70 billion nursing home industry. What is different here, though, is that few in this highly fragmented business are complaining.
People in the business are smiling because, among other things, there is a rising tide of senior citizens to take care of, and there is a stagnant to declining pool of beds in which to put them. Nursing home companies are also successfully competing with hospitals in taking care of patients who are recovering from surgery. 
 Indeed, even as reform is causing dislocation in important components of the health care system, from hospitals to drug companies to physicians, analysts say many nursing home operators, particularly the biggest ones, are in pretty good shape.
"Nursing homes are the only area in health care where there is a shortage," said Peter Sidoti, a health care analyst at the NatWest Securities Corporation in New York. "There are not enough nursing home beds in the country, and demand is growing."
Although other factors are playing a role, the driving force behind the positive outlook for nursing homes is demographic. Millions of Americans are getting old, and advances in medical technology are allowing them to grow older still. By the year 2000, there will be about 35 million Americans age 65 or older, and 40 million by 2010, according to Census Bureau Estimates; that's up from 31.5 million in 1990.
For nursing homes, the critical group is people 85 and older, which happens to be the fastest growing part of the elderly population. By the year 2000, their numbers are projected to swell by 40 percent, and to double by 2010.
According to a recent research report prepared by Todd B. Richter, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, and by Mark G. Banta, another health care analyst at the firm, more than half of those over 85 need long-term care.
The other critical part of the equation is where will all these older people go? For the foreseeable future they will compete for a finite number of beds that is not expected to get much bigger. There are more than 15,000 nursing homes in the country, with about 1.6 million beds. On any given day, between 90 and 95 percent of those beds are occupied.
Thus far this decade, the supply of nursing home beds has stabilized, or has even declined slightly, because of state Certificate of Need laws designed to control or reduce the number of nursing home beds. If a nursing home wants to expand, it must apply to the state, showing why there is a need for more beds in its area. Because most nursing home residents are on Medicaid, the government health plan that covers the poor, the state pays a big part of the tab at nursing homes. So as beds increase, so does the state's Medicaid costs. The effect: States don't hand out Certificates of Need like aspirin.
In 1990 alone, nursing home payments represented 38.2 percent of Medicaid expenditures nationwide, according to a report prepared by John F. Hindelong, a principal and health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Paying for Medicaid is the second-biggest cost item for state governments, and it is probably the single fastest-growing cost.
In their report, Dean Witter's analysts concluded that since restrictive Certificate of Need laws are in place in most states, "We do not believe the supply situation will change materially for the better over the next several years," possibly not before the turn of the century.
Nursing homes, however, have found a way to profit from the state restrictions. Now the average nursing home derives more than 60 percent of its revenue from Medicaid. But by holding down the number of new beds and effectively putting a lid on Medicaid patients, home operators have greater latitude to "pick and choose who they let in the door," Mr. Sidoti from NatWest Securities said. The ability to pick from a generally more affluent group is boosting profitability.
The search for greater profitability has pushed nursing home operators into direct competition with their big cousins, hospitals, for subacute-care patients. These patients, recovering from cancer, coronary bypass and joint replacement surgery, or from serious accidents, are increasingly receiving post-operative therapy at nursing homes.
"We are branching out into areas that until the 1990's were dominated by hospitals," said Paul Ormond, chairman and chief executive of the Health Care and Retirement Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest nursing home operator. For nursing homes able to afford the $10,000- to $15,000-per-bed investment Dean Witter's analysts estimate is necessary to accommodate subacute and rehabilitation patients, the attractions are clear: Operating margins for treatment of subacute care patients are roughly twice those on custodial geriatric care.
For payers like health maintenance organizations and insurance companies, there is one clear benefit of using nursing homes for subacute care: cost.
"We make a pretty compelling argument to payers about the price reductions we can provide," said Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health Care Association, a Washington lobbying group that represents 11,000 subacute residential care nursing homes.
"We are talking about a day of care that is one-half to two-thirds the price of what a day at a hospital costs. And we know we can do it cheaper than that."
In Mr. Hindelong's report on the nursing home industry, the Donaldson Lufkin analyst, citing figures from the 1992 Marion Merrell Dow Long Term Care Digest, notes that in 1991 H.M.O.'s generated an average of 30 percent of revenue at for-profit nursing homes. In 1989 and 1990, the H.M.O. contribution to nursing home revenues was 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.
"People that run skilled nursing facilities are much more cost conscious than people who run hospitals," said Stewart Bainum, chairman and chief executive of Manor Care Inc., the nation's third-largest and most profitable nursing home chain.
David Vanderwater, chief operating officer at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest hospital chain, admitted that "historically, hospitals have not been the most economical place for these types of services. But the world is changing. I think hospitals are poised to meet that challenge. And we believe hospitals provide much more flexibility than nursing homes."
In order to meet the challenge, some hospitals are reducing their number of beds and sharply cutting their work force.
Columbia/HCA is nevertheless keeping its options open. Last week, the company and Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home company, said they were discussing joint ventures in some cities.
All this change is getting Wall Street's attention. Over the last year, shares in the 16 publicly traded nursing home companies have risen an average of 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Richter of Dean Witter said..
"We follow 10 publicly traded companies and have buy recommendations on all of them because we think the long-term fundamentals are superb," Mr. Sidoti of NatWest Securities said. That stated, he does have some particular favorites. He likes the Hillhaven Corporation, the nation's second-largest nursing home operator. And he said the Sun Healthcare Group, which NatWest is advising in its $320 million buyout of the Mediplex Group, has a great future.
"Hillhaven owns its own bricks and mortar, and they have good earnings," he said. "We also think that since National Medical Enterprises owns 35 percent of the stock, Hillhaven is a likely takeover candidate."
Sun Healthcare, meanwhile, "is a company that has been ignored by investors. Right now, it has a market capitalization of $250 million, but only $90 million of that is freely traded."
That will change after the buyout of Mediplex, a subacute care provider, is completed.
"After this deal, the company will have a market capitalization of more than $700 million, and more than $500 million of that will be freely traded," Mr. Sidoti said.
Although the big players are getting all the attention, the industry is still dominated by small entrepreneurs, and more and more of them are beginning to merge. There have been a half dozen nursing home combinations over the last 12 months.
At the moment, the nursing home industry remains widely diversified: The 20 largest chains operate just 18 percent of the homes, but that is expected to change.
"Right now the top 32 players have 21 percent of the beds," Mr. Richter said. "Five years from now, I would expect the top 10 players will have 21 percent of the beds."
Mergers make sense because of the need to work with managed care purveyors," said Carl Sherman, a senior vice president and health care analyst at Dillon Read & Company. "In the next few years, the nursing home industry sees this as being all-important."
Also important for the industry is keeping down labor costs, which represent close to 80 percent of a nursing home's expenses. Wages are under control, but that could change.
"So long as unemployment stays above 6 percent, we in nursing homes will do well," Andrew L. Turner, founding chairman and chief executive of Sun Healthcare, said.
Aside from the mergers, larger nursing home operators, including Manor Care, have also entered into joint-venture arrangements with hospitals, or are contemplating them.
Given the huge size of some hospital chains relative to nursing homes, "hospitals could purchase assets and capabilities from the nursing home industry," Mr. Ormond at Health Care and Retirement said. "But it is more likely they will focus on their segment of the market, and we will focus on ours. There will be ways for the system to enjoy the economics of both."
Mr. Turner of Sun Healthcare disagreed. "In 10 years we will be in the hospital business," he said. "But it will be called something different than that."
 
 
 
SMALL FRY ARE MAKING ACQUISITIONS
 Over the last year the nursing home industry has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. But unlike the 1980's, when big companies spent too much for their acquisitions, the buying and selling in the last 12 months has involved smaller operators doing smaller deals.
 "In the past, if there was acquisition activity, it was big fish swallowing little fish," saisd Andrew L. Turner, chairman and chief executive of Sun Healthcare Group, which in January announced in was buying the Mediplex Group for $320 million.
 "Today, it's the little fish who are getting married," he added. "The five largest companies are not out there."
 Indeed. Here is a list of the five biggest nursing home deals in the last year:
 * Genesis Health Ventures/Meridian Healthcare. Price, $205 million. Combination increases the number of beds at Genesis to more than 10,000. Genesis also agreed to lease an additional seven nursing homes from Meridian, with an option to buy them for $59 million in 10 years.
 * Horizon Healthcare Corporation/Greenert Rehabilitation Group. Price, $350 million. Combination gives Horizon just under 9,000 beds.
 * Sun Healthcare Group Systems/Mediplex Group. Price $320 million. Combination make Sun one of the 10 highest nursing home operations in the country, with more than 13,000 beds.
 * Integrated Health Services/Central Park Lodges. Price $184 million. Combination gives Integrated nearly 5,000 beds. Central Park had been a unit of the Trizec Corporation of Canada.
 * Regency Health Services/Care Enterprises. Prices, $120 million in a stock swap. Combination is giving Regency just over 9,000 beds.

Bell Atlantic and T.C.I. Decide the Future can Wait
Maybe everyone got carried away with this "information highway" idea; maybe things were moving too fast. Because all the fancy talk got slammed into a wall of reality. The Huge Merger planned by Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications was supposed to set off a fireworks-popping transformation of, well, the world as we know it - cable-television, communications, who-knows-what. But last week, the two compnies said, Never mind: The numbers don't add up. Why did the deal crash? The F.C.C. lowering cable rates played a part, and T.C.I.'s aggreasive manner did clash with staid Bell Atlantic. But more likely it just wasn't time for the cable industry to disappear into some labyrinthine, futuristic world. Now, said one executive, cable "will not be folded into the telephone industry as quickly as people thought." cable stocks, though, looked better before. 

What Should Cable TV Cost?
Even without merger confusion, cable television is a slippery thing. Regulators keep trying to put a fair price tag on it, but the technological sands keep shifting. Last year the F.C.C. moved to bring rates down to competitive levels, but somehow a third of consumers saw their rates rise -- partly because cable companies proved adept at reshuffling the channels in a "basic" package. Last week, the F.C.C. tried again, cutting rates an additional 7 percent -- that, it says, is where true competition would drive them -- and it is trying to close the loopholes. The head of the F.C.C., Reed Hundt, called it "one of the greatest consumer savings" -- when you add it up, it amounts to a couple of dollars a month.
 
Soros Takes a Beating
Well, no one's invincible -- not even George Soros. Mr. Soros has taken on a larger-than-life aura for his prescient, and hugely profitable, bets on the direction of the world's currencies. A year and a half ago, he made $1 billion when he bet that Britain's pound would be devalued in the midst of Europe's exchange-rate turmoil. With such stakes, though, the day had to come when the losses would be just as huge. It has. Last week Mr. Soros said his Quantum Group funds lost $600 million on Feb. 14 in a bad bet on the direction of the yen.
 
Giving In to Cancer at Tenneco
Michael Walsh tried for a year to do two quite formidable -- and quite different -- tasks, but in the end one of them demanded his undivided attention. One task had been to run Tenneco, and he did that spectacularly. In less than three years, he had, by all accounts, whipped the company into shape -- just as he had turned around Union Pacific before that. But in January 1993 he developed brain cancer, and after a year of battling that, while staying on the job, he resigned last week at the age of 51. The stock fell $3.375 over two days, to $54.625, but a more relevant point is that that's still nearly twice what it was shortly after Mr. Walsh took charge.
 
Take That, Microsoft!
Mighty Microsoft, the fearsome competitor, got its wrist slapped last week, but it will take a lot more than that to slow it down. A Federal jury said the company infringed the patent of a small California company called Stac Electronics, which had developed a method for doubling the storage capacity of computer disks. The jury awarded Stac $120 million in damages -- which Microsoft can pay out of its pocket money -- but the bigger question is whether this Goliath will now be a bit more cautious in its dealings with various Davids. And it will surely cause more discussion about whether the patent concept is even relevant to something as complex as software.
 
NASA, Back in the Frying Pan
NASA can't seem to stay out of trouble. Recently it went a long way toward erasing one black mark by patching up the Hubble, but last week it had another headache. Federal prosecutors accused nine people, some of whom work for NASA, of taking part in bribery and kickback schemes at the Johnson Space Center in Texas. Martin Marietta agreed to pay $1 million and to help in the inquiry. What's behind it? One scientist cited NASA's loose, "mom and pop" accounting methods, saying, "It's a lot easier to knock off a mom-and-pop than an armored car."
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Japan Abandons HDTV (Briefly)
In Japan, high-definition television is a topic painfully close to the economic nerve. It's their baby, a rare instance of Japan pioneering a technology. So there was an uproar last week when the Government said it might abandon analog HDTV technology, into which industry had poured billions, in favor of the Americans' digital system. Such an uproar, in fact, that the next day Tokyo said, Well, uh, maybe we'll stick with it after all. A token bit of national honor restored, but the damage was done: Who's going to put more effort into a technology that could be a dead end?
 
Bradley Slams 'Japan-Bashing'
President Clinton's tough talk on trade with Japan is good box office, but -- for the long-term good -- is it the right thing? Some have doubts, and last week they got a key ally in Bill Bradley. "People want to believe," the Democratic senator said, that "somebody is victimizing us." But he wants none of it. Mr. Clinton's saber-rattling is "gratuitous brinkmanship," he said -- "Japan-bashing" for domestic consumption. Threats of a trade war, he said, could undermine efforts at reform in Japan. He will surely be heard, because he's usually a solid Clinton backer.
 
Easing High-Tech Exports
People are nervous about exporting fancy technology. As one arms-control advocate put it, we don't want to "send U.S. pilots again to bomb things our industry has exported." But changes in the world, and in technology, cannot be ignored. And, not least, a chance to increase the nation's trade cannot be ignored -- not by this President anyway. So last week Mr. Clinton proposed an overhaul of export controls to fit the realities of a post-cold-war world, with the aim of easing the sale of machine tools and other high-tech stuff. The move seemed, politically, on target, because the protests matched up well: business wanted more, arms-control groups wanted less.
 
Health Reform: A Fatal Flaw?
In his passion to fix the health care mess, President Clinton faces a built-in, possibly insurmountable problem: though everyone cheers the notion of "universal coverage," many recoil at the idea of the Government running things. One lawmaker called the plan "too bureaucratic, too governmental." In other words, any "government" plan may be doomed. And last week the American Association of Retired Persons declined to support the Clinton plan. That one hurt. The group has 33 million members -- with great interest in health care -- and Mr. Clinton has put a lot of effort into getting its backing.
 
Greenspan Keeps 'em Hopping
Alan Greenspan, whose every utterance is scrutinized by the markets, tried to make something perfectly clear last week. No, the Fed chairman insisted before Congress, inflation is under control. No, there's no reason for long-term interest rates to rise just because he'd nudged short-term rates up. President Clinton liked what he heard, but the markets were of two minds, with stock and bond prices rising on Tuesday, falling on Wednesday and plunging on Thursday before steadying on Friday -- with rates cited as a factor all week.
 
Putting the Hot News on Ice
Instant communications. It practically defines our age. Beepers, pocket phones, mercilessly up-to-the-second scheduling gadgets. But wait -- something very curious happened last week. The big story of the winter -- forget the snow, forget the earthquake, even forget Paramount -- was the duel between Ms. Apple Pie and Ms. Pool Hall. But when the ached-for moment came at last, most people didn't know 'til hours later. They didn't want to know ("Don't ruin it for me!") or blocked out the fact that during prime-time figure skating, it was the dead of night in Norway. CBS kept up the fiction, pounding every drum in reach as it opened its coverage of this great taped drama, now seven hours old.
 
Heading Off That First Puff
Dr. Joycelyn Elders is committed to cutting smoking, and last week, in the 23d Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, she took the battle to a new front. Noting that tobacco companies lose nearly two million customers a year -- they either die or quit -- and must thus constantly recruit new ones, she urged that the focus be on preventing those first puffs. "Young people are the chief source of new customers," she said, calling for a ban on advertising aimed at the young, like the Joe Camel ads. The Tobacco Institute insisted that ads are aimed at adult smokers. "We don't need to target kids, and we don't," a spokesman said. . . . The tobacco industry got another blow on Friday when the F.D.A. ruled that cigarettes could be considered drugs -- and face regulation as such.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
An Emerging Emerging Market

BYLINE: By Edward A. Gargan 

 BODY:
HIDDEN in the Indian Ocean like a verdant dollop dripping from the southern coast of tropical India, Sri Lanka has lingered in geographical and economic obscurity. It is a land that lures European tourists, is fighting a vicious but relatively contained civil war, and has quietly managed to attract interest from foreign investors and financial institutions.
Since the beginning of the year, the Colombo Stock Exchange -- tiny by global standards, to be sure -- has soared. Before last week, it had been outperforming markets in every other country except Brazil. Then, last Wednesday, the Sri Lankan all-shares index hit an all-time high of 1,373.48 and the market became the world's leading gainer for the year. The market has risen more than 350 points in three months. 
 Political stability, which appears to have been enhanced in the wake of the assassination of the former president last May, and the most sustained economic growth in South Asia have made Sri Lanka a lucrative investment with considerable potential, according to many analysts.
"A lot of investors are coming into the market," said Thilan Wijesinghe, the director of research at Asia Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd., a brokerage in Colombo. "We saw the first Sri Lankan country fund last year," he said in reference to the Regent Sri Lankan Fund Ltd., managed in Hong Kong. "It raised a total of $25.6 million in November, and one reason for the rise in the market was that the fund was investing. And then a lot of retail investors got into the market."
Far freer than the regional markets in India, particularly Bombay's, and in Karachi, the Colombo exchange has prospered in a small, and until now unnoticed, fashion. Gone forever, it seems, are the controls and state ownership that characterized the socialist policies of the 1970's. Foreign investment in manufacturing, once discouraged, is now vigorously wooed; and with a literacy rate approaching 90 percent, Sri Lanka has the most educated workers in South Asia.
Still, the country is tiny and the Colombo exchange has one of the smallest capitalizations of emerging market exchanges in the world, about $3.6 billion, up from $1.8 billion in December. But as Mano Titawella, the manager of research at HDF Securities Pvt. Ltd., a Colombo investment firm, put it, "Daily trading volume is now at $8 million. It's small by any other standard, but in December it was $2 million."
Such tiny turnover leads many analysts to ignore Sri Lanka altogether. "It's an emerging emerging market," said George K. Hersh Jr., a Baring Securities Ltd. analyst in New York.
A few foreign analysts, however, believe that Sri Lanka, if not yet of age, is rapidly warranting attention from investors.
"Our feeling is that the market growth is being generated by a combination of factors," said Nigel Rendell, an emerging market strategist at James Capel & Company, a London brokerage. Among them: "A fairly stable political environment, fairly strong growth -- 6 percent G.D.P. growth is the minimum this year if things hold together. There is also the possibility that if they manage to sort out the war with the Tamils [the ethnically-based, northern rebel movement], growth could be in double digits."
In Colombo, brokers and analysts are confident that there is no way to go but up. Mr. Wijesinghe even believes Sri Lanka's size works to its advantage in the competitive emerging market environment.
"Our smallness in itself proved to be an advantage," he said. "Fund managers might have two, three, four million in the Sri Lankan market. So people leave their money here instead of moving it out, like happened in Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. And new money was coming in.
"Then, the market took off in February in anticipation of two more country funds coming in, as well as the existing regional funds," he added. "I would reckon that there is $100 million still wanting to come into Sri Lanka. You're seeing a classic case of defying fundamentals."
Mr. Titawella of HDF Securities noted that, "There has been a tremendous infusion of liquidity. What has really held up is the announcement of a regional country fund which invested about $25 million. So the market took off in the later stages of December. Three weeks ago we had something called the Sri Lankan Growth Fund sponsored by Smith Newcourt in Hong Kong. They have the authority to put in $100 million." (There are no Sri Lankan funds currently trading in the United States.)
"The key thing is basically, on a whole, the market is overheated at the moment," said Mr. Titawella. "If you look at December, the market valuation was about 21 times historic earnings. Now we're looking at 31 times historic earnings. Traditionally it's been 14. I'm not comfortable with 31, definitely. I'm looking at a forecast of p/e of about 22, which I think is still high, and I think the market should correct itself in terms of a p/eof about 18."
Still, foreign analysts believe Sri Lanka is moving forward faster than other markets in South Asia. And a general election scheduled for the end of the year is likely to be called early this summer so the program of privatizing Government-owned industries and enterprises can be accelerated.
"From a foreign perspective it looks good," Mr. Rendell of James Capel said. "We like the manufacturing sector. We like the construction sector. The service sector also seems to be growing, and the tourist sector is booming."

Innovation: Medicine's Best Cost-Cutter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL PORTER, ELIZABETH TEISBERG and GREGORY BROWN; Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg are on the faculty of the Harvard Business School. Gregory Brown, a former surgeon, is a vice president of Vector Securities International in Chicago. The three have just completed a three-year study of the economics of health care.

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union Message last month, President Clinton began the final stage of his courageous campaign for health care reform. But neither his proposal nor any of the other leading proposals will yield the desired results. They all fail to recognize the central importance of innovation in reducing health care costs.
The Administration's proposal does try to control costs; it just does it the wrong way. It depends upon simplified paperwork, the greater bargaining power of new purchasing alliances and caps on prices. But costs cannot be reduced enough with these measures, which are essentially ways to deliver today's health care more efficiently. The savings from these efforts are possible and necessary, but the desire to widen access to health care, the growing health needs of an aging population and Americans' demands for the best treatments available will soon overwhelm the gains. 
 As many industries have shown, the only real way to lower costs substantially is through innovation. It was innovation that drove down the price of the average long-distance phone call by more than 50 percent between 1984 and 1992 -- while raising quality as well. And although the first personal computer cost $50,000, innovation has reduced cost so much that, today, a PC that drastically outperforms the original model can easily be purchased for less than $3,000.
Despite these and many other examples of innovation's great cost-reducing power, the Clinton proposal completely neglects this principle, and the competing proposals are not much better. The reformers may assume that the march of technology is impervious to Government regulation, but this is wrong. In 1993, for example, more than $500 million in public and private stock offerings for medical-device and drug firms were canceled because of the threat of price controls.
Or the reformers may regard technology as the cause rather than the cure of high costs. They often dwell, say, on the $1 million cost of a magnetic resonance imaging machine while ignoring the diagnoses doctors can make with it and the expensive exploratory surgery it avoids.
This approach is also mistaken; innovation's savings and other benefits are as substantial in health care as in other industries. New drugs to prevent postsurgical infections can reduce hospital stays as much as 10 days. Gene therapy for illnesses like cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's disease can eliminate years of chronic care costs, while also improving patients' quality of life. New cell therapy techniques can reduce the cost of a bone-marrow transplant as much as $50,000. Similarly, the laparoscope, originally developed for use in gynecology, has reduced the bill for gall bladder surgery to $6,400 from $21,000 and turned a six-day hospital stay into an outpatient procedure.
Drugs and devices are not the only ways to innovate; services can be revolutionized, too. Special head-trauma centers have been shown to lower cost and quicken rehabilitation, for example.
What does all this mean? It means health reform will only work if it spurs innovation.
But, by reducing the rigorous competition that innovation requires, the Administration's proposal discourages this invaluable process. Under the proposal, health care will be overseen by yet another sclerotic Government bureaucracy, the National Health Board. There will be monopolistic regional purchasing alliances, which will trigger the rapid consolidation of payers and providers. These large provider-payer networks will reduce choice and competition among specialty-care providers, while deciding what treatments are covered, for whom and when. With a bias against covering anything new, these powerful entities will replace the diversity and experimentation that have long fueled innovation and maintained this country's leadership in the global pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical-device industries.
To make matters worse, if prices are tightly controlled under reform, America's flow of innovation will slow to a trickle because the incentives needed for its huge investments will disappear. Schering-Plough spent $100 million for a plant to make alpha interferon when that drug was known only to help a rare cancer. Under price controls such an effort would not be made -- nor the discovery that the drug treats 15 other diseases.
THE Clinton proposal aims to compensate for these risks to innovation by continued Government financing of basic research. But private-sector investment in research and development of drugs and medical technologies dwarfs the budget of the National Institutes of Health, the principal Federal source of research funds. And if we deaden the incentives for private-sector investment, much of the Federal research will never be transformed from science into usable technology.
The challenge that confounds health care reformers is that although the United States has produced a breathtaking rate of advance in innovation, competition appears to have failed on another crucial dimension: cost. Incentives to keep costs down have been so skewed by regulation, insurance practices, limited information about quality and price and the natural price insensitivity of ill patients that the normal economic rules do not apply:
* Prices remain high in the face of excess capacity because, until recently, prices were set to cover full costs rather than meet competition.
* Technologies remain costly even when widely diffused because reimbursement has been based on customary charges, not costs.
* Hospitals and physicians who charge higher prices or fail to provide quality service are not forced out of business because quality is poorly understood and local hospitals have been preserved in spite of inefficiencies and underutilization. Instead, providers and payers compete on proficiency at "gaming" the system by cost-shifting, self-referral, "balance billing" of patients above insurers' agreed rates and creative denial of insurance claims.
In other words, the reformers are addressing a health care system that works well in one way but does not in another. Given this diagnosis, the prescription is a straightforward one. We must realign the skewed cost incentives -- the part that does not work well -- and preserve and protect the incentives for innovation -- the part that does work well.
To do this, reform must accomplish many tasks. It must promote competition by forcing insurers to make their money by finding good, low-cost providers, rather than by avoiding the payment of claims. It must be vigilant in enforcing antitrust laws to avoid overconsolidation of providers into a few powerful networks and Government agencies. It must also preserve choice by guarding against overextension of full-service provider networks; only through choice can the best providers emerge. And reform must permit lower-quality, inefficient providers to fail; only then will they be replaced by better ones.
But the first step in successful reform is to recognize the central importance of innovation. And no leading reform proposal -- not the Clinton plan, the Cooper plan, the Chafee-Dolan plan or the Canadian-style single-payer system -- understands this fact. Instead, they all severely limit choice and competition -- and thus innovation, the only long-term solution to our ills.

HEADLINE: Black Journeys: Many Travelers Along Many Roads

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

 BODY:
AS this year's version of the annual nod to black history draws to an end, it's hard to escape how often the well-intentioned focus on forgotten lives, legacies and achievements deteriorates into cliches: a nod to Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass and W. E. B. Du Bois, a bow to the Harlem Renaissance and the civil rights movement, then all are forgotten until next February.
Like all things rote, Black History Month misses the nuance and detail of real lives and undercuts the yeasty history of blacks in America. It makes seamless what is rich with curlicues and furbelows. 
 How strange was the antebellum life of Amanda America Dickson, the daughter of a white bachelor from Georgia who left her his fortune?
What moved Bessie Coleman, the young Texas woman who went to France to learn to fly and returned to barnstorm through the American Southwest in the 1920's?
Where are the nameless heros and heroines, the deviants from the flatbed of history, who brought black Americans to where they stand today? Unlike other immigrants, most blacks arrived in this country as slaves. But their history is not a simple list of events from chains to freedom. Like the history of the population at large, it is a history of movement. The circumstances of the movement, however, are often distorted by the laws, habits and racism that have defined their experience.
Patterns of black migration have often overlapped those of whites, particularly when whites were masters. Blacks have generally been drawn in the directions that offered them the most freedom and opportunity. Historically, that meant north and west.
Unlike those of European settlers, blacks' ancestral ties to their homelands were cut. So the Old South was a substitute homeland, the place from which their generations went forth in a fascinating migration, one shaped not only by traditional economic forces but by laws that shackled their hopes long after slavery.
 
The Ebbs and Flows
 Only recently has it been possible, with new data banks like that of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, to follow the ebbs and flows of black migration.
For much of the 19th century, black migration was constrained -- legally for slaves, officially and by bigotry for free blacks. Still, there was movement. By 1860, Baltimore had more free blacks than any other city. Though Maryland was a slave state, Quakers had a moderating influence. The free blacks had schools, churches and benevolent societies, according to Dr. Bettye Collier-Thomas, a historian at Temple University.
For five years after the Civil War, the Federal Government provided some protection to the newly freed blacks. But after Reconstruction, Southern states reimposed Jim Crow restrictions. The oppression was so heavy that in 1879 many blacks began an exodus from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas into Kansas and from North Carolina into Indiana.
The recession of 1890 put a stop to this migration, and Jim Crow laws mired blacks in the places that whites thought they should occupy. Blacks remained on the Plains, though in small numbers scattered through central Kansas, the Oklahoma Territory, West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and the Dakotas.
By 1920, the Great Migration of peoples, black and white, from the South to the North had started. It began earlier for others, like my maternal grandfather, Harrison Streibling, who after a year at Norfolk Mission College left Staunton, Va., for France and World War I.
On his return, he joined the stream of laborers bound North, heading to the mines of Pennsylvania. He was a miner, steel worker, bricklayer, ice deliver, plasterer, awning installer. He scrabbled through a thicket of jobs on the kind of byways we all traveled as we found our way home.

Chart: "Steps in a March From Bondage Toward Home and Freedom"
 
Africans provided a free, seemingly inexhaustible labor supply that could not escape because its members were easily identified, according to the historian John Hope Franklin's work "From Slavery to Freedom." Once colonists realized this, they began importing slaves, and the vast majority of blacks arrived in the New World from Africa in chains. But not all. Africans accompanied Spanish and French explorers of the New World in the 16th century. An African named Estevanico explored New Mexico and Arizona for the Spanish.

The Civil War ended slavery for blacks, but by the late 1870's, another form of bondage emerged: sharecropping and Jim Crow laws. In some parts of the South, blacks who became known as "exodusters" looked northwest to Kansas to escape slavery's legacy.

The Great Migration to the North started emptying Southern fields shortly before the 1920's. There were boom times for some in the North. Within all-black neighborhoods, entrepreneurs thrived, running restaurants, barber shops, funeral homes and banks.

Segregation began to fall under legal attacks in the 1950's, and the reforms of the Great Society in the 1960's ended most legal -- if not actual -- segregation. Those blacks who were best prepared to take advantage of the new freedom moved from all-black neighborhoods and segregated school systems.

Urban Areas have become home to most Americans, including blacks. As some move to the suburbs, both segregated housing patterns and preference combine to create new black suburbs.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Says Russia Must Do More to Get Aid

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KRONBERG, Germany, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Finance officials of the seven most powerful industrial nations agreed today that economic aid to Russia could continue as soon as it began credible measures to control inflation and budget deficits, but that Moscow still had much to do, Western officials said.
"We urged them to strengthen their efforts to bring inflation under control," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "We told the Russians that a strong stabilization program is needed to trigger more support from the International Monetary Fund." 
 Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said the Western countries had agreed to work with the Russian authorities on measures to help the population cope with the consequences of economic change -- unemployment from bankrupt state industries as they are sold off or closed down, for instance. But he added that the Russians would have to come up with most of the money for such measures themselves.
Two senior Russian officials, Finance Minister Sergei K. Dubinin and Economics Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin, said they had pledged to bring monthly inflation down from 22 percent to 7 to 9 percent by the end of this year.
 
I.M.F. Talks Expected
 Mr. Dubinin also said he expected discussions to resume by mid-March between Moscow and the Monetary Fund about a second $1.5 billion loan to help Russia make the transition to a market economy.
Echoing the caution expressed by European officials at the meeting here, Mr. Bentsen said: "I hope they can make that. It will be a difficult target."
For the American delegation here, trade friction between the United States and Japan came close to overshadowing concern about Russia.
"We have continued to urge Japan to live up to its commitment to put in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen domestic demand, to reduce its large trade surplus, to open its markets," Mr. Bentsen said. "That is in the interest of all of Japan's trading partners and in the interest of Japan."
But a senior Treasury official said that "there was no breakthrough of any kind" before the Japanese left this evening.
 
Bentsen Wary on Yen
 Pressed on speculation that the United States would try to encourage the continued increase in the exchange-rate value of the Japanese yen to make Japanese products more expensive on United States and world markets, Mr. Bentsen refused to be drawn. "We believe in the fundamentals dictating exchange rates," he said.
Finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, and Canada , known as the Group of Seven, met in a resort hotel in the hills north of Frankfurt that was built as a castle for the Queen of Prussia. The meeting followed a week of turmoil on international financial markets that has seen long-term interest rates rise steeply and the Japanese yen strengthen considerably against the dollar.
Some of the turmoil was caused by fears of inflation because of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the American economy while most of Europe except for Britain is still mired deep in recession, and some by tensions between the United States and Japan on trade issues.
Mr. Bentsen met his Japanese counterpart, Hirohisa Fujii, in the hotel this morning before the broader discussions began, but he made clear beforehand that he expected no breakthrough.
Originally, Mr. Waigel of Germany convened the gathering so representatives from the seven nations could hear reports from Russian officials about what would happen to plans by President Boris N. Yeltsin to move toward a market economy after the political backlash in last December's elections.
 
Little Money Delivered
 At their summit meeting in Japan last summer, leaders of the Group of Seven promised $28 billion to Russia in grants and loans, mainly through the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions, but made the assistance conditional on Russian steps to bring inflation and government deficit spending under control. Only a small amount of money has actually been delivered.
The fund had provided Russia with $2.5 billion in loans since 1992, but has held back on an additional $1.5 billion as Mr. Yeltsin's commitment to change has seemed to waver.
Before today's meeting, officials made clear that no additional Western assistance was under consideration, but that they would like to give the Russians assurances that previous commitments would be met if Moscow continued reform.
"Our response will be dictated by their behavior," a senior Treasury Department official said.
 
No Effect From Spying Seen
 American officials said they did not expect American assistance to be affected by accusations that a senior Central Intelligence Agency official had been a spy for the Soviet Union and, after its collapse, for the Russian Government.
Mr. Dubinin, Russia's Finance Minister, Mr. Shokhin, the Economics Minister, and the central bank chief, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, repeated earlier pledges by Mr. Yeltsin to keep moving ahead with privatization of state-owned industries and budget reforms, but not so fast as to suddenly throw millions of Russians out of work or into poverty.
Fears that change was proceeding too fast are thought to be the main reason for the strong showing of ultranationalist opponents of Mr. Yeltsin in the December parliamentary elections, when they won around a quarter of the total vote.
The latest Russian budget target is to reduce the deficit this year to about $30 billion, but only with Western aid and agreement to roll over much of the $80 billion foreign debt, and to reduce annual inflation to 400 percent.

HEADLINE: North Korea Grants Nuclear Inspectors Visas

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 26

 BODY:
In another example of the brinkmanship that has characterized the yearlong dispute over its nuclear ambitions, North Korea has avoided a possible trade embargo at the last hour by agreeing to open some of its nuclear installations to international inspectors.
North Korea gave its assent to the inspections late Friday, only hours before the start of a process that could have resulted in a trade blockade against the Communist country. 
 At the center of the dispute is the suspicion that the Government of Kim Il Sung is developing atomic weapons. The North Korean Government had refused to grant visas to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency for an examination of seven sites. Today Pyongyang relented and granted the visas for the inspectors, who are to begin work Tuesday to determine if nuclear material has been diverted for possible military use.
The seven inspectors will leave Vienna for Pyongyang on Sunday, the agency said in a statement from Vienna.
Hans Blix, the head of the international energy agency, had warned North Korea that he would refer the dispute to the Security Council if the visas were not granted by Monday.
But the agreement reached Friday night does not resolve the Pyongyang Government's continuing refusal to let international inspectors visit two secret nuclear installations. The agency suspects that the two sites would yield evidence that North Korea is trying to build atomic weapons in breach of the pledge it made when it signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
In Washington, President Clinton said he was "encouraged" by North Korea's decision to open the nuclear sites to inspection. The accord was reached after two days of talks between Thomas C. Hubbard, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, and Ho Jung, North Korea's Deputy Representative to the United Nations.
In return, the United States has agreed to suspend annual military exercises with South Korean forces. The United States will also hold a third round of high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva on improving relations, starting March 21.
North and South Korea are meanwhile to begin working-level talks on Tuesday with the goal of exchanging envoys, Administration officials said.
North and South Korea do not have diplomatic relations. The mission of the two envoys will be to put into force an agreement the two Koreas signed last December to forswear dangerous nuclear technologies, like reprocessing and enrichment, which have military applications.
At the conclusion of the talks late Friday, Mr. Hubbard described the accord as "only the first step toward the resolution of the nuclear issue."
"But we are pleased that these needed inspections will in fact begin" on Tuesday, he added.
Administration officials say the agreement means that North Korea has fallen back into step with the basic understanding it reached with the United States last December.
That understanding provided for a new round of high-level talks between the Clinton Administration and the North Korean Government on resolving nuclear issues and improving relations once North Korea had reopened its declared nuclear sites to inspectors and begun a dialogue with the South.
At the round of talks now scheduled to start in Geneva on March 21, the United States will offer to help end North Korea's international isolation by promoting trade and aid links and holding out the prospect of eventual diplomatic recognition for Pyongyang.
But in return, Administration officials say North Korea must allow the energy agency to visit the two secret nuclear sites it wants to inspect, abandon any covert nuclear weapons program it may have started and agree to switch over to technologies in its civil nuclear program that offer less scope for military misuse.
The regular inspections of North Korea's seven declared nuclear sites were broken off by Pyongyang just over a year ago after the International Atomic Energy Agency first found evidence that it was being deceived by North Korea.

HEADLINE: Incinerators Again Testing A New Mayor

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
During his campaign for mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani expressed skepticism about plans for two large incinerators in Brooklyn, saying New York City should focus on recycling instead. But a series of recent actions by the administration has worried opponents of incineration, who say they fear the plans will go forward.
The plans call for a new $450 million incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to handle 3,000 tons a day and for upgrading an unused, smaller plant in Bensonhurst. They have been promoted by previous administrations as vital to the city's efforts to end its reliance on the overflowing Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. 
 But local opposition has left the projects mired in court fights, and when Mr. Giuliani met with neighborhood residents during the campaign, he pledged to work to increase recycling to alleviate concerns about both incinerators.
 
Concern Over Developments
 Opponents of the incinerators -- a diverse force that includes the Speaker of the State Assembly as well as community groups -- say they are concerned about these recent developments:
*Mr. Giuliani's decision to seek a state permit that would help clear the way for construction of the Navy Yard incinerator.
*The city's decision to submit a court brief opposing a lawsuit that seeks an environmental impact study for the Bensonhurst incinerator.
*The Mayor's plan to cut $5.7 million from the city's recycling funds.
*Mr. Giuliani's invitation to the City Council to revise its 1989 legislation on mandatory recycling and perhaps scale back its goals. The action follows a ruling last week by the state's highest court ordering the city to meet its own requirement that 25 percent of its waste be recycled.
Among those questioning the Giuliani administration's resolve is Sheldon Silver, the Manhattan Democrat who is the Speaker of the State Assembly. "It certainly does trouble me," he said. "It's clearly a change. It looks like perhaps all they want to do is go forward with incineration."
David N. Dinkins, who called for a moratorium on new incinerators during his 1989 mayoral campaign, nonetheless kept the Navy Yard project on track once he was in office. Officials in the Giuliani administration say they, too, do not want to close the door on the project.
Paul Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel, said the Mayor regards incineration as a "last hope" that should be preserved only as "an insurance policy" in the event that recycling and other alternatives cannot adequately handle the city's waste problems.
Also, a letter on Friday from Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers to the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, said the administration was actively investigating plans to export wastes to other states.
The merits and perils of incineration as a waste disposal alternative have been debated for years. Proponents portray it as safe and cost-effective, saying it would relieve the city's dependence on the overtaxed Fresh Kills landfill, which is expected to be filled to capacity as early as the next decade. Opponents portray incineration as a health risk, particularly to the very young and the elderly, and assert that its economic appeal has not been established.
The opponents assert that the evidence of its dangers because of harmful pollutants has only been strengthened in the seven years since the city conducted its health-risk assessment for the Brooklyn Navy Yard project.
 
'Wise and Prudent Course'
 But members of Mr. Giuliani's administration said that the Mayor staked out a careful position of flexibility on incineration during the campaign last fall and that he has not altered it.
"We believe it is the wise and prudent course to retain incineration as a last option," said Mr. Crotty, who has advised the Mayor on the issue along with Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner, who also served under Mr. Dinkins. "That's the policy the Mayor is going to go along with. Where will we be if in the year 2000 we haven't met recycling goals and our landfill has reached capacity? It's an insurance policy. And that doesn't mean the Mayor has backed off his position at all."
Opponents of the incinerators, while conceding that it is very early in Mr. Giuliani's administration to draw conclusions, have become increasingly suspicious of the Mayor's actions. They point to an Oct. 15 interview with a community newspaper in Brooklyn -- in which the Mayor said he would commit himself "to a massive recycling program so there isn't a need to build a new incinerator" -- and they ask what has happened.
"Follow the administration's reasoning, and you might as well build a nuclear power plant in the middle of Brooklyn just so you have another option," said Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate.
 
Seeking a Reassessment
 Much of the recent criticism of the Mayor's actions has centered on recycling. Mr. Crotty said the administration hoped to persuade the City Council to reassess "what's physically realistic and fundable" and rewrite the 1989 recycling law, perhaps scaling back its targets.
Incinerator opponents accuse the Mayor of trying to maintain the status quo, both with regard to the level of recycling and the building of the incinerator.
"It's disturbing because what his actions of late indicate is that his position is no different from the previous administration on how it is going to handle the waste problem," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "They are the same tracks going in the same direction toward the same destination."
 
Lawsuits, Votes and Protests
 The course of the debate is a long and complicated one. There have been numerous lawsuits, and as many appeals. Administrations have come and gone, permits have been issued and then revoked, votes have been taken and protests have been staged.
At the moment, the State Department of Environmental Conservation will make the next rulings of consequence. A decision on whether the city, under a plan submitted in the final week of the Dinkins administration, has met the state's pollution requirements for the Navy Yard incinerator is expected on Wednesday. The department is also expected to rule on the city's appeal of a ruling requiring extensive air quality hearings for the Bensonhurst incinerator.
No one -- not opponents, not proponents, not the city's Corporation Counsel -- expects anything but more litigation and more contesting of additional permits to follow. Start of construction of the Navy Yard incinerator before 1996 is considered inconceivable by everyone.
"I think the Mayor is going to go for the incinerator, and that everything else is a snow job," said Rosie Baerga, a leader of the Community Alliance for the Environment in Williamsburg. "O.K., fine. Be that way. But the Hasidim, the Poles, the Italians, the African-Americans, the Hispanics, we are not going to be quiet."
Mr. Silver, the Assembly Speaker, whose Lower East Side district is across the East River from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, cautioned the Mayor against hasty decisions on the matter.
"They appear to be making a decision six or seven weeks into their administration that could affect an awful lot of people," Mr. Silver said. "And that can't be right."

HEADLINE: Business and Universities as Partners

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
More and more college and university presidents, like City University's chancellor, serve as paid members of corporate boards of directors, as American companies seek to build bridges to higher education.
A recent survey of 1,000 heads of colleges and universities showed that about 10 percent reported corporate membership, with many serving on one to three corporations. But the City University chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, who serves on five (she has said she intends to resign from one in April), faced criticism last week that her outside activities took her out of town too often. 
 Last year, in addition to her salary of $158,000, she earned $140,000 from this work.
Last Tuesday the City University's trustees adopted a resolution requiring the chancellor and other top university officials to make known any income they earned from sources other than their university jobs and to account for the time that they spend on business unrelated to CUNY.
The survey of heads of colleges and universities, by the College and University Personnel Association, an academic service organization, shows that 104 of the 1,000 academic chiefs who responded said they derived at least some income from paid corporate directorships, according to the organization's executive director, Richard C. Creal.
 
'A Definite Trend'
 "There's a definite trend for corporations to seek out academic leaders to serve on their boards," said Tom Ingram, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, a nonprofit service organization. "That's because of a great awareness that the future of the economy is tied to higher education and that a variety of partnerships can develop."
Such membership helps both colleges and corporations, according to Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 colleges and universities.
"They need to be out there in the larger society in order to be effective leaders," he said.
"They can also learn a great deal from such involvement as when we recently brought together 40 C.E.O.'s with an equal number of college and university presidents, and they discussed what can be learned from corporations that have had to reduce their size."
While some institutions, like the City University, limit the outside activities of their presidents or chancellors, it is difficult to set firm guidelines on such activities, Mr. Atwell said. "Some corporations," he said, "ask board members to attend only two or three meetings a year whereas others require a great deal more than that."
 
Questions of Time and Propriety
 But from the corporation's point of view, such service should be limited, according to John Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a service organization. "I can't see how an active executive gives the necessary time or commitment to his work in today's environment if he sits on the boards of more than three outside corporations," Mr. Nash said.
And some question the propriety of any corporate membership. The executive director of a Ralph Nader organization, the National Coalition for Universities in the Public Interest, condemns the practice as "an unholy alliance between business and the university because it compromises the integrity of the academic institution."
"What Chancellor Reynolds has done is both normal and improper," said the executive director, Leonard Minsky. "Suppose you have a university laboratory working on a way to control environmental damage and then the president of that university serves on the board of a corporation that is causing that damage. Isn't that a serious conflict of purpose? The search for truth and the search for profit are incompatible."
Among those who choose not to serve on corporate boards are L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, and D. Bruce Johnstone, who retired last week as chancellor of the State University of New York. In the past Mr. Johnstone served as a director of Key Bank.
 
From Pensions to Chemicals
 Of those who do serve on corporate boards, Jack Peltason, the president of the University of California, serves on the boards of three corporations engaged in a range of activities, from pensions and insurance to computer hardware.
Randolph W. Bromery, the president of Springfield College, a private four-year school in Massachusetts, serves on five boards: Exxon Corporation, Chemical Banking Corporation, Chemical Bank, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and Nynex.
Harold T. Shapiro, the president of Princeton University, is on the board of the Dow Chemical Company.
Dr. Reynolds said she felt a special mission as one of the few women in high academic posts to serve on boards, in part to urge better treatment of women in hiring and promotion, salary and training.
A steadily increasing number of corporate directors are women, although the overall percentage of board seats held by women remains small. According to a study released last fall by Catalyst, a Washington-based nonprofit research and advisory service concerned with women's issues, there were 46 women on the boards of leading American corporations in 1977. Today the number has increased to 500. But of the 11,715 present seats on the boards of top corporations companies, only 721, or 6.2 percent, are occupied by women.
Forty-nine percent of these directors said their professional experience was in the field of education.

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks Tax Plan Beyond State's Borders

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. 24

 BODY:
When the New Jersey Assembly takes up the first round of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposed income-tax cuts on Monday, many members of the Republican majority will support the cuts in the belief that they are following in the footsteps of Republican tax cutters in Massachusetts, Michigan and Delaware.
During her campaign for governor and since her election, Mrs. Whitman repeatedly held up the actions of Republican administrations in those states as examples of how bold tax cuts have begun to pay off with revived economies, just as the Governor believes that her tax cut will help New Jersey. 
Yet the parallels between Governor Whitman's plan and the actions of Governor John Engler of Michigan, Pete du Pont and later John Castle of Delaware, and William Weld of Massachusetts are in many ways tenuous. Only in Delaware were income taxes cut as sharply as Mrs. Whitman is proposing, and they were cut as Delaware's economy was expanding so rapidly that the cuts resulted in no loss of revenue to the state.
New Jersey's economy is still struggling, in contrast, and the 5 percent income-tax cut the Assembly is all but certain to pass on Monday will produce an immediate loss of $200 million in revenue once it is enacted. The State Senate is scheduled to take up the tax cuts on Thursday.
 
A Painful Solution
 In Massachusetts and Michigan, Governors Weld and Engler did what Governor Whitman has so far chosen not to do: endure the political pain of first cutting spending to eliminate looming deficits and then trimming taxes at the margins if at all.
"There is no comparison between what Whitman is proposing for New Jersey and what happened in Michigan and Massachusetts," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany.
"Maybe Delaware is an example, because they did cut income taxes," Mr. Gold went on. "But Weld and Engler deserve their anti-tax reputations not because they cut taxes a lot, but because they resisted the forces to raise taxes. What Governor Whitman is doing is a very large actual cut, one that is much larger than anything that has occurred in Massachusetts or Michigan."
 
Lower Taxes, More Growth?
 The available evidence so far casts doubt on Mrs. Whitman's supply-side argument that lower taxes produce economic growth. Michigan is enjoying a moderately strong recovery that may be benefiting from Mr. Engler's initiatives, but Massachusetts, three years after Mr. Weld took office, is still in the doldrums, and the boom that paid for Delaware's tax cuts a decade ago has faded.
Though some New Jersey Republicans often cite the party's successes in Massachusetts, in reality the 5 percent cut in the income-tax rate that Mr. Weld often takes credit for was enacted before he took office but did not take effect until after he was sworn in.
Mr. Weld did repeal a business sales tax that had not yet taken effect, and, along with Governor Engler, he cut inheritance taxes; both governors have also enacted some investment-tax credits, though both states have increased cigarette and liquor taxes.
Delaware's top income-tax rate was reduced over six years from 19.8 percent before the first cuts in 1979, the highest in the country, to 7.7 percent in 1988, which is close to the top rates of Delaware's neighbors.
However, in 1982 Delaware deregulated its banking industry, causing bank holding companies to rush into the state, rebuilding Wilmington's skyline and resulting in such an influx of jobs and investment that income-tax receipts remained constant even as the income-tax rate was cut by nearly two-thirds.
"The tax cuts were certainly helpful to the state economy, but they also came at a time when the national economy was strong and the Delaware economy was doing better than the national," said Michael Ferguson, the state budget director, who was also budget director under former Governor Castle. "But clearly corporations don't want to be in a state that has the highest income-tax rate in the country."
 
Spending Plan to Be Unveiled
 Governor Whitman has said she would reveal her spending plan on March 15. At that time state lawmakers will get their first glimpse at how she plans to absorb the loss of $1.4 billion over three years, which is the estimated price of her promise to reduce the state's income tax by 30 percent over that period. In addition to the cuts, the Governor must also close a projected built-in deficit of more than $1 billion starting July 1.
From the outset, however, lawmakers have worried that the loss of tax revenue will force cuts in state aid to school districts, municipalities, universities and transportation. Those concerns are borne out in Massachusetts, where Governor Weld's budget cuts forced a reduction in state aid to municipalities and schools from $2.88 billion in 1990 to $2.33 billion in 1992, Mr. Weld's first budget. That figure has since increased, to $2.96 billion, while aid to higher education has dropped by a third and tuition at public colleges has doubled.
In Michigan, Governor Engler closed mental hospitals, took 82,000 childless, able-bodied adults off welfare rolls and closed entire state departments to eliminate a $1.8 billion deficit that he inherited. He also made many enemies along the way.
"The first two years were just brutal," said John Truscott, Mr. Engler's spokesman. And State Representative Maxine Berman, a Democrat from Southfield, remains harshly critical.
 
Tax Cut vs. Spending Cut
 "The Governor has not cut taxes; we have cut spending in a very, very painful way," Ms. Berman said. "So if Governor Engler is to be an example of how you cut budgets, then there are going to be many, many people in New Jersey who are going to be in as much difficulty as a lot of people in Michigan are."
Yet Mr. Engler and Mr. Weld are both widely popular in their states, as was Mr. Castle when he left the Delaware governorship in 1992. In the end, Governor Engler said in an interview, voters remember chief executives who make difficult decisions, and he said he had given some advice to the New Jersey Governor.
"I told Christie that she is absolutely on the right track, because she's making the right decisions even if they are tough decisions," Mr. Engler said. "What's important in all this is that these decisions pass the test of time, and I absolutely support her in what she's doing, even if it means that New Jersey will end up being a tougher competitor for Michigan after she gets this done."
The cornerstone of Governor Whitman's tax-cut program has always been her supply-side belief that reducing the tax burden will spur New Jersey's economic growth. Yet in Michigan, Massachusetts and Delaware, the evidence on that front is not clear. Private employment in Michigan grew by 1.7 percent from June 1990 to June of last year, giving it a rank in the middle of the states, at No. 25, in growth over that period.
Governor Engler hastens to take credit for the growth in jobs, and while the giant auto companies account for part of the resurgence, a lot of growth in the state has indeed occurred in small businesses of the kind Mr. Engler hoped to help by avoiding tax increases and providing businesses with incentives to grow.
Mr. Weld's Massachusetts, however, shows scant signs of recovery and ranks 47th nationally to New Jersey's 46th in job creation over the same period. Delaware is doing only slightly better and ranks 34th nationally.

HEADLINE: Rage in a Village in Mexico Where Land Is Life

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EL CARRIZAL, Mexico

 BODY:
It is a possession so precious that it is hidden deep in the woods. When it is needed an elder member of this communal farm in the state of Chiapas gallops away on a white horse, returning half an hour later with a portfolio. Inside are the yellowed papers the Indian peasants of El Carrizal filed on April 7, 1983, to formally demand possession of the land on which they and their forebears had worked in virtual slavery since the turn of the century.
All over Chiapas there are groups of poor farmers like those in El Carrizal who have had faith in Mexico's singular system of land redistribution but have not obtained what they wanted. Their frustration, anger and feeling of betrayal are held in common by the members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which attacked several cities on Jan. 1 and demands, among other things, the land that for them means life. 
 What the 45 Tzeltal Indian families of El Carrizal did in 1983 was a classic Mexican land taking, the kind outlined in the 1910 revolution that pits peons against the powerful ranchers for whom they worked. It also helps explain the current revolt in Chiapas, where Indian demands to own land have been ignored so routinely that resentment has turned to rage.
 
Behind the Anger
 The reasons for such anger are apparent. Almost 11 years after they gathered up their courage and legally claimed their land, the families in El Carrizal still have not received the response guaranteed in Mexico's Constitution. So with the rights they assume are inherent in their treasured 1983 papers, they simply took over the land from its private owner.
They have built 30 houses, two schools, a church and a basketball court. Three times already pistoleros hired by the former owner have tried to destroy the settlement, forcing the people to hide in the mountains. Three times they have come back to start again, clutching their treasured legal papers.
"For a long time now the Government has kept telling us we will get our declaration, but it never happens," said Pablo Gomez Vasquez, a stocky 35-year-old whose parents and grandparents are buried in simple graves, with pine boughs as headstones, on the land for which he is fighting.
As is the way with many Indian communities here, he was designated to relate El Carrizal's history, and no one else would be identified. "The Government says 'Respect the law,' " he said, "but how are we going to respect the law if the law doesn't respect us?"
 
No More Redistribution
 Specifically, the farmers in Chiapas have asked for the repeal of a recent constitutional amendment that effectively ended the land giveaways that started in 1915. In one of the most significant moves of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the Government in 1992 gave peasants the right to sell their land, but said no more land would be given away because practically none was left to give. The 28,000 community farms owned by more than three million peasants already occupy more than half of Mexico's arable land.
Furthermore, Government economists said, giving away small, unproductive parcels of land practically guarantees that the poor will remain poor forever. Most peasant farmers do not use any modern technology, not even fertilizers, and do not have access to the capital needed to buy equipment or supplies.
[At the peace talks that have begun in Chiapas, rebel leaders have thrown those arguments back at the officials who made them, claiming that redistribution of the land by itself is not enough. They argue now for productive land and the technology to keep it that way, for roads to get produce to market and for a commitment to make peasant farming worthwhile.]
The heart of the matter remains the land itself. For Indians here, descendants of the Maya people, land is the source of life. Broken Government promises to deliver land are considered sufficient cause for taking up arms.
"When the people saw that their requests were never being respected it created an enormous discontent here," said the Rev. Pablo Romo, a Roman Catholic priest who is director of the Fray Bartolome Center for Human Rights in San Cristobal de las Casas. "This is a fundamental part of the current conflict."
The 1910 revolution promised to break up big haciendas and redistribute the land to landless peasants. But the concept never really took hold in Chiapas because of the state's remoteness and the political strength of the gentry.
 
Peasants Without Land
 "The revolution just didn't happen here," said Ronald B. Nigh, an anthropologist at the Center of Investigations and Advanced Studies in Social Anthropology, a Government research institution in San Cristobal. "What you have is really a prerevolutionary situation where all the best land is in the hands of the ranchers, even though they deny it, and the peasants who work there have no land at all."
But the poor of Chiapas still cling to the belief that someday they will have land. They have filed their petitions with the federal bureaucracy responsible for giving out land, and they have waited. Even today, though the giveaway technically has ended, the Government still has to process thousands of backlogged demands, like the one from El Carrizal.
Three years ago, before the constitutional changes, there were 25,000 unresolved land claims in Mexico. That has been reduced to 3,000, mainly by refusing the claims.
It is generally believed to be too early to tell how the new regulations have affected Mexico. There has not been any great wave of peasants selling their land, nor have the old haciendas returned. But agriculture officials say outside investors have expressed interest in buying or renting the best peasant land, although only a handful of deals have yet been negotiated.
The land on which El Carrizal's residents grow corn, beans and coffee once belonged to a huge ranch called San Rafael, about 40 miles from San Cristobal. Mr. Gomez Vasquez's father and grandfather worked for the same man, Manuel Lievano Dominguez, in conditions close to slavery. They gave three work days a week without pay to cover the rent on a tiny plot of land on which they could grow their own food. The owners took a share of whatever they produced: corn, beans, eggs, sugar cane.
 
The Peasants Organize
 Hearing a rumor in 1983 that the ranch might be sold, the peasants organized themselves with the help of a group called the Emiliano Zapata Campesino Organization. Some people believe that an offshoot of the group was the nucleus for the Zapatista Army.
Over the last 80 years, the process for making land claims has evolved from revolution to bureaucracy. The original solicitation is in some ways the most important legal step.
On a brilliant sunny afternoon, Mr. Gomez Vasquez took the original document from the portfolio and handling it as delicately as a holy book showed a visitor what it said. Just one long sheet of coarse paper, typed in single-space by some public writer, the document is a manifesto of peasant rights.
"If we ask for the rights to this property," it said, "it is because in it we have left on it our lives, working from 5 in the morning until 7 at night; we have enriched our patrons. They do not need their property, while we, we need it to live."
The demand was rejected outright. The community tried again in July 1985, but when a month passed without any answer they decided to simply do what they felt they had the right to do. They stopped working on the ranch and moved to their own spot on a high mountain plateau.
Mr. Gomez Vasquez says, and research by the Fray Bartolome Center for Human Rights confirms, that a series of repressions began then that would continue until the present: late night raids, beatings, unjustified jailings. The community was burned to the ground once, and hired thugs accompanied by police officers stole everything, including every machete.
 
A Shared Struggle
 The people struggled on in fear. That was when they first hid their papers, worried that in another raid all would truly be lost. Their anger grew as their poverty deepened, and they were preparing for another raid on Jan. 1, this time supported by the peasants in a nearby community who strongly support the governing party.
"Thanks to the Zapatistas, that didn't happen," Mr. Gomez Vasquez said. Although they fly white flags of peace atop two poles near their basketball court, which forms a kind of civic square, the men of El Carrizal say they have no fear of the Zapatistas.
"We share the same struggle, the same goals," Mr. Gomez Vasquez said, returning from a visit to the grave of his parents. "Their way is different from our own, but that is not to say that we are against it. It's just that it's different. Someday, who knows, maybe we will join with them."
In the afternoon, after the men return from the fields and the women are busy preparing the evening meal, a kind of assembly occurs at El Carrizal. The men sit on two benches made from tree trunks. These people do not vote in regular elections (it costs 50 cents to take the bus into town and it is just not worth it they say) but here all decisions are made democratically.
This day they discussed the land conflict, again. The Government has offered 272 hectares, or 670 acres, just 20 percent of their request. It has also offered rough land in another part of the state, far from the graves of the ancestors. Both offers have been rejected.
 
'Nobody Has Anything'
 Those who want to speak leave the bench and sit on a rough white rock or stand at the other end of the parallel rows, their hats at their feet.
One old man in a ragged knit shirt placed his hat on the ground. "If the newspapers all say that Mexico is at peace, that everyone now is happy because the fighting is over, they are wrong," he said. "Companions, it is true that in Mexico we are almost all equal. But what is equality here? It is that nobody has anything."
He apologized to his friends for the holes in his pants, and to a visitor for the roughness of his Spanish. "If the Government doesn't give us our land claim, then we'll keep on fighting," he said.
How long will it be before they are forced to do more, perhaps to take up arms?
"The only answer to that," he said, "is that there are no arms here now."
If there were, he said, things would be different.

HEADLINE: Haitians, Thwarted at Sea, Look for a Back Door

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 26

 BODY:
With the United States Coast Guard still repatriating Haitians picked up in boats trying to flee to Florida, many Haitians are increasingly choosing other routes and methods in their attempt to escape, diplomats and human rights officials say.
With the political repression and economic hardship still severe, many Haitians are determined to leave. Four boatloads of Haitian refugees have been picked up at sea north of Haiti since Feb. 4, the most in a single month since military leaders refused to resign to allow the return of Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 But diplomats and rights officials say the risk of repatriation has led many Haitians to explore alternative routes to flee the Caribbean country. One new trend has been a rise in the number of Haitians trying to reach the Turks and Caicos Islands aboard freighters and sailing vessels.
Sometimes ill-prepared, sometimes carrying false travel and identification papers, those migrants try and pass themselves off as crew members on boats that regularly ply their trade between Haiti and the British-owned islands, diplomats said. If they can get past the United States Coast Guard and reach land, they can try to island-hop up the Bahamas, and embark on regularly scheduled voyages to Florida.
"It's either more widely used, or just discovered," Cmdr. Dave Breuninger of the Coast Guard said of the new route. Reliable estimates of the number of Haitians using that strategy were unavailable.
Anne Fuller, associate director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, said that many Haitians appear to have realized that their chances of making it to Florida from Haiti on wooden boats are far outweighed by the risk of drowning or repatriation.
"I think people are afraid of spending several hundred dollars and losing it all," Ms. Fuller said. "They are afraid of not knowing whether local authorities will put them in jail. Most people know they're not going to get through, so they don't try."
Less than 1,000 boat people have been returned to Haiti since the United States order to forcibly repatriate Haitians went into effect in January 1993, compared with well over 30,000 who were returned in the 16 months following the September 1991 military coup against Father Aristide.
Another alternative increasingly chosen by Haitians seeking to escape is to slip over the border to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and find work in sugar-cane fields or make their way to Santo Domingo, the capital.

HEADLINE: Investment Service Reduces Troy's Rating

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y., Feb. 26

 BODY:
The City of Troy, which continues to struggle with a four-year-old financial crisis, had its credit rating reduced below investment grade on Friday by Moody's Investors Service.
Moody's said it had cut Troy's credit rating from B-aa to B-a, one step below investment grade, in response to what it called the "ongoing deterioration" of the city's finances. 
 Any bonds ranked B-a or below are considered junk bonds. The lower rating means fewer investors will buy Troy's bonds, and the city may have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors to those bonds.
The city, just northeast of Albany, ended the 1993 fiscal year with an estimated general fund deficit of $4.5 million, the company said.
The Interim City Manager, John H. Clinton, whose last day in office was Friday, has warned that the city's deficit could run as high as $17 million by the end of 1994.
The city's failure to budget money to repay a $35.1 million mortgage taken in 1992, high overtime costs for the police and fire departments, a shortfall caused by the shutdown of the city landfill and an overestimate in a past surplus have contributed to Troy's problems, Moody's said.
Utica and Lackawanna are the only two other cities in the state rated B-a by Moody's.

HEADLINE: Boroughs Squabble Over Building Project

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Last summer, Representative Floyd H. Flake managed to slip a stipulation into a Federal appropriations bill to build a new regional headquarters for the Food and Drug Administration -- but only on a parking lot at York College in Jamaica, Queens. Since that just happens to be in his district, he thought he had sealed a good deal for his constituents in one of the city's more depressed areas.
Instead, Mr. Flake's legislative legerdemain -- in alliance with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- opened a free-for-all that has tied up approval of the $180 million project altogether. It would be the F.D.A.'s biggest laboratory outside its national headquarters in Maryland, testing bales of food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, including samples from the tons of foreign goods that arrive each year at Kennedy International Airport. 
 There are a few catches:
Brooklyn, current home to the F.D.A.'s regional laboratory, claims it was robbed -- in part because it did not have a member on the House Appropriations Committee at the time and did not spot Mr. Flake's move.
Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island says she would be happy to step into the breach by luring the lab and its 300 jobs to the site of the soon-to-be-closed Navy Homeport there, and even New Jersey has pricked up its ears.
And the City University, which as York College's parent would have to approve any deal, is balking -- over what academic benefits would be gained, and over how to replace the 275 parking spaces that would be lost.
"CUNY has got a bunch of bureaucrats who are trying to negotiate parking spots out of the Federal Government and holding up my project," said the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman. "This is crazy. I'm going to have a heart attack."
The fight is not quite that simple, but it is a classic example of why getting things done can be so complicated in New York, where local bureaucracies rival the Federal one for complexity, and where more than a dozen members of Congress compete for Federal largess in a geographical area that in most parts of the nation would not have enough people to support a single member.
The tussling has produced a blizzard of snippy letters, and CUNY has hired a distinguished nutrition scientist, Dr. Louis Lasagna, the dean of academic affairs for the Tufts University Medical School in Boston, to review the deal on its behalf.
"There's a great deal of interest in this," said Jay Hershenson, CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations. "It's real clear that CUNY is going through a series of reviews here that indicate that this being taken very seriously."
It seems equally clear that CUNY is doing all it can to hold out for the best deal on a project that it never solicited in the first place and that was basically imposed on it by Mr. Flake. The 175,000-square-foot building -- which under Mr. Flake's legislation would be privately built and leased by the F.D.A. for 20 years at not more that $7.8 million a year -- has not even been designed yet, and construction would not begin for at least two years. The subject is on the university board's agenda for its meeting next month, and Ms. Shulman said the chairman, James P. Murphy, has promised action.
Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, has seized on the delay to make his own pitch for finding a new site in Brooklyn for the headquarters, which for years has been on Third Avenue along the Brooklyn waterfront in Sunset Park, once a major port of entry for the products it tested.
 
'This Is an Outrage'
 "It's a very sensitive thing with me, because I think this is an outrage," said Mr. Golden, who has long had little to do with Senator Moynihan and is furious at Mr. Flake. "I'd like to know how a member of Queens can introduce a committee resolution, how he can take something away from people in Brooklyn, from a needy, interracial neighborhood. He's not creating jobs in Queens, he's stealing jobs from Brooklyn."
Mr. Moynihan's press secretary, Brian Connolly, said the Senator had not been trying to favor one borough over another, only to replace the agency's outdated and decrepit headquarters. "There was a very impressive proposal prepared by Congressman Flake, and they needed a new place," he said.
Mr. Flake's spokesman, Marshall Mitchell, said the Congressman has long sought to make Jamaica a hub for Federal offices (a local Social Security office is already there) in hopes of spurring economic revitalization, that York has always been a centerpiece of such efforts and that "nobody really pushed hard for it to be in Brooklyn."
 
Battling Boroughs
 Or as Ms. Shulman's counsel, Nicholas G. Garaufis, put it: "It's not like we tried to shanghai this at the last minute; we've been trying to shanghai it for years."
Ms. Shulman said Brooklyn already had many Federal projects, including courthouses and offices.
"The F.D.A. wants to come to Queens, and wants to come to York, and Howie has had a lot of wonderful things in Brooklyn," she said. "He should really keep his cotton-picking hands off my project."
The F.D.A. referred all inquiries about the project to the New York regional office of the General Services Administration, whose spokeswoman, Renee Miscione, would only say, "We're following a Congressional mandate on the project to effect an agreement with York College, and we're trying to do that."
But Ms. Shulman has worried that the F.D.A. would lose patience, and perhaps seek Congressional approval for another site, so she has tried to meet the university's objections one by one. She found an underused municipal parking garage on Archer Avenue, three blocks from the college site, that could lease 200 parking spaces, and has promised to provide city capital budget funds to pave a nearby vacant city lot to create 75 more.
Other questions may be stickier, including how to create still more parking spaces that the university wants, and also how to justify turning over land controlled by the State Dormitory Authority to a Federal agency that would use it for purposes only indirectly related to the academic mission of York College, which has about 7,000 students, many of them older working adults. The college's long-term plan calls for eventually building a student union that could have gone on the proposed F.D.A. site.
 
What About York?
 Under state law, said Mr. Hershenson, the CUNY spokesman, such land must be used for purposes related to the college. At its other labs, including the existing one in Brooklyn, the F.D.A. has various arrangements with academic institutions for student internships and faculty research projects, and presumably would continue them at York. But university officials have expressed concern that the F.D.A.'s applied research would not necessarily jibe with York's science faculty's needs, especially since the college does not even have a graduate school, and that in any case the agency could not devote enough time or equipment to the college to justify surrendering the land.
"The F.D.A. has indicated in writing that it is interested in pursuing such issues, and we have asked for greater specificity," Mr. Hershenson said. "We have to look out for the interests of our students and faculty."
Mr. Golden has raised a host of other objections, including concerns that the Queens site is not properly zoned for laboratory use, though he concedes the Federal Government could probably override that.
But Ms. Shulman said she refuses to entertain defeat.
"We're not going to let that happen," she said. "I mean, we'd be the laughingstock of the universe if we lost it. It's a miracle."

HEADLINE: The Woodstock Nation Meets the 90's;
Warily Revisiting a Cultural Icon, for Peace, Love and Profits

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAUGERTIES, N.Y.

 BODY:
Dick Wrolsen wasn't at the first Woodstock festival 25 years ago. But he said he had seen enough on television to know that its anniversary should not be celebrated this summer, as planned, here in the quiet town where he has lived for all his 61 years.
"You can expect to see urination, defecation and fornication on private property," Mr. Wrolsen, a retired employee of International Business Machines Corporation, said over coffee recently. "For the safety and welfare of the community at large, I believe the festival should not take place." 
 Bubbling up from the music and mud of the first Woodstock festival is a stew of fears, but also dreams, about how the concert's 25th anniversary might affect life in a pair of upstate towns. Not one but two commemorative concerts are scheduled for the weekend of Aug. 12: in Saugerties, an understated Hudson River community about 100 miles north of New York City, and in Bethel, the Catskill resort town that was host to the original. (In 1994, as in 1969, the town of Woodstock itself has lent its name but little else.) The promoters planning the concert in Saugerties have the rights to the world-famous name and envision 250,000 young people camped out for a marathon "Woodstock '94" rock festival on a 400-acre farm on Route 212.
 
'Woodstock' vs. 'Bethel'
 Their rivals have the farm where it really all began, Max Yasgur's in Bethel, about 50 miles southeast of here. But their musical extravaganza, which they hope will draw as many as 80,000 people, must settle for the name "Bethel '94."
Some residents in the two communities agree with Mr. Wrolsen that crowding that many people into such small towns -- Saugerties has a year-round population of 20,000; Bethel, 4,100 -- could lead only to trouble. But others, including Jim Griffis, 56, the Town Supervisor of Saugerties, believe that a concert that once symbolized peace and love has evolved into a powerful engine of economic development -- something that could draw tourists from around the world to an area that has endured economic hard times in recent years. For months, officials in Saugerties and Bethel, as well as on the county and state levels, have been consumed by heated discussions on whether to allow the concerts at all.
So far, the two municipalities have granted the promoters only preliminary approval, pending a host of reviews to determine, among other things, how traffic would be affected, where concertgoers would spend the night and whether the security of residents could be assured.
 
Can They Pull Them Off?
 Still, plans for the two concerts appear further along than past efforts to commemorate the Woodstock anniversary, which ultimately fell flat.
The promoter behind the Saugerties concert is Woodstock Ventures, which staged the original Woodstock concert in Bethel in 1969. Unable to reach agreement with Bethel officials this time around, Michael Lang and his two partners in Woodstock Ventures came to this community about 15 miles northeast of the town of Woodstock.
Mr. Lang, now 49, says the residents of Saugerties should put whatever fears they have to rest. This summer's concert, he said, would bear little resemblance to its 1969 namesake, where more than 350,000 people turned miles of rural roads into an impromptu parking lot and danced in the rain, at times with the aid of drugs, to the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, The Who and Sly and the Family Stone.
For one thing, Mr. Lang said, a private security force of at least 800 would insure that drugs and alcohol would be prohibited. Ticket holders -- who would pay about $100 each for the weekend -- would be shuttled to the site on 800 buses that would originate from at least 14 parking lots around the Hudson Valley. Mr. Lang, who intends the target audience to be between 18 and 27 years old, said he expected most of the attendees would spend the night camping out on the farm.
 
$20 Million Venture
 Mr. Lang declined to comment on which musical acts, if any, he had signed to perform. But he said the venture, which is expected to cost $20 million, was being financially backed by Polygram N.V., a $4 billion entertainment company whose recording artists include U2, Sting and Bon Jovi. There was no immediate indication, however, that any of those performers would appear at Woodstock '94. A Polygram spokeswoman, Patricia Kiel, said the company would not comment on whether it had an agreement with Mr. Lang until after the company's annual results were announced on Feb. 28.
While saying that the concert, if successful, could be very good for the town -- indeed, Saugerties stands to collect $4 per ticket, a potential windfall of $1 million -- Mr. Griffis, the Town Supervisor, said officials were cautiously examining every aspect of Mr. Lang's proposal.
"It's my responsibility," Mr. Griffis said, "to make sure whatever does happen is properly planned and properly carried out and that the people and their property are properly protected."
The concert in Bethel is being promoted by Sid Bernstein, who is credited with first bringing the Beatles to the United States in 1964. Although the Bethel town board, by a 3-to-2 margin, gave preliminary approval to Mr. Bernstein's proposal over the plans of a rival, he has been dogged by allegations that his financial backing for the concert, to cost an estimated $10 million, is shaky.
 
Who's Backing Bernstein?
 At issue is a report prepared by a fraud investigator, at the behest of several residents who live near the Bethel site, contending that one of the backers Mr. Bernstein presented to the town, a Pennsylvania real-estate company, could not be located, while another, a North Carolina cellular-telephone company, denied any involvement in the venture.
Mr. Bernstein said that the corporate names in question had been provided to the town by his partners, not by him, and that he was working to secure major backing from "a world-famous soft-drink company," which he would not name, and from Stephen Friedman, one of the co-producers of the Broadway musical "Annie." Mr. Friedman, a longtime friend of Mr. Bernstein, said such discussions were "very premature."
Thomas J. Bowes, a senior vice president at Prudential Securities in Manhattan whose Bethel home is one-eighth of a mile from the proposed concert site, said that questions about Mr. Bernstein's financial condition have made him wonder how safe his family would be if the event draws the 80,000 people that the promoter hopes for.
"How secure can I feel as a homeowner that the security will be proper and that the whole event will be controlled, rather than just in total disarray?" Mr. Bowes said.
Mr. Bernstein -- who said he had signed the folk singer Richie Havens, an original Woodstock performer, to play at the Bethel concert -- said the townspeople will "have to buy my word" that he can pull it off. At the town's request, Mr. Bernstein's plans are being critiqued by a retired state police major who was involved in planning the 1980 Olympics at Lake Placid.
Allan C. Scott, the Bethel Town Supervisor, who was one of the two council members who voted against Mr. Bernstein's proposal at the meeting last month, said last week that he needed to learn much more about Mr. Bernstein's plans and how they would affect the town of 4,100.
 
'Shock to the System'
 "It's very hard," Mr. Scott said, "to deal with the shock to the system that would come with bringing 80,000 people into a rural community that is not used to having 80,000 people come in for the weekend."
Like other residents in Saugerties and Bethel, Severin Koninkiewicz, an 80-year-old former soldier in the Polish and American armies in World War II, believes it is not too early to ready a battle plan for the concert that would take place across the road from his tiny wood-and-brick house here.
With no intention of venturing outside if a concert takes place, he and his wife, Stephanie, plan to stock up on provisions like veal, frozen vegetables and cranberry juice. And to drown out the loud music, they are planning to have a Woodstock of their own -- a "classical" Woodstock, courtesy of their compact disk player -- that will feature the works of Chopin, Mozart and Beethoven.
"The situation will be no worse than a war, or a storm or the earthquake in California," Mr. Koninkiewicz said.

HEADLINE: Some Gifts to the Neediest Inspired by Donors' Grief

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A woman from California gave to help very young children in memory of her little boy, who died shortly after birth. A man from Brooklyn gave to help teen-agers who have lost parents after one of his co-workers died and left behind a 16-year-old son.
They are among the hundreds of people who have contributed to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in order to do something very much in keeping with the spirit of the fund itself: to "turn sorrow and pain into positive action," in the words of one contributor. 
 The 82d annual campaign, which ends tomorrow, has received more than 12,000 donations from New York and around the country and from places as far-flung as Tokyo and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The gifts were sent for almost as many reasons as there were gifts: to commemorate births and weddings and anniversaries, to remember the dead, to celebrate birthdays and to express gratitude for good luck or business success.
 
In Memory of a Child
 But some, like Christine A. Chorney, a lawyer in San Francisco, contributed to help ease others' pain in the midst of their own, simply because they found that doing so is the best catharsis.
"The enclosed contribution is made in memory of my dearest son, Stephen, who would have been almost a year old if he had lived," wrote Ms. Chorney in a letter accompanying her $75 donation. "Although I am sad that I will not be able to provide for him, I would be happy to know that my contribution was used to help a child, preferably a small one like Stephen would have been. Please use it to buy toys, clothing, medical care or anything else needed or wanted by a child."
Her contribution, like all the others that have been sent since the campaign began on Thanksgiving Day, goes directly to support seven social-service agencies in their efforts to help thousands of New Yorkers who are homeless, disabled, unemployed or mentally ill. Because The Times pays the campaign's administrative costs, every dollar is used for direct services for the most needy.
Keith Charles Edwards of Brooklyn, a photographer who gives to several charities through a payroll deduction at his business, gave $5 to the Neediest Cases Fund this month to transform his own grief over a death in his office.
 
Sending a Boy to Camp
 "My now-deceased co-worker is survived by a 16-year-old son who has benefited from The New York Times Neediest and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies," Mr. Edwards wrote. "I was moved to learn of this boy's progress in life since he won a scholarship to camp two years in a row thanks to the generosity of good citizens."
The Federation, one of the social-service agencies supported by the fund, provides grants each year for children to attend day and summer camps. In 1992 it also started the Black and Latino Males Initiative, which sends 60 inner-city youths to summer camp in High Falls, N.Y.
Mr. Edwards said he planned to make his contribution to the Federation a tradition. "I can afford to give more and as time progresses, so will my increase," he wrote. "I wish you all Godspeed."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Is Casting; New York Stays Home

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Seeking Hollywood's glamour and its dollars, representatives of governments around the country are gathering this weekend at a trade show in Los Angeles trying to persuade movie producers to film in their cities and states. But there is a notable absence at the Location Expo.
New York City, with a vacancy at the top of its Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, is not represented. 
 With the once-vibrant television and movie production business in New York just rebounding from the severe drought of the early 1990's, the absence of a new film commissioner has come to symbolize a crossroads for the industry in New York City and to heighten the anxiety of those who make their living in it.
"I think people are nervous because we're at a critical juncture here because we have New York back on the big screen," said Nick Wollner, a New York film producer who is the East Coast president of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers. "New York is back being an acceptable icon on the big screen, but we need to keep up that momentum."
 
A Test on 2 Fronts
 Mr. Wollner and other industry representatives say the film office needs an experienced production professional to maintain the momentum and that the administration's choice for the office will test Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's statements that he views the industry as fertile ground for economic development.
Randy Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff, said on Friday that dozens of people had been interviewed for the commissioner's job since a selection committee was appointed nearly three months ago. Interviews are continuing, he said, but it will be at least two more weeks before names of finalists are forwarded to Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Mastro added that the time elapsed was no indication that the administration's interest in the film industry was flagging.
"We consider the film office to be extremely important, the film industry to be extremely important," Mr. Mastro said. "It is a major source of revenue for the city."
 
Sending the Right Message
 Mr. Giuliani made a strong statement supporting the industry last week when he took issue with the Transit Authority for restricting film makers from shooting violent scenes in the subway system.
"This message should be conveyed in the right way: we want people to come to New York and make movies," Mr. Giuliani said. He said he saw film making as a source of jobs and tax revenue for the city as well as a way to promote its image worldwide.
The film commissioner's job is to attract productions to the city and then to act as a guide, clearing the underbrush of red tape and politics that can make filming in New York City an expensive and unpleasant experience. The office has about a dozen employees.
The job has been vacant since Richard Brick left last month. Mr. Brick was hired by the Dinkins administration in November 1992 after the film office had been leaderless for much of that year. He is an independent producer and the former chairman of the graduate film department at Columbia University.
 
A Potential Money-Maker
 A study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December indicates that the success of the film office can be lucrative for the city.
The study found that television and movie production in the New York City region brought $3 billion into the economy in direct and indirect spending in 1992 and that 91 percent of the economic activity occurred in the city itself. The productions spent $1.3 billion directly in the city in 1992, the study saids.
This level of activity places New York's production business directly behind California's -- although a distant second -- in terms of employees and payroll.
But New York's position is precarious. With financially pressed cities and states around the nation viewing film production as a lucrative, clean industry, the number of local film commissions grew in the 1980's from 60 to 235, according to the Association of Film Commissioners International.
 
Recovering From a Boycott
 The industry is also struggling to recover from a boycott by major studios in 1990 and 1991 because of contract disputes between the studios and craft unions. The dispute was settled in May 1991.
In December the city's Economic Policy and Marketing Group reported seeing the first signs of recovery. The city's film office issued 113 permits for the filming of feature films in the first 10 months of 1993, an increase of 30 percent from the same period in 1992. And the average cost of major studio features filmed in 1993 was $25 million, or 10 times as much as the budgets for the independent films that were the staple of the city's industry during the boycott.
Jeffrey Hayes, the producer of the television series "Law and Order," said the unions had become more accommodating after the boycott. He also said Mr. Brick's 14-month tenure with the city had made the city friendlier to producers.
"There's never been a more favorable climate for films coming into the city," Mr. Hayes said. "What people are worried about is, they need someone strong in the film office to get the message out."
 
The Right Set of Skills
 Mr. Mastro said there were no finalists for the job so far. He also said there were no plans to downgrade the position from commissioner to office director, as some industry representatives said they feared. The job was raised to commissioner level when Mr. Brick was appointed.
Phil Dixon, the New York producer of four daytime television shows and a member of the committee of New York Production Partnership, the production industry group, said the new commissioner must have both the political skills to sell New York as a filming location and the industry experience to work quickly and effectively to solve the problems of Hollywood producers. He said that combination is particularly important, given the competition from other cities.
"There are many cities around the country that can offer lower costs, just because of their economic structures," Mr. Dixon said. And although film makers are still interested in depicting New York in their movies, technology allows them to go to other cities and, in his words, "fake it" without audiences' knowing.

HEADLINE: Dr. Roy Reierson, 87, A Retired Economist

 BODY:
Dr. Roy L. Reierson, a former executive of and chief economist for Bankers Trust Company in New York City, died on Thursday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Dr. Reierson, who was 87, lived in Granite Springs, N.Y.
The cause was complications following a fall, said his daughter, Kaari. 
 After a 37-year career with the bank, Dr. Reierson retired in 1971 as a senior vice president who was widely respected on Wall Street for his conservative views on national economic policy. He was regarded as an expert on interest rates, the Federal budget and taxes and often testified before Congressional and banking groups.
At various times Dr. Reierson served as a consultant to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and undertook special assignments for the Departments of Treasury and Commerce, and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
Dr. Reierson graduated from St. Olaf College, and received master's and doctoral degrees from Northwestern University, where he later taught. Later he was a member of the faculty of the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration.
He is survived by his wife, Maria Reierson; two sons, Lars, of London and Kristofer, of Boston, and his daughter, Kaari Reierson of Washington.

HEADLINE: WINTER OLYMPICS;
In Politics And on Ice, Neighbors Are Apart

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GJOVIK, Norway, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The secession was peaceful, voted on and done. The players are friends, former teammates, in many cases, on professional teams back home. But no self-respecting breakaway republic wants to be trounced by the country it used to be part of, Olympic medal or no Olympic medal.
Robert Petrovicky of Slovakia heard of the talk back home in Bratislava. "After we lost to the Russians, they said, 'O.K., forget about a medal; just beat the Czechs.' " 
 Playing in its first Olympic tournament, Slovakia survived its preliminary-round pool, but lost to the Russians in the hockey quarterfinals, then dropped a 7-1 decision for fifth place to the Czech Republic tonight at the Gjovik Olympic Cavern Hall that didn't hurt more, but might sting a little back home.
 
Not Big Deal for Czechs
 To the Czechs, from whom the Slovaks broke away last year, this was no big deal, nothing to brag about. Before the Slovaks split from their former union with Bohemia and Moravia that was Czechoslovakia, the Czechs dominated the national team, averaging 15 of the 20 players chosen. Nine of the 12 teams in the country's professional league, now split like the republics, were from the Czech side. They expected to end up with the better team, having the deeper talent pool.
"A normal game, like we were playing the U.S.," said the Czechs' Otakar Janecky. "I think it was more important to them."
"Yes," Petrovicky said. "It was a historic game."
Since the nation split, the more urban Czech Republic to the north, closer to Germany, has prospered, as it continues to build on the foundation of capitalism begun when Communist rule crumbled five years ago. It hasn't even bothered to change its red, white and blue flag, the white third traditionally representing Slovakia.
The more agrarian south, meanwhile, is struggling economically with independence, to the point where Petrovicky wonders what the point was in the first place.
 
A Vote Against the Split
 He was playing in the United States with the Hartford Whalers when the vote was taken, and called his father to ask what he thought. "I remember him saying, 'We came through Communism together, and we should rebuild together,' " he said. "He voted against the split."
Petrovicky is playing this season for Hartford's minor league team in Springfield, Mass., but returned home before the Olympics to train with the national team. He was astounded by inflation. Milk that once cost two Czech crowns a few years ago was going for 15 or more.
"It's 400, 500 percent," he said. "But the people I talk to from the north, the Czechs, they say the prices there are actually going down. I don't usually care about politics, but this I don't understand."
A victory tonight might have soothed those growing pains for a day, at least. But after Slovakia's Miroslav Satan put a goal on the board at 2 minutes 21 seconds of the first period, the Czechs routed Slovakia's goalie, Eduard Hartmann, for four goals in less than 10 minutes. Before they knew what hit them, the Slovaks were done.
"The Czechs are better," Petrovicky said. "But I think if it was a game for more than fifth place, we would have played better."
 
Alarming the Officials
 Compared to the other teams in this watered-down tournament, the Slovaks have been more like a National Hockey League team in style, if not substance. Led by Peter Stastny, a veteran of many N.H.L. wars with the Quebec Nordiques, the gloves were coming off at a rate that began to alarm Olympic officials. They didn't resort to that tonight at this marvelous facility, literally a building carved into the side of a mountain, a hockey cave.
Petrovicky said playing for fifth place wasn't much to get worked up over. The Czechs' Bedrich Scerban agreed that it was more difficult working up the passion to belt someone you've grown up with in the Czechoslovak junior program.
"I play now in Finland for a professional team, and so when we play against the Finns, it's like playing against my friends," he said. "With the Slovaks, I know many of them, more than half. They're my friends.
"If we had to play for a medal, we play hard. But for fifth place, against your friends, you try to score goals. How hard do you play?"

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
This Brake Stuff Just Won't Stop

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon 

 BODY:
AS we know, February's slop has produced turmoil in the eastern part of the country. It also resulted in a blizzard of questions on antilock brake systems, and the queries resulted in a column on the pros and cons of ABS. And that resulted in more questions and comments and . . . oh, just mush onward.
 
Dear Sir,
May I offer one additional thought on antilock brakes? 
 Before I had ABS, my pumping of the brakes caused my brake lights to flash on and off, alerting the driver behind me to the fact that I was braking on a slippery surface. I could see them back off and reduce the possibility of rear-ending me.
Now that I have ABS, the driver behind me doesn't get the warning of flashing lights. So, I deliberately pump my brakes before I "stand on the pedal" to give him that warning and get him off my tail.
May I suggest that the auto manufacturers change the action of the brake lights so they flash on and off whenever the ABS mechanism engages. That should achieve the same result.
 
STANLEY L. POLLOCK
Chicago
Good idea. Consider it passed on. Incidentally, I remember seeing ads years ago for a gizmo that pulsed the brake lights every time you stepped on the pedal. A similar gadget is available for motorcycles, and it might be adaptable for cars. Check with your friendly neighborhood biker gang (or visit a motorcycle shop.)
 
Plumbing the Paradox
 
Dear Sir,
You said recently that you were "boggled" by a study by the Highway Institute for Traffic Safety in which ABS saved almost nothing in terms of insurance claims. Rather than being boggling, such an outcome is fully consistent with the economic/ psychological concept of "offsetting behavior."
Offsetting behavior occurs frequently, and a good example is when pedestrians walk more carefully on icy sidewalks because the probability of falling is much greater than under dry conditions.
Drivers, too, realize that cars with ABS are safer and, in economic parlance, that the cost of undertaking risky activities is now lower. Consequently, it is reasonable (some would say rational) for drivers to take more risk, either by driving more aggressively or deciding to drive at all in inclement weather. Offsetting behavior explains the paradox of safer ABS-equipped cars but no drop in accident claims.
A paper published recently in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management by Edward Harper and myself finds that offsetting behavior is a quantitatively important factor in understanding motor vehicle fatalities in the United States. Drivers will not remain passive with the new technology, and the number of skids and other potential accident situations will increase because drivers feel more comfortable in the ABS-equipped cars.
On the other hand, offsetting behavior can have a salutary interaction with regulations. For example, Government standards will lead to lighter cars and, by some accounts, to an increase in fatalities. But the hypothesis suggests that driver behavior will be altered because downsized autos will be driven less aggressively, thus attenuating adverse effects.
Failure to recognize the subtle effects of offsetting behavior may well lead to inaccurate business and policy decisions.
 
ROBERT S. CHIRINKO
Champaign, Ill.
You may be right. In which case, I consider myself unboggled.
 
The Quick-Stop Factor
 
Dear Sir,
As a regular reader, I feel I must write to point out an error which you have made for two consecutive weeks.
One of the most frequent misapprehensions about ABS is that it shortens braking distance, and that is not true. The system functions to prevent wheel lockup, and hence to help the driver keep control in slippery conditions.
There is nothing inherent in an ABS system that shortens braking distances, and that is carefully explained by the manufacturers. I don't mean to be an alarmist, but this misinformation is as potentially harmful as the assumption held by some drivers that it's O.K. not to wear a seat belt if the car has an air bag.
 
CHRIS BEYER
Upper Montclair, N.J.
You are right that by eliminating lockup, ABS allows a driver to steer through a panic stop, and that is an important benefit. But antilock brakes do indeed offer an improvement in stopping distances -- particularly on slippery surfaces -- by radically slowing the wheels while preventing the tires from skidding. I've seen it in action, and the difference is dramatic. It is worth noting, though, that antilocks do not make a driver invincible; they are no substitute for common sense.
 
Honoring the Inventors
 
Dear Sir,
Your column on antilock brakes coincides with the presentation of the 1994 Elmer A. Sperry Award to Hans Jurgen Gerstenmeier, Wolf-Dieter Jonner and Heinz Leiber, who developed the technology for Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany. The award will be presented March 1 at the Society of Automotive Engineers International Congress and Exposition at Cobo Center in Detroit.
Starting with an initial idea advanced in 1936, they worked for more than two decades to design and develop the antilock braking concept for application to motor vehicles.
The Sperry Award is given annually to recognize outstanding contributions to transportation. It was started in 1955 to honor Elmer A. Sperry, an inventor of locomotives, streetcars, an electric automobile and many other transportation systems.
 
STANLEY A. MAST
New York
Time they got a break.
 
The Quick-Stop Factor, Part II
 
Dear Sir,
Your article on antilock braking systems missed one critical point: that on packed snow and particularly on ice, the most important device for decelerating an automobile under control is not the brake pedal but the transmission shift lever.
In the storms of the last fortnight, both my wife in her rear-wheel-drive Crown Victoria and I in my front-wheel-drive Dodge Spirit were able to avoid skids completely by downshifting so that brakes were not needed until speeds had dropped below 5 miles an hour.
The technique of downshifting as a means to maintain control under the worst driving conditions apparently is not taught today, or is considered to be a form of transmission abuse, but it works.
 
PETER WHITTIER
Rockaway, N.J.
 
Downshifting, done properly, can be a useful tool in controlling a car's behavior. But it also can be dangerous, particularly when the road is slick. Shifting to a lower gear slows the driving wheels, suddenly putting them out of sync with the vehicle's speed, and a skid can be the result.
 
Freewheeling Discourse
 
Dear Sir,
I read your useful column with great interest and have an additional suggestion to make. If you are trying to go very slowly downhill in snowy or icy conditions and have a car with an automatic transmission, put the gear in neutral. It is magical the way you keep control because otherwise the transmission's "creep" interferes with braking.
 
SUSAN F.C. WEIL
Mount Kisco, N.Y.
Something must be magically out of whack if "creep" interferes with your braking. The engine itself has a good deal of slowing power in the lower gears. And, in any case, it is not a good idea to relinquish any portion of control by disconnecting the engine from the wheels.

To the Editor:
Since their adoption less than two years ago, Reebok's Human Rights Production Standards have forced changes in employment and environmental practices by Reebok's contractors throughout Asia. 
 Where can other responsible corporations look for guidelines "to steer a middle course between moral relativism and moral absolutism?" ("Global Business Must Mind its Morals," Viewpoints, Feb. 13). Increasingly, corporate leaders are turning to the internationally recognized standards articulated by the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the legal instruments that are its progeny. These standards establish basic rights for individuals in all societies and avoid charges of moral imperialism by any one country. They offer practical -- though not binding -- investment, employment and marketing guidance to multinational corporations operating in unfamiliar settings.

HEADLINE: Helping the Neediest

 BODY:
Tomorrow marks the end of the 82d appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Despite hard times, our readers have been generous. More than 12,000 donors gave about $4.5 million.
The money will go to seven private agencies that are dedicated to helping the city's most vulnerable citizens. In this particularly bitter winter, that help has made a crucial difference to many lives. For some it has meant a warm place to sleep, for others a meal. For many children, it has made the difference between an intact family and one splintered by the stresses of economic hardship. 
 The agencies' work does not end with the campaign; they continue to provide services to needy New Yorkers throughout the year. The needs will continue too. In a city strapped for cash as never before, private agencies like those supported by the Neediest Cases Fund will take on more of the burden of meeting basic needs for people who have fallen on desperate times through no fault of their own.

HEADLINE: Hate Fliers Inflame Mayoral Race in New Orleans

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Even by the standards of a city where politics has long been a brawler's sport, a pair of anonymous anti-black, anti-Semitic fliers that have circulated in the build-up to the March 5 runoff election for mayor have been particularly nasty.
The election pits State Senator Marc Morial, 36, the son of the late Ernest (Dutch) Morial, New Orleans's first black Mayor, against Donald Mintz, a 50-year-old Jewish lawyer with a long history of civic leadership and strong ties to the city's blacks. 
 Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the fliers incident is the Morial campaign's charge that Mr. Mintz, the front-runner by a narrow margin in recent polls, had campaign workers create and distribute some of the more scurrilous fliers themselves to paint Mr. Mintz as a candidate under siege.
In an interview, Mr. Mintz denied that he or anyone in his campaign had created the fliers. But he conceded that his campaign had mailed copies to thousands of Jews throughout the nation along with a fund-raising letter that characterized the fliers' racist sentiments as an attack on "the stature and security of our community."
 
Help in Raising Money
 The mailing generated more than $200,000 in contributions for Mr. Mintz from outside the city, city investigators said. As of early February, campaign records showed that his campaign had raised about $650,000 in all.
Dr. Lawrence Rubin, executive vice chairman of the National Jewish Relations Advisory Council, a group based in New York, said his group had examined the fliers and, based on their language and content, had concluded that they were probably not the work of hate groups.
"People who received the fund-raising letter called us," Dr. Rubin said, "and we shared with them our reservations and concern, but let them make their own judgment as to how to deal with it."
But for the Morial campaign the conclusion was clear. "Mr. Mintz self-inflicted a racial wound where there was none," said Bob Tucker, the campaign chairman for Mr. Morial, "and he did it to raise funds nationally."
The flier that has attracted the most condemnation is titled "Let's Make Mintz Meat & Molasses." It bears pictures of Mr. Mintz and a man who resembles the South African leader Nelson Mandela and demands, "Stop the Colored/Jew Coalition" and "Say Never to Jungle Apes & Christ Killers."
 
'Unusually Nasty'
 Even in this politically jaded city, many find insinuations that the Mintz campaign produced such fliers too cynical to believe. "It's unusually nasty," said Mary Zervigon, a member of the city's Human Relations Commission. "It has been going on for months, rather than just a few weeks, and there is this idea of the reverse spin of a candidate attacking himself in these fliers in order to gain some advantage."
Already, a main Mintz adviser has been charged with a misdemeanor count accusing him of violating state campaign laws by distributing some of the anonymous fliers this month. And Mr. Mintz suffered another setback on Friday when an investigation by the commission issued a preliminary report saying that at least two of the fliers "originated in the Mintz campaign" and that a campaign aide was responsible for distributing one flier and trying to distribute the other in the New Orleans area.
Still, many in this city of 497,000 insist that no one cares about the fliers. Most people have never seen or read them, said Ed Renwick, director of the Loyola Institute of Politics. He and others said Mr. Mintz was unlikely to lose his nearly solid support among whites, who make up 39 percent of the voters, over charges initiated by the District Attorney, who supports Mr. Morial. But the analysts said Mr. Mintz could lose support among blacks, who are 61 percent of the voters.
 
Fear of Crime
 Silas Lee, a political scientist at Xavier University and a pollster, said voters of both races were desperate about crime and the economy. As a result, he said, older black voters and middle-class black voters, usually loyal to black candidates, were willing to vote for a white candidate perceived as strong and able to make a difference.
Mr. Mintz is widely viewed as a man with ideas and the determination to put them into action. Mr. Morial, despite his relative youth and perceived inexperience, has basked somewhat in the aura of his father's reputation for assertiveness and savvy and is seen as someone familiar with the tribulations of the city's first black Mayor.
Either way, said John Maginnis, editor of the Louisiana Political Review, both candidates are seen as an antidote to years of "laid-back" government under the outgoing Mayor, Sidney Barthelemy, who cannot by law seek a third term and who has remained neutral.
Samuel Dubois Cook, the president of Dillard University here and a political scientist, said both candidates were perceived as agents of change who shared prescriptions for curbing crime and diversifying the city's economy.
As he sat down for lunch recently in the French Quarter, Mr. Mintz talked wistfully of his once-proud city, a place now besieged by crime, 37,000 abandoned private housing units and a decline in jobs and educational opportunities. He envisioned bringing manufacturing jobs to the city and bolstering medical research and training institutions at 10 universities.
 
Gambling on a Casino
 Mr. Mintz also emphasized the importance of not putting too much of the city's future economic hopes on a recently approved casino. He accused past administrations of depending too heavily on the oil and gas money that once flowed into the city.
Mr. Morial sounded remarkably the same as he addressed a rally on Friday night at the Lakewood Country Club in Algiers on the west bank of the Mississippi River. But he also evoked a time when a Morial was in City Hall and things were better. In the racially mixed audience, C. W. Chachere, a white advertising executive, said he had been undecided until a few days ago, when disgust over the fliers had driven him into the Morial camp. He said he did not care whether Mr. Mintz's campaign had actually created them, but he was angry that it had used them to raise money.
"Those fliers scare me," Mr. Chachere said, "and I have come to the conclusion that it's Morial and not Mintz who can use all of the people resources we have in the city."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HUNTS POINT;
Battered but Unbowed, Bronx Seeks Government Aid

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE--PIERRE 

 BODY:
In terms of economic aid for the Bronx, Borough President Fernando Ferrer has no bird in the hand. But he is keeping several irons in the fire.
The Bronx has suffered a number of blows over the last year, ranging from the cancellation of a street and sewer reconstruction project for Hunts Point to the Giuliani administration's decision to drop a new Bronx-based police academy to George Steinbrenner's threats to desert Yankee Stadium. 
 Mr. Ferrer is fighting back, seeking two special government programs. First, he said on Friday that the indications were good that he was winning a running battle to have a stretch of the borough included in the city's application for a Federal "economic empowerment zone."
"It was counterintuitive not to include the South Bronx," Mr. Ferrer said. "We believe the Dinkins administration made a mistake." Areas in the empowerment zone would receive funds for job training, drug treatment and other social services.
The city's application will be filed in June, with a decision likely this summer. But Mr. Ferrer is already moving in another direction, filing an application with the state to have Hunts Point designated an economic development zone.
Hunts Point is one of an estimated 40 cities, villages and neighborhoods in New York State expected to submit such applications by tomorrow, attempting to demonstrate that they are poor enough to be designated economic development zones.
Up to 15 will be named in early June, state officials said, and will share about $1.6 million a year.
Under the program, businesses that move into the distressed zones or expand existing operations there are offered state tax reductions and subsidies to help pay utility bills and construction loans.
"We're ripe for this designation," said John Robert, district manager of Community Board 2. "The Bronx is always getting dumped on."
There is plenty of room to grow in the area, borough officials say. Marie Diven, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ferrer, said there are 163 acres of vacant lots in Hunts Point, of which 70 percent are city-owned.
There have been 19 such zones designated in the state since the program was established in 1986 by the Legislature to help struggling municipalities. New York City has four, including Port Morris, the Bronx; East New York, Brooklyn; South Jamaica, Queens, and East Harlem. GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
12 Women Call For Equality In Business

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Like many struggling business owners, Sandra Sam has put everything into her restaurant, the Gadabout, on Fifth Avenue at 125th Street. In September, she even sold her home to keep up with her bills.
"That was the only home my children knew, and believe me, they're not happy about this," she said. "Right now I'm at the point that if my business closed, I'd have to go on welfare." 
 It is not the hard work, the risk or the challenge of competition that fuels her fears of the worst. She has seen some men prosper while she suffers, she says, and she feels that, in the midst of a small burst of economic growth in the area, the people in control of Harlem's resources are turning a deaf ear to her and other women.
Ms. Sam is one of 12 women -- all black entrepreneurs in Harlem -- who have joined a decade-long wave that has washed through the country, bringing women together to press community and business leaders to give them access to money and information they say they have been denied.
"I'm not asking for a handout," Ms. Sam said last week. "I have boots and I can pull them up. I just want them not to take my feet or hands away, so I can't do what I need to."
Christine Merser, the founder and executive director of Women Resource Center of New York, said the national burst of women's groups, and an accompanying growth of government programs directed at helping women in business, were responses to the historic problems women face.
Among these obstacles, she said, is that women tend to work in ways that do not establish credit histories, the determining factor in qualifying for a loan. Often, they work for someone else or within a marriage. And Ms. Merser said that of the more than 200 business organizations in her database for New York City, none is in Harlem.
The 12 Harlem women have no name for their group, which began last fall, after Dorothy Pitman Hughes, who runs an office supplies store, began organizing other black women in business. After comparing notes, they began a campaign of letters and phone calls to Representative Charles B. Rangel, who agreed to a meeting. They told him that they felt sidelined by Harlem's power structure, pointing out that none of them were invited to a recent meeting of community leaders with Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown.
In response, he set up a meeting for them this month with Donald Coggsville, the head of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation. Mr. Coggsville said he would seek their advice in drawing up a proposal for Federal aid under the "empowerment zone" program. Mr. Rangel also told the group that he would set up a meeting with the leaders of several banks that are active in the area.
The women were heartened by Mr. Rangel's attention, Ms. Hughes said, and they say they are hopeful. But the bankers meeting has yet to take place, or even be scheduled.
"If we had a support system, if we could go to banks and get a loan, the whole face of Harlem could change," said Ms. Hughes.
Ms. Hughes said she needs money so she can receive lines of credit from manufacturers. Ms. Sam needs to pay back her loans. Beulah Tuten plans to expand her sign-making business and buy a van so she can deliver her wares.
"We need to build a liaison with the people who manage Harlem," Ms. Hughes said. "If dollars are going to come to Harlem, we want to be part of that. And if we are not part of it, I am definitely going to go to Washington and ask the President to lift the economic embargo against African-American women in Harlem." EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

HEADLINE: Beyond Denial: An 'Eldercare' Primer;
Health-Care Rules Are a Dizzying Maze. It's Terribly Painful to Confront a Parent's Mortality. But Why Wait for a Crisis?

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
CAROL MAURO'S father lived happily and healthily on his own in a Manhattan walk-up apartment until last Father's Day, when, at the age of 82, he fell and broke his hip. That injury, complicated by a heart attack, transformed his life, and the lives of his three daughters as well.
Caught unprepared, Mrs. Mauro says, she and her sisters flailed about in their search for information, "all sort of tripping over each other in trying to be helpful." The months since have been a crash course in the elements of what has come to be called "eldercare" -- the runic regulations of Medicaid and Medicare, the relative benefits of home health care versus life in a nursing home. 
 "We got lulled into forgetting how old he really was," said Mrs. Mauro, who directs training programs for a large insurance company. "You live with a whole lot of denial about what's going to happen to your parents."
Now, her father, John Vitale, a retired postal worker who has lived alone since his wife died in 1981, has health aides helping him around the clock, and Mrs. Mauro and her sisters are paying his not inconsiderable bills.
Their story, experts say, is all too typical. It is the rare adult who begins to grapple ahead of time with the financial, medical and emotional implications of caring for elderly parents. Most of the time, such topics are addressed only in mid-crisis, with decisions made hurriedly and then frequently regretted in hindsight.
All of this, of course, is as simple, and as maddeningly complex, as the relationships and inevitable conflicts between parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife.
Some parents may feel that to involve their children in highly personal decisions would be to surrender irrevocably to old age. Disagreements frequently erupt over whether parents' money should be used for their care or kept to pass on to their children. And often the need to plan for elderly parents gets pushed aside by the demands of a child's own children or career.
But the biggest hurdle for many is simply facing the fact that parents get old and frail and, ultimately, are gone.
"I just didn't want to think of this person, my mother, who I loved so much and who had always taken care of me, as a helpless person," said Linda Nochlin, a professor of modern art at New York University whose mother died at the age of 80 last month. "It's terribly hard. To say one can be rational about it is simply untrue. No one can really help you confront the notion of your mother's mortality, and then your own mortality, which goes along with it."
Still, while a parent may remain healthy and independent until 65 or 90, "the mortality rate is 100 percent, so it's foolish not to deal with these things," says Louise Fradkin, a founder of Children of Aging Parents, a national support group.
The often staggering financial burden of medical care for the elderly is one of the major factors driving the furious health care debate in Washington. And there is added urgency in the changing demographics of New York. While the total number of people over 65 in the city remained fairly constant between censuses in 1980 and 1990, the number of people 85 and older -- those most likely to need specialized care -- rose 32 percent.
"The average 40-year-old couple has more parents than children," said Barbara B. Lepis, director of the Partnership for Eldercare, an information center run out of the city's Department for the Aging.
The aging of the population and the growing complexity of the situation have given rise to an expanding industry of services for the elderly, and for the children who will care for them, from corporate help to a new species of social worker, the geriatric-care manager, who can navigate much of the eldercare maze for you.
The field is vast and complex. All the more reason to learn the basics now. What follows, then, is a primer in many of the major issues of caring for elderly relatives in a city of extensive and diverse but often poorly publicized services.
 
THE PAPERWORK
 The first step is the paperwork.
An essential, lawyers and advocates for the elderly say, is power of attorney, a document in which a parent designates someone who will be able to perform tasks like paying bills and writing checks. Someone who becomes incapacitated without having assigned power of attorney may end up having decisions made by a state-appointed guardian.
A lawyer usually draws up the document, which must be notarized. Forms are available from any stationery store specializing in legal forms, but experts urge great care; power of attorneyis a highly potent instrument that is easily abused.
Next is the health-care proxy, which allows the person designated to make decisions about medical treatment should a patient not be able to participate in such decisions.
Many lawyers also recommend that parents sign living wills, which state their feelings about the degree to which they should be sustained on life-support if they become terminally ill or recovery otherwise seems unlikely. Though New York, unlike many states, does not have a law regulating the use of living wills, "judges generally uphold them," said Ellen P. Rosenzweig, a director of the Institute of Law and Rights of Older Adults at Hunter College.
Lawyers draft these documents, but for those who want to do it themselves, forms for health-care proxies and living wills are available from an organization called Choice in Dying. A New York health-care proxy is essentially valid only within the state.
Parents should also be encouraged to make, and give their children, lists of their assets and of their monthly income from all sources -- pensions, Social Security, rental property, interest and dividends. The list should include safe-deposit box locations, the names and telephone numbers of lawyers and accountants, the location of a will and other important documents, and any information about funeral arrangements already made.
 
HEALTH-CARE OPTIONS
 The next subject -- one that is considerably more bewildering and emotionally fraught -- is health care. While many parents are in good general physical condition and able to manage their own care, and while most will never need a nursing home, many will need some kind of specialized care at some point.
Simply raising the subject can be painful. Carolyn E. Mayo, compensation manager for American International Group, where Mrs. Mauro also works, checked out home care last year for her parents, Dorothy and Walter Spence, who are 78 and 83 and living in their own house in North Bayshore, L.I., despite failing eyesight and other health problems.
"My mother said to me, 'You know your father doesn't like having strangers in the house,' " she recalled. So Mrs. Mayo continues to commute from her home on Staten Island when they need help.
Often the choice is between nursing homes and home health care, which has grown dramatically of late.
Carl D'Aquino, an interior designer, and his two brothers placed their parents, now 73 and 79, in nursing homes twice within the last six months and Mr. D'Aquino called the decision and the aftermath "probably the most difficult thing I've gone through in my entire life."
"As fine as the home is," he added, "every time I go and visit, it's completely draining. Leaving is so hard."
Many people resist nursing homes on a gut level. When Judith Brickman, a nursing-home specialist with the city's Department for the Aging, tells her clients to free-associate with "nursing home," she says, she frequently gets responses like "sick, institutional, depressing."
"They have an absolutely horrible reputation, but I don't think it's deserved," she said, though she allows that 20 years ago, many nursing homes were indeed bad. Still, the 1990 census found that 46,118 New Yorkers over 65, or 4.8 percent, were in the city's 160 nursing ing homes or in other residential facilities.
The Department for the Aging provides lists of nursing homes as well as advice on how to assess them. And there are safety nets to help protect residents of nursing homes. Federal law requires, and pays for, each home to have an ombudsman to take complaints. Another advocacy option is a group called Friends and Relatives of Institutionalized Aged.
Gaining admission to a nursing home usually requires two evaluations -- the patient review instrument and the patient screen instrument -- to evaluate the need for care.
The most popular alternative to nursing homes is home health care, in which aides with varying levels of nursing training assist elderly people in daily activities, from bathing to taking medicine to going to the grocery store. Many private agencies specialize in placing home health aides, for a fee. Nonprofit agencies like the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens will provide health aides under certain circumstances, using Medicaid or private funds. The city also provides them for needy residents through Medicaid.
Screening a health aide is essential, and people should ask about applicants' training, whether they hold a certificate as a home health aide or nurse's aide, whether they have experience and good references, whether they have had a recent physical examination themselves, and how they might respond in a specific medical emergency. Have the person try out for a few days, and monitor the situation closely.
"Employers should lay the rules down right at the start and make sure the aide understands," said Agnes Mak, who runs the home health aide program at the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens. "They should not make medical decisions. They should communicate with the family. The key is constant supervision."
An alternative that falls between home care and nursing homes is "enriched housing," in which frail elderly people live in apartment buildings where a hot meal is served once a day and other services, from transportation to personal grooming, are arranged. The cost varies, but at one large building in Manhattan it is just under $800 a month. A related alternative is "shared housing," in which roommates are found for elderly people who remain in their homes.
 
PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE
 Except for the wealthy and those who qualify for Medicaid, the Federal insurance program for the poor, paying for medical care poses the thorniest problems, and raises some of the most difficult questions, of all.
Generally speaking, for a healthy person over 65, visits to the doctor are covered by private insurance or by Medicare, the Government's insurance plan for the elderly. When a crisis requires hospitalization, Medicare and private insurance will also cover most of those costs.
But by and large, private insurers and Medicare do not pay for long-term nursing home or in-home care, although Medicare does cover up to 100 days of skilled care following a hospital stay of three days or more. For example, a heart-attack patient can have most of his or her hospital stay paid through Medicare, but someone who develops Alzheimer's disease and deteriorates to the point of needing daily care usually can not.
Another significant cost not covered by Medicare is prescription drugs. Most people pay for them out of pocket or with private insurance.
Both nursing-home care and home care can be tremendously expensive. The average New York City nursing home costs at least $5,000 a month, according to the Department for the Aging, and home health aides typically charge $10 and up an hour, which can quickly be just as costly.
"You find out ultimately that this is going to be more expensive than anybody but Rockefeller can handle," said Barry Herman, an economist whose mother, Fannie, has Alzheimer's disease and entered a nursing home last month.
For younger parents without serious health problems, insurers do offer policies that cover long-term care. Such policies are expensive, and don't always cover every contingency.
Which leaves a huge swath of peo-ple in the middle struggling to be covered for long-term care. Which leads in turn to a common, and often emotionally trying, financial maneuver known as "spending down," which allows someone who starts out relatively well off to be covered by becoming legally indigent. Here is how it works:
In New York, which is more generous than other states because of the high cost of living, the cutoff for Medicaid is $534 in monthly income, with $4,700 in assets.
Spending down can take two forms. The first is actually spending assets to pay for care. Mr. Herman's mother, for instance, is now paying for her nursing home, at a cost of about $7,500 a month. After about six months, he said, her money will be gone and Medicaid will take over.
The other route is what is known as the surplus income program. People who have income that exceeds the official limits for Medicaid can still qualify as long as their medical expenses absorb that surplus. They turn the excess income over to the nursing home or home health-care agency, with Mediciad picking up the difference, Ms. Rosenzweig said.
With a certain amount of planning, however, there are ways to keep money in the family.
Because of a 1988 change in Federal law, the spouse of a nursing-home patient covered by Medicaid is allowed to keep $72,660 in savings and have an income of up to $1,817 a month -- more if need can be proven in court. Homes and other possessions are not counted as assets, as long as the spouse or a disabled child is living in the house.
An elderly person without a spouse can also transfer money to other relatives, and the rules for such transfers can influence the choice between home care and nursing home care.
A patient can transfer unlimited assets to another family member, apply for Medicaid and be approved immediately for home care. The same person choosing to enter a nursing home, however, would have to wait out a penalty period based on the amount of money transferred. For example, a person transferring $100,000 in stock would have to wait roughly 18 months -- the value of the assets divided by $5,400, the average cost of a month in a nursing home.
Until last year, the penalty period was limited to 30 months, but now there is no limit, Ms. Rosenzweig said, adding that there is also a proposal in the State Assembly to apply the penalty period to in-home care.
Perhaps the most difficult thing about getting people to spend down or transfer assets, experts say, is that many find it frightening and humiliating, after a life of hard work
"No matter how much you trust and love your children," says Nora O'Brien, a counseling coordinator with the Partnership for Eldercare, "it's scary to take all your money and give it to someone else."
There are myriad tax considerations that affect the transfer of assets to qualify for Medicaid. Mrs. Brickman urges people to see elder-law specialists for help in planning.
Paying for long-term care is one of the issues dealt with in the various health plans now being debated in Washington.
President Clinton's plan would give states grants to pay for in-home care for people of all ages. The plan proposed by Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, would eliminate Medicaid altogether and recommend that states pay for long-term care, while the plan offered by Senator John Chaffee, a Rhode Island Republican, would provide tax incentives for people to buy long-term care insurance, which is also part of the President's plan.
 
HELPING THE HELPERS
 Like elder-law specialists, geriatric-care managers are a byproduct of the huge growth in the elderly population. Frequently they are hired by adult children to help convince their parents of the need for care or to fill in for the children when they are out of town or otherwise preoccupied.
Many of them started out as social workers and a few are therapists as well, but all are trained to step into complex family situations and begin to sort them out. They are self-regulated, with no licensing required, although most of them belong to the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers and are licensed in their original occupations.
Their fees are substantial -- $80 to $150 an hour, depending on the task at hand -- and are not covered by health insurance or Medicare.
Leonie Nowitz is one such care manager. She started her business, the Center for Lifelong Growth, in Manhattan, in 1979 and has 20 or so clients at a time. She might accompany one elderly person to the doctor, visit with another, help the children of another sign up for Medicaid or find a reliable home health aide. Sometimes the children, and their parents, live in New York; more often the children live in a faraway state. In that case, having a geriatric-care manager on call can eliminate the need to fly out on the next plane when a parent appears to be ill or having trouble.
"People get very nervous about a bureaucratic system, so they ask me to help them get on Medicaid and help them get into nursing homes when the need arises," Ms. Nowitz said. "It's helpful to have contacts at nursing homes. It can be an old-boy network."
For those who can't afford to hire a geriatric-care manager, public and nonprofit private agencies offer social workers who perform many of the same tasks, although usually with much larger caseloads.
Even considering the cost, clients seem to think geriatric-care managers can be invaluable. A 50-year-old New York City schoolteacher said he hired Ms. Nowitz to take his mother and his uncle to the doctor and find home health aides to care for them, but he also found Ms. Nowitz a reliable shoulder when he tired of hearing both his uncle, now almost 90, and his teen-age children complain that he didn't spend enough time with any of them.
"I talked to her once about my feelings, about having to deal first with my mother and now my uncle who needed care," said the man, who did not want his name used. "She seemed to understand that. I had tried therapy many years ago, and it really didn't work. I didn't think they understood me. This time, someone really seemed to have my emotions down pat."
He seems to have reached his own kind of peace with the problems of caring for elderly relatives. These days, he said, he keeps an old black-and-white photograph of himself as a toddler, dressed in a snowsuit and cradled in his uncle's arms, in a dresser drawer.
"He looks so proud," he said. "And now the situation is reversed. Every time I go for my socks in the morning I take a look at it. My uncle was always very good to me, and now I have an obligation to him."

MANHATTAN UPDATE

 BODY:

* PENNSYLVANIA STATION: The City Planning Commission has voted 5 to 4, with 2 abstentions, against renewing a Penn Station video arcade's three-year permit.
The arcade, Station Break, also known as Time Out Amusement Arcade, has been attracting mostly young people to its 100 video games for 16 years. Now the owners have 30 days to vacate the site, in the Long Island Rail Road concourse. 
 "We're obviously disappointed with the result, and it's too bad that 40 minority jobs may be lost," said Samuel H. Lindenbaum of the law firm Rosenman & Colin, who represent the arcade. He said the owners, Edison Brothers Mall Entertainment of St. Louis, were "exploring the options."
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has invested $200 million to renovate the station, led the fight to evict the arcade, which it said was a center for truancy and disorderly conduct.
* 42d STREET: After a public hearing on the proposed 42d Street trolley this month, the City Planning Commission has scheduled a vote for April 11. If approved, the plan would go to the City Council for full review and final vote within 50 days, and then to the Mayor.
The cost of the Light Rail Project, as the plan is formally known, is estimated at $75 million. The trolley, privately owned and operated, would traverse midtown Manhattan at 42d Street. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger has given conditional support to the plan, but community boards in the area oppose it because of the cost and the disruption that would be caused by laying tracks.
 * HARLEM: Spring is around the corner, but the gardens many Harlem residents hoped to see sprouting in some vacant lots may not be.
Under the Dinkins administration, $1.25 million was included in this year's budget to turn a handful of vacant city-owned lots in Harlem and other low-income neighborhoods into gardens. But each site had to go through a lengthy land-use review process, so the funds were never made available. And now, because of the cuts the Giuliani administration listed in its recent budget proposal, the money is no longer available.
Frederic B. Winters, a spokesman for the Department of General Services, said last week that "there is no money in our budget for this project."
Linda Davidoff, the executive director of the Parks Council, which had lobbied for the gardens, said that her group was lobbying for the money to be restored.
"We're hoping that money really won't be extinguished from the budget," she said. "We're caught between two administrations."

HEADLINE: Japan's Bureaucracy: No Sign It's Losing Any Power

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
In the two weeks since Japan and the United States collided over trade policy and began threatening each other with sanctions and counter-sanctions, President Clinton has repeatedly identified the real source of the problem: Japan's entrenched, turf-conscious bureaucrats.
"There's a big fight going on in Japan now," he said the other day, describing a classic struggle between the mandarins who have run Japan's industrial and trade policies for four decades and the reformers, led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who are fighting to open an economy now choking on overregulation. 
 But Mr. Clinton's description bears little resemblance to the reality of what is happening amid the cramped, battle-gray desks of Tokyo's powerful ministries, where the world's second biggest economy is ruled from some of world's grungiest offices.
Mr. Hosokawa rose to prominence as a bureaucrat-basher, complaining that mayors and governors needed to call Tokyo for approval to move a bus stop. Nonetheless, for two weeks he has said nothing publicly to suggest that his own views differ one iota from the bureaucracy's, especially when it comes to dealing with the angry Americans.
 
U.S. Attack Prompts Defense
 Indeed, if a fierce battle is now under way between Japan's new political leadership and its "permanent government," to use Mr. Clinton's phrase, almost no one here has noticed -- not the beleaguered business sector, not the bureaucrats themselves, not the American Embassy.
Mr. Clinton's attacks have even prompted leaders of the "reform" parties, which in the past have denounced the overconcentration of power in the hands of Japan's unelected elite, to rally to the bureaucrats' defense.
"It doesn't make any sense to condemn the bureaucrats," Ichiro Ozawa, the country's most powerful behind-the-scenes politician, said a few days ago. "If you look at the current situation, the problem is that the U.S. position is not very logical." He then launched into a familiar soliloquy about how the Clinton Administration is trying to manage its trade with Japan.
Noboru Hatakeyama, the former Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry, who until a few months ago represented all the forces Mr. Clinton was talking about, said: "Maybe Clinton thought this was Russia or South America. There is no struggle here. It is patronizing: 'Poor Mr. Hosokawa, being beaten up by the big evil bureaucracy.' How would Mr. Clinton like it if we went on TV and talked about how he was being manipulated by the evil forces in Congress?"
 
Reputation Tarnished
 Certainly, these are not entirely happy days for the Japanese bureaucracy. Its reputation has been more than a little tarnished: newspapers feasted this week on the chaos that resulted from the public admission by a senior official that Japan had spent billions of dollars backing a technology for broadcasting high-definition television that is already outmoded.
Worse yet, the Prime Minister's trip to Washington, and the subsequent fallout, called into question whether the bureaucrats have lost one of their most valuable skills: placating the Americans.
"The bureaucracy has not yet changed the strategy it used in 12 years of contacts with the Reagan and Bush Administrations," the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, said in an editorial the other day.
But while Japanese love to complain about the power and pettiness of the bureaucrats, they still view them with more than a little pride, as the source of stability that keeps the country running even in times of political upheaval.
That is why the top graduates of the University of Tokyo still vie for positions at the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, ahead of jobs in the private sector. Where else, they say, could they be given at age 35 so much responsibility, so much respect? And while the demand for computer chips or steel may rise and fall, Japanese always harbor a desire for some central control of the economy, now an integral part of the national culture.
Their reach is such that bureaucrats, rather than elected officials serving as ministers, usually answer questions in Parliament. They draft virtually all the laws, usually wording them in language vague enough to leave maximum discretion in enforcing them. Even judges are trained as bureaucrats, all sent to the same school, and appointed to the bench early in life so that they can be inculcated with the conservative traditions of the courts. Periodically on television, the chairman of a major company is seen being called in by a young bureaucrat for a dressing-down while camera crews record the older man bowing deeply in apology.
 
Wary of Tax Watchdog
 The Finance Ministry also watches over all tax investigations -- a fact that makes most of Japan's politicians, whose fund-raising efforts often live on the far edge of the tax laws, unlikely to challenge them.
But the most important source of the bureaucracy's power is that it has the monopoly on expertise, leaving any prime minister with no alternative source of strategy, especially in the enormously complex world of trade.
Unlike the White House, the prime minister's office has very little staff of its own. There is no real equivalent of the National Security Council, no separate council of economic advisers.
"The staff can barely keep up with routine tasks, let alone take the time to make future-oriented plans for prime ministerial action," Mr. Ozawa wrote in his recent book, "Blueprint for a New Japan."
There are virtually no political appointees at the subcabinet level. Members of Parliament are even more dependent on the bureaucracy for ideas: at most, they have one secretary devoted to policy, while there are several to keep constituents happy or raise money.
 
Commissions Infiltrated
 The result is that there is little contention in the system, apart from feuds between ministries. Mr. Hosokawa, perhaps sensing that he was setting himself up for manipulation, has created a large number of independent commissions to advise him on critical problems, including the deregulation of the economy -- the core issue with the United States. But somehow, bureaucrats or retired senior officials have infiltrated the commissions. The results, some members say, is that the recommendations so far have been tremendously watered-down.
"It was frustrating," said Yotaro Kobayashi, the head of Fuji-Xerox and a leading member of one of the advisory groups. "While we have a new system in place, we have the same people running it. With the politicians in chaos, the bureaucracy is the stopgap."
The American Ambassador here, Walter F. Mondale, describes Japan's bureaucrats in more vivid terms. He compares them to the material on on spacecraft that peels off, layer by layer, as the outside temperature gets hotter and hotter.
"You run in with flamethrowers," he said the other day, "and it just chars a little bit."
Even Mr. Mondale acknowledges his admiration for the skill and intelligence of Japan's bureaucrats; the problem is that their first mission is defending their own institutions. Indeed, even deregulation, the step intended to get the bureaucrats out of the market, has been turned on its head by agencies terrified that their power may be diminished.
 
New Bureaucracy for New Rice
 Not long ago the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the country's biggest newspaper, reported how the Agriculture Ministry had managed to create a vast new bureaucracy to watch over imports of foreign rice, the biggest single market opening of Mr. Hosokawa's eight-month tenure.
New administrative orders are flying out the door, telling rice millers how to package and label their goods, how to price it, and then where to send it. "It is just like the days when rice was rationed," a bitter-sounding executive commented in the newspaper.
Even men like Akitane Kiuchi, a former Ambassador and recently Mr. Hososkawa's "secret messenger" to Washington, find themselves with some sympathy for Mr. Clinton's complaint.
"The Japanese are, unfortunately, the most conservative people in the world, and perhaps the bureaucrats are the most conservative among the Japanese," Mr. Kiuchi said. "Face it. We are not accustomed to change."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 2, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about Japan's entrenched bureaucracy misstated the circulation ranking of Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily newspaper that described the bureaucracy's handling of the opening of Japan's rice market to imports. It is the fourth-largest Japanese daily; the largest is Yomiuri Shimbun.

HEADLINE: The American Economy, Back on Top

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
DURING the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton often fretted that the United States economy was fast becoming the world's also-ran. But more and more it looks as if he inherited a winner.
A 3 percent economic growth rate, a gain of two million new jobs in the past year and an inflation rate reminiscent of the 1960's make America the envy of the industrialized world. The amount the average American worker can produce, already the highest in the world, is growing faster than in other wealthy countries, including Japan. The United States has become the world's low-cost provider of many sophisticated products and services, from plastics to software to financial services. And after years of decline, the nation's share of the world export market has been rising. 
 For the most part, these advantages will continue even after countries like Japan and Germany snap out of their recessions. It is the United States, not Japan, that is the master of the next generation of commercially important computer and communications technologies and also of leading-edge services from medicine to movie making. And American managers are not only investing heavily in new equipment, they are also much farther along than those in Europe and Japan in streamlining and re-engineering their companies to make them more competitive. That's one reason that American industries that recently were losers -- like automobiles, machine tools, steel and computer chips -- are back with a vengeance.
The turnaround reflects more than 10 years of sometimes innovative and often wrenching change, driven by recession, deregulation, tougher foreign competition, the threat of takeovers, and, not least, new technology.
The image of the United States as an economic winner, once associated only with apologists for the Reagan era, is catching on. The French newspaper Le Monde and the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun have each run long series on the new American competitive threat. Foreign leaders and executives who once lectured Americans on their shortcomings now speak enviously of this country's cleverness in churning out everything from jobs to Jeeps.
While such sentiments may seem more common abroad, there are signs that America's self-esteem is recovering. Some polls show that Americans once again see the United States as an economic giant. Rush Limbaugh, who likes to brag about America's prowess, is one of the most popular radio talk show hosts. By contrast, Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of dying American factory towns, hasn't had a hit in a couple of years.
"Image and reality have both undergone a remarkable change in the last few years," said Michael Hammer, a business consultant and co-author of the best-seller "Re-engineering the Corporation." "American business -- not just manufacturing -- is again perceived as the world leader."
David Rolley, an international economist at the forecasting firm DRI/McGraw Hill, added: "Everyone thought the U.S. was a basket case, but others turned out to be bigger basket cases. Germany has too many good things, too many vacations. Japan is too much like I.B.M., such a successful model that nobody figured out what to do when it exhausted the model."
None of this is an excuse for giddiness. The gains have come at a high price. Even as the economy created new jobs, tens of millions of people lost their old ones and were forced to pull up stakes, take pay cuts, carve out new careers. The United States is still second best (or third or fourth) in many pursuits. And tomorrow's stars, from Malaysia to Mexico, pose growing challenges for many an American business.
Also, the recovery here and the recessions abroad are bound to highlight American strengths and foreign weaknesses. America's turnaround may look better than it is because reports of the nation's demise were exaggerated to begin with. And, as always, what looks like a lot of improvement to one person looks like too little to another.
Finally, the benefits of economic leadership are mostly psychic. The struggle to make the economic pie bigger and insure that all citizens get a slice is largely a race against oneself, not against other countries. And being the economic leader is no cure for some of the most serious problems American society faces, including crime, inadequate education, the growing isolation of the underclass, the rampant economic insecurity that many middle-class Americans feel, and, for that matter, the malaise that can come with working so hard to do better.
But the changing perception of America is already subtly influencing the way we think. Infatuation with the Japanese or German model of capitalism is becoming less fashionable, and the massive government meddling advocated by so many critics to reverse the nation's supposed decline is less appealing to a lot of people.
For example, despite promises of more government help for so-called strategic industries, the Clinton Administration has not budgeted much money for such an industrial policy. And Washington will probably not lurch toward European-style "managed trade," through which the Government sets targets for how much companies should buy from, and sell to, foreigners -- recent threats to limit Japan's access to the American market notwithstanding. And almost no one expects the big worker-retraining programs proposed during the Presidential campaign to materialize.
In fact, interest is growing in less costly ways to let people roll with the punches -- from getting welfare mothers into jobs to making it easier for workers to change jobs without losing pensions or health coverage.
The climate could still change. A trade war with Japan, while unlikely, is nevertheless a possibility. The Federal Reserve Board could turn a blind eye as the inflation genie slips out of the bottle. There's always the possibility that health care reform, if it happens, will add costs to businesses and therefore stifle job creation. Efforts to protect the people who have suffered in the economic transformation could backfire -- as they have in Europe -- if they take the form of protectionism or laws that make it harder for businesses to shrink payrolls or get out of unprofitable businesses.
But many people, including the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, think that the many recent positive signs, especially the rebound in productivity growth, signal that the United States economy will do even better in the 1990's than in the 1980's. That means, they argue, that more Americans will share in the economy's gains.
 
The Evidence
Glowing Numbers And More to Come
 Some of the evidence of America's impressive economic performance has been around for years but ignored. Most of it is fairly new.
Start with the most basic yardstick of economic health, the growth of productivity, or output per worker. Productivity determines how fast living standards can rise.
The American worker is the most productive in the world by far, producing on average $49,600 in goods and services a year in 1990 -- $5,000 more than German workers, $10,000 more than Japanese counterparts. Moreover, while productivity was growing more quickly abroad than in the United States for most of the 20th century, America has lately been gaining more quickly, as companies here figure out how to provide more and better products and services with new technologies and fewer workers.
Since the start of the economic recovery nearly three years ago, United States productivity has been growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, more than twice as fast as the average between 1970 and 1990, and markedly better than elsewhere.
The United States lead is widest in services. Retailing is twice as productive in the United States as in Japan, where laws protect the shopkeeper from the discount chain. The deregulated American telecommunications industry is at least twice as productive as Germany's government monopoly. The fragmented American banking industry is a third more efficient than Germany's banking oligopolies. The American edge in these industries has recently been expanding, not shrinking.
Gains on the factory floor have lately been even more stellar than for the economy over all: Hourly output has been rising nearly 5 percent a year for three years even as it has flattened or fallen in Germany and Japan. The United States lead in manufacturing, which had been shrinking as Germany and Japan caught up or moved ahead in some industries, has lately been widening again.
"You're seeing today the results of actions undertaken in the second half of the 1980's," said Stanley Gault, the chief executive who helped revive the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Rubbermaid Inc.
THERE are at least two reasons for thinking that the American productivity lead won't evaporate when Germany and Japan recover from their recessions. One is that investment, especially in computers, is booming. The other, more important, reason is that corporate America started the painful task of learning how to make more, more quickly and with fewer resources, earlier than many of its overseas counterparts, especially in Europe.
In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Shintaro Hori, a director of the consulting firm Bain & Company Japan, estimated that Japanese companies will have to shed 15 to 20 percent of their white-collar work forces to match the low overhead in America.
"There are far fewer re-engineering efforts under way in Japanese and German companies compared with the United States," said Mr. Hammer, the consultant, whose firm has trained thousands of American managers to overhaul their companies in the last few years but few from foreign corporations.
Hard evidence is the reward American companies are reaping: Despite the moderate pace of the economic recovery, inflation-adjusted corporate profits are close to an all-time high.
In some smokestack industries -- steel, machine tools and especially cars -- the choice was to raise productivity and quality a lot or cede the field to the competition, as American companies did in consumer electronics. American managers chose the former, lifting productivity in the auto plants, for example, by an average of 10 percent every year during the late 1980's, according to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
Indeed, no sooner did "The Reckoning" -- the book by David Halberstam that focused on Ford and Nissan to tell "the story of Japan's ascent and America's subtle industrial decline" -- appear in 1985 than did Ford begin its comeback and Nissan begin to falter. Ford's market share has since climbed to 25.5 percent of the American market from 21.3 percent, while Nissan, with 5.0 percent today, never improved on the 5.3 percent it held in the mid-1980's.
IN the first half of the 1980's, many American products were not only inferior to, but also pricier than, those offered by other nations. The grossly overvalued dollar -- which made American exports expensive and imports cheap -- was largely to blame. But so were a clutch of bad habits -- from executives' granting fat pay increases to Washington's tolerating too much inflation.
These days, by contrast, American factories ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne and Spandex to Siena (for bicycle pants). America's exports have been rising nearly 9 percent a year since 1985, even faster than Japan's 6.6 percent and Germany's 4.2 percent. Even more telling, the United States' share of exports by industrialized countries, which shrank to nearly 10 percent a decade ago, close to a post-war low, has rebounded to its 1980 level, around 14 percent.
Small wonder. Thanks to the weaker dollar, more moderate wage settlements and gains in efficiency, American production costs have been rising more slowly than those in Europe and Japan: 1.1 percent a year since 1985, compared with 2.5 percent in Europe and 1.7 percent in Japan. BMW of North America Inc. and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. are building their new plants in the American South. And, to hold down the price of their new models, Japanese car makers with plants in America are resorting to a strategy considered unthinkable just a few years ago: raising as much as possible the content of locally procured parts, as Honda said it would do this year.
Contrast this with Germany's cost problem. At current exchange rates German manufacturing workers are paid about $26 an hour, $10 more than American and Japanese factory hands. The problem is so serious that Chancellor Helmut Kohl devoted the German equivalent of the State of the Union message last October to the problem of German competitiveness.
"It seems as if there is still nothing more important than thinking about how we can expand our recreation time," he scolded. "If we want to secure Germany's future, we cannot organize our country as if it were one big recreation park."
Making things less expensively isn't enough to captivate a world full of ever more affluent, increasingly sophisticated consumers. That requires a prodigious stream of new ideas and invention. A case in point is the converging world of computing, telecommunications and television.
"We're in the midst of the third industrial revolution," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, "and the United States is leading it."
The European technology industry is in deep trouble, its stagnant revenue, lack of new products and need for billions in government subsidies evident even before the recession. Japan has been a leader in consumer electronics. But, as its retreat in high-definition television shows, that country is still mainly the master of mass-produced components -- flat panel displays, memory chips, fax machines.
Six years ago, the fear was that Japanese dominance would spread to leading-edge technologies. But Japanese electronics giants like the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, the NEC Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation haven't been able to keep up with changing technology and American companies like the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are in the lead in virtually all the key ingredients of the business- and personal-computer revolution: software, workstations, laser printers, computer networks and the computers-on-a-chip known as microprocessors.
"Everything important gets invented here," said Charles Ferguson, a Cambridge, Mass., technology consultant who a few years ago was warning darkly of the Japanese threat. The growing demand for sophisticated products will probably play to the strengths of American producers. So might the fact that American consumers are already more familiar with new technology than people abroad. Compared with Japan, for example, the United States has more than three times as many personal computers per worker.
"More Americans are familiar with these technologies and are using them in everyday life," Mr. Steinberg said. "And more American businesses have learned to use the technology to improve productivity."
 
The Reasons
Economic 'Vices' Are Also Virtues
 Are there reasons for the American comeback other than inventiveness, streamlining, re-engineering, the adaptability of workers and managers, lower inflation and interest rates, and a weaker dollar?
Yes, indeed. Often overlooked is that some of this nation's supposed vices -- from a reluctance to protect and regulate industries, to an obsession with short-term profits -- have turned out to be virtues as well. And the much-praised features of Japanese and German capitalism -- from managed trade to lifetime employment -- have proved to have drawbacks.
The fact that American companies are regularly exposed to the toughest competitors on their home turf is a blessing as well as a curse. Detroit was forced to compete head to head with Japanese cars. European auto makers enjoyed far more protection from Japan. For a while, the jobs of tens of thousands of European auto workers and their bosses were safe, but now a huge downsizing is all but inevitable.
Lighter regulation in the United States than in other nations proved bracing for many American service companies because it encouraged competition. American shopkeepers cannot fall back on the kind of zoning laws that shield mom-and-pop stores in Japan from certain death by would-be Wal-Marts. A.T.& T. has been at the forefront of communications technology in large part because of challenges from the likes of MCI Communications Inc. and the Sprint Corporation. United Airlines gives passengers a better price because Southwest Airlines does. Contrast the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and United with their German counterparts, which remain carefully guarded state monopolies, though things are beginning to change.
Even the focus by investors and bankers on last quarter's bottom line may turn out to be less of a handicap than some argue. Impatient institutional investors blew the whistle when profits shrank, as did bank lenders without the cozy ties to corporate boards that exist in countries like Germany and Japan.
And the deep pain of layoffs has produced important gains. To be sure, the dislocation caused by layoffs in one American industry after another since the early 1980's is staggering. In the past decade, estimates Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago, 1 in 10 manufacturing jobs -- two million -- vanished every year, even though the net decline in factory jobs over the decade was only about 1 million.
But it is becoming clear that the ability to move workers quickly from one industry to another also has benefits to the economy -- in the form of increased productivity that is essential to raising the standard of living.
For all the layoffs, the fact is that the number of new jobs has far outstripped the number of jobs lost in recent years. The United States economy has added 18 million jobs in the past decade, a net gain of more than 20 percent, including 2 million in the past year. And the unemployment rate has dropped about 1.5 percentage points in the past 18 months, to just over 6 percent. The economies of the European Community, which combined are the same size as the American economy, have added just 7 million jobs in 10 years, a net increase of 7 percent, and have grappled with unemployment rates, now in the double digits, that haven't fallen below 8 percent in a decade.
 
The Dissent
But What About That Trade Deficit?
 Perhaps the most compelling counterargument to the notion that America is doing so well is this: Imports are rising three times faster than exports and the trade deficit, which was shrinking during the late 1980's, is swelling. "How can Japan pay wages that are higher, have productivity that is lower and still sell us $60 billion more than they buy?" asked Lester Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is much in favor at the White House by dint of his book "Head to Head: The Coming Battle Among Japan, Europe and America."
But the trade deficit is not a particularly reliable yardstick of the health of an economy for two reasons. The first is that how much countries buy abroad depends on their income as well as the attractiveness of the foreign products, and America's income (in short, its gross domestic product) is rising more rapidly than that of most other nations.
The more subtle reason is that critics of American competitiveness have a habit of focusing on trade figures that capture only goods that are traded internationally, ignoring the service sector. Yet America's economic performance depends far more on service industries, which now employ three out of four American workers.
So America's back in the lead. But that's no excuse to relax. "Things are going to get different again," said Mr. Hammer. "People think the hard work is over, but hard work is going to be a permanent condition."

After more than a decade of painful change and dislocation, many American industries are leaner and nimbler and others have seized the leadership of the sophisticated technologies that are ushering in the information age.

HEADLINE: Tax Law, Weather Plague Restaurants

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER restaurants are having a bad time," observed M'el Eudes who, with her husband, Henri, owns Auberge Argenteuil, a French restaurant in Hartsdale. "Places are closing left and right. Now the drop in the tax deduction for business meals is the last straw."
What Mrs. Eudes was referring to was the change in the tax deduction for business meals and entertainment, which took effect on Jan. 1 and reduced the tax deduction to 50 percent from 80 percent. 
 But the outlook is not unfavorable for all restaurants. Some are preparing to take advantage of the fact that catered meals on company premises remain fully tax deductible.
 
1989 Saw Beginning of Change
 When the Eudes bought Argenteuil 17 years ago, the deduction was 100 percent. It dropped to 80 percent in 1986. "The economy was strong then," Ms. Eudes recalled. "Companies were booming." But in 1989 things began to change.
"Corporations were among our steady customers," Ms. Eudes said. "Our restaurant is made up of a series of private rooms, which lend themselves nicely for luncheon and dinner meetings. We are a classic French restaurant, and we only use fresh ingredients in the French tradition, and we built up a loyal following. A pharmaceutical house, for instance, would regularly invite groups of doctors for lunch to introduce new products to them."
 
Decline in Corporate Business
 By 1989, however, "a lot of companies began moving out of state, others left the area, and we began to see a fall-off in corporate business," Ms. Eudes said. "Today we are seeing fewer and fewer corporate credit cards."
If the drop in the deduction wasn't bad enough for business, the weather wasn't helping either, Ms. Eudes said. "Since January we have been closed more days than we ever have before in all the 17 years in business." But what especially troubled her about the new ruling was its ripple effect.
"It is going to hurt the people who can least afford it, the restaurant workers," Ms. Eudes said. "They will be out of jobs. We are a small restaurant, and we once employed 30 people. Now we are down to 12."
John Antun, owner of Antun's of Westchester in Elmsford and the former president of both the Westchester Restaurant Association and the New York State Restaurant Association, a trade group, estimates that more than 100,000 jobs will be lost nationally in the restaurant industry.
"Fourteen years ago, it was almost impossible to find waitresses or cooks. Now well-qualified cooks are knocking on my door looking for work. That's how much things have changed."
And it is the restaurants who relied most on the expense-account lunch and dinner, Mr. Antun said, that are especially feeling the pinch.
"Some places have stopped serving lunch entirely," Mr. Antun said. "Restaurants all over the state have been affected. Perceptions are different. Corporations don't want to be seen as extravagant. Corporate clients ask us for banquets and parties that are low-key affairs. What I find interesting is that price is not so much the issue as is the desire not to look lavish."
Henry A. Fondu, one of the owners of Olliver's in White Plains, said that some of his regular customers have already been advised by their employers to cut back on business meals.
"Over the years we have worked up very good relationships with our corporate clients and it is no question that the new ruling will have a negative impact on our lunch and dinner business," Mr. Fondu said. "Companies are not only telling their executives to be more frugal but they are advising them to invite more clients to the company dining room more often."
But so far this year, it is "the weather that has hurt us more than the tax change," Mr. Fondu said. "The snow has been terrible for business."
 
An Essential Business Tool
 One of the things about the deduction for business meals that especially bothers Ms. Eudes is the misconception that the ruling will affect only the rich.
"I can't believe that Congress actually thought this one through," she said. "In addition to the restaurant workers who will be losing their jobs, the tax will hurt middle-income people like traveling salespeople and truck drivers who have to spend money for meals when they are on the road."
And there are those who feel that the business lunch is essential, whatever the penalty.
"Oh, sure, the new ruling will hurt, but the bottom line is that we will have to absorb it as part of the cost of doing business," said Donald R. Levin, president of Levin Public Relations and Marketing in White Plains. "It has its business purposes, and I will continue to take people out for lunch and dinner as much as I feel is necessary."
 
Detrimental Effect Expected
 Mr. Levin, who figured that he takes clients and prospective clients to lunch or dinner several times a week, said that the value of the business lunch is that there are fewer distractions in a restaurant than in an office.
"Just getting away from the telephone is worth it," he said. "There's less pressure and I can get a client's undivided attention. Business luncheons are much more productive than exchanging ideas in an office setting."
Mr. Levin, who favors the restaurants in Stouffer Westchester Hotel, the Rye Town Hilton and Doral Arrowwood, said he spends on the average of $35 for lunch and $50 for dinner for two. "People eat pretty sparingly today, and very few order drinks other than a glass of wine, usually at dinner," he said.
Ralph Serrecchia, manager of Povare Restaurant at Arrowwood, said the new rules would have a detrimental effect on all restaurants.
"I think we are feeling it at dinner more than at lunch, but we will have a better slant on it after we get two normal months of business back to back," he said. "It's hard to judge now how it has affected us so far because the weather has been so bad that business is off anyway."
Yet, Mr. Serrecchia said, the restaurant has stepped up its efforts on special promotions to attract new business. "We are going after local business people who are not necessarily on expense accounts, in addition to local residents," he said.
 
An Opportunity for Some
 And although the drop in deductions angers many of those in the restaurant industry, Mr. Antun said that it might actually benefit modest establishments that have never been on the expense-account circuit.
"Customers will be looking for lower-priced meals," he said, adding that restaurants were also exploring new ways to sell business meals.
"I look upon it as a new market opportunity for restaurants to get into on-site catering," he said. "When meals are delivered to a corporate headquarters or an off-site customer, they are 100 percent deductible as a business expense. We are busy promoting the concept of 'great food to go.' " Arrowwood, Mr. Serrecchia said, is also poised to deliver meals to customers in their offices. "Everything is in place. We expect to start the service shortly."
When she was asked about on-site catering, Ms. Eudes said: "We can't do that. Our master chef can't be in two places at once. We are regrouping in a different way by promoting events such as wedding luncheons and dinners and theme evenings. For example, we recently sent out 300 mailings for a Night in Provence dinner on March 4, which is price-fixed at $45, including wine. In this business you have to do something or you can't make it and you close."

Plans Afoot for New Or Expanded Malls

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AT LEAST a dozen major mall expansions or new malls are being planned across Connecticut, even though retail sales have been flat for five years.
Christopher J. Tennyson, senior vice president of Taubman Inc., said mall developers were looking to the future. His company, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has proposed a 381,000-square-foot expansion of the hugely successful Westfarms Mall, which straddles the West Hartford-Farmington line. The million-square-foot mall has four anchor stores. 
 "Building this will take about two years," Mr. Tennyson said. "If you build only in boom times, you're likely to open in down times. We think things will turn around in the two years it will take us to complete this project."
Taubman is also discussing with New Haven officials the development of an urban mall and is considering a 300,000-square-foot expansion of its 900,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center mall, which would let it add a new anchor store to the three already there, as well as 30 or 40 new shops.
Among other plans is one announced in December by the New York-based Charter Oak Partners for an 80-store, 400,000-square-foot mall on 103 acres in Westbrook, a few miles from where Connecticut Factory Stores is planning a 300,000-square-foot mall on 47 acres in Clinton.
In addition, Homart, based in Chicago, has an option to purchase a site in Waterbury for a new regional mall; Wilmorite, based in Rochester, is considering a site in Plainville and Erichetti Associates has proposed a 925,000-square-foot mall in its hometown of Cheshire, Conn.
All this is happening amid signs that a turnaround may have begun. Connecticut retailers reported 7 to 8 percent increases in Christmas sales over the previous year, said Ronald J. Pugliese, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, for a third consecutive year of rising sales.
Mr. Pugliese said that Connecticut had long had the highest per capita income in the country and that its unemployment rate was still relatively low. (The unemployment rate as of the end of 1993 was 5.9 percent, compared with more than 7 percent a year earlier; the state estimates that per capita income was $21,321 last year. In 1990, it was $20,189, the highest in the nation, compared with the national average of $14,420.)
Mr. Pugliese said that retailers, looking at those data, were bound to say, "Connecticut is a good place to be, so let's get in there."
Mr. Tennyon, of Taubman, said that "if you look at household income and college education and life style, Connecticut is an extremely attractive market."
John A. Erichetti, president of Erichetti Associates, which has approvals for a 925,000-square-foot mall at the intersections of Routes 691 and 10 in Cheshire, said that his development company was seeing first-hand the revival of Connecticut's economy.
"Our phone is ringing more often, capital is loosening up and investors are coming back into the market looking for deals," Mr. Erichetti said. "I think Connecticut is through the worst of it."
Mr. Erichetti said there was a lot of interest in new retail complexes because store configurations had changed so much in recent years, away from anchor stores and small shops and towards "category killers," such as Toys 'R' Us and Sound Playground, and club-type stores that offer members special discounts. Also, he said, some stores want to improve their location.
William E. Kane Jr., a mall development expert with Edward Heberger and Associates, a real-estate appraisal and consulting concern based in Cheshire, said mall developers wanted to duplicate the success of some relatively new retail projects, such as the Pavilion at Buckland Hills mall in Manchester. They are looking for niches that are unserved or underserved by regional malls, and there are still a few such pockets, such as in the Waterbury area, he said.
THAT is what is behind Homart's proposal for an 850,000-square-foot mall with four anchor stores and 120 smaller shops on 80 acres off Interstate 84 in Waterbury, said Kristine Sandrick, vice president for marketing at Homart. Meriden Center, a mall Homart co-developed, is a 20-minute drive from the Waterbury site, Ms. Sandrick, said, but "we don't have a problem with overlapping that market area" because "the Waterbury market in general is really underserved."
Ms. Sandrick said that Homart, which developed Buckland Hills, was hoping for a similar success in Waterbury. "We feel there are a lot of similarities," she said.
Mr. Kane said he doubted that all the proposals would come to fruition. There are three proposals in Waterbury, for instance, he said, but only one mall would survive "so they fight to see who can get their applications in first, and who can get the anchor tenants signed up first."
"I doubt all three of them would be built," he said, adding that the increase in proposals was ironic, because any mall development might be risky today.
"The department-store industry is going through a real shakeout," he said. "Malls are competing with specialty stores like The Gap and The Limited for clothing, and Sound Playground and Lechmere are taking away the hard-goods market. Stand-alone thrifts like Kmart and Wal-Mart and Bradlee are doing well, so a mall's sales base is eroding."
But some developers are trying to capitalize on the changes in shopping patterns. Jeffrey L. Johnson, a partner in Connecticut Factory Stores, for example, has proposed a 300,000-square-foot mall of factory-outlet stores in Clinton.
"In the entire spectrum of retail development, factory outlets are a real bright spot," Mr. Johnson said. "Sales in factory outlets continue to grow at a pace much quicker than other areas of retail."
He said that he had commitments for more than 60 percent of the space and that if the Charter Oak project in neighboring Clinton was built, rather than hurt his project, it could serve to establish the shoreline towns as a destination for factory-outlet shoppers.
"There are no other significant factory outlet centers in the state of Connecticut," Mr. Johnson said. "And in other areas, factory-outlet shoppers tend to have higher incomes and more education than people who shop in other retail outlets. The demographics in Connecticut are the quintessential factory-outlet shopper."
Other mall development companies are looking to diversify. William L. Grad, general manager of the Crystal Mall in Waterford, owned by New England Development, is seeking approval for two additional developments, each 200,000 to 250,000 square feet. He said one would be for one or two large tenants that did not like malls and the other could be retail-oriented development such as restaurants and movie theaters.
"We know it's a wonderful location based on the nine years we've been in this spot," Mr. Grad said. "The mall has been fully leased the last eight of those years."
Mr. Tennyson said Taubman wanted to expand and renovate its Westfarms and Stamford Town Center malls to make sure they remained among the preeminent retailing complexes in the state.
"One of the reasons you expand and change is to hold onto your franchise," he said.
IN late January the Farmington Zoning Commission approved plans for the $100 million Westfarms Mall expansion after Taubman agreed to direct traffic as much as possible away from residential areas of Farmington. The plans call for 311,000 square feet of retail space and two parking garages in the Farmington portion of the mall. Taubman is awaiting West Hartford's action on the rest of the addition, 70,000 square feet of retail space and a third parking garage.
Kathy Shields, the development director for Homart on the Waterbury mall project, said the company hoped to have it open in mid-1996. Market studies have shown that there are 350,000 people, with an average household income of $49,000, in the towns the mall would draw from, she said, and that they did not have a major mall within a 20- to 30-minute drive.
"'You don't get many clear-cut trade areas like that, that aren't already serviced by a regional mall," she said.

HEADLINE: Better, Brighter Space on a Tight Budget

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE 

 BODY:
IN a tight economy, an architect's job is particularly challenging: How to meet a project's objectives within strict budgetary guidelines -- and still create an exciting design.
Eight firms, having met those challenges, have been recognized by the American Institute of Architects, Connecticut, in its 31st annual design awards competition. 
 The diversity of their projects indicates that creativity is alive and well in the state, whether it be applied to police substations in New Haven or to a biotechnical research center in a cornfield in Mystic or to a vandal-resistant community center for Latino Youth Development in New Haven.
The jurors were Charles Redmon of Cambridge 7 Associates Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.; John M. Clancy of Goddy, Clancy & Associates Inc. in Boston, and Eve Kahn, architectural critic for The Wall Street Journal.
Most of the 62 architects submitting entries indicated that the state was experiencing a brain drain, referring to the loss of corporate and military operations. But, as Linda H. Griffis, program director of the A.I.A. Connecticut put it, "The jurors were delighted to see some low-budget work that was beautifully done."
 
A Center for Latinos
 That the community center for Latino Youth Development Inc. was built at all is a remarkable achievement, according to Charles Beckman Swanson, the New Haven-based architect who brought it in at $70 a square foot. "They had worked out of a former holding jail for a police substation abandoned 25 years ago, but wanted to create a home of their own," he said. "They began to solicit funds and came up with $554,000 in Federal, state and city grants. We spent every penny of it but no more."
A concrete masonry structure, the building houses a game room, tutoring room, counseling facilities and an entire floor devoted to allied outreach programs and offices. It serves as an informational, counseling and cultural resource center.
Even with its tough outer shell, the center is still vulnerable to vandalism -- paint in particular. But an amazing understanding has been reached in the neighborhood.
"The people who operate the building approached the families of known gang members -- the Latino Kings -- and asked them to please save the facility, and they have. It's been up now a year and a half," Mr. Swanson said. "The statement that this building has made to the community is permanence to Latino youth development. It has improved their status."
 
Police Substations
 Another award-winning project executed on "the tightest of budgets," in the jurors' words, is the community-based police substation system for the city of New Haven. Robert Roscow oversaw the project for the Center for Architecture Inc., situated in Wallingford.
"They are really the first of their kind," said Mr. Roscow, referring to the seven structures now present in some of New Haven's most troubled neighborhoods. "The whole concept is you have the policemen on foot assigned to an area -- that gives you a reason for having these substations."
A grant from the state enabled the substations to go up. The architect designed one prototype, suitable for modular construction, from which all could be derived.
"They're very simple little buildings," Mr. Roscow said. "There are no lockups, no booking area, no video cameras at the door. They serve more as an outpost. One side has desks and lockers; on the other side is a meeting room for 30 to 40 people with a kitchen. It's open to different groups in the community."
An added attraction, especially for the local children, is the horse stall prominently situated at the front of each substation to accommodate the mounted patrol. "The horses are bathed, there is hot and cold running water for them, and the kids can pet the horse," he said.
 
Facelift for Schools
 Children and the booming school enrollment were the focus of the winning design of Harold Roth of New Haven, who was charged with the expansion and renovation of two identical elementary schools in Branford.
"We wanted to completely change the image of the schools." Mr. Roth said. "It was done in a way to expand the kind of activity that would enrich the curriculum; a library -- science, music and art facilities. There was no hot lunch program, no place for indoor assemblies."
The Mary Tisko and Mary Murphy schools were both tripled in size, in each case using the original building as the side of a square with an interior courtyard. The new lunch room and library became the front of each school.
 
Battling the Saugatuck
 Fighting to save a historic building from the encroaching waters of the Saugatuck River was challenging enough for Roger Ferris of Southport, but the project nearly drowned because of town zoning.
National Hall, an 1873 Italianate edifice, was originally built as a bank for Westport. "At the time," Mr. Ferris said, "the Saugatuck River was navigable and a port. We have photos that show the large ships right in front of it. The town fathers thought that it would become an important port." The railroads, however, changed all that, he added.
Besides being the town's bank, the building served -- concurrently -- as the town high school, the state police barracks and Town Hall. "This now stands as an odd building, not in keeping with anything else. That's why modern-day regulations didn't fit it very well," Mr. Ferris said.
For the developer to save the building, which was "falling into the Saugatuck River" according to Mr. Ferris, three years were spent in the "regulatory arena and involved 19 local, state and Federal agencies."
Winning designation for the site as a Historic Design District, the architect was able to go ahead with the plan, which called for a 15-suite inn and a restaurant. "The next step was to basically build a new building within the existing shell," Mr. Ferris said. "That whole process included all new steel foundations and rebuilding the cast-iron facade. I liken it to putting one's sock on with one's shoe on."
 
Making a Church Inviting
 Another historic building needed to change with the times, and Steven McAlister of New Hartford did just that for the First Congregational Church in Collinsville, on the National Register of Historic Places.
"My main objective was to allow a contemporary, family, evangelical congregation to use it, without destroying its historical character," explained Mr. McAlister.
The architect said the Greek Revival church was built in 1858 by the Collins family, of the Collins Ax Company (relocated to Asia), and reflected a time when the pulpit was elevated, the choir was out of sight at the back and the feeling was very formal, very Puritan. The church also had an unfinished appearance, indicated by lack of moldings and the use of simple pipe columns.
Mr. McAllister's design for the interior was derived from Greek Revival, and the most dramatic change was the replacement of the pipe columns. "The day the new columns went in, it changed," he said. He also curved the balcony, which was "a weird place to be with no connection to the rest of the church," he said. He raised and canted the pews for a better view of the altar platform, and enlarged the narthex and installed glazed doors in a "conscious attempt to bring the people in the street inside."
 
A Design for Corn
 Creating a strain of corn that is naturally resistant to drought and insects is the charge of scientists who work in the new Discovery Research Center in Mystic. The research facility was designed by a team headed by William H. Grover, of Centerbrook Architects in Stonington.
"This is a biotechnical research center -- we've done quite a few of these," Mr. Grover said. "We had to design laboratories that were relatively inexpensive for a start-up company. It had to be economical, a nice place so they could hire young scientists who wanted to work there, and it had to be a good neighbor to the nursing home next door."
All different kinds of equipment needed to be accommodated, as well as a library, offices, laboratories and greenhouses. "They take things from a single cell and grow a tiny plant to a giant corn plant in a continuous operation," Mr. Grover said. The complex, to blend in with its agricultural location, resembles barns and is surrounded by cornfields.
To house aspiring scientists among other students, Chad Floyd, also of Centerbrook Architects, designed the Academic Center and Honor Housing for the University of Toledo in Ohio.
"It's a 400-bed dorm to house honors students," Mr. Floyd explained. "The idea is that this is an opportunity for those who are really studious to gather in a student atmosphere."
An academic building, yet to be erected, was also designed as part of a master plan. "The look of the building has its roots in the campus itself -- from the academic Gothic style of architecture -- and is similar in hue and value to the buff-colored native limestone on the early traditional buildings on campus," Mr. Floyd said.
Before sitting down to draw, Mr. Floyd had workshop sessions with faculty, students and staff members. "It was clear people longed for some sense of continuity. What we did was to create a new architecture that employs some general Gothic sensitivities but build it with a contemporary sensibility," he said.
The jury noted the project's use of simple materials, the brick pattern at the base, the aluminum roofing and the wonderful chimneys set at an angle to the roofing.
 
A Library for the Light
 The only winning residential project was a library addition described by the jurors as "a plain, brown wrapper with all the icing inside."
"It's a lighthouse, a tower of learning, and kind of a folly," said David Austin, of Austin Patterson Associates in Southport. The three-story library tower was built on an existing foundation, an addition to the original 1820's waterfront tavern, now the home of a Darien family. To reflect the owners' interest in boating, the architect included all kinds of nautical references.
For example, the first-level ceiling beams look as though they are connected to the ribs of a ship. And to gain access to the second and third levels, one has to ascend a single-tread, industrial ladder with spark ling brass railings. The whole structure is tapered to the top, just like a lighthouse, with the third level affording vast views of the river, harbor and Long Island Sound. The floor of the third level is executed in industrial glass blocks, "to bring the light down," said the architect.
An avid sailor himself, Mr. Austin said, "I couldn't resist trying this."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Study Indian Point 3 Plant

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: BUCHANAN

 BODY:
THREE state lawmakers have begun an inquiry into economic and safety issues at Indian Point 3, the New York Power Authority's nuclear plant here.
Richard L. Brodsky, a State Assemblyman representing parts of Greenburgh, said last week that in the long run, keeping the plant open may not make economic sense, considering the cost of decommissioning the reactor and expenses associated with nuclear waste disposal among other things. 
 The 17-year-old Indian Point 3 was voluntarily shut down a year ago and remains closed, pending work to correct problems identified by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Last June, after a series of unfavorable evaluations, the 965-megawatt plant was placed on the commission's watch list of the country's most troubled reactors. In July, a performance review by the regulatory body cited inadequate management controls.
 
Safety and Management Also at Issue
 Paul D. Tonko, chairman of the Assembly's Energy Committee and an Assemblyman from the 105th District, which includes Schenectady, has joined Mr. Brodsky in the study of Indian Point 3. Also on the panel is Albert Vann, chairman of the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, and an Assemblyman representing the 56th District in Brooklyn.
Mr. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, has questioned "the true value" of Indian Point 3, considering the fact that the plant is "down almost 50 percent of the time" and during those periods alternative power must be purchased by the New York Power Authority in order to supply its customers.
In addition to studying the economics of keeping the plant open, the legislative inquiry is focusing on safety issues at the plant and management practices, which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called deficient.
"The question of safety is something I have been looking at for a long, long time," Mr. Brodsky said. "My point now is that this needs to be thoroughly researched and investigated."
 
A Source of Employment
 James F. X. Steets, communications manager for Indian Point 3, said that the benefits of the plant "have been demonstrated in a $2 billion saving to our customers in New York City and Westchester" since 1976 when the plant opened. The plant's license to operate expires in 2016.
Mr. Steets also said that the plant employs 654 full-time workers and up to 900 part-timers during power failures, which, he said, "has a favorable impact on the local economy in terms of jobs." He also said that most of the management issues had been "addressed and resolved" and that the power authority was looking at a possible reopening of the plant this fall.
But Mr. Brodsky said that Mr. Steets' reassurances notwithstanding, the public had become increasingly worried about the safety and economic issues.
At least one hearing will be scheduled in the spring, and Mr. Steets said the power authority would cooperate by providing whatever information was needed by the legislators.
Mr. Brodsky, however, predicted that the hearing would "be a watershed" and added: "Something very, very major is happening to the policies and politics regarding Indian Point 3. The safety arguments, especially, are becoming more powerful."
Meanwhile, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke's office announced earlier this month that it was mailing an updated booklet, "Planning for Emergencies," to all Westchester residents who live within a 10-mile radius of the Indian Point power plants. Indian Point 2, which is run by Consolidated Edison, is also in this northern Westchester town.
The booklet, published yearly, describes the county's plans to protect residents during emergencies like severe storms, fires, transportation accidents or incidents at the power plants.
 
Report on Radiation Included

 This year's 12-page booklet includes some changes in reception centers, which are predesignated sites for evacuees.
"While chances of a major accident at Indian Point or some other form of large-scale emergency are quite remote, we strongly urge recipients of the booklet to note the changes and read the booklet carefully," Mr. O'Rourke said.
The booklet includes a detailed map of the area and information on sirens and frequencies of radio stations carrying emergency information. It also suggests what children in school, people in hospitals, nursing homes and day-care centers and those with disabilities should do in an emergency.
A report is included on radiation and its effects. The closing paragraph reads as follows: "In more than 30 years, the operation of the Indian Point plants has never caused an injury to a member of the public. Mechanical malfunctions have interrupted operations at times and occasionally have caused small releases of radiation inside the containment building, but have never led to a significant release beyond the plant boundary."
Residents who want a copy of the booklet should call the County Office of Emergency Services at (800) 942-1452.

THE YOUNG SCIENTISTS
America's Future and the Winning of the Westinghouse.
By Joseph Berger.
243 pp. Reading, Mass.:
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $21.95. 
HOW does one get to be a great scientific researcher and maybe win a Nobel Prize? Practice, practice, practice -- doing research, that is, instead of just memorizing scientific facts and principles. Start early, in a special high school dedicated to turning "youngsters intoxicated with science into scientists." Find a mentor in a real laboratory. Design a full-scale project. Work endless hours, with "impassioned diligence," and love it.
It helps, but is not essential, to come from New York (loaded with such special schools, gifted teachers and research centers); to be the child of an immigrant family accustomed to struggle for whom America is still a frontier; and to have parents who value and foster autonomy, curiosity, initiative and the work ethic.
These are the central messages in "The Young Scientists," in which Joseph Berger, a reporter for The New York Times who covered education from 1987 to 1993, takes what could have been a dry subject and turns it into an account that is at once exhilarating, poignant and deeply troubling.
Mr. Berger uses the annual national Westinghouse Science Talent Search as a vehicle to examine science education in the United States (a nation in which, according to a recent survey for the National Science Foundation, less than half of adults knew that Earth revolved around the sun) and to argue that we desperately need to make more young scientists if the United States is to maintain its economic and technological stature.
Wisely, then, he begins with the places that are doing that job brilliantly: schools like the Bronx High School of Science (which Mr. Berger, a student there more than 30 years ago, remembers fondly), Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, Midwood High School in Brooklyn and the new statewide science boarding schools, especially the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics ("a Southern-fried Bronx High School of Science with dormitories") in Durham. In each, he takes us into the classrooms, introduces us to inspired teachers who run research courses and guide Westinghouse competitors, and explains the core of the talent search method, which has helped produce 5 Nobelists, 8 recipients of MacArthur Foundation fellowships and 28 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
"In most American science classes," Mr. Berger notes, "students learn scientific concepts and facts that they feed back on tests. They do not learn methods of research, and they do not perform any research." One teacher explains: "How great would it be just getting lectures in basketball? You gotta play the game."
The excitement in "The Young Scientists," and the best reason for reading the book, is in the interviews with the students who have struggled through the year-long Westinghouse project, produced complete, rigorous, publishable and innovative pieces of scientific research, and emerged as national winners. These students are anything but stereotypical nerds; they bubble with energy, combine brilliance with the true grit necessary to think their way past the failures and obstacles that always accompany research, and cherish the curiosity and sense of wonder that really drive science.
These teen-age scientists are not "touched at birth with radiant powers," Mr. Berger reminds us. They are nurtured, and we should be making tens of thousands more of them. "The Young Scientists" shows us how.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Delegates, Alas, Oversimplify Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The "failure" of the latest round of United States-Japanese trade talks shows the simplistic and self-centered approach the United States often takes toward its "most important" international partner: unrealistic demands such as numerical targets, failure to obtain agreement or fulfillment, followed by threats to retaliate or a retaliatory action. 
 Watching these spectacles, now too familiar, one wonders if United States negotiators understand the complexity of economic mechanisms and the workings of Japanese society. The overall impression is that the United States is good at working out a conceptual image of, say, Japan; it then takes that image to be reality. When it finds that reality differs from an image so conceived, instead of changing the image, it vents frustration.
Take one Administration official's pronouncement to the effect that Japanese bureaucracy is now the "enemy" of the United States. The economic activities of any country are the result of interactions of a range of factors: industrial productivity, individual corporate strategies, the relationship between corporations and their stockholders, habits and preferences of consumers, regulations, and those who create and implement the regulations, the bureaucrats.
The trade balance is no more than one result of these interactions. It is naive to assume, as the Clinton Administration apparently does, that by reshaping Japan's bureaucracy to its own liking, the United States can eliminate its deficit with Japan.
Only this simplistic, self-centered approach can account for the United States action of bringing in the Japanese foreign minister at the critical stage of framework talks. The obvious assumption was that by going over the heads of bureaucrats, the United States demands on numerical targets would be quickly met.
Most Japanese agree with the Clinton Administration's basic proposition that Japan's social and economic structures themselves must change for imports to increase. This is why Japan has been taking steps to grow out of "a corporate society" by shifting its emphasis from corporations to consumers. The Japanese are also re-examining their regulatory system, even though they have benefited from it for nearly half a century.
There are things that only Japan can do in correcting the imbalance, like reforming its political system, as well as things that only the United States can do, such as reducing its budget deficit. There are also things that cannot necessarily be resolved through negotiations, like the difference in speed in bringing about social change and the different degree of complexity of matters to be changed.
Yet before the talks the Clinton Administration, which turned these disparate elements into a single issue, had made simple assumptions about economic mechanisms and the workings of Japanese society and expressed frustration whenever it found that its assumptions did not conform to reality. In this regard, it was shadowboxing. The danger is that the resulting "failure" could provoke the threat of retaliation or a retaliation itself that would affect the global trade climate. It is hard to imagine that such an approach, which is based on virtual reality, will change economic reality.

HEADLINE: Ticketmaster Depends on Part-Time Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Health Care Squeeze" by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 13) notes that Ticketmaster's part-time workers, according to the collective bargaining agreement negotiated by labor and management, do not receive health insurance benefits. This is a policy driven by economic necessity, one that is inevitably followed by the overwhelming proportion of American companies and accepted by nearly all unions. 
 Mr. Herbert, however, attributes insidious motives to Ticketmaster, parroting a union claim that is now before an impartial arbitrator, where it belongs.
Of course Ticketmaster employs many part-time workers; we could not run our business without them. For example, we need to respond when people call, with large staffs available during peak periods from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. and from 6 to 10 P.M. Very few people want to work both shifts. Our needs also vary widely from month to month, with demand surging in November and December and plummeting in January.
It is this combination of fluctuating demand and early and late shifts -- operational constants -- that leads us to depend on part-time workers.
We try to accommodate the demands of our employees as much as possible -- but more often than not, it is we who seek people to work extra hours, rather than workers who seek to extend. For example, the employee cited as complaining about reduced hours has told us she cannot work on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. Are we manipulating her schedule by respecting her wishes?
These issues will be resolved in arbitration on their merits. The larger problems of extending health care to all -- a program goal we support -- can only be responsibly addressed as part of the national debate on the subject.

HEADLINE: Competing Plan Is Stuck Offstage In Debate Over Better Health Care

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
If the struggle over health care is a struggle for the soul of the President and his party, Representative Jim Cooper is yanking in one direction and Representative Jim McDermott is pulling in the other.
Mr. Cooper of Tennessee, young tribune of the New Democrats, urges President Clinton to go slow, to turn away from the lure of big government even if it means forsaking the goal of universal coverage. 
 Mr. McDermott, an amiable liberal from Seattle, who was practicing psychiatry while Mr. Cooper was still prepping at Groton, urges the President to stay committed to the goal of universal coverage -- not someday but now -- and to recognize that a straightforward government insurance program like Canada's is the best way.
 
Hot in Washington
 Mr. Cooper is very hot in the capital. Mr. McDermott and his cause -- the less-than-grandly titled single-payer movement -- have been regarded by many as a charming anachronism, the earth shoes of health policy. "Right now, if you read the newspapers, you'd think it was Cooper vs. the President," Mr. McDermott grumbles.
In a meeting at the White House on Wednesday night, Mr. McDermott and some allies served notice that they were still very much in the game.
It is, in fact, easy to underestimate the single-payer influence in the House -- and wrong. Mr. McDermott has 90 Democratic co-sponsors for his health care bill in the House; Mr. Cooper has a total of 57 in both parties. Supporters of a Canadian-style health system are scattered across the Ways and Means Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, all places where they can make their influence felt as the legislative process begins. They are the Democratic base for health care overhaul, a sturdy counterweight to efforts to push Mr. Clinton to the right.
At the very least, they expect Mr. Clinton to live up to his promise of guaranteeing coverage to all. "It'll be the single payer people in the subcommittees who will keep universal coverage from being phased in over 45 years," said one Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill, a Clinton backer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In fact, after Mr. McDermott's meeting with the President and his top health advisers this week, the Congressman declared, "I think the President understands that he cannot pass any version of health reform without our votes, and that he is not going to get our votes by simply making more compromises with those who do not share his basic goal of universal health insurance coverage for all Americans."
At best, they hope that the sheer complexity of the Clinton plan -- with its quasi-governmental insurance purchasing pools and its mix of market and regulatory forces -- will drive new supporters into their ranks.
Mr. McDermott said: "I think that ultimately the President will sign a bill that will be quite a bit different from what he produced."
But will it be more like Mr. Cooper's, or more like yours?
"More like us," Mr. McDermott asserts.
 
Many Who Disagree
 There are many who disagree, but on a quiet morning in his office on Capitol Hill, the 57-year-old Congressman seems engaged in something other than political bluffing. He is padding about his office, searching for an account of the practice of bloodletting in Revolutionary America and the role it played in the death of George Washington; he wants to use it in an article he is writing about health care restructuring for the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It is all a matter of faulty and unexamined beliefs, Mr. McDermott explains, with the congenial manner of a shrink-turned-pol: A belief that bloodletting worked, a belief that government does not.
"We have this belief in this country that government can't do anything right," he says. "We've had 12 years of people selling that idea from the White House." That, in turn, leads to a conviction that a single-payer system is "politically not doable," Mr. McDermott argues, a determination that the Clinton Administration made early on.
"They simply said, what will the American people buy? And they said, they won't buy a government program. So they designed their program around public polls, not about what was the best public policy. And I'm willing to argue about that."
 
A Polite Response
 More in sorrow than in anger, the Congressman says, "The President has so much power to shape public opinion, and he's so good at it. I think he could have sold single payer. I really, honestly do."
The Administration responds politely. "Clearly they're a crucial bloc of very committed legislators who have been fighting for health care for a very long time," said George Stephanopoulos, the Presidential adviser. "We're not taking them for granted, we want to work with them, we consider them allies."
There have been many versions of single-payer systems proposed over the years; the main characteristic is that the Government essentially replaces the health insurance companies, doing away with private insurance premiums, raising taxes and using them to pay for medical care. In Mr. McDermott's plan, the Federal Government would define the standard benefit package -- which would include such extensive benefits as long-term nursing home care -- and people would pay for it through a payroll deduction.
Employers would pay 8.4 percent of payroll, small employers 4 percent and employees would pay 2.1 percent of wages or salary. Mr. McDermott argues that most people would end up saving money under this plan, because it would replace what is currently paid to insurance companies -- including huge administrative costs.
 
Hearing the Objections
 Mr. McDermott says he has heard all the objections to a single-payer system: fear of government, fear of vast new taxes, fear of rationing. The rationing issue, he says, is particularly powerful, and, he asserts, particularly unjustified.
"People don't look at what's going on in this system right now, in terms of rationing," Mr. McDermott says. "If you have a hernia operation, you don't get to stay in the hospital overnight. They hand you a bottle of pills and send you home after your surgery. Women have a baby; they get sent home the same day they have the baby.
"That's rationing done by insurance companies, right now in this country, it's happening all the time."
Mr. McDermott has the physician's full measure of disdain for insurance companies. This, in fact, gives much of the power to his arguments: He straddles the divide between those who write health policy and those who live it. He was a psychiatrist for two decades in a variety of settings -- from a private practice to the Seattle/King County Jail to the Foreign Service in Zaire, where he worked with American personnel in sub-Saharan Africa.
Before coming to Congress in 1988, he served 15 years in the Washington State Legislature, where he worked on legislation to provide low-cost insurance to low-income and unemployed people. He was appointed to the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health in 1992.
The single-payer movement is often faulted for its political naivete, and there is some grumbling in the House that Mr. McDermott could be more aggressive and more strategic in pressing his case. He is, in fact, less artful in political positioning than Mr. Cooper.
 
An Excess of Politics
 But Mr. McDermott argues that the Administration suffers from an excess of politics. The recent report by Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, actually did the Administration a favor when it ruled that the Clinton plan was, in fundamental ways, a government program financed by government receipts, Mr. McDermott said.
"He forced them out in the open," Mr. McDermott said. "He said, 'Come on, this thing costs money. Why don't you just admit it, and put it up on the table, and don't try to confuse people about how you're going to get this for free. I mean, that's just baloney, and every American knows it."
In the middle of all this maneuvering, Mr. McDermott said he and other single-payer advocates cling to the President's promise of universal coverage as a fundamental right. Everybody in the health care debate has anecdotes, and as Mr. McDermott sums up:
He was leaving the hospital one night when he was called back to consult in the intensive care unit, where a 45-year-old man who had just had a heart attack was demanding to leave the hospital. "So I went and talked to him, and he said, 'Look, if I stay here at $1,000 a day, if I live, I'm going to be broke, because I don't have insurance. And if I die, my family's going to be broke. So why the hell not get out of here?' "
Mr. McDermott added with a small smile, "He was totally sane. He knew where he was, what was happening to him. He was not the least bit out of touch."

HEADLINE: Mexico Mediator Sees Progress, but a Rebel Disagrees

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Despite indications by the mediator between Government and peasant rebel negotiators that the parties had reached the broad outlines of a settlement, the rebels insisted tonight that the Government had refused to meet their most important demands.
At a news conference this evening in the mustard-colored cathedral where he often says Mass, the mediator, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal, said the two sides had come to "a significant agreement" that resolved at least 22 of 34 demands presented by the insurgents. 
 But little more than an hour later, the military commander of the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army, who is known only as Subcommander Marcos, said flatly, "There are no agreements now of any type."
Contradicting both Monsignor Ruiz and a Government official who echoed his report of tentative accords, Marcos said the rebels and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's peace commissioner for the southern state of Chiapas, Manuel Camacho Solis, had merely presented their different positions.
"There has still not been any negotiation," Marcos said in an interview with foreign reporters. "The Commissioner has heard our demands. We have heard his answers."
It was unclear to what extent the contrasting explanations of what had happened in the first eight days of talks reflected deep or even substantive differences on specific issues.
Marcos seemed to dismiss the Government's responses in part because they were, as he described them, "only promises" that came without guarantees. All parties to the negotiation also said it would soon break up so that Mr. Camacho could lobby for support from colleagues in the Government and rebel delegates could consult with their peasant supporters.
Monsignor Ruiz offered few details of the accords he said had been reached to end a conflict that has taken more than 100 lives, shaken the country's political system and tarnished the public image of Mr. Salinas's administration.
But he said that among the unresolved issues, four or five were "very secondary," while the others were complicated mainly by the difficulties involved in their translation into the four Mayan Indian languages spoken among the 19 Zapatista negotiators.
On the most difficult issue in the talks -- the rebels' demand for broad political changes to assure fair national elections -- Monsignor Ruiz said the two sides had already reached agreement on two non-binding commitments for democratic reform.
The difference in Marcos's account of discussions on that issue was particularly stark.
"What we think is that the Government roundly refuses to accept the discussion of national issues," he said. "The Government has refused to talk about democracy."
He recognized, as he has before, that political reform was a task that goes far beyond the negotiations in San Cristobal. But he added: "If there is no change in the political course, there will not be peace. If that change does not take place, not only will there not be peace, but this country will explode."
Speaking to reporters through the ski mask that has been his only public face, the rebel leader listed eight other main points of conflict. He said they included the rebels' demands for democracy and election-law reforms, changes in the country's legal system and economic policies, and greater protection of Indian rights.
The REPORTS came after two days of intense negotiations in which the talks appeared to have bogged down and the rebel leadership pointedly reiterated its insistence..
The reports came after two days during which the talks seemed to bog down and the rebel leadership pointedly reiterated its insistence that President Salinas either resign in favor of a transitional Government or turn over the supervision of national elections to independent citizens.
"We cannot ignore the interpretation that we are in the most critical part of the accords at this moment," the negotiators said in a joint communique late Saturday night. "We are aware that everything agreed to at the negotiating table and verified in Chiapas has profound repercussions for the future."
The grave tone had contrasted sharply with earlier upbeat announcements of tentative accords for the protection of Indians' civil rights and improvements in areas like housing, health care and education.
It was still not clear what had caused the sharp swings in the tenor of the negotiations.
 
Most Politics Is Local
 Government officials said they had responded generously to the rebels'local demands partly in hopes of persuading them to step back from their insistence on broad changes in the political system.
At a distance from the talks here, the Government and its Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled for 65 years, began to take promised steps to insure fair presidential elections in August. After weeks in which Government supporters resisted opposition pressure for a special session of Congress to draft new election laws, officials said such a session might be called as early as Monday.
Until Saturday, the Zapatistas seemed to have grown more responsive to the Government's argument that it could not bargain over changes in the political system with a small guerrilla force that suddenly declared war against the state on Jan. 1. While making clear that the rebels would not drop their push for political changes, their military commander, Subcommander Marcos, described the talks as too small to accommodate such national issues.
 
Rebels Repeat Demands
 But in a toughly worded communique issued late Saturday, the Zapatistas repeated their demand for sweeping political change.
"Their legitimacy does not come from respect for the will of the majority but its usurpation," the statement said of Mr. Salinas and a group of unidentified state governors whom it accused of having come to power by electoral fraud.
Although the statement seemed to make an oblique threat of resuming the fighting that ended Jan. 10 with a cease-fire, it was understood by some Government officials more as a figurative call to arms.
An official familiar with the talks said the President's negotiator, Manuel Camacho Solis, had offered measures to break the governing party's monopoly on power in Chiapas and to assure Indian communities of a greater role in determining priorities for economic development. But the official said Mr. Camacho had rejected the Zapatistas' call for parallel Indian governments, and would not move from that position.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS:;
A newsletter treats the adventures of Ross Perot
as more than just political entertainment.

BYLINE: By William Glaberson 

 BODY:
ROSS PEROT, according to Micah L. Sifry, may be either the catalyst for an important new social movement or "a dictator in waiting." Either way, Mr. Sifry figures, there ought to be a market for a newsletter ($15 for four issues a year) about the billionaire and his movement.
The result: The Perot Periodical, a quarterly that The Columbia Journalism Review recently called the classiest of a new crop of niche political publications. Others include The Clinton Chronicle, a monthly tantrum against the Commander in Chief, and Stephanopouletter: The Official Newsletter of the George Stephanopoulos Fan Club. 
 Mr. Sifry, whose day job is associate editor of The Nation, the left-tilted weekly, is now working on the third issue of The Perot Periodical. And in case readers don't get the point, the newsletter with the caricature of Mr. Perot as an "albino monkey in a zoo" is not authorized by the former Presidential candidate.
Call it son of The Quayle Quarterly, the irreverent newsletter that passed on to publication heaven when the former Vice President left Washington.
Mr. Sifry, who gave himself the titles of editor and publisher, acknowledges an intellectual debt to The Quayle Quarterly's founders. The Perot Periodical includes some of their brand of satire. But Mr. Sifry says the heart of his effort is to chronicle a movement that is being overlooked by large news organizations. He says Mr. Perot may have been prematurely declared "washed up" by Washington pundits.
Still, Mr. Sifry knows, as Mr. Perot himself seems to, that some of Mr. Perot's attraction is his quirkiness. The "albino monkey" drawing, for example, is part of a regular series by an illustrator, D. B. Johnson, who gamely accepts the invitation offered by Mr. Perot's uniquely descriptive way of expressing himself.
Using quotations from Mr. Perot, Mr. Johnson provides an accompanying image. The recent drawing was inspired by Mr. Perot's explanation, reported in U.S. News & World Report, of his ability to draw crowds: "I'm kind of like an albino monkey in a zoo. People come because they never saw one."
The newsletter's current 16-page issue quotes Mr. Perot as making this comment at a recent rally in Tampa, Fla.: "I am willing to stand up here like a clay pigeon, if you will write your Congressman." Guess what type of bird Mr. Johnson drew?
All the caricatures, of course, are labeled AnthroPEROTmorphics.
But Mr. Sifry has also sounded serious themes.
Reporters for the newsletter have documented what they say could be evidence that "the line between Perotism and right-wing extremism is getting thin." The newsletter also suggested that as many as one-third of the paid leaders in the constantly changing cast at Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand America, are former military officers.
And it has argued that, rather than losing millions of dollars in running for President in 1992, as reported by many news organizations, Mr. Perot might have made money. It says Mr. Perot's influence helped push Bill Clinton away from early promises of a vigorous economic stimulus program, thus helping to keep interest rates low. The resulting gains in the bond market, it said, were beneficial to Mr. Perot, who is believed to have heavy bond investments. The newsletter concludes, therefore, that he "made a quarter-billion dollars by running for President."
Mr. Sifry, 32, says he is nearly breaking even on his venture, which is aimed at "political junkies" and journalists. He also has what he calls a surprise market among dissident Perot supporters who fret about what some say is a streak of authoritarianism in the organization. The magazine-style newsletter has about 450 mail subscribers, and Mr. Sifry says 4,000 copies have sold briskly at a price of $4 each in bookstores across the country.
At Mr. Perot's Dallas headquarters, however, The Perot Periodical is not a big hit. "It's got a lot of inaccuracies and I guess I don't respect a publication that doesn't report accurately," said Sharon Holman, the spokeswoman for Mr. Perot's organization.
She said the assertion that the organization might be drifting toward the right was false and that it was simply made up of "grass-roots regular Americans." She labeled the assertion that Mr. Perot made a profit because of his run for office "so absurd it's not even worth a comment."
And in response to the newsletter's coverage suggesting that many of the organization's leaders were recruited from the ranks of former military officers, she read a letter from V. B. Corn, its state leader in Ohio. Mr. Corn labeled The Perot Periodical a "tabloid-like" publication and said fewer than 20 percent of the national staff members of United We Stand America had served in the military.
Mr. Sifry said Mr. Perot's movement eludes traditional news organizations precisely because it is nontraditional. But with some polls showing that more than 25 percent of the electorate would consider voting for Mr. Perot for President, Mr. Sifry said, someone ought to pay attention.
"He and the movement," Mr. Sifry said, "ought to be covered as more than a sideshow or a freak show."

HEADLINE: Not Red, but Still a Bear;
Russia, No Longer an Ideological Enemy, Remains a Power With Its Own Interests

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The tension between the United States and Russia over the war in Bosnia and Russia's spying in Washington has raised the question in the minds of many: Just what is the relationship between America and Russia today? Allies? Not exactly. Enemies? Not really. Acquaintances? That's not it either.
Across Washington last week, officials, diplomats and lawmakers struggled with that question as Russia has engaged in more and more behavior that seems hostile to American interests. 
 At stake in the answer is everything from $4 billion in American aid to NATO's willingness to accept Moscow into the alliance one day.
 
Optimism Seems to Be Waning
 About all that is clear now is that the optimistic post-cold-war consensus in Washington about a "partnership" between Russia and the United States seems to be crumbling.
Even one of the leading advocates of American assistance to Russia, Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, declared today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press": "We have to get over the idea that this is a partnership. This is a tough rivalry, and that is an important distinction to make."
The confusion over America's relationship with Russia grows out of the false assumption that the United States had only one conflict with Moscow during the cold war: the ideological struggle between democracy and Communism.
That was the struggle that received all the attention. But there was another, less obvious conflict, which existed before Russia became Communist in 1917 and still exists today: the natural competition between states -- competition for raw materials, economic wealth and security. With Russia occupying one-seventh of the world's land mass and being the home of 150 million people, it will always be a voracious competitor for resources, whether it is led by a Jefferson or a Yeltsin.
That is why Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1835 that history and geography would always make the Russian-American relationship complex: "There are now two great nations in the world which, starting from different points, seem to be advancing toward the same goal: the Russians and the Anglo-Americans."
"America's conquests are made with plowshares, Russia's with the sword," he wrote. "Their point of departure is different and their paths diverse; nevertheless, each seems called by some secret desire of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world."
The nature of the rivalry in the immediate future will depend a great deal on how Russia defines itself. Will Russia define itself as a democracy like Britain or France, and therefore limit its competition with the United States to the economic sphere? Or will it define itself differently?
 
Russia's Three Transitions
 That definition, said Daniel Yergin, an economic historian, will depend on the outcome of three transitions under way in Russia: a transition from Communist dictatorship to democracy, from a planned economy to a free market and from an empire to a nation-state.
All three of these transitions are incomplete, and none is assured of a happy ending -- as events like the release in Moscow on Saturday of hard-liners who plotted the overthrow of President Boris N. Yeltsin only underscore.
"Until two and half months ago," Mr. Yergin said, "there was a complacency in the United States that everything was settled and behind us, and that while Russia was interesting, at times confusing, it didn't really matter much -- it was on autopilot.
"But that American consensus has broken down, and it is now in need of rethinking and re-articulation."
Understanding that Russia is still up for grabs, President Clinton, has begun to try to build a new consensus about relations with Moscow, based on a more hard-headed reading of politics there.
At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Clinton said: "What I think is naive is the suggestion that we should have ever believed for a moment that every event in Russia and every speech made by every Russian politician in every election of every member of Parliament would somehow be in a constant straight line toward a goal that we wanted to predetermine. This is not black and white; this is gray."
 
Helping the Reformers
 Mr. Clinton argued that the United States should continue giving aid to Russia to increase the likelihood that the liberal reformers there would win and therefore be the ones to define the America-Russia relationship.
"It is in our national interests to continue working with Russia, to lower the nuclear threshold, to support the development of Russia as a peaceful democracy," Mr. Clinton said. Virtually all American foreign aid to Russia, he said, goes to grass-roots projects to privatize state-owned businesses and toward building democratic institutions, dismantling nuclear missiles and helping a market economy to take hold in individual cities.
That is precisely the sort of aid that should be continued, he indicated, no matter what happens in Moscow.
But as logical as that view may be, it will not be easy to sustain if the drift toward nationalism, Pan-Slavism and populist economics continues apace in Moscow, or if more Russian spies are uncovered at the C.I.A.
For instance, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, told reporters on Friday that he agreed that the spying incident involving Aldrich H. Ames should not alone lead to a cutoff of Russian aid. But he added that he and some of his colleagues felt that given what is now happening in the relationship, "Russia aid, at least as it's currently constructed, is in some trouble looking to next year's appropriations bill."
 
Avoiding the Extremes
 That is the kind of drift in sentiment that President Clinton now finds himself fighting. But the question for Mr. Clinton is how understanding he can afford to be of Moscow as Russia goes through the painful process of defining itself as a state.
On one hand, he does not want to drive Moscow to extremes by being too tough, say, by expelling all Russian intelligence agents from Washington. On the other hand, being too tolerant, as he may have been when Russia intervened this month in Sarajevo on behalf of the Serbs, can encourage the worst instincts in Moscow.
President Clinton might be having an easier time selling a gray Russia policy to a public accustomed to decades of black and white if he and his predecessor, George Bush, had been more frank from the beginning about the brutal nature of the competition between Moscow and Washington.
"In 1992, Bush was trying to inflate his accomplishments by overselling to the American public what the end of the cold war meant," said Michael R. Beschloss, a historian of the cold war. "There was little emphasis on the primal forces still at work in Russian politics or the long history it would have to overcome to achieve democracy."
As for President Clinton, he wanted to persuade an American public that was turning inward after the cold war to support more financial aid to Russia, to help the reformers there triumph.
But in fairness to both Presidents, the American people, weary of 40 years of cold war, deeply wanted to believe that with the fall of Communism, the struggle with Russia was over -- that Russia had gone through therapy and was now a new, different, American-like nation.
Those days of illusion are over.

HEADLINE: Business Backs Weicker On Reduction of Taxes

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Business leaders and municipal officials came to the Capitol this week to say they support Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s call for the state to reduce local property taxes, but they disagreed over which taxpayers should benefit.
In a meeting with Mr. Weicker and in testimony before the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, business leaders supported his proposal to eliminate the personal-property tax, which towns and cities assess on motor vehicles and business equipment. 
 Businesses pay as much as two-thirds of the $700 million a year raised by the tax.
Mayors and first selectmen, however, urged the committee to focus on property-tax relief for homeowners. While eliminating the personal-property tax on cars would save most families a few hundred dollars a year, they said, the real-property tax on their homes costs them thousands of dollars, with no regard to income.
 
A Means to Competitiveness
 Mr. Weicker is promoting his property-tax relief plan as a way to make Connecticut more competitive and to stimulate its economy. The plan would begin by relieving businesses of the property tax on their computers and other data-processing equipment, at a cost of $56 million.
As employment grows, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark told the finance committee today at a hearing, more people will pay taxes and so the overall tax burden will lessen.
"While business appears to be the immediate beneficiary of this proposal, the inevitable consequence is a fairer tax burden on everyone," she said.
 
Reaching the Limit
 But the municipal officials said that in many communities, residents were reaching the limit of what they can pay, especially as the increase in housing values over the last decade has shifted the property-tax burden toward homeowners, from business and industry.
In East Hartford, for example, homeowners could see their taxes increase as much as 40 percent because of a reassessment in 1993, even though Pratt & Whitney Aircraft makes up more than one-quarter of the town's tax roll.
In cities, property-tax rates have soared so high that they are forcing out the middle class, leaving behind a population that cannot pay the taxes, said John DeStefano, the Mayor of New Haven.
"As we increase the tax rate, our tax collections are going down," he said.
 
No 'Line in the Sand'
 Lieutenant Governor Groark and Mr. Weicker's budget chief, William J. Cibes, both assured the finance committee that "no line has been drawn in the sand" over details of a plan that the Governor could support -- beyond his insistence on providing relief to businesses.
Legislators, for example, could take the $300 million that eliminating the tax on vehicles would cost and use it to help homeowners, Mr. Cibes said.
But that amount, Mr. Cibes also warned, would not greatly reduce homeowners' taxes, compared with erasing the entire tax on their cars. And, he said, Mr. Weicker's plan held a small windfall for towns and cities: while many collect less than 90 percent of the taxes they levy on vehicles, the state would reimburse them for the full amount, thus increasing their actual revenue.
 
Opposition Expected
 Mr. Weicker's plan faces significant opposition, in part because it favors business, in part because it requires towns and cities to give up a tax they now have control over and then to depend on the state's promise to reimburse them.
In drafting a plan to phase in the elimination of the personal property tax over 10 years, Mr. Cibes relied on projected surpluses of revenue in those years to finance the reimbursements to municipalities.
"Where will the money come from?" asked Representative Robert A. Maddox Jr., a Republican from Bethlehem, citing other grants that the state promised to make but then paid only in part. "It will be there to start with, and then it will vanish."
A member of one coalition of community groups that was formed in 1991 to support Mr. Weicker in his fight for a personal income tax today testified against his property-tax plan, saying it does not provide enough relief for individuals.
A major effect of the income tax, combined with business tax cuts Mr. Weicker also urged for his strategy to help the state's economy, was to shift hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from businesses to individuals.
 
No Bank for the Family?
 "On the opening day of the legislative session, we heard that the state has become a 'bank' for businesses," said Suzanne Haviland, executive director of the coalition, the Taxpayers Alliance to Serve Connecticut. "But when is the state going to become a bank for the average family? By 1998, we will have given out more than $500 million in corporate tax cuts, tax breaks and more."
Legislators have submitted several alternatives to Mr. Weicker's plan. Most use what are known as circuit-breakers, to set a ceiling on how much property tax a person would pay.
One bill proposed by Senator Martin M. Looney, a Democrat from New Haven, would allow homeowners to subtract from their state income-tax payment any tax on their home exceeding 5 percent of their income. The property-tax ceiling for a couple earning $40,000, then, would be $2,000,
A second bill would limit taxes on a house to 2 percent of its fair-market value. If that same couple's house was worth $100,000, the tax ceiling on it would again be $2,000.
Other bills would allow individuals to subtract anywhere from 20 percent to 100 percent of their property taxes from their income-tax payments. And one bill proposed by Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford and a co-chairman of the finance committee, would raise $300 million for property-tax relief by raising the top income-tax rate to 6 percent, from the current 4.5 percent.
"An encouraging note," Mr. Mulready reassured the mayors today, "is that we're talking about how to do something, not whether to do something."

HEADLINE: Highest U.S. Rights Official Meets With Leading Chinese Dissident

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The State Department's top human rights official met privately today with China's most prominent dissident in the first such encounter with a Clinton Administration official since the dissident was freed last year after serving 14 1/2 years in prison for advocating democracy.
The official, John Shattuck, an Assistant Secretary of State, agreed to take a message from the dissident, Wei Jingsheng, to President Clinton urging him to maintain economic pressure on Beijing as the best way to win the release of political prisoners. 
 An associate of Mr. Wei's described the meeting in a telephone call, but the United States Embassy had no comment on it. The Chinese authorities have warned Mr. Wei several times that he will be rearrested if he persists in his campaign for human rights and democracy.
Mr. Wei's associate said Mr. Shattuck had requested the meeting to solicit opinions about the condition of political prisoners, the strength of the democracy movement and how the Administration could best exert its influence on China to improve its human rights record. The associate quoted Mr. Shattuck as saying he had taken "strength" from the meeting with Mr. Wei, a former electrician at the Beijing Zoo, who by virtue of his unbending will during years in prison, has emerged as the potential leader of a new democracy movement in China.
Separately today, China acknowledged that the human rights situation in the country "is not completely satisfactory," but in a long commentary carried by the official New China News Agency, Beijing lashed out at the United States for setting itself up as a moral arbiter in the world at a time when crime, drug-related violence and discrimination are "infringing on the human rights of the American people."
Mr. Shattuck is in Beijing for what are expected to be tough negotiations on the "overall, significant progress" in human rights that Mr. Clinton is demanding as a condition for annual renewal of the low-tariff privileges under which China exports tens of billions of dollars of goods to the United States.
Chinese officials are increasingly frustrated by the unwillingness of the Administration to define what it means by significant progress in the categories it has identified, like releasing political and religious prisoners and safeguarding Tibet's cultural heritage.
Former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who met with Chinese officials last week, said in an interview here that the Chinese were afraid that Mr. Clinton, in demanding results, would "move the goal posts" as soon as the Chinese acted in those areas. Mr. Eagleburger also implied that some American diplomats were becoming frustrated at the President's not defining what he means by progress.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Increase 7.8%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools rose 7.8 percent in January, continuing the upward trend seen in 1993, an industry trade group said today.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, based in McLean, Va., said orders for machine tools totaled $356.05 million in January, up from a revised $330.35 million in December. The January orders were more than double the $175.55 million of January 1993. 
 "January orders signal continued reinvestment by the U.S. in manufacturing, which is essential to our long-term economic health," the association's president, Albert W. Moore, said.
Orders for machine tools, which are considered an indicator of future economic activity, ended 1993 at a five-year high and are forecast to increase in 1994 and 1995.
The revival largely stems from renewed strength in manufacturing.

HEADLINE: Dr. Leopold Kohr, 84; Backed Smaller States

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Leopold Kohr, an Austrian philosopher and economist who argued that "small is beautiful," died Saturday in Gloucester, England, where he had lived for about a decade, said his biographer, Gerald Lehner. Professor Kohr was 84.
No cause of death was given. 
 Dr. Kohr, who used the pseudonym Hans Kohr, is best known for his studies of national economies, which led him to favor small countries and oppose broad unification projects like the European Union.
The phrase "small is beautiful" is generally associated with the late German economist Fritz Schumacher, who lived in Britain and published a book with that title in the 1970's. But Mr. Schumacher said Dr. Kohr had been his teacher, Mr. Lehner said.
In the mid-1960's, a group of Dr. Kohr's supporters raised money to try to test his theories on Anguilla, a Caribbean island that had declared its independence from Britain. But the project was not supported by the residents.
Leopold Kohr was born in Oberndorf and studied law in Austria and political theory at the London School of Economics. He served as a correspondent in the Spanish Civil War and left Austria in 1938 when it was annexed by Nazi Germany. He taught economics at Rutgers University in New Jersey in the 1940's and 50's.

HEADLINE: Regulators Mute Their Fears Over Derivatives

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The nation's top financial regulators are having fewer nightmares about a potential crisis from the explosive growth of a new category of financial transactions known as derivatives.
At a three-day conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which ended on Saturday, about 100 Government officials, academics and financial executives agreed that the complex web of new derivatives transactions, which have a face value of more than $7 trillion, is forcing changes in everything from accounting standards to the training of bank regulators. 
 Gone, though, were the concerns that have plagued some regulators -- that derivatives were making the financial system more vulnerable to a worldwide market meltdown.
In the keynote speech, a Federal Reserve governor, Susan M. Phillips, challenged "the persistence of what appears to be exaggerated fears of the risk of derivatives activities."
"I have concluded," Ms. Phillips said, "that the concerns that have been expressed about derivatives by legislators, regulators, and even senior executives of financial institutions can best be understood as symptoms of broader anxieties about changes in financial markets."
 
Just What Are Derivatives?
 Derivatives are financial agreements whose value varies in relation to -- derives from -- the performance of a financial market. They are in effect side bets, payable in cash, that interest rates, currencies, commodities or stocks will move in a certain direction. For example, a company that buys oil could protect itself from price increases with an option that would pay the company if oil prices rose.
Clifford W. Smith Jr., a finance professor at the University of Rochester, more directly challenged the skeptics and doomsayers on derivatives. "It's hard to get people to get precise about what they mean by systemic risk," he said, alluding to the meltdown fears. "It's clear it's big and sometimes scary, but after that they get fuzzy."
Mr. Smith's comments angered William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who had just given a speech that mixed strong support for the growth of derivatives with caution about the potential for their misuse. Mr. McDonough responded that it is the role of a central bank to worry about a possible catastrophe.
Nonetheless, in his speech, Mr. McDonough conceded that regulators' admonitions "have a nagging quality because we have not specified a concrete approach to controlling and managing this risk."
In general, regulators spoke highly of the ability of banks and brokers that deal in derivatives to manage the risks they present. Indeed, Ms. Phillips said the theories and computer systems developed to manage risk in derivatives are improving their other businesses.
The potential for losses from derivatives is, in general, far less than the risks of lending, argued Lewis W. Teel, the BankAmerica Corporation executive in charge of controlling trading risk. "The loan guys in my bank have found a way to lose $7 billion over the last few years lending to developing countries and real estate developers, and they tell me they are credit-risk experts," he said.
A number of participants said the biggest potential problem today is among corporations that use derivatives, most of which have not developed risk-management systems as sophisticated as those used by the major dealers. Recently, the huge German mining conglomerate Metallgesellschaft A.G. lost hundreds of millions of dollars through mistakes in using oil derivatives to hedge part of its refining business.
"We are going to have a U.S. version of Metallgesellschaft," Mr. Teel said, "when a user will blow $1 billion."
 
Call for a Clearinghouse
 Many speakers said that the potential effects of such a major failure could be reduced by the creation of a clearinghouse modeled after those run by the futures exchanges that would guarantee derivatives contracts. Currently, most derivatives are private agreements between two parties, subjecting each to the potential default of the other.
While such an arrangement would be difficult for the more complex derivatives, "we should migrate the plain vanilla stuff to an exchange as quickly as possible," said Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of the American International Group, the big insurance company that earns 20 percent of its profits from derivatives dealing.

HEADLINE: Bigger Role For Intuition Seen at Fed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, having dropped its reliance on the money supply figures that made markets soar or swoon in the 1980's, is increasingly basing interest rate decisions on an approach best summed up as banker's intuition.
When Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, gave his semiannual testimony before Congress on Tuesday, the only section of his written testimony that he did not bother to read aloud concerned money supply measures like the M-2, which represents the total of cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit of less than $100,000 and several other financial instruments. 
 In a series of interviews last week, top Fed officials said they were putting greater weight on economic indicators ranging from the price of gold and the output of factories to personal anecdotes. They are also paying more attention to human psychology: notably investors' expectations of inflation, an area that has long exasperated economists who use computer models to predict inflation.
 
 
Data With an Attitude
 "I get a feel for what I think is going on based on the information -- not only the anecdotal information in the press and the statistical information assembled and compiled by the staff here, but also from the general tone of the markets," said John P. LaWare, a Fed governor, who added that he also looked at figures on housing starts, employment and bank loans. "I'm probably least sensitive to the money figures because I don't know what they mean anymore."
In looking at so many economic indications at the same time, Fed officials in effect rely on educated hunches of what they should do, rather than following the dictates of computer models or a couple of key indicators.
"Policy has become more intuitive over the last year," David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company of New York, said today.
The main reason has to do with the discrepancy between what happens with the money supply and what happens in the economy. That is partly a result of the enormous growth of mutual funds, which are left out of the main money supply measures.
"I came on believing what I had been taught -- and taught as a professor -- which was M-2," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor and former Harvard economics professor. "I don't think I can use it anymore."
In place of money supply figures, he said, "we look at a whole raft of variables -- we ignore nothing and focus on nothing."
To be sure, Fed officials are not flying the economy by the seat of their pants. Like many private economists, some Fed officials start with computer models that assume that various indicators will signal inflation with the same lags as in the past. For example, higher inflation rates have tended to follow increases in the money supply.
But having concluded that such historical patterns are not always valid, Fed officials are revising computer models to fit their assumptions about how the economy works now. They then run the new models to see how the changes affect the models' predictions of future inflation.
Such an approach may seem very orderly. But it all depends on the Fed official's guess of how past statistical relationships have changed, a guess that is based on a lifetime of experience.
 
Monetarists Object
 Many monetarist economists in academia believe that money supply figures remain valuable. They criticize Mr. Greenspan for focusing on a succession of economic indicators in public testimony.
"It's a very dangerous game to play, to drag out whatever indicator is pointing in the right direction," said William Poole, a monetarist at Brown University often cited as a possible future Republican nominee to the Fed.
But Mr. Greenspan appears unmoved. The Fed's monetary policy committee "will continue to monitor the behavior of money supply measures for evidence about underlying economic and financial developments more generally, but it will still have to base its assessments regarding appropriate policy actions on a wide variety of economic indicators," according to Mr. Greenspan's written, but unread, testimony on Tuesday.
The most important consideration for the Fed these days appears to be investors' expectations of inflation, which are reflected to some extent in long-term interest rates and commodity prices.
 
 
The Degree of Slack
 Short-term changes in prices may depend on how much slack is available in the economy to accommodate surges in demand, but over the longer haul, "the rate of price change depends crucially on price expectations, and not on the degree of slack," Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Jan. 31.
Long-term interest rates tend to vary with these expectations. And the success of the Fed's interest rate policy, Mr. Greenspan said on Tuesday, should be judged by whether it holds down these long-term rates. The Fed has no direct control over long-term rates but does control short-term rates. In theory, it can pull down long-term rates by pushing up short-term rates.
The Fed pushed up rates for overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a percentage point on Feb. 4. Long-term rates, however, have risen by more than a third of a percentage point since then. This has surprised and dismayed Fed officials. "I had thought that a move by us at that time would be more likely to stabilize or maybe even bring down the long-term rate," Mr. LaWare said.
Mr. Greenspan said on Thursday that the rise in long-term rates did not reflect the Fed's move on short-term rates. Instead, he said, long-term rates rose because of subsequent economic reports that investors misinterpreted as signs that the strong economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year would continue this year and rekindle inflation.
 
 
Gold and Commodity Prices
 Many Wall Street analysts say the Fed now focuses overwhelmingly on prices for gold and other commodities in setting short-term interest rates. Mr. Greenspan seemed to lend strong support for this view on Tuesday, when he told the House Banking Committee that gold prices were "a very good indicator" of future inflation.
But other senior Fed officials say they see little use for gold as an indicator of inflation. "If that's what the chairman believes, that's fine -- it's not my view that gold forms a key or central variable," Mr. Lindsey said.
Mr. Greenspan played down the importance of commodities before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
Susan M. Phillips, another Fed governor and a former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is widely assumed to follow commodity prices closely. But she said she had actually paid less attention to these prices since her appointment in December 1991, although she still described them as important.


GRAPHIC: Here are the economic indicators that the Federal Reserve is now watching in determining when to raise short-term interest rates to fight inflation. Some of the best-known variables and intellectual influences from recent years have fallen out of favor. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, cited most of these variables in his testimony before a House Banking Committee panel last week.
 
WHAT'S IN
 
Expected inflation, especially as reflected in long term interest rates and commodity prices. Nororiously difficult to measure, expectations of inflation are nonetheless Mr. Greenspan's top target. He tried on Tuesday to talk down these expectations, and long-term bonds with them.
 
Gold prices. When they rise, people may be losing faith in the currency and moving into tangible assets.
 
Capacity utilization. If factories are already operating at full speed, raising output could feed inflation.
 
Real short-term interest rates. Subtract inflation from the interest rate to find the real rate. But the Fed now thinks that Government figures may overstate inflation.
 
Unit labor costs. If wages rise faster than productivity, then these costs increase, feeding inflation.
 
Figures on bank lending and other credit figures.
 
WHAT'S OUT
 
Various categories of the money supply, like the amount of money Americans hold in cash and checking accounts.
 
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank survey of prices paid by manufacturers for suplies. The Fed thinks it predicts economic activity and new orders, not inflation.
 
The consumer price index. Because data are only available with a lag of nearly three weeks, the index provides too little information about future inflation.

HEADLINE: A Push for Surveillance Software

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
In the age of computer communications and digital telephone calls, the American people must be willing to give up a degree of personal privacy in exchange for safety and security, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.
In an interview on Friday, Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, defended proposed legislation that critics say would turn the nation's telephone network into a vast surveillance system. He said taxpayers would be asked to pay up to half a billion dollars to develop and deploy the necessary network software. 
 The Administration wants to impose new technology that would enable law-enforcement agents to gather a wealth of personal information by monitoring citizens' calling patterns and credit card transactions over the telephone network -- and over the two-way cable television networks being planned by cable and phone companies. The system would go well beyond current wiretapping technology, because much of the information could be gleaned without the police or F.B.I. actually having to eavesdrop on specific voice or electronic-mail conversations.
"The costs are high, but you have to do a cost-benefit analysis," said Mr. Freeh, who insisted that fighting terrorists and criminals was the Government's intention -- not playing Big Brother to the citizenry.
 
'A Credible Solution'
 "The damage to the World Trade tower and the economic interests of the country are conservatively estimated at $5 billion," he said, citing last year's bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. "I think the American people will agree that this is a credible solution to the problem we face."
The Administration is trying to line up Congressional support for the legislation, called the Digital Telephony and Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994, before having it formally introduced.
Government officials say traditional wiretapping is becoming increasingly difficult because more and more phone calls and data communications are transmitted as streams of digital information -- representing the ones and zeros understood by computers. Thousands of such calls may intermingle on a public-network circuit at any moment. Proponents of the legislation say new software placed on computerized network switching equipment is necessary to help law enforcement sort through this traffic.
But executives of McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's biggest cellular telephone company, told Mr. Freeh and White House officials at a meeting on Thursday that their newest telephone switches already provide the surveillance capabilities requested in the legislation.
Moreover, privacy advocates say the Government can point to no case in which digital network technology alone has impeded an investigation. And they note that in the World Trade Center case, it was not electronic communications but mundane bungling of vehicle and warehouse rentals that led to arrests.
 
An Electronic Portrait
 Such critics have long warned that in the information age, it is possible to build a detailed model of an individual's behavior, political and sexual preferences, social network and travel itineraries simply by examining telephone-calling patterns and credit card purchases.
Some capabilities were demonstrated when law-enforcement agents pieced together a chronological list of phone calls made by the people accused of plotting and carrying out the attack in January on the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. But the type of software the Clinton Administration wants to add to the public communications network would make possible much more detailed records of individuals' electronic activities.
"It will be possible to develop a life-size portrait about you as a person," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a Washington privacy-rights lobbying group. "This is not just about a phone number."
For the Administration, having taxpayers rather than communications companies pay for the system is meant to dilute industry criticism of the plan, which has met resistance since it was disclosed a few weeks ago. Congressional support is difficult to gauge.
"The bill has some significant problems we need to resolve," said Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights. "The profiling and the tracking aspect of the bill is something we are concerned about."
A version of the legislation was first proposed in 1991 by the Bush Administration at the urging of the Justice Department. But unlike that version, the new bill would limit the surveillance to public networks and not include company phone systems -- private branch exchanges, or PBX's -- or private corporate computer networks.
Despite those changes, civil liberties groups and some industry executives say they are concerned that the scope of the new bill would give law- enforcement agencies new access to a vast amount of "transactional," or billing, information related to the setup of a telephone call.
Under current law, obtaining a subpoena to obtain transactional data from the telephone company is easier than getting a wiretap warrant to eavesdrop on actual conversations, which requires a judge to find probable cause that a crime has taken place.
Mr. Freeh met with telephone industry executives at the White House on Thursday and with Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill on Friday in an effort to attract support for the bill. He said in the interview that he was willing to compromise by adding safeguards for transactional information.
"I understand the privacy concern," he said. "My real objective is to get access to the content of telephone calls. With respect to the extraordinary amount of personal information that is generated by this new technology, we would consider some way to block some of that information or raise the standard required to gain access. We're flexible on that."
The F.B.I. Director said new digital communications technologies were making it more difficult for authorities to listen to conversations of suspected criminals who may be using cellular telephones or whose conversations may be carried as data streams in networks of fiber optic cables.
Mr. Freeh said wiretapping had long been one of law enforcement's most effective tools. He cited examples in which it had been used effectively to prevent crimes, including a case in Chicago in which a terrorist was planning to shoot down an airliner with a Stinger missile.
In that instance, Mr. Freeh said, the telephone networks involved were not advanced digital systems, but older analog networks that send voices as electronic patterns mimicking natural sound waves.
But he said there had already been hundreds of cases in which attempted F.B.I. wiretaps had been thwarted by new digital communications technology -- not, he said, because the suspected criminals were necessarily trying to evade detection, but simply because the public-network technology made it difficult for agents to listen.
Last year, a group called the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility obtained Government documents through a Freedom of Information request indicating that an informal survey of F.B.I. offices in Newark, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, Nev., found no instances in recent years in which F.B.I. agents had encountered any technology-based problems in conducting wiretaps.
Asked about those findings, Mr. Freeh said he was not aware of them.
Several telephone industry executives who met with Mr. Freeh at the White House last week said that they were skeptical whether new legislation was needed and that they were concerned about provisions that would fine telephone companies up to $10,000 a day for failing to comply with the new law.
"This is just new faces giving the same pitch," said one telephone industry vice president who attended the meeting and who had been opposed to the Bush Administration's version of the legislation. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
Executives at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said they did not believe there were significant technological problems that warranted new legislation. They also said they feared that the proposed legislation would undercut the privacy expected by customers.
"Clearly the privacy concern is the biggest concern for A.T.& T.," a spokesman for the company, Herb Linnen, said. He said the company would continue to meet with the White House and Justice Department in an effort to narrow the bill. Industry executives and privacy advocates have also warned about abuses of new surveillance technologies by telephone company insiders and computer vandals.
But the F.B.I. Director said the protections in current analog telephone systems would be adequate to deter most break-ins.
"This is always a threat," Mr. Freeh said. "But it's de minimus if you consider the alternative, which is not giving law-enforcement and intelligence agencies these capabilities."
A White House official said that he believed opponents of the legislation were overreacting and that the law was a good compromise between privacy and law-enforcement needs.
"The authority to gather transactional information already exists; I don't think this expands that authority," said John Podesta, the White House staff secretary. "We're open to talking through the issue with the privacy community."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
For Giuliani, the Message Is Making It on Your Own

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Speaking at a junior high school in the bleak streets of Brownsville recently, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave a conservative twist to the words of John F. Kennedy to preach self-reliance to the students. They should, he said to an audience of black and Hispanic teen-agers, ask "not what somebody else can do for you but what you can do for yourselves."
And ever since that Brooklyn school visit, Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly used a naive question asked by one girl to build a morality tale of how students have unrealistic expectations of what government can, in fact, do for them. She had asked why there couldn't be scholarships granted irrespective of grades to allow people like her to go away to college. 
 "I thought it would be kind of useful, rather than kind of pandering to her, to get her ready for life," Mr. Giuliani said on WLIB, the black-oriented radio station. "She was a teen-ager already and I said, you know, that other people won't pay for you. I couldn't afford to go away to college when I was your age. I wanted to go away to college. My family couldn't afford it. So I went to college in New York City. I commuted and got a very good education." The Mayor then added that she could go to the City University.
Day after day, as he takes charge of the city and roams the radio dial, Mr. Giuliani has been spelling out his conservative social philosophy, political values and Horatio Alger belief in making it on your own in a harsh world and without a helping hand from government. "Government has a role," he says, but a far less expansive one than has been the norm in New York City.
 
Signature Issues
 Some of these views were clear in the mayoral race when Mr. Giuliani spoke of energizing the private sector and inveighed against crime and the "disorder that is driving this city down."
But once past his signature issues of crime and the economy, Mr. Giuliani was often unrevealing, with a campaign strategy to avoid mistakes and protect a lead. He highlighted endorsements from Democrats and Liberals to soften his Republicanism and ran biographical campaign commercials presenting him as a warm family man.
His one major foray into social policy -- a position paper on the homeless -- brought an outcry by advocacy groups with its call for a 90-day limit on shelter stays for all but the chronically homeless. The controversy forced Mr. Giuliani to be on the defensive, left explaining that he meant the time limit as a spur to government to find better solutions.
Two months into his mayoralty, Mr. Giuliani's reticence is gone. To the contrary, he seems to relish the chance to argue daily with the city's traditional liberal orthodoxy, often waxing his most adamantly conservative when being questioned by openly skeptical commentators on black-oriented radio programs.
 
'A Little Bit Beyond'
 Washing dishes 12 hours a day in a restaurant is "an honorable, decent, terrific thing to do," the Mayor says, and suggests that the squeegee men who wash windshields instead of holding a restaurant job are trying to avoid paying taxes. Of the high unemployment rate for youth, he says "there are also jobs that don't get filled at the same time there's unemployment, so you push yourself a little hard, and you push yourself a little bit beyond, you're going to find a job." Illegal aliens, he has noted, find jobs.
And speaking of the student who wanted government to provide scholarships not tied to grades, Mr. Giuliani said, "you've got to talk to that young lady about realism, not fantasy dreams, because one of the things government does, we can realistically help, we can't provide fantasies."
Philosophically, Mr. Giuliani's views resemble the neo-conservative critique of the welfare state as fostering dependency -- a philosophy embraced by the Reagan Administration, in which Mr. Giuliani served before becoming United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
 
Help-Wanted Ads
 Democrats, too, starting with President Clinton and his pledge to "end welfare as we know it," inveigh against welfare these days. But there can be a sense of time warp to Mr. Giuliani's comments as if Washington's debate of a decade ago has now come to New York. "In fact, there was just an article in one of the papers on how there were more jobs available in certain areas than people who want to fill them," Mr. Giuliani said last week in an uncanny echo of President Ronald Reagan when he was asked about black unemployment in 1982 and pointed to the help-wanted ads in The Washington Post.
"I made it a point to count the pages of help-wanted ads," Mr. Reagan said at the time. "In this time of great unemployment there were 24 full pages of classified ads of employers looking for employees. What we need is to make more people qualified to go and apply for those jobs."
Those who know Mr. Giuliani call his views long held and heartfelt. And in politics, social policy is often born out of personal experience. When Mayor David N. Dinkins was pushing for a civilian complaint review board to oversee police conduct, he recalled that as a law student managing his father-in-law's liquor store, he was berated as a "nigger" by a police officer in upper Manhattan when he parked his car briefly in a bus stop after midnight to see his father-in-law at a nearby restaurant and assure him that he had deposited the night's receipts.
 
'I've Washed Dishes'
 Mr. Giuliani often harks back to his youth as he delivers his exhortations toward self-reliance. He repeatedly uses his life as the son of a middle-class tavern owner in the Long Island suburbs as a model for the down and out of the inner city, with no sense of dissonance in the comparisons. "I've washed dishes in restaurants," Mr. Giuliani explained in reference to his work in his father's taverns as he said squeegee men should find restaurant jobs.
"I wanted to go away to college and I couldn't afford it, so I went to college in New York City -- I commuted," he recalled as he talked about the student's dream to use college as a route to get out of Brooklyn.
"I didn't own my own textbooks -- I had to borrow them," he said recently, discussing current conditions in city schools.
Democrats concede that Mr. Giuliani is on popular political ground with such aphorisms, but say he is ignoring the harsher realities facing today's young people in the city. "Should we be having a continuing public dialogue about, say, 200 younger black men who should not be squeegeeing us?" asked Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate. "Or a dialogue about the army of 20,000 young minorities who want to work but can't find gainful work?"
It is not yet clear how Mr. Giuliani's views will move beyond oratory, and how extensively he plans to redesign social programs. Last week he named Joan Malin, a veteran of the Dinkins administration to run the city department overseeing the homeless shelters -- a department that Mr. Giuliani said during his campaign should be turned over to nonprofit groups. But he also appointed a former Republican-Conservative candidate for mayor, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, to run the agency that administers the city's anti-poverty grants.
Mr. Giuliani's advisers say they are now looking at a variety of initiatives that could be ready in about a month for moving the city's 1.1 million welfare recipients toward work. "To the extent we can change any policy to encourage self-reliance, we'll do it," said one of the Mayor's senior advisers.
In the case of welfare, the adviser said: "You've got to get training and have jobs, but you can't put all the emphasis on training. You get people a job and you've started them off on the right course."
Explaining his governing philosophy, Mr. Giuliani said last week, "Government has a role, and if we're able to achieve all of the reforms that we want to achieve, government will still have a role, an important one."
But he added: "The fact is if you look broadly in New York City, government has always answered the question of should government do it by answering it yes. What government should have done is occasionally answer it yes and more often answer it no."

Giuliani's reticence in confronting liberal politics is gone and he does not hesitate to spell out his conservative social philosophy and political values at stops throughout the city.

HEADLINE: A Wrongheaded Amendment

 BODY:
When the Senate votes tomorrow on a constitutional amendment, proposed by Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, that would require Congress to balance the Federal budget, the outcome will be close. Such an amendment would be a political mistake. It would allow a mere 40 out of 100 senators and a similar minority in the House to block legislation that would create a deficit. And because the amendment includes no enforcement procedure, it would drag courts where they do not belong -- into routine budget disputes.
Fiddling with the Constitution could be defensible if a mighty public purpose were at stake. But Mr. Simon's amendment, and substitute versions also up for voting, would engrave into the Constitution a standard -- zero deficits -- that makes little economic sense. The deficit, as measured by Congress, takes no account of inflation, no account of growth, no account of recession and no account of the value of public investment. 
 Yes, the Federal deficit over the last 15 years has been too high. When the Government spends more than it taxes, it borrows the balance. Borrowing threatens to siphon money away from businesses that would have used it for plants and equipment. When this happens, the private economy is left less productive -- a blow to our children's living standards.
So Federal borrowing must be contained. But at what level? For several reasons the answer is not necessarily zero. Consider the impact of growth. As incomes rise, individuals can afford to carry more debt. At current growth rates, Congress can run deficits of about $200 billion and still keep the debt growing less quickly than incomes. Or consider the impact of inflation. Inflation eats away at the economic value of government bonds that individuals hold. At current rates of inflation, Congress could run a $100 billion deficit without raising the real value of the debt. The upshot is that $200 billion deficits are fiscally prudent.
But the biggest danger lurking in a balanced budget amendment has to do with the way Congress keeps its books. The Federal budget lumps together ordinary spending (for farm subsidies or administrative salaries) and long-term public investment (for mass transit or scientific research). Forced to cut out hundreds of billions from the deficit, Congress will be driven to eliminate big-ticket investments whose payoffs are far into the future and preserve lower-cost giveaways to politically powerful special interests. At risk will be spending on education, training and infrastructure.
The proposed amendment also poses a threat when the economy turns sour. During downturns, tax revenues fall off, sending the budget into deficit. Under the amendment, Congress would be required to cut spending and raise tax rates -- throwing the economy into a steeper tailspin. The only way out is for three-fifths of each house to suspend the amendment -- a vote that would be nearly impossible to achieve until the economy had slipped badly.
Though the 1993 budget law should keep deficits tame for now, they are expected to soar again by the end of the decade. But the villain is almost entirely health care costs. The answer to that is health care reform, not a destructive constitutional straitjacket.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
A New Ball Game

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
"The road to any solution in Bosnia now runs through Moscow." A senior diplomat here thus summed up the dramatically changed landscape faced by Western governments trying to design an end to the Bosnian conflict.
When Russia intervened two weeks ago, offering a hand to the Serbs, it became an essential player in the diplomatic game -- with President Boris Yeltsin personally involved. That sharply limits what the United States and the Europeans can do on their own. But it also offers an urgent opportunity for Russo-American action. 
 An example of the new restraints on the West is the outlook for further NATO air strike threats, like the one that helped move Serbian guns back from Sarajevo. Their purpose might be to end the Serbian shelling of other Bosnian Government enclaves, to reopen the Tuzla airport or to stop military traffic from Serbia and Croatia.
But now that Russia is involved, can such NATO air action be a serious possibility? NATO members are highly unlikely to want to risk an even more dangerous conflict. And threats that will not be carried out are worse than useless.
The irony is that, in the events of the last two weeks, the Serbs have ended up winners. The Bosnian Government hoped that it was finally getting a protective arm from NATO. But the symbolic protection that Russia has extended to the Serbs is more meaningful.
The changed situation most significantly affects the sine qua non of any overall peace settlement achieved by territorial division of Bosnia: getting the Serbs to withdraw from enough of the territory they have seized -- 70 percent of the country -- to make possible a viable if rump Bosnia.
The United States is now trying to broker a cease-fire between the Muslim-dominated Bosnian forces and the Croats -- and a political plan for a Bosnian-Croatian confederation. Those would be important steps if they actually worked -- though one has to be skeptical that they can after such brutality as the Croatian savaging of Muslim civilians in Mostar.
But if the Bosnian-Croatian plan does succeed, there will still be the terrible problem of the Bosnian Government enclaves in the east and west. No Bosnian state would be viable -- or its borders peaceful -- if some of its territory consisted of islands surrounded by hostile Serbian forces.
Diplomats have hoped that Bosnian Serb leaders would give up enough land to link the Government territories. But how can the Serbs be persuaded to do that if Russia is effectively protecting them from Western pressure?
The answer can now probably lie only in agreement between the Yeltsin Government and the West. And "the West" really means the United States, because Bosnia has shown again how dependent the Europeans are on American leadership.
It is a strange situation. Here is a Russian state in desperate economic and political trouble, its President unable to prevent a grant of amnesty to men who tried to overthrow him. Yet that Russia is in a position to help shape -- or block -- any resolution of the Bosnian conflict.
If there is to be a peace that has a chance of holding, Washington and Moscow have to agree broadly on the terms. Then the United States would have to sell them to the Bosnian Government, Russia to the Serbs.
Such a joint demarche is the new opportunity, and it is a serious one. In the past, Russian diplomats have been cooperative and well informed on the Bosnian situation. President Yeltsin's call for a Moscow conference on Bosnia, which has drawn a lukewarm Western response, might in fact have possibilities.
The risk is that domestic political pressure on Mr. Yeltsin -- from the rise of Slav nationalism -- may now make him lean too far toward the Serbs. But President Clinton would have some negotiating leverage to produce a modestly decent result for the Bosnian victims. Sanctions on Serbia are a powerful lever. And after the C.I.A. mole affair and Congressional anger at Russia, Mr. Yeltsin has reasons to want to look cooperative.
But there will be no chance of success unless President Clinton has a firm policy, knows his objectives and is personally committed to them. More of the wavering that marked his past positions on Bosnia -- the confusion between aggressors and victims, the empty postures -- would be fatal. The President faces a classic, difficult challenge in foreign policy. With attention and commitment, he can meet it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Delegates, Alas, Oversimplify Japan;
Tell It to the Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Big Trade Deficit With Japan: Some Think It's No Problem" (front page, Feb. 15) quotes Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology defending the proposition that the Japanese "may be giving American exporters a hard time, but the bilateral deficit is not evidence of it." However, neither you nor he explains why the laws of cause and effect are suspended in United States-Japanese trade relations. 
 Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan is quoted stating that we run trade deficits simply because we consume more than we produce so long as foreigners are willing to finance the transactions. Neither you nor he explains why, during a period of constricting employment and declining living standards, our failure to produce domestically more of what we consume -- thereby employing more of our people -- is not troubling. Nor is our growing dependence on financing by foreigners mentioned.
Mr. Solow noted that he ran a "trade deficit" with his barber without ill effects and that his employer also ran a "trade deficit" with him -- buying his services without selling him anything in exchange -- without harm. This analogy is ludicrous.
Mr. Solow does not throw himself out of work when he goes to someone else to have his hair cut in the way Americans have been thrown out of work in many domestic industries while consumers had their hair cut elsewhere, so to speak. It's a wonder M.I.T. and the University of Michigan aren't driven to importing economists from Germany and Japan.
I am a criminal defense lawyer, not an economist, but I wish to reinject into the discussion what strikes me as self-evident: The lack of decent-paying work for our unskilled and semiskilled work force is a major cause of United States crime and social decay.
The bulk of my clientele falls into the chronically unemployed and the newly laid off or chronically underemployed. The gainfully employed mostly do not commit crimes. The remaining, and growing, portion, who are not securely employed or decently paid need solid factory jobs to work their way out of poverty, and those jobs don't exist anymore. Why? Because they've been moved to Taiwan, Singapore and, yes, Japan.
Now we cannot employ all our people at a living wage, and as a result, our nation is suffering a catastrophic decline in living standards with an unraveling of our social fabric. But your writer would have us believe we needn't worry about our $60 billion loss to Japan this year in unreciprocated trade. Do you think the rest of the country, being out of a job, has so lost its mind as to believe such rubbish?

HEADLINE: MUNICIPAL WORKERS;
Where Giuliani Is Aiming the Knife. . .

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has portrayed New York City's municipal work force as a wasteful, uncontrollable beast that has slowly strangled the economic life of the city.
 Enough! the Mayor declared as he presented his preliminary budget plan in early February, vowing to cut 15,000 jobs over the next year and a half. All that, he insists, without seriously disrupting essential services. (What services are essential remains to be defined.) 
Already, the Mayor has eliminated more than 4,000 positions, largely by not filling openings. By June, he hopes to cut 7,600 more with a severance package of cash and benefits.
 The details of that plan still have to be hammered out in negotiations with the municipal unions, beginning this week. Most of the other job cuts will come through attrition, if everything goes as planned. Otherwise, the Mayor says, layoffs will be needed. STEVEN LEE MYERS
Board of Education -- 88,883 Mr. Giuliani has no direct control, but has proposed a $291 million cut in the city's contribution and pressured the Schools Chancellor to cut nearly 2,500 administrators from the central office.
Police -- 36,824 Mr. Giuliani has proposed no reductions here. He says it would be "crazy" to cut the police force. Fire -- 12,425 No cuts are planned
Sanitation -- 10,937 The Mayor has cut 1,282 positions from Sanitation, and another 250 workers are targets under his severance plan. He says improvements in productivity make the jobs unnecessary.
