HEADLINE: Pataki Pledges 'Bold Steps' And Job Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Six days after pleading with Congress to bail out New York State, Gov. George E. Pataki vowed today to cut at least $3 billion in state spending over the next 18 months, and to start by trimming 5,000 workers through a hiring freeze and early retirements.
 "As we certainly, appropriately, make the case to Washington, we also have to take bold steps right here at home," Mr. Pataki said. "We have to lead by example." 
 For the first time since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, which dealt a severe blow to state finances, Mr. Pataki acknowledged that, as a last resort, he could not rule out laying off employees or postponing tax cuts already enacted. He also declined to rule out tax increases, an extraordinary concession from a Republican who has made tax cuts a signature issue.
State budget officials estimate the state will lose about $9 billion in revenue over the next 18 months because of the attacks.
"We are going to do everything in our power to avoid layoffs, to avoid tax increases," Mr. Pataki said. "As we go forward, we are going to have to look at all the different options. We're going to wait until we have the action plans back from the different state agencies."
Last week, Mr. Pataki asked for $54 billion in federal aid for recovery from the destruction of the trade center, but he got a lukewarm reception from both Republicans and Democrats in Washington. Members of Congress questioned his request for $12 billion to help the city and state make up for lost revenues -- relief that the federal government has not provided in previous disasters -- and for $3 billion for apparently unrelated transportation projects.
On the day that Governor Pataki released his aid request, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that the city would freeze about $1 billion in planned city spending, and impose a hiring freeze.
Aides to the governor said today that New York State also had to demonstrate to Washington that it was absorbing some of the pain on its own, and not asking the federal government to solve the entire problem. Mr. Pataki hinted at that need, himself, saying, "We have to show the rest of the country that we are dealing with the economic and fiscal impacts of this horrible attack here in New York State every single day as we go forward."
In addition to reducing the state work force of about 193,000, the governor said he would refinance the state's $37 billion debt and ask state agencies to cut nonessential spending on things like travel and new equipment.
But the governor said that those actions would save only about $1 billion and that he had called the heads of state agencies to find another $2 billion in savings. He made it clear that the other cost-cutting steps he might take would depend on how much the state could persuade Congress and President Bush to provide.
Speaking at a hastily convened news conference in the Capitol, Mr. Pataki also said he would not agree to a supplemental budget of the sort lawmakers have been discussing for two months, to plug holes left in the spending plan the Legislature approved in August. Legislative leaders put that budget at about $81 billion, while the governor's office contends it is $84 billion.
"I think the idea of a supplemental budget that increases spending is something that, in the light of a $9 billion economic impact, we just couldn't consider," he said.
The governor's announcement came as the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, released new figures that threw into stark relief just how badly the state's treasury had been hit by the trade center attack and an economic recession that was worsening even before Sept. 11.
State officials say that the worst of the fiscal picture probably will not become public until January, when the governor, kicking off a re-election year, is to propose his budget for the 2002-2003 fiscal year.
Mr. McCall characterized the state's fiscal condition as "not positive, and uncertain." Because the economy had already begun to slow down before Sept. 11, and because just five weeks had elapsed since the attack, he said, "it is very difficult to know what kind of impact this disaster is going to have."
Carole E. Stone, the state's budget director, has predicted that New York will lose at least 87,000 jobs, many of them highly paid, because of the collapse of the twin towers. She has projected a drop in income taxes to $2 billion below what was projected this fiscal year and $5.6 billion in the next.
In setting a target of $3 billion in savings, Mr. Pataki and his staff provided few details. The governor said the hiring freeze would apply to all state agencies except those concerned with public safety and health care, but he would not say how much he hoped to shrink the work force through attrition.
He promised to submit an early-retirement bill to the Legislature, but did not provide any specifics. He said he would "eliminate, as of today, all nonessential discretionary spending by state agencies," though he and his aides offered neither examples nor an estimate of the savings. He and his staff also declined to say how much could be saved by refinancing state debt.
Mr. McCall, a Democrat who plans to run against Mr. Pataki next year, dismissed the governor's announcement today as "a very vague plan," noting that the trade center attack followed a long-running budget stalemate between the governor and the Legislature. "This came in the absence of any real budget and financial plan, so we kind of never knew where we were in the first place," he said.
Mr. McCall also said that Mr. Pataki's quick, broad-brush presentation seemed inadequate when compared with the much longer, more detailed news conference Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani held last week to explain his plan for getting New York City through its fiscal year. The mayor "was dealing with the same degree of uncertainty, but he was much more definitive about what the city had to do," Mr. McCall said.
Legislative leaders responded cautiously to the governor's assertion that the state could not afford a supplemental budget, and argued that more should be spent on education and social services provided by private organizations under contract to the state.
"While money is limited, we are in a situation of triage," said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said he agreed that a broad supplemental budget of the kind debated before Sept. 11 was not appropriate. "However," he said, "we must also consider how we can address vital needs in education, assisting not-for profit organizations and, in particular, helping police, fire and other emergency services."

HEADLINE: Schools Closest to Twin Towers Struggle for Continuity 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
As debris and concrete dust from the collapsing World Trade Center rained down around them on Sept. 11, 1,300 students from two small public high schools ran toward the East River, with some vaulting over park benches as teachers chased the stragglers. An aide gave a piggyback ride to a girl in a wheelchair. 
 Helping to lead the escape, Ada Rosario Dolch, principal of the High School for Leadership and Public Service, tried not to think of her younger sister, Wendy Wakeford, who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald in the north tower and is now presumed dead. 
 Leadership and its sister school, the High School of Economics and Finance, were one and a half blocks south of the twin towers, closer to the terrorist attack than any other school in the city. But being so close to the disaster has not seemed to give them any advantage in the help they have received during the five weeks since the attack. 
The schools, which once shared some teachers and programs, have been split into two cramped public school buildings in different parts of Midtown Manhattan, where they are struggling to maintain a precarious sense of community, miles from their home base and the financial district that was a source of internships and support. They can no longer share advanced calculus, history and literature teachers, so they have had to rejigger teaching assignments. Seniors no longer have a college application office. Many extracurricular activities, like sports and theater, are suspended. The students from Economics and Finance start school at 1 p.m. and finish at 6 p.m., when most of their peers are home for dinner.
Meanwhile, the students at both schools have watched the American Stock Exchange, which was next door to them, resume operations -- though exchange employees say it appears to be the only building on the block that is functioning. Still, the students wonder why their turn has not yet come.
Right or wrong, the students say they also feel overshadowed by the attention paid to Stuyvesant High School, perhaps the city's most prestigious and best-known public school. In the wake of the disaster, its 3,000 students were temporarily relocated to Brooklyn but returned to their building, at Chambers and West Streets, a few blocks from the trade center, on Oct. 9. The Stuyvesant students were cheered on by Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who set up a temporary office in their building to reassure everyone that the building was safe.
Jisung Chun, a senior at Economics and Finance, said she was shocked that most people she met did not even realize there were two schools right next to the terrorist attack. "I tell people that I still can't go to my school because of Sept. 11, and they say, 'Oh, you go to Stuyvesant?' " Jisung said. "I don't want people to say that. Stuyvesant is a great school, but this is a great school."
Zulaimy S. Ortiz, a senior at Economics and Finance, talks of a near-silence surrounding their continued exile. "It felt like nobody really cared," she said. 
Stuyvesant is a school with many children of affluent and influential families, including the daughter of United States Senator Charles E. Schumer. The parents at Economics and Finance and Leadership and Public Service are New York's quiet backbone, not its movers and shakers. Zulaimy's mother is a paraprofessional in a public school; her father was recently laid off. Annica Jarrett's mother is a nurse's assistant; her father lives abroad. Hiu-Kien Michael Wong's parents own a Chinese takeout restaurant in the Bronx. Their families live far from the corridors of power.
David Klasfeld, deputy chancellor for operations, said yesterday that the Board of Education was not shortchanging Economics and Finance or Leadership and Public Service. The schools are unique, he said, because they are still within the so-called frozen zone, the radius around the site of the recovery effort where no one is allowed without clearance at police and National Guard checkpoints.
One building was temporarily used as a morgue, and the board itself, he said, has had trouble getting access to evaluate the extent of the damage and begin cleaning up. Mr. Klasfeld said the board would consult parents about what they want to do. "Is this the place that they want to be?" he asked. "These are the kinds of decisions that the school community -- with us -- has to make."
He said that the frozen zone changes from day to day and that board officials thought the schools could be opened in a month. Some people who work in the area say that estimate is overly optimistic. "There are huge trucks coming in and out of here 24 hours a day," said one Wall Street executive. "It's one thing to have adults in a secure building, but another to have 1,000 kids right next to a disaster area, unable to go out, passing military checkpoints every day. It could be a nightmare."
The American Stock Exchange, which had been operating in borrowed space, opened two weeks ago only because it was a White House priority, said Robert J. Rendine, the exchange's senior vice president for communications. 
The students wonder why, instead of doubling up with other schools, they have not been offered a temporary home of their own -- an armory, an empty office building, a warehouse. "I hear about companies donating space for offices, and I want to say, 'Hey buddy, we've got a school here,' " said Harvinder Kaur, another senior at Economics and Finance.
Zulaimy said she and her mother had drafted a letter to Donald J. Trump, asking if he could spare a building, but had been too shy to send it.
But Mr. Klasfeld said that legal requirements for a school -- like bathrooms, space and access -- were not so simple.
Once separated by a footbridge, the sister schools are now separated by several avenues. The 750 students from Economics and Finance, once at 100 Trinity Place, are sharing space at Norman Thomas High School, at 33rd Street and Park Avenue. Another 550 students from Leadership, at 90 Trinity Place, are doubled up with Fashion Industries High School at 24th Street and Eighth Avenue. If they need a counselor to help them apply to college, they must hunt one down in coffee or computer rooms. Some colleges have been kind enough to waive deadlines, said Dr. Patrick W. Burke, principal of Economics and Finance.
The students missed three weeks of school and are worried about falling behind, especially in advanced placement courses. "We need those credits for college," Harvinder said.
Beyond the academic losses, their sense of community has been wounded as well. The small schools attracted enterprising students to the capital of world finance. Hiu-Kien recalls that his internship at Morgan Stanley introduced him to "the best people I ever met."
Zulaimy wanted to go into the hotel business, and through her school, had secured an internship at the Marriott World Trade Hotel. The Marriott was crushed by the falling south tower. "I've been laid off," she said, putting her head in her hands. 
Zulaimy was watching the TV news the other night when she caught a glimpse of her school building through the wreckage of the World Trade Center. "I ran around the apartment screaming and laughing," she said. "My father didn't understand what was wrong with me. I was happy just to see it still standing."
While few of the students have had the heart to look at their damaged buildings, Ms. Dolch, the principal of Leadership, has returned to retrieve purses, wallets and documents. When she first entered, she said, she felt as if time had stopped. Half-eaten breakfasts and newspapers dated Sept. 11 littered the desks. She cleaned up the coffee oozing out of the bottom of the paper cup she had left on her desk. She wants the clock to start ticking again. 
"The truth is, when I walk into the building, I have a great big smile on my face," she said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ANTITERROR BILL; 
House and Senate Leaders Clash on Banking Measure

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN and KURT EICHENWALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
With some bankers and conservative groups alarmed about legislation intended to make it harder for terrorists to move money through the banking system, House and Senate leaders are clashing about whether to include banking controls in the pending terrorism bill.
 Leaders in the Republican-controlled House say broad new rules designed to crack down on domestic and international money laundering should be dealt with separately from a bill that would provide the government with more policing power to combat terrorism. 
 The Senate has passed a single, comprehensive bill. Democratic leaders say they will not take any more action on the overall bill unless it includes tougher banking rules. 
Terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks left a long paper trail of bank accounts, credit cards and money transfers showing that they used the ordinary banking system with little scrutiny. As a result, both sides in the debate say the attacks highlight the need for tougher banking procedures. Money-laundering legislation in the House and Senate would impose similar mandates on banks to scrutinize customers and report suspicious activity. It would also give the Treasury secretary broad powers to track money overseas and to punish foreign governments that fail to help in the crackdown.
But the urgency of fighting terrorism has not entirely overtaken a longstanding debate about whether banks are doing enough to make sure that criminals do not use the international financial system to help commit crimes.
The philosophical differences, people involved in the wrangling said, were revealed in procedural battles because opponents were reluctant to formally oppose any measures viewed as vital to fighting terrorism.
Senate Democrats said the banking controls must be considered as a package with the new terrorism law. Otherwise, Republican opponents will find a way to delay or kill the provisions, said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, whose money-laundering bill was incorporated into the Senate's terrorism bill.
"If the bill is separated," Mr. Levin said, "it could be the death warrant for our anti-money-laundering legislation."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, has repeatedly said there will be no terrorism bill without the money-laundering measures included.
On the House side, Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is majority leader, told reporters today that the House would vote on its own money-laundering bill "no later than tomorrow." Mr. Army continued to reject the Senate strategy of linkage.
"We want to deal with them separately," he said. 
Though the White House backed the Senate bill when it was completed last week, it has taken a largely hands-off position on the tussle between the House and Senate over how to handle the banking rules.
Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said the Bush administration wanted the terrorism package to become law as quickly as possible. If the banking rules get in the way of doing that, Ms. Buchan said, then the administration does not oppose handling them independently.
"If it's possible to move them together quickly, then we'd like to see them together," she said.
"If not, then we'd like to see the counterterrorism bill done quickly" and the banking legislation done shortly thereafter, Ms. Buchan said.
The neutral position, several lawmakers and Congressional aides said, reflects a debate within the administration over how strongly to push the new banking controls. Law enforcement officials, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, have pushed hard for new rules that would allow law enforcement officers to scrutinize bank accounts and have easier access to bank records filed with the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the White House economic adviser, often criticized money-laundering rules as burdensome and ineffective before the Sept. 11 attacks. Since the attacks, Mr. O'Neill has been leading the administration's high-profile campaign to curtail terrorists' access to the financial system.
Mr. Lindsey has continued to oppose some new banking measures as draconian. His office has taken the lead in seeking to work out differences between House and Senate versions of the terrorism bills, Congressional staff members and White House officials said.
Conservative groups and bankers have lobbied against the measures, although their approach has been low key relative to the intensive efforts to kill such legislation in the past.
Some 25 conservative leaders organized by the Center for Freedom and Prosperity sent a letter to President Bush earlier this month urging him to reject the Senate's proposals on money laundering. They called the new rules a back-door effort to eliminate international competition in the financial industry and argued that it gave too much power to the Treasury secretary.
Some banking groups, including the influential Texas Bankers Association, have also pressed House supporters, including Mr. Armey, to strip some of the most contentious provisions from the banking bill, Congressional aides said. 
"Bankers are very uncomfortable with this bill," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant who opposes the new legislation. "It tries to turn banks into spies for the government. But in this environment, most bankers are very shy about saying so."

 Operations and Diplomacy

ANTI-TALIBAN STRATEGY: Sharply intensified airstrikes against Taliban troops near Kabul, and soon, perhaps, at the front with the Northern Alliance, are designed to crack the regime while it is reeling. A1

AGREEMENT WITH PAKISTAN: The United States and Pakistan said they would work to create a broad-based government in Afghanistan that could include some moderate elements of the Taliban. A1

NORTHERN ALLIANCE'S ULTIMATUM: A senior rebel official declared that his group would not accept members of the Taliban in any coalition government in Afghanistan. B3

THE REFUGEE FLOW: Up to 2,000 Afghans are thought to be crossing into Pakistan each day, traveling on smuggler routes and hiding out in homes of earlier arrivals. B1

DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN: American pilots for the first time were freed to choose their own targets. As airstrikes continued, two American bombs badly damaged a Red Cross aid-storage compound near Kabul. B2

AID WORKERS' FRUSTRATION: International relief groups said that bombing was making it nearly impossible to deliver large amounts of food to starving Afghans. B3

The Anthrax Threat

A POWERFUL GRADE: The anthrax bacteria mailed to the Senate majority leader's was in a highly potent form, and the letter bore strong similarities to the one sent to the NBC offices in New York, officials said. A1

TROUBLING RAMIFICATIONS: The discovery of high-grade anthrax spores suggests that somewhere, someone has access to germ weapons with the potential to inflict huge casualties if the right delivery system is used, experts said. A1

CHASING ANTHRAX REPORTS: Another wave of anthrax scares rolled across the country, and the F.B.I. said it had responded to more than 2,300 reports in the past few weeks. B4

MAIL INVESTIGATIONS: In the dozens of anthrax investigations carried out each year, virtually all turn out to be hoaxes. Now, investigators are embarking on what may be a much more daunting task. B4

URGING CALM IN FLORIDA: Gov. Jeb Bush came to South Florida, urging calm in a community that for weeks has been on the verge of panic about exposures to anthrax. B5

STRAINED HEALTH SYSTEM: Doctors are being deluged with calls from frightened citizens demanding to be tested for anthrax, straining the nation's system of health providers and laboratories. B5

NEW YORK'S DOCTORS: With panic spreading about anthrax, doctors in New York are having to diagnose diseases they have only read about, and they are becoming public health educators overnight. B1

TENSION IN ABC INQUIRY: The inspection of ABC News offices in New York was delayed as federal investigators and the police argued over how extensive the survey needed to be to ensure safety. B6

A CHILD WITH ANTHRAX: The ABC employee whose 7-year-old son became the second person in New York confirmed to have anthrax talked about how an office party two weeks ago led to a fearful ordeal. B6

LINKS TO NEW JERSEY: With investigators swarming over Trenton because of anthrax-bearing letters that were postmarked there, New Jersey finds itself at the center of an international terrorism inquiry. B6

THE DRUG DILEMMA: The United States is considering whether to buy cheaper generic versions of the antibiotic Cipro. But the move would carry troubling consequences with it. A1

DRUG PRODUCTION INCREASED: The German company that makes the antibiotic Cipro said that it was tripling production of the drug. B7

ANTHRAX DRUGS: While public attention has focused on the antibiotic Cipro as an anthrax treatment, officials say other drugs are very likely to work as well for less cost. B7

Securing the Nation

CONGRESSIONAL SAFETY: A fleet of police cars barricaded the front of the Capitol, tourists were banned, and many lawmakers sought assurances of security as an anthrax investigation continued. B8

THE SECURITY CHIEF: A week after being chosen to coordinate the homeland security effort, Tom Ridge began accepting media interviews, promising to find ways to help reassure Americans soon. B8

GUARDING AIR TRAFFIC: The nation's air traffic control centers are poorly protected, the president of the controllers' union said, adding that having a tower knocked out would cause dire problems. B8

AIRPORT SECURITY VIOLATIONS: The airport security company that was fined $1.2 million last year for hiring felons to screen passengers at Philadelphia International Airport has committed more violations at other airports, officials said. B8

DEBATE OVER BANKING: House and Senate leaders are clashing about whether to include banking controls in the pending anti-terrorism bill. B9

QUESTIONS FOR BIN LADEN: CNN announced that it had submitted six written questions to Osama bin Laden through a man who claimed to be a representative of Al Qaeda. B9

THE MEDIA WAR: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld became the latest senior administration official to grant an interview to Al Jazeera, the news network based in Qatar, trying to counter propaganda from Osama bin Laden. B9

The Terrorism Inquiry

ATTACKERS' CLOSE CALL: The day after Christmas, two pilots were said to walk away from a stalled training plane that blocked a taxiway at busy Miami International Airport. For the pilots, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, it was a close brush with the law while training for their attack on the World Trade Center. B1

SETBACKS IN BELGIUM: American investigators said that Belgian authorities had denied them access to suspects and evidence in an inquiry into the European network linked to Osama bin Laden. B9

The Aftermath in New York

SURVIVING, BUT TENUOUSLY: Lauren Manning, a Cantor Fitzgerald employee critically burned during the trade center attack, vowed that day to fight to live, for her husband and son's sake. She and a handful of others still cling to life at New York Presbyterian Hospital. A1

THE EMBASSY BOMBERS: Courthouse security will be bolstered for tomorrow's sentencing of the four men convicted in the bombing of American embassies in Africa. B10

SKYSCRAPER REOPENS: One Liberty Plaza, the skyscraper next to the trade center, was the subject of many rumors of collapse and major structural damage. Today's reopening celebration joyously proves the rumors wrong. B10

MANHATTAN TRAVEL LIMITS: City officials raised the possibility that the partial ban on single-occupancy vehicles entering Manhattan might become permanent. B10

THE OTHER DEATHS: As thousands of families who lost someone at the trade center have mourned in the glare of history, thousands more who lost someone to sickness, age or accident have mourned in its shadow. D1

Business

MORE BAILOUTS UNLIKELY: Despite helping airlines and insurers, the Bush administration is refusing calls for emergency aid to other industries hurt by the terror attacks. C1

JOBLESS, WITHOUT AID: The plight of workers displaced in the trade center attack points out an unemployment insurance system that has not kept up with changes in the labor force. C1

The Arts

DRAMA ON THE RADIO: In the shadow of the trade center, WNYC-FM, New York's public radio station, has dealt with journalistic triumph, technical nightmares and financial calamity since the attacks. E1

CATERPILLAR'S EARNINGS MISS WALL STREET'S FORECASTS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Third-quarter earnings at Caterpillar fell 5 percent, missing Wall Street's expectations, as the company, a heavy-equipment maker, coped with higher costs. Caterpillar also forecast a larger-than-expected decrease in full-year profit because of economic uncertainty. Net profit was $205 million, or 59 cents a share, down from $216 million, or 62 cents a share, last year, Caterpillar said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of 62 cents. Third-quarter sales were $5.06 billion, up from $4.78 billion in 2000. The company, based in Peoria, Ill., said it expected profit for the year to be down 10 to 15 percent from 2000, more than the 5 percent to 10 percent forecast earlier.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Transmeta Replaces Chief Executive 

BYLINE:  By Laurie J. Flynn (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 In its second major executive shake-up this year, the Transmeta Corporation, a maker of high-performance semiconductor chips, announced yesterday that it was replacing Mark K. Allen as chief executive. The company said its board chairman, Murray A. Goldman, above, would be the new chief executive, while Hugh Barnes, another board member, would take over as president and chief operating officer, two jobs that have been vacant since Mr. 
Allen became chief executive in March. Several weeks ago Transmeta warned that sales for the third quarter would be lower than expected, as a result of the worsening economy and the slowdown in the chip industry. On Oct. 8, Mr. Allen said the company would report revenue for the third quarter of about $5 million, down from $10.5 million in the second quarter. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is to report its earnings tomorrow. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: The Netherlands: Philips Expects A Loss 

BYLINE:  By Alan Cowell (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Royal Philips Electronics, the largest consumer electronics manufacturer in Europe, said that it would lose about $540 million in 2001, the first time in five years that it has not made a profit. Philips said third- quarter sales dropped 23 percent as its customers bought fewer televisions, computer screens and semiconductors. The chief executive, Gerard Kleisterlee, said consumer confidence was hurt by the terrorist attacks in the United States. Philips said that it lost money in the third quarter and expected to do the same in the fourth. Its shares, which have fallen 38 percent this year, rose 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Deepening Wrinkles in the New Economy 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The strong productivity gains of the late 1990's were concentrated in only 30 percent of the private sector and are likely to be whittled away in the coming months and years, according to a study released yesterday by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm. 
 During the boom years from 1995 through 2000, many economists, journalists and Wall Street analysts declared that a new economy had emerged, one in which the productivity growth rate -- and standards of living -- had improved more rapidly because of information technology. But now that the boom has given way to more than a year of weak growth, widespread layoffs and, lately, the beginning of a recession, the new economy is being re-evaluated. The McKinsey study is the most detailed look at the 1995-2000 period published so far. 
 The yearlong study examined productivity in 59 sectors and came to a conclusion that other experts are reaching in this postboom period, in which the stock market bubble has burst, exuberant business investment is disappearing and Labor Department revisions have reduced earlier estimates of productivity growth. More downward revisions are expected.
The productivity statistics are important because they measure the amount of output or revenue that the nation's workers produce each hour on average. The more that output increases, the more revenue there is for an employer to channel into wages or profits or both. The Labor Department had originally pegged the productivity growth rate at 2.8 percent a year in the late 1990's, up from 1.4 percent from 1973 to 1995 -- a long period of stagnation.
The 2.8 percent figure was lowered recently to 2.5 percent. The McKinsey researchers and other experts say that while there has been an improvement since 1995, mainly because of computers and information technology, the long-term productivity growth rate is likely to fall back to about 2 percent.
"We have tried not to settle on a specific number, simply because we do not think anyone can know what will happen in the next few years," said William Lewis, director of McKinsey's Global Institute, which produced the study. 
That uncertainty is a far cry from the optimistic proclamations of an increasingly efficient new economy, an optimism still maintained by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He is counting on a higher productivity level to help limit the damage from the recession that the United States is most likely in.
The McKinsey study found that nearly all the surge from 1995 through 2000 occurred in six sectors: retail, wholesale, telecommunications, securities, the assembly of computers and the manufacture of semiconductors. Kevin Stiroh, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has also studied productivity industry by industry and has arrived at a similar conclusion in a study that will be published soon.
The improvement came sometimes from the use of computers, sometimes from the actual manufacture of computers and chips and sometimes from the way in which companies were reorganized or operated, regardless of information technology.
"I.T. investment had a significant impact on productivity in some industries and virtually none in others," the McKinsey study found.
Wal-Mart's rapidly rising productivity and its huge share of retailing, for example, brought up the overall average in that industry. "McKinsey attributes a lot of Wal-Mart's productivity gains to the large scale of its stores and the organization of its supply chain," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics who was on an advisory committee for the research. "A lot of that could have been achieved without computers."
Productivity surged in the securities industry, partly because of the Internet and online trading, but also because of rising stock prices. That helped to make mutual fund workers and money managers, among others, more productive. Their output was measured in the value of the stocks they handled. In recent months, stock prices have fallen or remained flat, reducing output per hour.
The assembly of computers and the manufacture of semiconductors contributed significantly to the productivity surge in the late 1990's. But that was mainly because the time spent in production remained essentially unchanged while the speed of these devices increased several fold. As speed rose, so did "quality" and therefore dollar value as measured in the government's accounts -- and therefore worker output.
"Computer speed is likely to increase at the same rate in coming years, but people and companies are likely to buy fewer computers," Mr. Lewis said, explaining that the private sector no longer needs so much additional speed.

Intel Meets Forecasts and Expects Slightly Better Earnings

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation met its financial projections for the third quarter today and said it expected profitability to slightly improve in the last three months of the year, leading some analysts to predict that the semiconductor industry has seen the worst of its precipitous sales decline.
 Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel group that makes microprocessors for personal computers, said the results reinforced his view that the second quarter had been "the bottom," adding that the timing for Intel's recovery was unclear. 
 The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said its sales improved by 3 percent over the second quarter, to $6.5 billion, largely on the strength of increasing sales of chips and other components to personal computer manufacturers. Revenue declined 25 percent from last year's quarter, when sales and investment gains reached record highs. 
Many investors, though, have stopped judging technology companies by how their results compare with those heady times.
Early in September, Intel had predicted that its sales would fall "slightly below" $6.5 billion. The company's chief financial officer, Andy D. Bryant, attributed the revenue level reported today to a successful introduction of Intel's new chip, the Pentium 4. Mr. Bryant said the company was more than halfway to its goal of replacing the Pentium III in all new desktop PC's.
"It appears as if there is actually demand for the product," he said in an interview. Mr. Bryant said he expected Intel to report revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion this quarter. "Our expectations," he added, "have been tempered by the weak economy and declines in consumer confidence."
Analysts focused on Intel's prediction that its gross profit margin would improve by one percentage point in the fourth quarter, to 47 percent, after declining by two percentage points in the third quarter from the second. Intel has waged a pricing war with Advanced Micro Devices, its smaller rival in chips for desktop PC's, that has steadily eroded the profitability of both companies.
Intel said it earned $106 million in the quarter, or 2 cents a share, a decline of 96 percent from the corresponding period last year and half its earnings level in the second quarter.
After excluding special items related to acquisitions, Intel reported earnings of $655 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with 41 cents in the third quarter of 2000. The earnings matched Wall Street estimates, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.
Strengthened by sales to students and to European technology managers returning from vacation, the third quarter typically shows strong improvements over the second quarter.
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said the so-called seasonal improvement had not been as not as strong as usual. But adding that "these aren't normal times," he praised the results as strong indicators of an eventual upturn.
"We think the worst is behind, not only Intel but the semiconductor group as a whole," Mr. Joseph said. "Intel has traditionally been a leader out of the downturn."
Intel said it gained market share from Advanced Micro during the quarter. That was supported by preliminary data from Mercury Research in Scottsdale, Ariz., which said Intel shipped 77.5 percent of all PC chips during the quarter, compared with 76.7 percent the quarter before. Advanced Micro's share declined to 21.5 percent from 22.2 percent, Mercury Research said.
In regular trading today, shares of Intel gained 58 cents, to $24.96. They climbed as high as $26.20 after hours, falling back to $25.45.
The personal computer market is mired in its steepest slump. Dell, the market leader, recently reaffirmed its forecasts for the quarter, but Compaq and Gateway lowered their projections after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
Steve Kleynhans, a vice president with the Meta Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., said customers had many compelling reasons to buy PC's, including increased power, the forthcoming Windows XP operating system from Microsoft and features like rewriteable DVD players in machines that cost less than $1,000. But he added that consumers and small businesses were too uncertain about their jobs to buy new computers this year. "Buying a new PC, no matter how cool it is, is probably a few notches down on the priority list from where it was just a few months ago," he said.
In separate announcements today, two other makers of chips or chip equipment, ASM Lithography Holdings and Royal Philips Electronics, both based in the Netherlands, sent mixed signals about their prospects for recovery.
Philips posted a loss for its fiscal third quarter and said chip sales declined 43 percent. But it also said it expected a slight improvement in sales in the fourth quarter and extended mild hopes for a recovery in chip sales by the middle of 2002.
ASM Lithography said it would cut 1,400 jobs, or 17 percent of its work force, by the middle of next year "as a consequence of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry." It also said it was moving more quickly than expected to consolidate operations of the Silicon Valley Group, purchased for $1.6 billion earlier this year.
The company said it would close one plant in Ridgefield, Conn., and two in California, one in Orange County in the south and the other in Scotts Valley, near Santa Cruz, and take a restructuring charge as high as 430 million euros, or $390 million. An American spokesman for the company said he expected no noticeable rebound until the last months of 2002.

HEADLINE: Businesses Finding That Good Security Is No Longer Optional 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON and JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
They are hiring security guards, requiring employees to wear identification badges at all times, taking X-rays of packages and reviewing evacuation plans.
 Businesses across the country are trying not only to make their employees and offices safe but also to reassure people, perhaps the hardest job of all. For help, they are often turning to outside security firms and consultants to identify which measures they need right away and what changes should be made permanently. The most common advice is to examine current security and then to spend more on equipment and on people with better training. 
 "We're getting tremendous demand to do security analysis at company locations," said Timothy Dimoff, the president and founder of SACS Consulting Inc., which specializes in security issues. "The focus is going to be more on control," he said -- who has access to offices and plants and how mail and other deliveries are screened. 
While many large companies have long taken security concerns seriously, other companies are listening and responding to consultants' advice for the first time. Evaluations "are getting much more credence," said Alan Bernstein, the chief operating officer of the Wackenhut Corporation, which provides security services and guards.
Though companies are reluctant to describe their heightened measures out of fear any information could be used against them, organizations as varied as Verizon Communications and the Girl Scouts have taken immediate and visible steps to improve their security over the last month. Just as the airline industry has tried to reassure travelers with the presence of armed marshals and increased scrutiny of what and who gets on a plane, the first steps seem to be adding security guards and putting up concrete barriers at their facilities.
With employers spending more, security companies are blossoming. Stocks of companies providing equipment or guards have risen sharply since Sept. 11. Wackenhut's shares, for example, have risen from $16.70 on Sept. 10 to close yesterday at $23.55. The stock of American Science and Engineering, which makes X-ray gear, has more than doubled, from $5.75 to $14.47.
Not all of corporate America is convinced of the need for additional precautions but managers know they need to reassure their workers. "You need to make your people comfortable and want to come to work," Mr. Bernstein said. But what exactly will put people at ease is uncharted territory.
"We're all winging it," said William P. Callahan, president of United Intelligence Group Inc., a security consulting firm. Because the threats are so new, he said, no one knows what makes sense -- spending hundreds of millions of dollars to put in irradiation equipment at the Postal Service or, maybe, doing nothing.
The standard on security "will slowly evolve," as it has overseas in places like Israel, said Richard Maurer, a security consultant with EDI Ltd. Consulting Engineers. "We are just catching up with most of the rest of the world. It is painful."
But some consultants say companies must drastically change how they approach security as dangers previously unthinkable become real. Companies simply need to spend a lot more on security, said Ira A. Lipman, chairman and president of Guardsmark Inc., which provides security services. "If you make things tight, then you don't really have to be fearful," he said. "And it's been my experience that employees are more comfortable working for an employer that has tight security." 
Companies that do not necessarily see themselves as likely targets of attacks worry that someone besides a terrorist, like a disgruntled employee, will try something in the current environment. "They're worried about the copycats, the looney tunes," Mr. Dimoff said.
It is unclear how long some of the new procedures will last. Guardsmark, which has had an increase in demand for guards for offices between Washington and Boston, enters one-year contracts that are automatically renewed but can be terminated on 90 days' notice.
Some companies -- especially smaller ones -- are focusing on immediate threats and will eventually decide to scale back their efforts, conceded Mr. Bernstein of Wackenhut. 
For now, many large organizations are trying to take whatever precautions they can. "We've looked at everything," said Liz Sheppard, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts, whose headquarters is just a few blocks away from the Empire State Building, a possible target. 
The Girl Scouts brought in a consultant to help review all its policies, from how it handles mail and packages to how it can safely evacuate its employees in light of concerns about whether to follow instructions broadcast by the building management during an emergency.
Other companies have also taken immediate steps. "Our security people have never been so busy," said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon Communications. While employees were always required to show badges to enter offices, security guards are now looking at identification and searching any bags. The company is also employing more guards, he said. Verizon also tracks the location of all its 100,000 vehicles around the country, Mr. Rabe said.
Large corporations that are well known to the general public seem to be moving most quickly, according to consultants. "Not all companies are at the same risk," said Michael G. Cherkasky, president and chief executive of Kroll Inc., a security consulting firm. "Companies that have a high profile or have international aspects to them have different risk profiles" than smaller firms, he said.
Delivery companies are also taking specific steps. Airborne Express said it was paying more attention to first-time shippers who were not already in the company's database. Those individuals will have to fill out additional forms when sending packages, said Robert Mintz, a spokesman for Airborne. 
In addition, the company has increased security on the ground at its shipping facilities, adding more guards -- usually off-duty police officers, Mr. Mintz said -- and providing additional training to employees who handle packages. Bomb-sniffing dogs have been used by the company in the past, he said, although X-ray machines are currently not a part of its standard procedures.
The costs of additional security will vary, depending on the size and complexity of the organization. A basic security package for a firm of 25 to 50 people in offices would cost $7,500 to $15,000, according to Mr. Callahan, and would include doors linked to identification cards and the placement of security cameras, but no security guards. The cost of a security guard depends on experience and skills, he said.
While many companies have former law enforcement or military personnel leading their security departments, they may now decide to hire better trained and better paid guards who know how to operate surveillance equipment and who can explain policies and interact better with the public. 
"The days of the security officer reading a book in the lobby have gone away," Mr. Maurer said.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Waits for 'Revolution' to Bear Fruit 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
He still speaks lovingly to the throngs, sometimes for hours at a time on everything from the Bible to Sammy Sosa's bat to his idol, the 19th-century South American liberator, Simon Bolivar. Spotting a familiar face, he stops in midsentence, delighting a crowd by asking about a relative's welfare or how much rain has fallen in a far-off hamlet.
 But these days, President Hugo Chavez is speaking less and less, curtailing his once spontaneous speeches as the crowds have thinned. Gone are the tens of thousands of flag-waving followers who hung on his every word on Bolivar Avenue in the heart of this capital. Instead, at speeches that remain frequent by any measure, he usually addresses several hundred at most, many trucked in from the countryside. 
 Winning office in a landslide election in December 1998 that smashed two longstanding parties, Mr. Chavez, a former army paratrooper and coup plotter, promised to purge the elites from government and obliterate corruption-riddled institutions. 
Holding referendums to win backing for what he has called a peaceful revolution, Mr. Chavez redrafted the Constitution, took control of the National Assembly and installed military officials in important government posts. His promise to ease life for the four of five Venezuelans who are poor while punishing those who squandered the country's vast oil wealth endeared him to millions. 
Under the revised Constitution, he can seek re-election in 2006.
With the economy buoyed by high oil prices, Mr. Chavez steered Venezuela through a period that saw inflation fall and foreign reserves increase, to almost $20 billion. Trying to extricate Venezuela from a recession, the government increased spending 42 percent last year, and the economy grew 3.2 percent.
Yet, many experts and former supporters say, the reforms by the left-leaning president have yielded few real improvements for the 24 million Venezuelans.
"Chavez, as a doctor, does a good job making a diagnosis, but he is disastrous in prescribing medicine," said Julio Andres Borges, leader of First Justice, a small party. "The president builds up everything with his discourse and the hopes of the people. But in the end, the people have seen it is all a paper castle."
More than half the work force is underemployed. Millions of people are street vendors. Crime has risen dramatically, and labor protests seem to occur daily. Squatters are invading land in the countryside, and tens of thousands of upper-class Venezuelans tired of the populist oratory are abandoning the country. Venezuelans are more polarized than ever, from those who see Mr. Chavez as a savior to those who say he is leading Venezuela to ruin.
His displays of friendship with leaders like Presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba and Saddam Hussein of Iraq have also irritated the United States, though American policy toward Venezuela remains one of engagement, rather than exclusion.
Mr. Chavez still enjoys the support of most Venezuelans, several polls show. But unrest is a possibility. Some theorists and political experts suggest that even a coup is possible, a disastrous prospect, because the United States counts on Venezuela for 7.6 percent of its oil.
"The people of Caracas are passing him by, and that could be deadly," said Miguel Otero, editor of El Nacional, a daily. "The day something big happens and he calls for the people, they will not come out for him, or they will come out against him."
Mr. Chavez has lashed out at the press, political opponents and former allies. His vitriol is not new. But many here said it was sharpening.
"This revolution will not go back," he thundered in a recent speech. "The enemies of the revolution are quite wrong, and they are going to fall hard if they try to slow this revolution, which no one can stop."
The attacks against opponents are widely expected to grow if economic growth slows as predicted. This year, 4.5 percent growth was forecast. But that figure is now generally expected to hover above 3.2 percent. Next year, growth might slip below 3 percent, more so if oil prices fall.
Officials contend that one of Mr. Chavez's most significant accomplishments has been prodding the price of oil higher in the last two years through his efforts to institute production cuts among fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Half of government operating revenues generated from oil production that is largely overseen by the giant state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. Venezuela, which has proven oil reserves of 76 billion barrels, depends on oil for 80 percent of export earnings, $29 billion last year.
Supporters also say the president's opponents are part of an elite minority whose views do not reflect those of most Venezuelans. "They are hysterical," said Jorge Perez, a former economics adviser to Mr. Chavez. "Why? Because they see their interests are going to be wiped away." 
Aurora Morales, who oversees doctrine for Mr. Chavez's movement, said the opposition should accept the fact that Mr. Chavez continues to have widespread support. "Look," Ms. Morales said, "Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela because the people wanted it, and he is still the people's leader."
Indeed, support for Mr. Chavez stood at 56 percent in July, impressive by any measure for a leader about to embark on his fourth year in office, according to a poll by Datanalisis. Yet the poll also showed a decline in support, from a 75 percent approval rating in February 2000.
More significantly, those considered "hard" supporters, people who attend rallies and speeches, dropped, from 48 percent in February 2000 to 31 in July.
Another poll, taken in August by Alfredo Keller & Associates of Caracas, found that 41 percent of respondents said the Chavez administration was better than they had hoped, down from 76 percent in April 1999.
Mr. Chavez draws strength from that fact that the two old parties that once governed are in shambles and that no organized well-known opposition force has emerged. "At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what a sitting president's popularity is, as long as no member of the opposition is more popular," said a Western diplomat who has closely followed Venezuelan politics. At Mr. Chavez's speeches, it is hard to tell that support is slipping. At one recent gathering, followers waving flags and wearing the red berets of his Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement waited nearly two hours in an auditorium until the president showed up. When Mr. Chavez strode on stage, the crowd erupted. He chided, "Discipline, discipline." Supporters screamed his name over and over. 
The rhetoric and actions that create such devotion, however, instill intense hatred among the middle and upper classes. Some speak in apocalyptic terms about what Mr. Chavez is doing to their country. 
At a meeting of Accion Democratica, a party demolished by Mr. Chavez's presidency, one member after another said Mr. Chavez was embarrassing the country and driving away investments. To a former government minister and opponent, Ramon Escovar, the sole recourse is organized protests.
"Imagine a strike, with taxicab drivers and bus workers and subway workers," Mr. Escovar told the group. "If it happens in three cities, it would be a real civil movement. Do you not think that could be reproduced here? Of course it can."

HEADLINE: Asian Session Will Focus On Terrorism And Trade 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Trade and terrorism will compete for top billing here beginning on Wednesday when 21 Asian and Pacific Rim countries formally open a series of meetings in what will be the largest gathering of government leaders since Sept. 11.
 The attacks and subsequent American airstrikes against Afghanistan have turned the Shanghai assemblage from a relatively toothless good-will exercise into a mildly contentious effort by the United States to strengthen its antiterrorism coalition in Asia. They have also added weight to the annual event, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which has in the past been best known, perhaps, for the closing photo opportunity, at which leaders put on shirts that reflect the culture of the host country. 
 China had hoped to use the meetings, for which it is host for the first time, to flaunt its fast-expanding economy and show off its model city at a time when most major economies are slowing dramatically or already in recession. 
But the main attraction will instead be President Bush, who is expected to arrive here late on Thursday. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrives late on Wednesday.
Although Mr. Bush has promised to keep economics on the agenda and is to give a keynote address to business leaders on Saturday, more attention will inevitably be given to his meeting on Friday with President Jiang Zemin of China and on Sunday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
The meetings will be largely symbolic. But Mr. Bush is widely expected to reassure Mr. Jiang that the United States military effort in Central Asia poses no threat to China. Many Chinese policy makers fear that the American presence near its western border may become long-term, altering the strategic landscape and ultimately undermining China's security.
Beijing has voiced support for Washington's war on terrorism. But the government response to the American attacks on Afghanistan have been measured at best, and largely marked by evident ambivalence.
The sudden American campaign has already made obsolete China's own efforts at building an antiterrorism coalition in Central Asia. It has also weakened China's influence in Pakistan, which Beijing has cultivated as a counterbalance to India, with which China has a longstanding territorial dispute.
Mr. Bush may also try to enlist China's help in persuading Indonesia and Malaysia, both predominantly Muslim nations, to support American military actions in Afghanistan. He will meet the leaders of both countries, who have criticized the American bombing.
Though the American agenda threatens to eclipse Mr. Jiang's carefully crafted show, the fact that Mr. Bush is showing up at all gives Mr. Jiang enormous prestige. Mr. Bush made much in his election campaign and in his administration's early days of intention to play down America's relationship with China in favor of its relationship with Japan.
Yet, despite fighting a war and canceling stops in Japan and South Korea, Mr. Bush has promised to make it to China. His visit is generally expected to put relations with China on their soundest footing so far in his administration.
China also has an agenda, including pressing its objections to America's proposed antimissile shield and urging the United States to end arms sales to Taiwan.
Instead of simply focusing on a multilateral resolution that would outline ways the region's economies can liberalize trade and help reverse the global economic downturn, the leaders of the group, called APEC, and their entourages will also debate a United States-drafted antiterrorism statement that Mr. Bush hopes the assembled leaders will sign. If signed it would be the first time the APEC forum has endorsed a political declaration.
Other initiatives under discussion are suddenly relevant to the war on terrorism. Among them is a program to link Pacific Rim disease-control centers, train health officials how to monitor outbreaks of diseases and plan responses. The program has taken on increased importance because of the anthrax problems in the United States.
Officials are also working on airline, airport and seaport security as well as tightening customs controls. Member nations are expected, too, to propose steps to combat money-laundering and other financial crimes, including the funding of terrorist groups.
Member nations are also expected to call for a new round of talks on global trade regulations at a meeting next month of the World Trade Organization. The meeting is supposed to be in Doha, Qatar, though the site is uncertain because of new security concerns. W.T.O. members at the meeting are generally expected to endorse China's entry into the trading club.

HEADLINE: White House Balks At Further Bailouts 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
In response to a flood of calls for bailouts from industries hurt directly or indirectly by the terrorist attacks, from restaurants and theme parks to steel makers, the Bush administration has developed the following official policy position: forget it.
 But in trying to fend off the pleas for assistance, the administration is in the awkward position of having to explain why it violated its own principle by granting or offering assistance to two economically important and politically powerful industries, airlines and insurers, in the weeks after the attacks. 
 For all the administration's philosophical discomfort with the idea of the government propping up private enterprise, President Bush has already disbursed $5 billion in cash assistance to airlines and is offering loan guarantees, totaling as much as $15 billion, to some carriers. 
The president has also proposed a plan to have the government pay at least 80 percent of claims for damage from any future terrorist attacks in the next year and to cap the insurance industry's liability in subsequent years. 
In general, administration officials said, their policy is that any assistance should be directed at strengthening the economy in general and not at particular industries or companies. In a White House where the economic policy has been built around faith in market forces and a campaign to slow the growth of government, that approach has not generated any noticeable internal dissent.
At the same time, White House officials have specific explanations for why airlines and insurers should be granted exceptions to the rule.
Getting the airlines flying again and keeping them out of bankruptcy was essential to keeping the entire economy afloat and was vital in restoring public confidence after the attacks, administration officials said. Helping the airlines will also ripple through the economy by helping hotels, restaurants, rental car companies and other businesses hurt by the downturn in travel, they said.
In developing a plan to have the government temporarily assume much of the risk of big property losses from another terrorist attack, administration officials said they were not bailing out the insurance industry, but helping the entire economy by assuring that all companies needing insurance would be able to obtain it at reasonable rates. Without affordable insurance, companies in many industries would be unable to function.
Whether the bailouts of the airlines and the insurers were constructed in a way that yields maximum good for the economy and the country at minimal cost to the taxpayer remains a matter of debate.
The justifications for those two bailouts also leave unanswered another question: What if circumstances change in a way that imperils the functioning of the oil industry, for example, or semiconductor manufacturers, or any of the other industries whose products and services are essential to maintaining the strength and vibrancy of the economy in the United States?
"There is no hard-and-fast rule on the national-security justification for government intervention," said Thomas D. Gallagher, a political analyst at the International Strategy and Investment Group, an investment firm.
For now, the administration seems intent on beating back a lengthening list of industries that are telling Congress about how their business has already been hurt by the aftershocks from the attacks -- and how a timely tax break or a new government program might help.
"Attempting to rush from sector to sector applying first aid would be an economically futile and fiscally ruinous mistake," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, said today.
"The short answer on more bailouts," he said, "is none."
But Congress, on both sides of the aisle, tends to be a softer touch for industries and interest groups, and lobbyists are pushing for a wide range of measures to be included in the economic stimulus package now being negotiated on Capitol Hill.
Hollywood is looking for a tax break to encourage studios not to move film production abroad. Theme parks support a tax credit for travel expenses. Steel makers are looking for help. Restaurants want increased deductibility of business meals.
"It's important not to set bad precedents, which means it's important not to bend too much to the will of industries that may have been hurt," said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility.
"The government certainly doesn't want to get into bailing out industries that have been hit in a secondary way, because frankly we've all been hit in a secondary way," Mr. Bixby said.
Barring some major new problem with the economy or national security, the focus in Washington will probably shift from big bailouts of essential industries to helping industries and their workers weather the economic downturn.
In an interview and in a speech tonight in New York, Mr. Daniels said the administration would seek to strip out of the economic stimulus bill any provisions that were focused on particular industries. 
"Other sector-specific bailouts should be avoided," Mr. Daniels said. "Industries heavily dependent on air travel will benefit from the recovery of airlines, and from macroeconomic measures that spur overall economic growth. Our ministrations must stop at causes, not symptoms."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 18, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the Bush administration's opposition to bailouts for industries other than airlines and insurers misstated the amount of loan guarantees offered by the administration to airlines. It is $10 billion, not $15 billion.

HEADLINE: Out of Work, and Out of the Benefits Loop; 
Restrictions Will Keep Millions From Receiving Help

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
When Larry Johnson applied for unemployment benefits the week after the World Trade Center collapsed, he seemed like just the kind of person government officials have been talking about helping since Sept. 11.
 Mr. Johnson, 49, worked the night shift, cleaning the bar and buffing floors, at Windows on the World, the restaurant at the top of the north tower. The terrorist attacks, two hours after Mr. Johnson had left work, killed 79 colleagues and took away his job eight months after he had started it. 
 But a couple of weeks ago, he received a letter from New York State rejecting his application for benefits because he had not earned enough money over the previous 18 months. That technicality is one of the many restrictions in an unemployment system that now pays benefits to about 39 percent of all Americans who are without a job and looking for one, down from about 50 percent in 1975 and even higher levels a half-century ago, according to the Labor Department. 
As the labor force has changed over the last three decades to include more women, more temporary employees and fewer factory workers, the unemployment insurance system has not changed with it in many states and has become considerably stricter in many others, job counselors and economists said.
The system, created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act, pays an average of $230 a week to unemployed Americans who meet its qualifications. Although the rules vary from state to state, they typically exclude people who do not fit the traditional notion of a laid-off worker -- part-time employees, recently hired low-wage workers and people who quit their jobs or refused a new shift for family reasons.
As a result, because millions of unemployed workers will not qualify for benefits in the first place, many laid-off employees will not be helped by President Bush's proposal to extend payments to a limited pool of those jobless Americans who are eligible.
With the United States probably in its first recession in a decade and companies announcing tens of thousands of layoffs, the gaps in the unemployment safety net could aggravate the downturn, economists say. People without jobs or unemployment benefits -- even people whose spouses work -- are likely to cut their discretionary spending sharply, as many struggle to pay their rent, meet their debt payments and still have enough money for food and transportation.
"I've got to start all over again," said Mr. Johnson, who described himself as running out of the money he had received from his sister and a few charities. "I'm on the edge of being homeless."
Mr. Johnson was turned down because New York, like most states, determines eligibility based on earnings over a 12-month period that ends a few months before the date a job is lost. This is supposed to give the state time to gather employment records, but it often excludes people who have worked for less than a year and were previously without a job.
New York is one of nine states that let people like Mr. Johnson reapply and ask that the most recent months be considered, said Betsy McCormack, a spokeswoman for the state labor department. With each rejection letter, the state includes a form allowing people to make the request.
In addition, Ms. McCormack said, Gov. George E. Pataki has taken steps to help people left jobless because of the attacks, like extending until next month the deadline to apply for disaster-related unemployment benefits.
Still, Mr. Johnson's unexpected rejection, and the difficulties it has caused, is typical of the effect that an increasingly complicated set of rules has had, job counselors said. 
"This is a system that defies explanation in so many ways," said Jeffrey B. Wenger, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington partly supported by labor unions.
Full-time employees who worked for at least a year before losing their jobs rarely fail to qualify for benefits because of income minimums; most states require people to have earned only a few thousand dollars to be eligible.
But people are rejected for many other reasons. Some are turned down because they quit their jobs to care for relatives, leaving them ineligible for benefits once they begin looking for work again. Or because they worked part time and made the minimum wage or slightly above, leaving them short of the income requirements in some states. Or because, like many parents of children, they worked part time before being laid off and are again seeking only part-time work.
"There is a big discrimination against part-time people," said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University. Like full-time employees, part-time workers pay unemployment-insurance tax while they are working, but in most states they do not receive the benefits of that tax when they are unemployed.
"It's not right," Mr. Freeman said.
Other people, meanwhile, never receive benefits because they do not think it is worth applying or because they do not know they qualify, labor experts said.
A report submitted to Congress last year by the General Accounting Office attributed the long-term decline in unemployment insurance coverage to several economic and political reasons. In past decades, more Americans worked in factories, where regular layoffs made jobless benefits a common part of their lives, and belonged to labor unions, which often reminded members to apply for benefits.
In the 1990's, more states eased eligibility rules than tightened them, Mr. Wenger said, helping the percentage of jobless workers getting benefits to increase slightly. 
The General Accounting Office report recommended a more significant loosening of the rules so that unemployment insurance could catch up to the changes in the work force. The report noted, for instance, that over the last five decades many states have begun rejecting people who had quit their jobs for personal reasons even as the percentage of families with two working parents rose sharply.
The report also said unemployment insurance had become particularly important because of the number of low-wage workers who have entered the work force since the welfare system was overhauled in 1996.
But proposals to expand unemployment insurance have won little political support because they cost money and could give people less incentive to find a job, economists say. In fact, Mr. Freeman said, Australia and many European countries, while still more generous, have reduced their benefits in recent years, making their systems more like that of the United States.
This month, President Bush proposed extending benefits by 13 weeks for people who became unemployed after Sept. 11, who live in states where the unemployment rate rises by at least 30 percent and whose benefits expire. Most states normally allow people to collect for as long as 26 weeks.
The president also asked Congress to give states $3 billion in emergency funds, some of which could be paid to unemployed workers enrolled in job-training classes who are not normally eligible.
Still, with the country entering its first recession since 1991, economists said they were worried that the system's gaps could contribute to a delay in recovery.
"If you want to put money into the economy, put it in the hands of people who are the most desperate," said Richard J. DeKaser, the chief economist at the National City Corporation, a bank based in Cleveland. "People who are unemployed are not going to save money."
If anything, many without jobs and unemployment benefits find themselves dipping into their savings or cutting back on their spending.
Marjorie Goldstein, who joined US Airways as a flight attendant in March after spending 15 years at home raising three children, lost her job late last month as part of the airline industry's huge cutbacks after the attacks. When she applied for unemployment, Pennsylvania rejected her and many of the people with whom she went to flight attendant school earlier this year, saying their work experience was too recent.
"If I were the major breadwinner, we'd be hungry," said Ms. Goldstein, who lives near Pittsburgh.
Because her husband works, she is not worried about paying the essential bills. But with her $1,700 in additional monthly income, the family had bought a new stove, refinished its driveway and paid for day camp for one of the children. Now, she said, they are likely to cut back.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE WIDENING INQUIRY; 
ANTHRAX MAILED TO SENATE IS FOUND TO BE POTENT FORM; CASE TIED TO ILLNESS AT NBC

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The anthrax mailed to the office of the Senate majority leader was pure and highly refined, consisting of particles so tiny that they could spread through the air without detection, government officials said tonight.
 The officials said the potent grade of highly concentrated anthrax found in the letter sent to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota could have been made by an expert capable of producing large amounts of it, although it is not yet known who may have manufactured or purchased the anthrax sent to the senator. 
 The letter, which was opened on Monday morning in Mr. Daschle's office, bore strong similarities in language and handwriting to the one sent to the NBC anchor Tom Brokaw in New York and appeared to have been composed by the same person. Officials stopped short of explicitly linking the attacks to international terrorism, but the gravity of the threat instantly transformed the investigation into a major national security concern. 
"We were told it was a very strong form of anthrax, a very potent form of anthrax which clearly was produced by someone who knew what he or she was doing," Mr. Daschle said after a briefing for senators by the F.B.I. and an Army epidemiologist. He said the sample that had been mailed to him "had a fairly significant degree of concentration of spores." 
Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine said the strain was "very refined, very pure."
Heightened concern over the purity and concentration of the anthrax came as a Congressional official said there had been some intelligence warnings last week that suspicious packages would be sent to important places and people.
President Bush was scheduled to fly to California on Wednesday, a one-day stop on his way to an economic summit in China. White House officials said that the trip was still on "as of now" and that Mr. Bush was waiting for final test results on the anthrax found in the Senate. His trip could be curtailed if necessary, the officials said.
Former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush's new chief of domestic security, met at the White House with senior federal law enforcement and health officials this afternoon. 
In an interview with Mr. Brokaw on "NBC Nightly News," Mr. Ridge called the threat of bioterrorism "the No. 1 priority this week and for the weeks ahead" and suggested it was time to build up supplies of smallpox vaccine and resume routine vaccinations of children, a practice that was stopped nearly three decades ago. 
The initial findings from an Army medical laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., came as the police at the Capitol shut down a full eight-story wing of the building where the letter was found, including the suites of 12 senators with the same ventilation system. Hundreds of people who so much as passed through the corridors near Mr. Daschle's office were being tested and treated with antibiotics.
A senior government official said tonight that the anthrax in Mr. Daschle's office was "very highly refined, very small anthrax" and was "the kind that will give you pulmonary anthrax."
Officials said they had not yet determined whether the anthrax that had infected the son of an ABC News producer in New York was the same as that sent to Mr. Daschle. They said the material sent to Mr. Brokaw was very similar to the kind of anthrax that killed a photo editor at American Media Inc., a tabloid publisher in Florida. The German drug company that makes the antibiotic used against anthrax, Cipro, said today that it was tripling production of the drug as public fears mounted.
But Bayer A.G., the maker, acknowledged that even that increase may not be sufficient to meet demand. Cipro is the only drug approved to treat inhaled anthrax, and on Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said the government wanted to increase the national stockpile of emergency drugs to have enough to treat 12 million people for 60 days, six times the current stockpile.
Much remained unclear tonight, including above all who might be responsible for the letters sent to the Senate and NBC, or what links they had to other cases of anthrax exposure in the last two weeks.
A senior government official said that laboratory tests had not matched the anthrax samples in the two letters but that he expected them to prove to be the same.
Investigators were trying to determine whether the two letters were related to other possible anthrax exposures across the country.
Both letters and their envelopes were handwritten in block printing, and copies were released today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They were unsigned and contained no salutation, the senior official said, and both contained a generalized threat and did not appear to target the addressees.
The official said the letters contained phrases like "Death to America," "You're going to die" and "Allah is great." Investigators did not conclude that the reference to Allah meant that the letter writer was an Islamic extremist or linked to Osama bin Laden, the official said. But officials today refused to rule out any possible motive for the letters. 
Lieut. Dan Nichols of the Capitol police called the shutdown of part of the Hart Senate Office Building "a precautionary measure only" and said security workers planned "extensive testing" of the ventilation system. The air conditioning and ventilation in that section of the building was shut off about a half-hour after Mr. Daschle's aide found the package on Monday morning, lawmakers said.
The White House communications director, Dan Bartlett, said tonight that the president would have no comment until investigators had a conclusive finding about the samples taken from the Senate. 
"We take all these cases involving anthrax very seriously," Mr. Bartlett said. "We will wait for a conclusive test."
He said Mr. Bush did not attend the meeting with Mr. Ridge this afternoon and was still planning his trip to China. "Right now, his itinerary hasn't changed," he said. "The president is confident in the federal agencies that have been responding to this. What do you want him to do? Hunker down? We're waiting for the tests and investigations to take place."
Dr. John Eisold, the attending physician at the Capitol, said several hundred people would be screened and given antibiotics during testing. He said officials wanted to "draw up the net as widely as possible and err on the conservative side and test and treat." 
Officials noted repeatedly that only the letter had so far tested positive for anthrax and that it was too early to have results from nasal swab testing.
At least one senator, Barabra Boxer, a California Democrat whose office is in the wing of the building that was shut, took advantage of the swab tests being offered today. "My staff and I have been tested and given antibiotics as a precautionary measure while awaiting tests results," Senator Boxer said.
At a news conference, the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, said threats of attacks against the United States had not diminished since last week, when his office issued a warning that there was a possibility of another attack on the United States in the coming days.
Mr. Mueller said the alert would continue in effect in part because of the anthrax exposure cases. "Quite obviously," he said, "the incidents of anthrax exposures in the last couple of days warrant such a continued state of alert."
Still, Mr. Mueller did not say he believed the anthrax outbreak was the attack warned of in intelligence information received last week.

HEADLINE: Common Interests In a Hazardous World 

BYLINE:  By David Shambaugh and Robert S. Litwak; David Shambaugh is director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University. Robert S. Litwak is director of international studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush's trip to China tomorrow to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting may mark a qualitatively new and more mature phase in relations between the two countries. The current campaign against global terrorism, in which the two governments have already cooperated extensively, offers the opportunity to improve a relationship that has been plagued by difficulties.
 Normally a presidential visit to China would generate strong passions and public controversy in the United States, as China has been a lightning rod in American domestic political debates. Disagreements about China policy inside the government, which have often been heated since 1989, have become muted. 
 The principal reason for the lack of controversy is that America and the world are preoccupied by the events of Sept. 11 and the unfolding American-led military campaign in Afghanistan. This lack of attention may be just what the relationship between America and China needs, providing an opportunity for President Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China to meet without strong domestic pressures and heightened international expectations. Simply going to Shanghai will also help familiarize President Bush with the realities of a rapidly modernizing China, giving him a concrete sense of a country often reduced to abstractions and stereotypes.
This first meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang provides a chance for the two to stake out mutual interests in the campaign against terrorism as well as to manage other difficult issues, including the spread of weapons of mass destruction, climate change, organized crime and narcotics smuggling, and the future of North Korea.
China's hosting of the APEC conference and imminent entry into the World Trade Organization in early November are also important events in their own right, and tangibly symbolize China's integration into the global economy. In this context, the tensions of recent years between Washington and Beijing may be reduced by multinational management of common problems. Although the two nations will continue to have friction, international coalitions and multilateral mechanisms offer a productive way forward for Sino-American cooperation.
Since President Nixon's opening to China three decades ago, American policy has sought China's integration into the international community. Encouraging Chinese membership in, and compliance with, international institutions has been viewed as important for global stability. Yet China has long suspected multilateral institutions of being stalking horses for American interests.
Interestingly, this view has recently been reversed; China now believes that such institutions may constrain American power or, at the least, keep the United States from acting unilaterally.
Although China is regarded as a full member of the global system, this integration remains more form than substance. China's ambivalence even now about multilateralism and Beijing's selective implementation of international agreements indicate that China is not fully comfortable with the aims, principles and norms that underlie global institutions. China's commitment to the international system needs to be judged by the consistency of its actions.
The international effort to restrict the proliferation of sensitive military technologies is one particularly thorny area that has long roiled Sino-American relations. Last November, Beijing formally committed to Washington that it would curb its exports of missile components and nuclear technology. This important agreement was reciprocated by a Clinton administration decision to make it easier for American companies to launch satellites on Chinese rockets. But last month the State Department slapped sanctions on two Chinese companies accused of circumventing the pledge to curb missile exports by transferring missile parts to Pakistan.
The Chinese government faces a choice. It can either continue selling nuclear technology and missile components, for example, to unstable states like Pakistan or hostile ones like Iran, or it can live up to its commitments and gain international acceptance as a responsible state. In our discussions in Beijing last week with military officials and civilian analysts, it was apparent that Chinese arms control authorities are rethinking China's approach. China cannot be against terrorism one day and selling dangerous technology to states that sponsor terrorism the next. The incentives now clearly cut in favor of Chinese compliance with multilateral nonproliferation norms. Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang may announce progress on this issue when they meet in Shanghai on Friday.
The mixed, complex character of Sino-American relations resists reduction to any simplistic slogan, whether "strategic partners" or "strategic competitors." America's relationship with China is increasingly enmeshed in a broader global framework. Of course, some Sino-American problems -- Taiwan and missile defense, for example -- are not amenable to multilateral management. But China's increased participation in global organizations may well improve the way our two nations handle this always fraught relationship.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ISLAMABAD; 
POWELL SUGGESTS ROLE FOR TALIBAN

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The United States and Pakistan agreed today to work urgently for the creation of a new, broad-based government in Afghanistan that both sides said could include moderate elements of the Taliban movement whose present leadership is now a target for the American-led military campaign. 
 The agreement was the most visible achievement of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit here today as bombs continued to fall in Afghanistan on Taliban troop concentrations and on targets associated with Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden. 
 The bombing of frontline Taliban positions near Kabul, the Afghan capital, has been largely avoided pending agreement on what sort of government might replace the Taliban. But in the last 24 hours the bombardment of Taliban positions, including those near the capital, has intensified. 
Secretary Powell said he had come to tell Pakistan that the United States -- long chastised here as having abandoned its cold war ally following the collapse of the Soviet Union -- was returning "to demonstrate our enduring commitment" to "a great Muslim nation."
The secretary said the revivified relations with Pakistan did not represent "just a temporary spike" in American focus, adding that Washington would stay the course to help rebuild Afghanistan and assist in Pakistan's development.
The high praise heaped on Pakistan provided a curious sight: an American secretary state standing next to a general in uniform who seized power in a military coup, and lauding his achievements.
Secretary Powell said the United States would also get more deeply involved -- if asked -- in resolving the longstanding and often violent conflict between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, a mainly Muslim territory claimed by both countries.
The American secretary's visit left no doubt that a far more robust American military and diplomatic initiative lies ahead in southern Asia, one that will require large expenditures, a re-examination of sanctions and other restricive policies and, in general, a much deeper involvement in the region than President Bush anticipated when he came to office nine months ago. 
Speaking at a news conference with Secretary Powell, the Pakistan president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said, "We agreed that durable peace in Afghanistan would only be possible through the establishment of a broad-based, multiethnic government representing the demographic contours of Afghanistan, freely chosen by the Afghans without outside interference."
Those who could play a role in the formation of such a government, he said, include the former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, "political leaders, moderate Taliban leaders, elements from the Northern Alliance, tribal elders" as well as "Afghans living outside their country."
Neither General Musharraf nor Secretary Powell elaborated on whom they considered to be "moderate Taliban leaders." But Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, the designated foreign minister of the Northern Alliance, the main opposition group to the Taliban in Afghanistan, said today that he would not accept any Taliban member in a future government. Pakistan regards the Northern Alliance with suspicion.
Secretary Powell appeared to support the notion of a Taliban presence in a future government. After the current government is toppled, he said, "there would still be those who might find that the teachings" and the "beliefs of that movement" are still very important. "We would have to listen to them or at least take them into account," he said.
General Musharraf's most immediate concern is the political difficulty of holding together a country where many people oppose the bombing in Afghanistan.
"Certainly a majority of the people are against the operation in Afghanistan," he said. "They would like to see this operation to be terminated as fast as possible, and that is what I would urge the coalition -- to achieve the military objectives and terminate the operation."
General Musharraf added, however, that polls show that "the majority of the people of Pakistan" support "my government's action."
The Pakistani president said that this "dichotomy" of public opinion illustrated the precarious political balance he is trying to maintain as thousands of Pakistanis continue to demonstrate, at times violently, against the American-led military campaign in Afghanistan. 
Though President Bush and Secretary Powell have condemned the Taliban leadership as evil, the secretary said today: "You can't export them. You can't send them to another country. You can't ethnically cleanse Afghanistan after this is over. But you can certainly get rid of this particular regime that has driven this country to such devastation."
In less than 24 hours, Secretary Powell packed in meetings with General Musharraf, his cabinet, the Pakistan intelligence chief and his top aides before flying to India. 
In the news conference, Secretary Powell pledged that "in the coming months the United States will take concrete steps to strengthen Pakistan's economy and further broaden our commercial and trade ties."
A senior administration official speaking to reporters afterward said the Bush administration is planning to provide another $550 million in economic assistance to Pakistan on top of the $50 million it made available shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the United States.
That money was provided after Pakistan agreed to open its airspace and provide some logisitics and basing facilities to carry out operations inside Afghanistan.
Pakistan would also receive nearly $100 million to help control its borders and cope with the refugee crisis spawned by the military operations in Afghanistan. In addition, a significant share of the $320 million Washington approved for food and medical aid to Afghanistan would be earmarked for Pakistan port facilities, warehouses and logistics as it prepares for an even greater influx of Afghans fleeing the war.
The American secretary said he would take back to Washington General Musharaff's "strong message" that Pakistan wants even more debt relief than the resheduling of $379 million of obligations that was approved last month.
For his part, the Pakistani leader, who seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999, told Mr. Powell that he was committed to holding democratic elections next year, and he pressed for greater access to the American market to stabilize a teetering economy.
As for Afghanistan itself, General Musharraf said: "The politcal process needs to be placed on a fast track in order to forestall the possibility of a political vacuum. It should not lag behind the fast moving events in the military field, nor should any attempt be made by any warring faction to impose itself on Afghanistan in the wake of the military strikes aginst the Taliban."
This last reference was clearly to the Northern Alliance, whose presence in power in Afghanistan would be unacceptable to Pakistan. 
Consultations on forming a new Afghan government are underway here between Pakistan, representatives of the former king and other Afghan factions. Other consultations are set for Washington and New York this week. A possible United Nations peacekeeping role in Afghanistan was also touched on during the discussions here.
The "success of any political process will also depend on economic conditions," the Pakistani leader said, because "Afghanistan has been destroyed by over two decades of conflict. The social economic infrastructure has been devastated, agriculture is in ruins, pastures have been destroyed, millions of mines litter the landscape."

HEADLINE: Keeping Peace in the Subcontinent 

 BODY:
The last thing Secretary of State Colin Powell needed as he began a delicate diplomatic mission to Pakistan and India this week was a flare-up of violence in Kashmir. Thanks to an untimely attack by India on Pakistani border posts, that is just what he got. The clash served notice, if any were needed at this volatile time in South Asia, that maintaining some sort of equilibrium in relations between Pakistan and India will be essential to waging a successful international war against terrorism. 
 In return for Pakistani support for the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan, President Bush has embraced Gen. Pervez Musharraf's regime in Islamabad and offered Pakistan large amounts of economic aid. Not surprisingly, that has alarmed Indian leaders, who before Sept. 11 had every reason to believe that Washington was eager to build stronger ties to New Delhi. Secretary Powell's difficult job has been to reinforce the new relationship with Pakistan while reassuring India that its interests will not be overlooked. 
 He appears to have accomplished the first part by gaining General Musharraf's agreement to work together to create a new, broad-based government in Afghanistan. To secure Pakistan's cooperation, Mr. Powell in principle endorsed the inclusion of moderate elements of the Taliban leadership. General Musharraf, for his part, did not insist on a fixed deadline for ending American military action. As General Powell completed his visit to Islamabad and began talks in India yesterday, it was clear that the Bush administration has no choice but to get more deeply engaged on a host of regional issues, including Kashmir.
General Musharraf deserves American support for his willingness to help in the campaign against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. That does not mean he should be given a free hand to support Islamic fundamentalist extremists in Kashmir, the northern Indian state where a Muslim uprising has been raging for years. Pakistan needs to stop supporting guerrilla fighters in the conflict. India must understand that it cannot crush Muslim aspirations in Kashmir with the use of force.
Washington should also press the two nations to lower nuclear tensions. The Clinton administration made significant progress in getting India and Pakistan to agree to end nuclear testing, curb the production of weapons material and halt the export of sensitive material. That effort must be continued.
George W. Bush came into office determined to keep his distance from foreign conflicts that did not directly threaten American interests. He probably would have put the strains between India and Pakistan in that category before Sept. 11. Now, with American forces attacking Afghanistan, Washington will have to be very much involved in maintaining the peace between these two old adversaries.

HEADLINE: Grim Forces Converge at Industry Gathering 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
THE two words used most frequently this week to describe Agenda 2002, the first gathering of computer industry executives since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, were "sober" and "subdued." 
 Attendance at the conference was down 15 percent, from 530 people last year to 450. In fact, said Stewart Alsop, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who started the conference in 1987 and oversaw it for 10 years, this was the first time in 14 years that the conference did not sell out. 
 Several people attending characterized the current state of the computer industry as "the perfect storm." That is, a downturn in the economy and the terrorist attacks have converged to foster a level of uncertainty that made last year's conference -- already sober in mood because of the dot-com collapse -- seem upbeat. 
Many of the people attending this time have been through an even more painful period since then as they watched their companies contract or disappear altogether and their personal fortunes wither. 
For years, the annual Agenda conference was equal parts mutual admiration society and sparring ground, the gathering place for the industry's elite members. Until a few years ago, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, was a regular, as were chief executives like Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems and Lawrence Ellison of Oracle. 
The tone for this year's gathering, held at a luxury resort in Scottsdale, was set immediately. In the first five minutes, James Fallows, the executive producer of the conference, asked people in the room to observe a moment of silence for those who died in the attacks on Sept. 11. The names of more than 200 people associated with the computer industry scrolled down a large projection screen. 
At the sessions and in the hallways during breaks, talk was of the economy and of terrorism. One session was devoted entirely to the aftermath of the attacks and the implications for issues like the security of computer networks. 
Kelly Conlin, chief executive of IDG, the company that organizes the conference, said he had considered canceling it before deciding to proceed. "Events like this, particularly in the aftermath of what happened, are a sort of group therapy where people can take consolation," he said. 
Mr. Fallows said that attendance was down not because of the terrorist attacks but because of the lackluster state of the industry. Few people canceled after Sept. 11, he said. 
Despite the subdued mood of those who came, he said, many of them managed "to evoke that image of Rosie the Riveter rolling up her sleeves and getting to work." 
"In this condition of macro-gloom, there are selective opportunities," Mr. Fallows said. "A lot of people have been stressing the advantages to starting an enterprise in these circumstances. Talent is abundant, rent is cheap and there's less competition." 
Some said they were relieved to see that, for the most part, the dot-com participants had disappeared, leaving many from the original Agenda crowd. "They can't afford to come," said Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, the Web search company. Mr. Schmidt, who has attended Agenda for 10 years, was referring to the conference's $4,300 registration fee, among the highest in the computer conference circuit.
But the decline in dot-com participation cast the problems of the more traditional companies into sharper relief. 
"A year ago everyone believed that well-managed profitable businesses were immune from the downturn," said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. "The last year has taught us that in a downturn, no company is immune." 
Some startups were still in evidence. Sergey Brin, president of Google, took the stage and defended his company's decision to continue what many now consider symbolic excesses of the dot-com era like free meals and massages for employees. Compared with a $100 million marketing campaign, he said, "these things cost nothing." 
Excess was not gone entirely absent from the conference. At a private dinner one evening, a successful entrepreneur ordered two bottles of $380 wine. Word spread quickly the next day. Two years ago, such a display of extravagance would not have gone unnoticed either, said Lise Buyers, a partner at Technology Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif., after hearing about it. "It's just that it's twice as tasteless now," she said.

HEADLINE: A New Image: Why Pros Go Digital 

BYLINE:  By MARK GLASER 

 BODY:
FOR years now, digital cameras have been nice gadgets for the amateur photographer. They offer instant gratification in viewing or sending, without the cost of film or development. And they lend themselves to all sorts of other possibilities once the images are transferred to a computer. 
 But for many professional photographers -- the photojournalists who shoot for newspapers and magazines, and studio photographers who specialize in portraits or advertising work -- digital cameras have been a harder sell. Some resisted because they found digital cameras insufficiently versatile to justify the cost of professional-quality models. And some remain convinced that only film can provide photography worthy of a magazine cover or a museum wall. 
 There are increasing signs, however, that digital cameras are gaining a secure place in the professional camera bag. More and more photographers have experimented with them as an adjunct to film. Some favor digital cameras for certain situations or effects; a few use them exclusively. And digital work was prominent in the memorable photojournalism that emerged from the attack on the World Trade Center last month. 
Newspapers, wire services and even glossy newsmagazines made extensive use of digital images from their own photographers as well as amateur shots from witnesses. Dirck Halstead, a longtime photojournalist who runs a Web site called The Digital Journalist (www.digitaljournalist.org), estimates that two-thirds of photographers at the scene were shooting digitally.
"The advantage of digital in this case was the initial ability to see the photos right away" on a camera's L.C.D. screen, he said, "and also to transmit from nearby delis or drugstores" by transferring the images to a laptop computer and then connecting the modem to a phone line. Digital photographers, moreover, did not have to open their cameras, in a chaotic setting filled with smoke and ash, to reload film, although they did have to change memory cards. 
Many professionals who shoot with only digital cameras were impressed with their results on that difficult day. David Handschuh, a staff photographer for The Daily News, was blown a block away by the force of the implosion at the trade center. He credits emergency workers, who pulled him from the rubble three times that day, with saving his life.
"I lost my glasses, my cellphone, my pager, but not my cameras," said Mr. Handschuh, who is recovering at his home in New Jersey. "They were filled with dust, but the disks were O.K. and the pictures were fine." Over all, the day was a "true test of digital photography in recording history," he said, "and it definitely passed the test. The images will stand the test of time."
The digital road has been a bumpy one for photographers. Early digital cameras offered poor resolutions, suffered shutter delays, became obsolete in months and ran into the tens of thousands of dollars to buy -- and repair. Only recently have the standard Nikon D1 models used by professionals come down to $3,500 (the new D1x is about $5,300).
"It's right on the cusp right now," Maggie Hallahan, a San Francisco-based photographer who shoots both advertising and editorial assignments, said of the professional tendency toward film or digital cameras. "This new generation of pro digital cameras will make a huge difference."
Even Gregory Heisler, a portrait photographer who largely uses film cameras in his shoots of celebrities, could not suppress his enthusiasm for the tiny Canon Elph digital camera he tried out on a recent vacation.
"It's unbelievable, really," he said. "I had this little thing in my vest pocket, with this itty-bitty card that holds 300 pictures on it. I could take a picture of my daughter by candlelight without a flash, and it would look fantastic."
Now a convert to the digital way, Mr. Heisler sees a day in the near future when photographers will only use film as a "craft choice," the way fine art photographers make more expensive platinum prints. 
Photographers in the field have more flexibility with digital cameras to change light sensitivity -- and even switch from color to monochrome pictures -- on the fly. Many envisage a time when digital cameras will surpass film cameras in quality. 
Among the first professional photographers to make exclusive use of digital cameras are those who shoot for newspapers, with their emphasis on speed of delivery. The Associated Press began outfitting staff photographers with digital cameras in 1994 and went fully digital worldwide this year. 
Photojournalists have found that the L.C.D. preview screens on digital cameras have helped them connect with the people they are photographing, by showing them the results and thereby bringing down their defenses. And photographers quickly know if they got the shot, in far less than the time it normally takes to develop film.
Newspapers are rapidly changing from film to digital photography. At The New York Times, all staff photographers now have digital equipment, said Margaret O'Connor, the paper's picture editor, and about half use it exclusively. "We're very bullish on it," she said. On one assignment after another, most recently the fighting in Afghanistan, she said, "even the last holdouts are realizing they can't shoot a story like this without it." 
The Indianapolis Star switched to almost exclusively digital photos two years ago, and provided all 17 of its staff photographers with two Nikon D1 cameras. Matt Detrich, a 32-year-old staff photographer, said he fought hard against going digital at first. But then he had one of those moments in the field that changed his viewpoint. 
Shooting at a sensitive scene, where a father was despairing over his children's deaths in a fire, "I could just hold down the button and shoot," he said. "I was able to see that I had my picture, that it was in focus, it was correctly exposed." Once he knew he had the shot, the photographer could step away and let the family grieve.
Some photojournalists like the flexibility of having both film and digital cameras on the same assignment. Shooting the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack for The New York Times, Angel Franco, a staff photographer, used a Hasselblad film camera for panoramic shots but otherwise relied heavily on two Canon D30 digital cameras -- and his PowerBook laptop computer. 
"In an emergency, where you've lost water and electricity, we could never process film," said Mr. Franco. "Plus, I don't have to worry about running out of film. I can just download the digital pictures off the cards and shoot again."
A colleague at The Times, Fred R. Conrad, an accomplished portrait photographer, finds less to love about digital shooting. While acknowledging its advantages, especially speed, he says that digital photography eliminates many of the "inherent choices a photographer has -- the format, the camera, the lens -- to shape an image." 
And then there is the shutter delay that almost made him throw a $3,000 digital camera to the ground. "It's so maddening to try to take a picture and have the camera say it's busy," he said.
Even the most dedicated proponents of digital have seen its pitfalls. Mr. Halstead, who runs The Digital Journalist, has been at the forefront of digital photography and founded the Platypus movement, which pushes still photographers to acquire video and audio skills. But one of his most famous shots was made on slide film. When the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, Mr. Halstead recalled seeing her face and searched through slides he had shot while covering the presidential election in 1996. He had an intern go through his old photos, which he archives painstakingly, and unearthed a shot of Ms. Lewinsky hugging the president.
"If the photographers to the left and right of me on that stage that night were shooting digital, they probably erased the files," Mr. Halstead wrote in an editorial on his site. "Monica who?" 
In this case, slides provided an archival edge, but mainly because of the photographer's memory. In fact, the ability to retrieve images readily from a searchable database helped accelerate the use of digital photography by news organizations. 
For freelance photographers, who have to file hundreds of thousands, even millions, of their own photos, the archiving issue is less clear-cut. Ms. Hallahan uses fireproof cabinets to store her slides and the CD's that she has burned with digital images. Not having the computer resources of a big organization, she finds digital storage costly for images that can each be huge files -- 11 megabytes or larger. 
As for digital photos she took only a few years ago, she has little use for them in her portfolio. "I looked back at my archives, my 'best of,' and I wouldn't ever include the digital images I took in a gallery show," she said. "Even the highest-quality digital cameras just didn't have the quality for output." 
Contrast that view with that of a still-life advertising photographer, Gregor Halenda, 35, who has been shooting entirely in digital for six years. He started with an early Phase One system, moved up to Leaf systems and is planning a studio upgrade to a $30,000 Sinar system. These are a step above those used by most photojournalists.
"Digital is a natural fit for me, with my personality being detail-oriented," Mr. Halenda said. At a recent one-day shoot for the Structure clothing store chain, he was able to send the art director and the client away at the end of the day with low- and high-resolution pictures burned on a CD. "They loved that," he said. (Like other film photographers, Mr. Halenda used to perform a similar function by taking instant pictures with a Polaroid camera, but "they were too small to be able to check critical focus," he said, "and the color was awful at best.") 
Harold Feinstein, a 70-year-old fine-art photographer, has also become a digital proponent. His last two books, "One Hundred Flowers" (Bulfinch Press, 2000) and "Foliage" (Bulfinch Press, 2001), were shot completely with digital cameras, and Mr. Feinstein, a master photo printer, says that the print quality has surpassed that of 35-millimeter film.
"Over the last three years, the quality has been spectacular," he said. "With digital, you can go to the edge of your creative intuition -- and not just to the edge, but go overboard." Besides, he said, "I don't miss washing trays in a darkroom."
Once you have gone digital, "there's no going back," Mr. Feinstein said. 
And going forward? Mr. Halstead foresees professional-quality hybrid cameras that will shoot digital still images and video and burn them directly onto blank DVD's, allowing photojournalists to abandon memory cards and digital videotapes completely.

HEADLINE: With Ishmael in That Island City; 
Though Everything Has Changed, Melville's Landlocked Dreamers Linger

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The book, published 150 years ago today, speaks to you. I don't mean this as an empty gesture of literary piety but as a literal description. That famous first sentence -- "Call me Ishmael" -- is in the second person. Someone wants your attention. He is a New York character, and the encounter is one most New Yorkers have had at one time or another. A stranger approaches you on the street and starts talking. It's not entirely clear what he wants, but his speech is rapid and urgent. He tells you his name, though it occurs to you that it may not be his real name. You nod, you look at your watch, you keep walking, quickening your pace, instinctively checking the placement of your wallet or purse. Is he panhandling? Threatening? Is he lost? Crazy? Maybe a little:
 "Whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off -- " 
 Reflexively, your hand touches the top of your head. But his madness may be divinest sense. Look around you: 
"There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which in a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there. 
"Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?"
Call me literal-minded. The other day -- it was not the Sabbath, and it was morning, but my state of mind was appropriately dreamy -- I followed Ishmael's instructions, attempting to provide an earnest answer to his rhetorical question. And I found that, though everything has changed, Ishmael and I inhabit the same city.
This is in part because his city is to some degree a state of mind -- more precisely a state of feeling. That damp, drizzly November describes the internal weather of a great many of us these days even as the outward climate has provided a succession of warm, glittering autumn mornings. The twin towers stood a few blocks to the north, and a quiet crowd assembles, not to gaze out at the ocean, but to look at the wreckage. 
In New York, in normal times as well as traumatic ones, there is a feeling of loneliness in the midst of bustle that seems to have altered little in a century and a half. To call Manhattan "insular" is, strictly speaking, to say that it is an island, but the word carries a connotation of inwardness:
"Posted like sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But those are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?"
All these lonely people, where do they all come from? You can see them still, a few of them, though it's probable that Ishmael's numbers, even in his more nautical age, are inflated. Corlears Hook, a gentle protuberance jutting into the East River between the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges, was in the mid-19th century a bustling seaside neighborhood of wharves and marketplaces. It is now a quiet zone of high-rise housing developments.
Straddling the F. D. R. Drive between Cherry and Jackson Streets is Corlears Hook Park, where a few solitary souls sit on benches, gazing at the cranes and smokestacks of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The whoosh of traffic on the drive supplies an approximation of surf, and a schoolyard mural near Montgomery Street depicts an underwater scene of dolphins and whales (blue and gray and happy-looking, no "higher horror of the whiteness" here).
A little farther on, as Brooklyn curves away in the distance and the spans of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges run parallel across a widening expanse of sky, you begin to feel the sublime, outward tug of open ocean, and to recollect that insular Manhattan is, like Istanbul or Venice or the Old Amsterdam for which it was once named, a city whose reason for being is water. Ishmael, surveying the clustered masts around the harbor, was contemplating the old economy of seaborne commerce that made New York, even then, a center of world trade. (Melville, ever the prophet, also created, in Bartleby the Scrivener, the prototype of the alienated office worker belonging to a newer economic order.) 
Under the Manhattan Bridge, the first tang of salt hit my nostrils, and the noises of the modern city faded under the slap of choppy waters against the bridge's massive concrete feet. On every third or fourth bench someone sat, daydreaming of whale voyages or just catching a midmorning catnap. Below the South Street Seaport, low red brick buildings Melville might recognize gave way to concrete, glass and steel. A few late New Jersey commuters with their shoulderbags, cell phones and morning papers, trickled from the Wall Street ferry landing, and the gusts of wind grew stronger. 
Coenties Slip, once a narrow cul-de-sac of water, has long since crept inland as the Manhattan landfill extended into the river. It is now a stubby block-long thoroughfare between Water and Pearl streets, bounded on one end by the new Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the other by the narrow, gridless ravines of the financial district. At the end of the block the wind shifted, bringing a smell of smoldering sheetrock and plastic -- a smell that carried intimations of weary grief and an anxiety that swells and ebbs like ocean waves. I turned away from it, following Ishmael's directions.
But his instruction to turn north on Whitehall may itself have an evasive intention: he was skirting the place where his creator was born in 1819. Continuing south on Pearl Street, toward Battery Park, I approached the black monolith of 1 Battery Park Plaza, which occupies the spot where Melville's family lived. When Herman was 11, his father's business collapsed, and the Melvilles moved to Albany. Two years later, Allan Melvill (his son would add the final "e") died, swamped by debts and unhinged by mental illness.
Families in Melville's fiction, when they exist at all, are realms of gothic unhappiness. Though Ishmael indulges in a brief reminiscence of his mother (who spanked him and sent him to bed in the middle of the day), he seems a man without background or parentage. Like all of the other members of the Pequod's ill-fated crew, he has no last name. He is, in his own words, an isolato, and at sea he finds a paradoxical community of fellow solitaries. 
A community that has something in common with a modern city: once they are united at sea, the ocean-gazing dreamers of the land turn their gazes on each other. Walking through Melville's city, your loneliness takes on a curiously social feeling. After a moment at the tip of the Battery, I turned north toward the busy desolation of West Street, and wound my way through the crowds that maneuvered around the blockaded streets west of Broadway.
Literature offers neither solace nor explanation for the present condition of lower Manhattan. Its value lies as much in its noncorrespondence with the world as in its fidelity to reality. Yes, Ahab might be interpreted as a figure of zealous, terroristic hatred commanding a suicide mission, but to force too much relevance onto "Moby-Dick" is to distort its meaning and corrupt its beauty.
Still, there is one moment in the first chapter that reads today like an eerie, inadvertent prophecy. Ishmael's impending voyage, he tells us, is "part of the grand programme of Providence . . . a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances." He continues: "I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:
"Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States
"Whaling Voyage by One Ishmael
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFGHANISTAN."
Here, aside from the uncanny coincidence of past and present, Ishmael describes the modern individual's predicament when faced with large movements of history from which he is necessarily alienated. Viewed objectively, our lives are small and inconsequential, our choices nugatory, but they never feel that way, and we struggle to comprehend the nature of the bonds, random or providential, that tether us to history. 
I finished my circumambulation on the West Side, on the far edge of the meat-packing district. Somewhere around here, at the Gansevoort Docks, Herman Melville, a former famous novelist, worked as a customs inspector for more than 20 years. In 1850, in the throes of conceiving "Moby-Dick" and worried about an outbreak of cholera, he moved his family to Pittsfield, Mass.
Thirteen years later, during the Civil War, he moved back, to take up his sinecure at the docks and occupy his brother's house on East 26th Street. The very address of his workplace must have been a daily rebuke: Gansevoort was his mother's maiden name, the name of an illustrious Dutch family and of a hero of the Revolutionary War, Herman's grandfather, General Peter Gansevoort. Melville's own name, as far as he knew, was on its way to being forgotten, the name of a depressive bureaucrat clinched to a desk. 
Back in the heart of the insular city, far from the water, I found a Starbuck's -- fittingly enough, since the coffee bars are named after the Pequod's first mate. And leafing through my battered copy of "Moby-Dick" I searched out those notable evocations of camaraderie and fellow feeling -- the love of Ishmael for Queequeg, the Polynesian harpooner; the utopian moment of sperm-squeezing on the deck -- and came to the end, with its chilling epigraph from the book of Job: "And I only am alone escaped to tell Thee."
The redundancy of "only" and "alone" -- as if solitude could be multiplied by itself -- obscures the fact that this is also a statement of witness, an act of communication. You are still here to listen, or no story could be told: narration requires a community, which is not bound by time or place. Following Ishmael through the streets of his New York, you feel a deep, melancholy pang of isolation and, at the same time, a miraculous harpoon-stab of connection.

HEADLINE: Multinationals at the Gate 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, China 

 BODY:
China is girding itself to defend its huge yet fragile economy from an invasion by foreign companies once its membership in the World Trade Organization is ratified.
 Many Chinese applauded the completion of talks on China's entry to the global trading system, which were overshadowed by the terrorist attacks on the United States. After 15 years of on-and-off work, the talks were scheduled to wrap up in Geneva the week of Sept. 10; the attacks pushed them back a week. The formal gathering set to ratify China's accession, scheduled for Doha, Qatar, in November, seems likely to be relocated and perhaps postponed because of security concerns. 
 But China's membership is now certain by early 2002, starting a process that will transform its economy in ways that are already causing anticipation and anxiety among those who expect to be affected.
"Friends, you clap, but even I don't yet know how big the competition is that we'll face after we enter the W.T.O.," China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, told a gathering of private businessmen in Nanjing the week the Geneva talks concluded. "My heart isn't yet very settled."
The market-opening process will be gradual, taking at least five years as threatened industries find ways to thwart W.T.O. rules. But there is no doubt about the course China has set, one the leadership hopes will ultimately strengthen the economy despite the dangers encountered along the way.
China's beleaguered farmers are among those most threatened by the changes the country agreed to make to become a W.T.O. member. Duties on imported agricultural products are to be reduced over time to 17 percent from an average of 22 percent now, and the reduction will be even greater for some American farm produce. Import quotas will be relaxed. Both changes will greatly increase the competition farmers face from imports.
Already, Chinese farm incomes are falling, and poverty is spreading in some areas where rural households depend on money sent home by relatives working on construction sites in cities. Labor is plentiful and cheap in the countryside, but total production costs on China's small farm plots are actually higher than in the West, where large mechanized farms provide economies of scale.
China dropped a ban on imports of American wheat last year, and it can now be bought in China for about $36 less a ton than can domestic wheat, putting downward pressure on local prices. That pressure will intensify after China raises its ceiling on wheat imports from the current 2 million tons annually, to 9.3 million tons by 2004.
Competition from efficient foreign agriculture is expected to hasten the already huge migration of people from the countryside into China's cities. The influx will strain urban social services and worsen urban unemployment, which has already risen sharply in recent years as the country has shaken up its industrial sector. China's state-owned industrial concerns have already shed about 35 million jobs the last five years, and government-controlled collectives laid off 16 million more. Economists estimate that another 30 million jobs are in jeopardy after China joins the W.T.O.
Competition for talent will also pose a problem, as many of the best and brightest managers and experts gravitate to multinational companies.
Among manufacturers, the country's fledgling automobile industry may be most vulnerable. Domestically built cars are sold for more than twice what similar models fetch in other countries, in large part because of high production costs. But by 2005, the quotas that limit competition from imports will be abolished, and tariffs are scheduled to slide steadily from as high as 100 percent now to just 25 percent. It is hard to imagine how domestic carmakers, few of which are profitable now, will be able to compete with cheaper, higher-quality imports.
Foreign companies threaten to grab vast chunks of the Chinese market in other fields where, despite years of government goading, domestic businesses are highly inefficient by global standards.
China's banks, for example, may lose as much as half of the market for fee-based banking services to foreign competition once foreign banks begin handling trade financing, credit card transactions and cash management. Foreign banks will be allowed to offer all of those services to both corporate and individual customers anywhere in the country five years after the country's membership becomes effective.
"Given the weak self-discipline and self-development mechanism, the weak infrastructure and the heavy historical burden, domestic institutions are not in an advantageous position," Dai Xianglong, China's chief central banker, said last month.
Foreign financial institutions will be allowed to own stakes of up to 49 percent in fund management companies within three years, and up to one-third in Chinese stock and bond underwriters.
Foreign companies are also expected to build their own modern retail and wholesale distribution networks that could quickly come to dominate distribution of many products, both domestic and imported.
Today, foreign companies may not legally distribute products in China other than those they make here. Nor can they own or manage distribution networks or wholesaling outlets.
China has promised that once it is a member of the W.T.O., those restrictions will be phased out within three years for most products.

HEADLINE: Companies Start Fund to Reward Hospitals for Better Care 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Within days after the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences shocked policy makers in late 1999 by reporting that mistakes in hospitals were killing tens of thousands of Americans each year, some of the nation's largest companies met and agreed to throw their weight behind efforts to make hospitals safer.
 Now, putting cash behind that commitment for the first time, four big New York companies will announce a $2 million incentive program today to encourage hospitals in the state to improve patient safety by requiring doctors to use computerized systems that guard against errors. To receive the bonuses, the hospitals will also have to hire physicians who specialize in intensive care to supervise their sickest patients. 
 For covered employees, the companies will add a bonus to each payment to hospitals that meet these safety standards, which were established by the national employers' organization, the Leapfrog Group. It has grown to more than 80 companies and government agencies that cover 26 million people. 
The New York sponsors -- Verizon Communications, I.B.M., PepsiCo and Xerox -- will join with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to offer the program. They cover more than 100,000 employees and their families in 28 counties in the city and eastern New York.
Some of the country's largest employers, including General Motors in Detroit, Boeing in Seattle and members of an Atlanta coalition, the Georgia Health Care Leadership Council, said they were planning similar Leapfrog programs.
Dr. Michael Stocker, chief executive of Empire, said the four New York employers were persuaded to finance bonuses after a recent study led by Dr. John D. Birkmeyer of the Dartmouth Medical School showed an economic payoff in shorter hospital stays, as well as fewer deaths. Other published studies have shown that electronic systems can reduce errors in prescriptions by 85 percent and that intensive care specialists on staff can reduce mortality rates in the intensive care unit by 10 percent, potentially saving thousand of lives.
"Providers have to order tests, prescription drugs and other things inside hospitals on a system backed up by artificial intelligence," said Bruce Taylor, director of benefits planning at Verizon, which covers 40,000 of its employees, retirees and dependents through Empire. "The system can make sure the order is accurate." Starting Jan. 1, hospitals that meet the standards will receive a 4 percent bonus, based on their charges for patients. The bonus will drop to 3 percent in 2003 and 2 percent in 2004. Only 7 or 8 of the 148 eligible hospitals will have complete computerized physician ordering systems by January, and 40 will have intensive care specialists, Empire estimates. But it expects those numbers to rise sharply in the following two years. 
Hospital executives said the bonuses would be tiny compared with the cost of installing the electronic systems: $5 million to $60 million, depending on hospital size and capabilities, which can include complicated record-keeping and information services. 
Hospital technology experts were excited about the possibilities for improving care. "In some systems, when a doctor is ordering a certain drug, a message could pop up on the screen saying the substance is excreted through the kidneys and the patient's kidney functions are worsening," said Dr. Tom Handler, a research director at Gartner Inc., a consulting firm.
Jack Wolf, chief information officer of Montefiore Medical Center, which has installed electronic ordering in 70 percent of the hospital, said: "In the next wave, the system will feed the medical results back into the front end of the process. Then the physician can actually drill down into the outcomes" and see how many patients who took a certain medication actually improved. 
Leapfrog employers are also asking hospitals to report on the number of patients in major categories so employees can see which hospitals have the most experience in treating diseases like cancer or heart disease. Hospitals worry about the costs, of course. "The challenge for any hospital is that only a small percentage of its patients are covered by these employers," said Theresa A. Bischoff, president of NYU Hospitals Center and chairwoman of the Greater New York Hospital Association.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Out-of-Work People Attend Job Fair 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
By the time the doors opened yesterday morning at the Twin Towers Job Expo, a city-sponsored effort to assist New Yorkers who lost their jobs in the wake of the World Trade Center disaster, the line wound three times around the two square blocks at Madison Square Garden and Pennsylvania Station. 
 So huge was the crowd, which city officials said was at least 8,000, that the city plans to conduct at least one more similar job fair. Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said the city had received calls in recent days from 50 companies seeking to take part, companies that could not be accommodated yesterday because of space limitations. "We're going to make this a regular part of what the city does," Mr. Coles said. "The turnout shows that a lot of people want to work in the city and a lot of companies want to hire people." 
 Each of the 200 participating companies vowed to give priority for new hires to people who lost their jobs directly as a result of the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. 
The companies included the Metropolitan Opera, which was hiring telemarketers but not tenors, to 1-800-TOW-TRUCK, a dispatcher for roadside automobile service that was looking for customer service and sales people. ("If you can use a computer and a phone at the same time, you're halfway to a job," Barry Miller, assistant director of human resources, told a potential recruit. "If you're willing to come to Newark, you're three-quarters of the way.") 
Large corporations like Citibank and AOL Time Warner were represented, as were smaller companies, among them a half dozen security firms that are likely to see increased demand for their services.
But while many of those attending could trace their job needs to the Sept. 11 attack, thousands more have been out of work for months, felled by a slowing economy and the collapse of the dot-com bubble. They came yesterday, too.
Job offers did result for some of those with enough foresight to be among the first in line for the fair, which was conducted on the ground level of exhibition space underneath the Garden's arena seating. In the first two hours, 40 of the participating companies had screened 1,500 prospective employees and offered jobs to 435, Mr. Coles said. Last night, a spokesman said that several thousand people attending the expo received preliminary job offers. But in interviews with people leaving the event, many said they simply dropped off resumes, and few companies were actually offering jobs. 
At day's end, many were turned away from the job fair. Hundreds were waiting when officials announced at least two hours before the official closing time that they would stop letting people in. A spokesman for Mr. Coles said about 2,000 people who could not get in yesterday were given tickets for priority entry to a job fair next Thursday.
Anna Pugliese had arrived at 3 p.m. and waited for an hour before a security guard turned her away. Ms. Pugliese, 52, who was laid off in April from Morgan Stanley in the World Trade Center, said her job prospects had dimmed considerably. "The World Trade Center was where I used to go to leave resumes," she said. "So now I'm left with nowhere to go. This was a mob scene."
Earlier, Duane Reade, the drugstore chain, told 20 people that they would be able to start work on Monday if they passed an employee screening program. All of those jobs are entry-level cashier or shipping and delivery positions paying $5.15 an hour, said Bolivar Garcia, an employee service liaison for Duane Reade. 
"We've had people coming in looking for information technology jobs, people with computer degrees, chefs, cooks," Mr. Garcia said. "These were people used to making $40,000 to $50,000 a year or more. We told them that everybody goes in at the minimum, but you can move up from there quickly. And a lot of people are just looking for jobs, because the bills are catching up."
The Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization, estimated last month that 65,000 jobs were directly affected by the World Trade Center attack, and that 43,000 more were affected by its spillover.
Many of the people in line -- clutching resumes, wearing their best interview suits and shivering in the brisk autumn breeze that turned into gusts that whipped around the Garden -- exhibited a genuine optimism about their prospects, despite the long line, the economic downturn and uncertainty and fear unleashed by the terrorist attack.
Heather Maly, who graduated from Georgetown University in May, followed through on her plans to move from Indianapolis to New York to find work, even a week after the World Trade Center attack. She had signed a Manhattan apartment lease in late August.
"Certainly the disaster caused me to hesitate, wonder should I go or should I not," she said. "But New York is where I wanted to be."
Ms. Maly added: "Now I doubt my decision because no one wants to hire anyone. I was thinking 'I want this kind of job' or 'I want that kind of job.' Now I just want a job."

HEADLINE: The New York Times Co. Registers a Sharp Drop in 3rd-Quarter Earnings 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell sharply as higher circulation revenue was more than offset by a decline in advertising brought on by the weak economy.
 "For much of the past six months, despite the dreary media climate, we believed that we would see signs of recovery by the fourth quarter," Leonard P. Forman, a senior vice president at the Times Company, said in a conference call with analysts yesterday. The attacks on Sept. 11 changed that outlook, he said, and made it very difficult to predict how the company would fare through the rest of the year. 
 The company said that by its preferred method of measuring profits, earnings fell 26.5 percent, to $46.3 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, compared with $63 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, in the period a year earlier. 
The figures in the latest quarter exclude a variety of items, including a profit last year from the sale of four newspapers and nine telephone directories. Over all, net income for the quarter fell 41.5 percent, to $43.8 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $75 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Advertising revenue, excluding revenue from businesses that have been sold, fell 14.5 percent in the quarter, to $452.7 million. Ad revenue at the New England Newspaper Group, which includes The Boston Globe, declined more sharply, falling 21.2 percent; at The New York Times, advertising revenue fell 14.4 percent.
The company said higher prices for its publications were the main reason for a 7.3 percent increase in circulation revenue, excluding divested properties, but it added that sales increased at all its publications after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The company's results were in line with analysts' estimates, many of which were revised lower after Sept. 11. Shares of the company fell $1.97, or 4.7 percent, to $40.02 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock price decline probably reflects concern about the company's year-end results, given the uncertain economic climate and the lack of guidance offered in yesterday's conference call, said Michael A. Kupinski, an analyst with A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
"They're experiencing something industrywide," he said, adding that the focus of the company on major urban markets may make it more vulnerable to the current slowdown in classified and help-wanted advertising than some companies in smaller cities. 
The Times Company said its overall revenue fell 9.2 percent, to $696.9 million, in the third quarter, compared with $767.7 million in the quarter a year earlier. The results last year included revenue from some properties that have since been sold. Excluding those businesses, revenue fell 7.7 percent. 
The company's online venture, New York Times Digital, reported an operating profit of $6.1 million in the quarter, its first quarterly operating profit ever. That is in contrast to a loss of $17 million last year. The profit reflected substantial expense cuts and came despite a decline in revenue.
Operating profit in the company's broadcast business fell 40 percent, to $6.1 million from $10.2 million, largely because of lower advertising revenue. The company said the quarter a year earlier benefited from political advertising, while the latest quarter was hurt by the pre-emption of regular commercials and programming in the wake of the terrorist attacks. Excluding special items, the company said that the operating profit decline in the broadcast segment was 44.9 percent.
Executives at the Times Company refrained from giving guidance regarding results for the fourth quarter or the year. "Economic uncertainty makes it difficult to give guidance for the balance of the year," Mr. Forman said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 19, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about third-quarter results for The New York Times Company misstated the operating profit of the company's online division, New York Times Digital. It was $786,000 ($6.1 million was the figure for the company's broadcast business).

HEADLINE: A Downturn Settles In Downtown; 
Shoppers Are Indulging, But Not Near Attack Site

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
By the time Jose Hernandez arrived at his job at Broome Street Flowers and Interiors in SoHo on Sept. 11, he had already seen the fiery slashes in the World Trade Center and knew a catastrophe was in the making. Still, he followed his routine, prepping newly bought willow and berry branches for display. 
 The branches were never sold, of course. Within an hour, the towers had collapsed and Manhattan was being sealed off below 14th Street. By the time the authorities let Mr. Hernandez back into the store three days later, the berries had shed all over the floor. He was able to save his delicate yucca palms, but those have not sold since, either. A month later, Mr. Hernandez estimates his business is still off some 80 percent. 
 In a shopping district a short subway ride -- and yet a universe -- away, players seemed to be acting out of a different script. A woman walked into Anne Fontaine, a boutique on Madison Avenue and 67th Street where blouses sell for $168 on average, bought six, and asked to have them ironed and delivered.
The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center sent economic shock waves rippling up all of New York's renowned shopping avenues, but display windows did not rattle equally. Consider the disparate impact on SoHo and Madison Avenue, perhaps New York's most famous byways of unapologetic consumption.
Both districts have emporiums filled with delectables as different as spike-heeled boots and antique Japanese crockery. But SoHo -- with its greater proximity to ground zero, greater reliance on tourists and a set of stores that cater not to the deeply entrenched superwealthy but rather their more financially vulnerable, newly minted cousins -- has been in much more pain.
Even these days as the October light illuminates the fire escapes on the converted industrial lofts, the urban-perfect streetscapes are empty. At the flea market at Wooster and Spring Streets, half of the stalls have closed. 
"It is very, very slow," said Avital Alfasi, who sells fleece hats and bohemian velvet scarves. "It is so sad. Normally on the weekends it would be packed with people from New Jersey and Long Island sitting outside and drinking coffee. Now there is nobody. You don't even see shopping bags anymore."
Far uptown, the boutique operators on Madison Avenue say the fallout from the terrorist attack has been far less stark.
True, the kind of sang-froid demonstrated by the Anne Fontaine customer was unusual. For several days after the terrorist attack, business along the avenue dropped off significantly, and several stores say they are still hurting. On a recent Friday afternoon, the Valentino store on 65th Street was devoid of customers, and at Mario Caldi, a nearby men's clothing store where Italian suits are priced from $950 to $2,500, Asad Haider, a salesman, said that nothing had sold the entire day. 
Still, the storekeepers say, the total effect of the trade center disaster has been more like a slap on the cheek than a body blow. Madison Avenue is such an island unto itself that, amazingly, a few store managers even said that sales had been up in the aftermath of Sept. 11. 
Wide flat-screen televisions with the latest in so-called plasma technology priced at $8,000 to $16,000 are continuing to sell at Red Rose Music on 74th Street, said Mark Herman, an audio-visual designer. 
At Zitomer's, an upscale pharmacy on 76th Street, toy sales have increased 10 percent over this time last year. And for reasons that Karl Wong, the toy department manager, cannot explain, many parents started doing their Christmas toy shopping in September.
"We're doing really well," echoed Gloria Karlitz, the manager of a Searle clothing store on 84th Street, where customers have been snapping up $400 winter coats. "Maybe people feel safer on 84th Street than further downtown."
Geography certainly explains, in part, why SoHo is suffering. The silhouettes of the giant trade center towers once loomed above Canal Street. So, their collapse radically changed both the physical and psychic space of the area.
Like the nearby neighborhoods of TriBeCa and Battery Park City, SoHo has been partly depopulated. Those who have stayed put in their homes and businesses still have not wiped away all the ashy fallout from the wreckage and are reconstructing their lives in a way that uptown neighbors have not had to do.
Norman Kornbleuth, owner of the Broadway Panhandler, a popular cookware store on Broome Street, said that most of his regular customers lived beneath 23rd and were too traumatized by events to go shopping. "People are just staying closer to home," he said. His sales are down about 25 percent since Sept. 11.
Proximity to the devastation zone is only part of the equation, however. Madison Avenue is somewhat sheltered from economic downturns by the special nature of its customer base: rich, local and, well, very rich. Local is critical right now as out-of-towners from Princeton to Tokyo are shunning the city. No place is better equipped than Madison Avenue, with its army of immaculately coifed sales associates, to lure customers back on a one-by-one basis.
"Many salespeople have been working with clients for many years,dressing them and giving them advice," said Matthew Bauer, the president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District, which represents 650 businesses from 61st to 85th Streets. "Because of these long-term relationships, our stores will be able to weather the storm," he said.
While Madison Avenue boutiques have built business by coddling clients, SoHo, with a less dense population base -- locals tend to live in huge loft spaces in low-slung buildings -- relies heavily on the bused-in hordes. On a recent afternoon, Dom, a furniture store specializing in moderately priced items like inflatable chairs and mirrored globes, was empty. 
"Without the tourists," said the store manager, Luigi Borrata, "it is totally slow."
Then there is the matter of wealth. SoHo has only recently become a truly luxe shopping district with stores like Chanel and Louis Vuitton. It attracts its share of the monied, but in general the stores strategically aim to appeal to a broader clientele than those up on Madison Avenue, which are quite intentionally practical only to those in the stratospheric income levels. Such an ultrarich clientele is naturally more immune to the stock market swings and recession fears that have followed the trade center attack. 
For example, if Jeanne Coogan was worried about her long-term economic prospects last week, she wasn't showing it as she strolled Madison Avenue. Ms. Coogan said she heeded the mayor's call to save the city by shopping. Since the 11th, she has bought about 40 percent more than she usually does in a comparable period, she estimated, including treating herself to such luxuries as a jeweled handbag. 
"I'm living every day like it could be my last," she said.

HEADLINE: Locking Up The Plastic; 
Many Americans Cut Back On High-Interest Debt

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Worried about rising layoffs and a falling stock market, Americans in recent months have cut back on their use of credit cards for the first time in almost 10 years. The trend seems to have accelerated in the weeks since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, bank executives say.
 This new frugality comes after a decade in which ever-growing levels of consumer debt helped drive the longest economic boom in American history. 
 With the economy weakening, however, a small but growing number of people are falling behind on credit card and mortgage payments. A much larger group of Americans, meanwhile, seems to be deciding that their debt -- or at least their high-interest credit card debt -- has reached its limit. 
The overall financial condition of American consumers remains fairly strong, thanks to a robust housing market, at least five years of solid income gains and stock prices that despite a sharp drop, remain generally higher than they were for most of the last decade.
But the situation has still weakened severely the last year, as the average net worth of households has fallen 14 percent, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
The new skittishness of consumers suggests that many are becoming more conservative in uncertain times, lowering the odds of huge bankruptcy problems if the country falls into a long recession.
On the other hand, a continued decline in personal debt could prolong a downturn by crimping consumer spending, one of the few strengths of the American economy over the last year.
The decline in consumer credit "is a short-term risk," said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, "but a longer-term healthy development."
Already, some borrowers are feeling squeezed. Providian Financial, an aggressive issuer of credit cards to high-risk borrowers, said last week that its earnings for the third quarter would be far lower than earlier predicted, largely because of higher-than-expected losses in September from its credit card customers.
Not all forms of debt are becoming less popular, however. With 30-year mortgage rates now at an average of about 6.6 percent, down from 7 percent in August and 7.8 percent a year ago, millions of Americans are refinancing their home loans. 
Last week, an index of mortgage-application activity reached its highest level since the Mortgage Bankers Association of America began calculating it in 1990, the association said yesterday. As applications for new-home loans have fallen almost 8 percent since Sept. 11, refinancing loans have surged.
But even these new loans show signs of changed economic times. In recent weeks, when people have refinanced, many have chosen to lower their monthly payments or shorten the terms of their loans, rather than to increase their debt and receive cash in return, Kevin M. Shannon, the president of Bank of America Consumer Real Estate, said.
"People are taking the opportunity to get their financial house in order," Mr. Shannon said.
The credit card statistics tell a similar story.
From May to August, the last month for which the Federal Reserve has published data, outstanding consumer credit remained virtually unchanged, falling $100 million, to about $1.59 trillion. That is the first time since 1992 that the number did not rise over a four-month period, and it is a sharp turnaround from the previous year.
In the 12 months leading up to May, consumer credit -- which includes credit card, automobile, student and various other loans -- grew $142 billion, or 9.8 percent.
Neither the government nor banking industry groups have released statistics on borrowing patterns since Sept. 11, but anecdotal evidence indicates that the attacks, and the increased likelihood of recession, have made people only more conservative.
"Right after Sept. 11, volume went off a cliff," Sanford I. Weill, the chief executive of Citigroup, the largest issuer of credit cards, said in an interview yesterday. "Half of that decline has been recovered."
Still, Mr. Weill said, the average amount that Citigroup customers are charging on their cards is 5 percent lower than it was a year ago.
The leveling off of consumer debt seems likely to continue in the coming months, according to a poll released yesterday by the Gallup Organization. Only 12 percent of Americans said they planned to increase their debts over the next six months, while 43 percent said they expected to lower their debt level, according to Gallup.
In some cases, consumers are simply switching to other forms of payments -- ones that do not include possible interest charges -- rather than cutting back on spending by the same amount that they are reducing credit card purchases. Gallup reported that 21 percent of Americans said their spending level would rise over the next six months, while 28 percent said it would decline.
Karen Swartz, an executive assistant at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadephia, said she was not worried about losing her job but had become more frugal in recent months. She has begun going to consignment shops more often than to Lord & Taylor, and she is relying on cash rather than her credit cards.
"So many of us got comfy while the economy was chugging along and didn't think that what went up had to come down," Ms. Swartz, 43, said. Even before Sept. 11, she had set a goal of cutting her family's credit card debt in half, to less than $3,000. Since the attacks, she has become even more careful.
"We're trying to be prepared for the out-of-the-blue stuff," she said.
Ms. Swartz's spending habits seem to be common. In reporting its third-quarter earnings on Monday, Bank of America said that credit card charges had fallen 5 to 8 percent since Sept. 11 but that debit card charges had remained roughly flat. Debit cards withdraw money directly from a bank account, avoiding the risk of interest rate charges that comes with credit card purchases.
The bank, which holds more money from consumers than any other in the country, also said that average deposits in money market savings accounts were 22 percent higher last month than they had been in September 2000.
In addition to slowing their borrowing, people have been helped by falling interest rates, which lower monthly credit card charges. Since the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark short-term interest rate 4 percentage points and the average variable rate on credit cards has dropped almost as much -- 3.3 percentage points, according to Bankrate.com.
Now, however, many interest rates are approaching the floor that credit card companies say they will not breach. "We're near a point at which rates on cards will not drop, no matter how low interest rates go," Greg McBride, an analyst with Bankrate .com, said.
For now, delinquency rates on credit cards and mortgages remain lower than they were during some parts of the 1990's. But the delinquency rate for credit cards has risen 18 percent since last summer, and the rates for mortgages are more than 20 percent higher than they were a year ago. Analysts predict that continuing job cuts will cause late payments to increase further in coming months.
Personal bankruptcy filings, at about 29,000 a week nationwide, are only slightly higher than they were in August. But there are exceptions. 
With many fewer people boarding airplanes since Sept. 11, hotels, resorts and casinos are all emptier than usual, bringing economic hardship on their employees. In Nevada, bankruptcy filings are 39 percent higher than a year ago, according to Economy.com. In Hawaii, they are 63 percent higher.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Sony and Other TV Studios To Cut New Programming

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Facing economic strains and a steep downturn in the advertising market, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox Broadcasting and the USA Network are cutting back on new programming, television executives said today.
 In the last few days, Sony Pictures Entertainment has been completing plans to halt development of new prime-time programming and cut back its television operations. For a producer of programs like "The King of Queens" and "Family Law" on CBS, as well as "Dawson's Creek" on WB, it is a potentially significant withdrawal. 
 A crucial reason for Sony's planned move is that it is one of the few top studios without a broadcast network, like Walt Disney, which owns ABC or Viacom Inc., the owner of CBS, making it harder for Sony to gain financial advantages out of the shows it produces. Owning a network gives a studio leverage in negotiating deals with other networks. 
At the same time, the Fox Broadcasting Network has quietly closed its unit making original movies, and the USA Network has diminished the number of films it was scheduled to make. ABC Network executives were also telling producers that the number of films the network was making was being sharply reduced. But one ABC executive said the reason for the reduction was because the network had stockpiled movies because of the threatened strikes by writers and actors in the spring.
Marci Pool, executive vice president for original movies at the Fox Broadcast Network, said that she had been informed by Fox on Tuesday night that she was out of a job, together with two other executives and two assistants.
"It didn't really catch me by surprise because they were talking of cutbacks," Ms. Pool said. "We knew that they would start with those marginalized areas like TV movies that are vulnerable, especially in the kind of economic climate we're in. And that climate predated Sept. 11."
Because networks suspended advertising for five days after the terrorist attacks to provide news coverage, which may have cost as much as $188 million in lost revenue, and because economic uncertainty seized the networks in the months before that, the networks and production companies have begun serious efforts to cut back.
"They have to continue making series so where else can they cut?" Ms. Pool said. "The film side."
Joe Earley, a spokesman for the Fox network, said: "The movie area has been extremely challenging for this network since it began, and even for those networks that have enjoyed success with original movies these are tough times. So for Fox, the movie division is a luxury that we can't afford in the current economic environment."
The effect of the cutbacks in television films -- as well as the overhaul of Sony's Columbia TriStar television unit -- will most certainly change what viewers see on television. There will be fewer original programs and more reruns as well as fewer films on network television. But the film divisions of the major networks have been hurt over the years by the proliferation of cable networks like HBO and Showtime that create original films and series. As a result of these new reductions, the cable networks and others may pick up the slack.
Jill S. Krutick, an entertainment analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said, "The economic environment has caused these companies to look under every rock to cut costs, and programming and production are always a source of heightened expense."
The USA Network, a division of USA Network's Entertainment Group, has also decided to cut back on original films, television executives said. The network's plan to become a significant player in the television films business -- making anywhere from 15 to 18 films a year -- has been cut to about half that number. One executive close to the network attributed the USA Network cutback to "a real tough advertising marketplace that's gotten worse in the last few weeks."
There have been estimates that the networks may incur as much as a 6 percent decline in advertising revenue -- as much as $1 billion -- because of the softening economy, made worse by the terrorist attacks. Networks also face substantial increases in costs because of news coverage of the terrorist attacks. Even before the attacks, networks like NBC had decided to substantially reduce original film operations because of their high costs.
In recent years, many films failed to generate large audiences, partly because of the competition from cable and elsewhere.
The planned Sony cutback stirred the most nervousness in the television industry. A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment on a report in The Los Angeles Times today that as many as 50 to 70 employees could be let go -- as well as hundreds of others connected to production companies that had deals with Sony.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE HARBOR; 
Coast Guard's Gunboats On Watch Against Attack

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
A half dozen times a day, in the choppy waters off Staten Island, a team of Coast Guard officers, police and federal agents board the 800-foot-long cargo ships that steam into the Port of New York and New Jersey from points around the world.
 For the next 90 minutes, the boarding team examines the ship's cargo manifest, confirms that the load is what it is supposed to be and demands to see proof of identity from a crew of 20 or so sailors. Occasionally, the officers will takes explosives-sniffing dogs aboard or have Immigration and Naturalization Service agents escort undocumented immigrants to shore. 
 The fight against terrorism being waged in the waters of New York Harbor in the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center is no less daunting than security efforts on the ground, at airports and on the roads. 
Dozens of Coast Guard cutters are patrolling security zones around New York's waterside landmarks, emergency-operation centers and chemical plants. Gunboats are maneuvering to and fro. The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor is issuing new, tamper-proof photo ID cards for thousands of longshoremen. And a domestic port security operation unprecedented since World War II is under way, said Commander Michael McAllister, the operations chief for the Coast Guard in New York, which is in charge of security on the water.
About 10,000 ships go in and out of New York's seaport in an average year, each with plenty of nooks that could hide terrorists or the tools of mass destruction.
In terms of cargo volume, the port is the largest container port on the East Coast. More than three million cargo containers (each one, on average, weighing 13.3 tons) come through each year, full of everything from sneakers to stereos to steel.
New York is the largest petroleum port in the nation, with more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum, oil and other lubricants delivered annually. Everything from jet fuel for Newark International Airport to home heating oil to gasoline comes through the port. And, according to a 1999 study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the port provides more than 166,000 jobs and $20 billion in annual economic activity.
On the shores around the port, there are about 200 waterfront facilities that deal with hazardous materials, said Beth Rooney, a port security coordinator for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Among them, to the north, on the the Hudson River, are the Indian Point nuclear power plants in Westchester County. To the south, past the Goethals Bridge, which connects Staten Island and New Jersey, there is a profusion of chemical and petroleum plants.
As officials try to choose between security measures that are doable and those that are practical, they have already curtailed certain security measures imposed last month.
Coast Guard officials had shut the port completely for two days after Sept. 11, and then boarded every cargo vessel until Sept. 28. Now they inspect selected ships and board up to half of the 20 or so daily arrivals.
To do this, they are collecting information from the cargo ships 96 hours in advance, passing that data to various law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and boarding those deemed to pose the highest risk, such as ships from some Middle Eastern nations.
"Obviously, something coming from a country we're at war with would draw our attention for targeting much more than something coming from a country we're not at war with," said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Brian T. Fisher.
Recreational vessels are allowed in the harbor only during daylight hours. And cruise ships that normally call at the port must go elsewhere, because the city is using their terminal on the Hudson River for emergency operations.
Last week, the port's Harbor Safety, Navigation and Operations committee set up a new security task force, made up of a cross section of maritime industries and law enforcement agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is studying the consequences of a liquefied-gas explosion, either on land or a ship.
"We're interested in knowing, 'Is it enough to take out a bridge? Or to level a neighborhood?' " said Edwin A. Levine, NOAA's scientific support coordinator. 
Maritime experts and Coast Guard officials say they do not want the waterways to become a target deemed vulnerable by terrorists.
"There are two potential types of attack that most concern pilots," Capt. Michael R. Watson, president of the American Pilots' Association, a national trade association, told a Senate committee on maritime security last week.
"The first would be where one or more individuals takes control of the ship away from the pilot with the intention of steering it into another ship, a bridge, a fuel dock or some other structure with maximum destructive potential," he said. "The second would be, as in the case of the U.S.S. Cole, a deliberate suicide attack on a vessel carrying hazardous cargoes."
This makes for steady pressure on the men and women of the Coast Guard. Last week, as Coast Guard Petty Officer Brendan Fitzpatrick steered his 41-foot cutter north through the quiet New York Harbor, there were four cargo ships off the starboard side that had already been directed to proceed under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
To his port side was the Statue of Liberty, protected by a red and white Coast Guard cutter. And straight off in the distance was a gray and white Coast Guard Port Security Unit, a 25-foot Boston Whaler with three crew members in camouflage whose orders were to protect the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management bunker at Pier 92 on the Hudson.
Those boats, known as River Rats, had not been deployed in a domestic harbor in more than 50 years, crew members said. The unit was on duty in New York for about a month before returning to its Virginia base this week.
As Petty Officer Fitzpatrick pulled up to the Boston Whaler, which had a .50- caliber machine gun in front and two M-60 machine guns in back, one of the men on board, Petty Officer Harry Cantey, slowed its engines and leaned over to speak.
"We've deployed to Panama, Turkey, Egypt," said Petty Officer Cantey, a Vietnam veteran from South Carolina who spoke with a slow cadence.
"And, ah, New York City," he said. "I would have never thought I'd be here."

HEADLINE: Bid for Altered Census Figures Is Rejected 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The Census Bureau said today that it would not adjust the 2000 population tally for use in allocating billions of dollars in annual federal aid across the country.
 The decision means that the federal government will use the raw head count available now to allocate federal aid for Medicaid, foster care and other social service programs. About $185 billion a year was distributed based on population counts from the 1990 census. 
 The Census Bureau and a number of Democrats and liberal groups have clashed for months over whether to adjust the 2000 census figures to make up for millions of uncounted people, mainly racial minorities and renters. 
At a news conference today, William G. Barron Jr., the acting director of the Census Bureau, said the agency rejected using adjusted data for distributing federal money because the data had too many errors to be reliable. 
In March, the bureau said it missed at least 6.4 million people last year and counted at least 3.1 million twice. Mr. Barron said today that enumerators may have double-counted an additional 3 million. 
As was the case in 1990, the adjusted numbers for the 2000 census were produced by a survey, in this case one involving 314,000 households, conducted by the bureau after the traditional decennial count was completed. The final count was 281.4 million. 
In both 1990 and last year, the survey showed the extent to which the census missed millions of people or double-counted others, mainly whites and homeowners. Earlier this year, the Bush administration decided to use the raw head count for the purposes of redrawing Congressional districts. 
Many big-city mayors reacted angrily to that decision.
"It is unfair and unwise," said Mayor Marc H. Morial of New Orleans, the president of the United States Conference of Mayors. "Cities now stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal as well as state aid over the next decade." 
A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York sounded a more resigned note. "We were expecting the administration to use a straight head count, so it was not a surprise to us," said Sid Dinsay, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani. 
Today's decision does not end the dispute. Critics of the Census Bureau are demanding that it immediately release the adjusted data for areas as small as city blocks for all 50 states. 
On Thursday, a lawsuit begins in Federal District Court in Portland, Ore., in which two Oregon state senators are seeking to compel the government to release the detailed data. 
"Cities and planning offices would love to look at the numbers to assess them and better understand them, so they can design better social service programs and the delivery of them," said Veronique Pluviose-Fenton, principal legislative counsel for the National League of Cities in Washington. 
But in a telephone interview today, John H. Thompson, director of the 2000 census, rejected the cities' pleas. "We have no immediate plans to release block-level data," Mr. Thompson said. "It's just too flawed." 
Kenneth Prewitt, the census director in the Clinton administration, defended the bureau's decision today, saying that the "data is driving the decision." But Mr. Prewitt urged census officials to release the block-level data for scientific review. 
Census officials insisted again today that despite the total number of errors in the 2000 census -- 12.5 million people missed or counted twice, just below the 12.8 million errors in 1990 -- the latest count was the most accurate in American history. 
The bureau had said there was a net national undercount of 1.2 percent of the country's 281.4 million people in 2000, or about 3.3 million. The 1990 undercount was 1.6 percent, or about 4 million.
Mr. Barron said today, however, that estimates showed the net undercount in 2000 was reduced to less than 1 percent. He said poverty and unemployment measurements that had long used adjusted data could rely on the more accurate head count. 
Working with the sampling data, census officials said the head count had missed 0.6 percent of the overall population, compared with 1.61 percent in 1990; 0.8 percent of blacks compared with 4.57 percent; and 1.25 percent of Hispanics, compared with nearly 5 percent. 
But Mr. Barron said the bureau had also probably double-counted hundreds of thousands of non-Hispanics whites, a finding that drew criticisms from minority rights groups. 
"They're adding whites who don't exist and leaving out minorities who are consistently passed over," said Karen K. Narasaki, executive director of National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, an advocacy group. "Our concern is to use adjusted numbers for federal allocations to poor people."

HEADLINE: In Woodbridge, Borrowing Doubled Under McGreevey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
In his campaign for New Jersey governor, James E. McGreevey presents himself as the candidate of fiscal common sense. He derides the major proposals of his opponent, Bret D. Schundler -- to eliminate tolls on the Garden State Parkway and allow parents to use tax dollars for private school -- as risky and outlandishly expensive, while portraying himself as a disciplined budget manager.
 To persuade voters, Mr. McGreevey and his aides rely on a neatly tailored summary of his record as mayor here in Woodbridge for the last nine years. He arrived at Town Hall in 1992 to find chaos and malfeasance -- uncashed checks stuffed in a drawer, $650,000 in missing health insurance funds under investigation by federal agents, and a $60 million budget that they say masked a $24 million deficit. 
 As mayor, the story goes, Mr. McGreevey cleaned it all up. He maintained services, kept property taxes stable and held spending in check. The end. 
But the story is not so simple. A review of a decade's worth of town budget records as well as interviews with current and former Woodbridge officials, residents and business owners show that while Mr. McGreevey clearly restored fiscal confidence and stability, the town's financial situation was never as dire as he has suggested.And though he could have chosen a number of strategies to fix problems and meet new goals, Mr. McGreevey has mostly favored borrowing money rather than raising taxes or cutting spending. In the decade since he took office, Woodbridge's borrowing has nearly doubled to about $176 million. This includes $16 million in notes issued just this year to build a long-promised recreation center that was on the verge of becoming a boondoggle. 
Mr. McGreevey's propensity for borrowing stands in contrast to his repeated criticism of former Gov. Christie Whitman for increasing state debt during her two terms. It also raises the question of whether Mr. McGreevey, if elected, can keep his pledge to reduce state debt at a time when New Jersey is facing a deficit of perhaps $1 billion or more.
Mr. McGreevey defends his record by pointing to the town's current fiscal strength. "Moody's Investor Service praised the township for taking the necessary steps to restore fiscal discipline," he said in a recent interview. "We have a Aa-3 bond rating, top 20 percent in the nation." 
Supporters say he should not be held responsible for the largest sum borrowed during his tenure -- $34 million that they say was mostly used to correct problems left by his predecessor and to adjust to a new fiscal calendar. They point out that he has paid down nearly as much debt as he incurred. Still, they agree that Mr. McGreevey's reliance on debt reflects his traditional approach to public finance. 
If Mr. Schundler, the Republican, is something of a financial maverick, wheeling and dealing through two terms as mayor of Jersey City, a close examination of Mr. McGreevey's financial record shows that he prefers to play things safe. Among his most creative deals was an auction of old town vehicles and equipment last year that generated about $135,000 in revenues.
Recently Mr. McGreevey started offering tax abatements to corporations willing to move to Woodbridge and clean up polluted property. In one such deal, FedEx Ground donated $1 million for computer networking in Woodbridge schools.
"I think Jim McGreevey learned sometimes the less you do, the less things that are going on in town, the less people question," Barbara Wyatt, a Woodbridge resident who battled Mr. McGreevey over the demolition of the old Town Hall to make way for a new building. 
In public finance, as in nearly everything else, Mr. McGreevey's pre-eminent skills are political, supporters and critics say. He has artfully used Woodbridge's underlying economic strength to budget with an eye toward his future. He has never raised taxes in an election year, for example. At the same time, his close political allies have profited from his spending and hiring decisions.
Throughout this year's campaign, Mr. McGreevey has said that anyone wondering how he will manage state finances need only look at how he ran Woodbridge, the state's fifth-largest municipality. But he has also preferred to discuss the failings of Mr. Schundler and Jersey City than his own record. 
Woodbridge Township, population 97,000, is a suburb at the intersection of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. It is home to the things that define New Jersey for many people: neatly carved subdivisions, huge malls, big manufacturing plants and office parks.
Buoyed by a robust economy and healthy local tax base, Mr. McGreevey never had to sweat to put the financial ledgers in order, records show. But he did have to clean up a few things. The town's auditors in 1992 found five "material weaknesses" in the budget and made 99 other recommendations. Their only complaint this year was that dog tags were not issued in sequential order. 
Marvin Corwick, a consultant to local governments, said Mr. McGreevey's predecessor, Joe DeMarino, had left town finances in "total disarray." But Mr. Corwick, who worked for Mr. McGreevey during his first year in office, acknowledged that Woodbridge was better positioned than most places to make a quick recovery. 
The town budget has increased to $80 million from $60 million in 1991. Since 1992, taxes have risen by about 2.4 percent a year, within the rate of inflation. And even with added borrowing over the last decade, the town is well within its legal debt limit.
By far, Mr. McGreevey's most important financial decision has came in his first year in office, when he decided to accept a state offer allowing municipalities to adjust their fiscal calendars. In exchange for switching to the state's fiscal year -- giving the state a six-month break from providing local aid -- the towns were permitted to borrow to cover their expenses. 
Mr. McGreevey borrowed $34 million, saying that the money was needed to cover a $24 million deficit $34 million, saying that the money was needed to cover a $24 million deficit masked in the budget by his predecessor.
Mr. McGreevey sold the idea hard. "Without the transfer, Ernst & Young predicted that property taxes would have risen by as much as $600 per household, literally driving people from their homes," he wrote in a four-page letter to the community. 
But not everyone was convinced. Robert F. Gawroniak, a Woodbridge councilman, quit the Democratic Party and became a Republican after he said the McGreevey administration could not prove that the deficit really existed. 
The ultimate cost to taxpayers in interest and principal was estimated at about $60 million over 19 years, with the largest payments beginning in 2001. Since then, the town has refinanced the bonds twice, securing lower interest rates and pushing the large principal payments to 2003.
Whether the strategy is a long-term success will depend largely on how well the town's finances are doing when these payments start coming due. If taxes need to be raised, Mr. McGreevey will likely be held responsible. 
At his State of the Township address in January 1998, Mr. McGreevey grabbed a hockey stick and slapped a puck into a portable goal in a light-hearted stunt to dramatize his announcement that a private company would build a $10 million recreation center, including two hockey rinks, on the site of a former landfill. 
"Our goal is to drop the first puck by the fall or winter of 1999," Mr. McGreevey said. He outlined a plan that he said would not cost the township a cent. "We wanted corporations that would have the necessary available capital for self-financing," he said then. "The one we chose has excellent credentials and a proven track record."
The announcement of the project came less than three months after Mr. McGreevey lost his first campaign for governor and said that he would almost certainly run again. The recreation center is still not finished. The company selected to build it is bankrupt. For now, the town has picked up the $16 million tab.
The developer, Family Golf Centers, of Melville, N.Y., ran into financial problems shortly after work got under way, and the project nearly became mired in bankruptcy proceedings. The center is scheduled to open early next year. 
But the deal is now quite different from what Mr. McGreevey promised in 1998. Instead of a private company paying to build the center, the town has covered the costs through $16 million in short-term bonds. 
Under the original plan, the private owner was to pay to lease the land from the town. Now, the town will pay management fees to a local skating business to run the ice and roller rinks and to the Y.M.C.A. to run the swimming pool and other programs. Woodbridge will keep any profits, and has solicited private donations. The town also plans to sell billboard ads in the skating rinks.
Mr. McGreevey says the center will pay for itself. But if it is not profitable, the taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.
Still, many in town are optimistic. "For pretty minimal dollars, I think they pulled a rabbit out of the hat," said Ray W. Zirpolo, vice chairman of the Woodbridge Chamber of Commerce. He added that he thought Mr. McGreevey had been a good mayor.
Not everyone is a fan. Warren Larsen, who owns an auto parts store, said Mr. McGreevey "calls himself a full-time mayor, but he only spends 5 percent of his time at Town Hall." 
Mr. McGreevey has also been criticized for allowing political allies to profit from town business. Until early this year, the town attorney was Paul M. Weiner, a law parter of Mr. McGreevey's political patron, State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak.
The Schundler campaign has charged that legal fees in Woodbridge have tripled since Mr. McGreevey took office. Rich McGrath, a McGreevey campaign spokesman, said that Woodbridge spends less than other towns its size but acknowledged that Mr. McGreevey had "taken a more activist approach to using the law department to recoup funds for Woodbridge."
If Woodbridge's relationship with the firm of Weiner Lesniak was born of political convenience, it died the same way. Mr. Weiner resigned as town attorney because of his financial interest in a plan to local a waste transfer station in Linden, N.J., a deal that Mr. McGreevey has staunchly opposed.
This is the first of two articles on the records of the major candidates for New Jersey governor. Tomorrow's will examine the record of Bret D. Schundler as Jersey City mayor.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Thursday summarizing the fiscal record of James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, misstated the average annual municipal tax bill for residential property owners in Woodbridge, where he is mayor.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
U.N. Envoy Says All Options Are Open on a Post-Taliban Afghanistan

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
At his first news conference since being named the United Nations point man on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi stressed today that the quest was only beginning for what to do about Afghanistan once the bombing was over and the Taliban defeated. Diplomats said his private message has been that "all options are bad."
 "We've got to be very careful," said Mr. Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, in what soon became a slogan. 
 "It's a new situation." 
"Our options are open." 
"Don't rush to any solution." 
The United Nations is "definitely" not seeking to form a protectorate, he said, and it should "never rush into sending a peacekeeping operation." The Afghans, he reminded reporters, were a nation that had never accepted foreign troops, Islamic or otherwise.
"We cannot produce a solution out of a hat to this problem," said Mr. Brahimi, who resigned in 1999 as special representative for Afghanistan out of frustration. "All we can do is bring the parties that have a say together. And we will go wherever and whenever it is useful."
Diplomats who had met with Mr. Brahimi on Tuesday in a closed session of the Security Council said his caution was not political evasion but a reflection of a hard truth that he had impressed on the Council: that a bitterly fragmented country, one with a marginal infrastructure, no national army but huge amounts of arms and surrounded by nervous and unstable neighbors, offered no easy solutions. The task at hand, the diplomats said, was to identify the one "least bad" option and to determine what it would take to make it work. 
The various options that have been raised include holding a conclave of tribal leaders to form a broad coalition under the symbolic leadership of the deposed 87-year-old Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah; forming a United Nations peacekeeping force and a United Nations administration; or sending in a Muslim security force, as Turkey has proposed. 
But none of these were recommended at the Council meeting, and diplomats involved in the consultations agreed that the discussions dwelt more on the enormous internal and regional complexity of the problem than on any concrete solution.
"The positive message from Washington is that there's real will and a real goal," one Western diplomat said. "But I'm not sure any concrete steps on how to get there are jelling yet." 
That problem has become increasingly evident in recent weeks in Washington. Officials there have acknowledged, for example, that the Central Intelligence Agency has so far failed to identify any elements in the dominant Pashtun ethnic group, in which the Taliban has its roots, that could become part of a new ruling coalition. Without the Pashtun, a government would not function, and would not be accepted by Pakistan, which is suspicious of the ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks of the opposition Northern Alliance.
Since being reappointed special representative to Afghanistan by Secretary General Kofi Annan, Mr. Brahimi has had consultations in Paris and London. On Thursday he is scheduled to meet with Richard N. Haass, the State Department director of policy planning, who has been named special coordinator for Afghanistan, and on Friday he plans to hold further talks with American officials in Washington.
In general, the search for a post-Taliban administration has become a major preoccupation. The issue was a central theme of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's talks earlier this week with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistan president, and other southern Asian leaders, and Mr. Haass has traveled to Rome to meet with Mr. Zahir, who has been suggested as a uniting symbol for the opposing Afghan factions. Officials from Britain, France and Germany plan to meet in Ghent, Belgium, on Friday to discuss Afghanistan.
The fundamental problem is to bring order to a country that has known none in almost three decades. Afghanistan has been wracked with civil strife more or less continuously since Mr. Zahir, who had ruled for 40 years, was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud. Five years later, Mr. Daoud was overthrown and killed in a Communist-led revolution, opening a struggle among pro-Communist factions. 
In December 1979, the Soviet Army marched in to try to end that strife, but instead touched off a civil war that lasted a decade. When the Soviets left, the rebel factions who fought against them, each heavily armed with American and captured Soviet weapons, started fighting one another. 
The Taliban, a militant Islamic group, came to prominence in early 1995 largely as a response to fatigue with the war. They quickly gathered strength, taking first Kandahar and then, in September 1996, the capital, Kabul. Their opponents were driven north, where they formed the loose Northern Alliance. 
The Taliban, with their roots among the Pashtun, were at first a popular antidote to the endless civil fighting among rival groups, and to the corruption and lawlessness that had spread through the land. Inexperienced in politics, economics or cultural affairs, the Taliban set about building a society on strict Islamic principles, banning television, music and movies, introducing public executions and amputations and barring women from jobs and schools. 
The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden when he had to leave Sudan, welcoming him as a comrade from the struggle against Soviet forces and as a Muslim hero.
But the Taliban never formed a formal administration, and it is this void that now confronts the United States and its allies with a dangerous vacuum, and possible new civil war, if the movement is removed from power. 
"They have no national army," said Barnett Rubin, an expert on central Asia at New York University. "The Taliban Army, which includes Al Qaeda, is an army of factions. If any army enters Kabul, they'll have a civil war. There's no treasury, no ministry of finance, no central bank, nowhere to put the reconstruction money. There's no judiciary, no dispute-resolution mechanism."
The enormous challenge, Mr. Brahimi said, was not new, and his frustration at failing to achieve any progress there persuaded him to quit in 1999 after two years as special United Nations representative. At that time, he said, the Afghan factions saw only two options -- total victory or war -- and the rest of the world had no interest in the country.
"Now the situation has changed," he said. "It's reasonable to expect that the Afghans will not have the second option, and also, quite clearly, there is a very real political will that is emerging and consolidating to support the United Nations in providing relief, in the peacemaking effort and later. This is very substantial change, and I think it is reasonable to think that perhaps we can do something now."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: OTTAWA; 
Canada Pushes Broad Antiterror Measure, Alarming Some Who Fear Erosion of Rights

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The Canadian government introduced the most stringent antiterrorism legislation in the country's history this week, allowing preventive arrests and broader electronic surveillance. 
 It also grants the power to compel testimony during investigations, setting aside the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. 
 Taken together with new regulations stepping up border operations and revamping immigration procedures since the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, the legislation represents the first step toward dealing with a new sense of danger across North America, Foreign Minister John Manley said in an interview today. 
He said the government would also consider establishing a foreign intelligence service, which Canada does not have. 
The measures are being promoted as making Canada safer, not as a response to similar new laws in the United States or Britain, which they resemble.
"There's quite an instinctive realization that what happened on Sept. 11 may have been an attack on somewhat symbolic targets but that they were symbols of open and free societies, including our own," said Mr. Manley, who is chairman of a cabinet committee on antiterrorism.
"I think Canadians understand perfectly well that we would be naive to believe that we do not have people linked to Al Qaeda within Canada and that they might take action against Canada," he said. "After all, we are the third-largest contributor in a military sense to the campaign that's going on now."
As Mr. Manley spoke, Prime Minister Jean Chretien was in Halifax, Nova Scotia, seeing off three Canadian ships -- a destroyer, a frigate and a supply ship -- headed for the Arabian Sea to join the American-led coalition attacking Afghanistan. Canada has pledged ships, aircraft and about 2,000 troops to the campaign..
The antiterrorism bill, presented to Parliament on Monday, is subject to weeks of debate and committee hearings, and its final form is uncertain. 
Legal experts, civil rights organizations and advocates of immigrant rights and a liberal asylum policy are alarmed at the sweep of the proposal and have raised questions about other measures already announced to expand the powers of the police and immigration authorities. 
Simon Potter, the first vice president of the Canadian Bar Association, said in an interview today that the organization saw "red flags" in the legislation and had formed a team of lawyers to study it and recommend changes to the government.
"In many, many aspects, it does things that Canada has never seen before," said Mr. Potter, an expert on constitutional law. The only parallel, he said, was a war powers act invoked briefly in Quebec in October 1970, when armed separatists took hostages and assassinated the provincial justice minister. 
"Even if we accept that enhanced enforcement powers are needed, and even if we accept that the point of balance between security and individual rights has shifted, we nevertheless have to work to make that new balance," he said. 
"This new legislation has causes for concern: the definition what terrorist activities are, the provision for preventative arrest and the provision for forcing people to testify even if they don't want to. It is disturbing to think that police can arrest you and keep you until they think you aren't going to be a menace any more." 
He added that since Canadians do not have constitutional protection against self-incrimination, compulsory testimony is worrying. "Never in Canada have we forced people to abandon their right to silence in an investigation," he said.
In separate actions earlier this month, Canada's immigration minister, Elinor Caplan, announced that 300 more immigration and customs officers would be hired to screen would-be refugees or asylum-seekers and detain those found potentially dangerous. Immigrants will have to carry a plastic identity card, not unlike the American "green card," enhanced with a magnetic stripe and photograph. An earlier version of this card was found to be easy to tamper with or forge.
Tighter border controls are a problem for both Canada and the United States, given the length of their border and the isolation of many areas.
The Canadian government remains opposed to integrated American-Canadian immigration and asylum policies and practices, however. Such policies, intended to form a North American "security perimeter," have been proposed for several years by the United States.
"I'm concerned that the perimeter concept is something that is not well defined, and it lies out there somewhere, and we may get to it sometime," Mr. Manley said today. 
"Right now, in the urgency of the time, we need to deal with real, practical problems because we've got a border that is the busiest in the world, on which two economies depend -- and it's moving slowly." He said that if traffic was suffering fewer delays, it was because freight volumes "are way down." About $1.5 billion in commerce crosses the border daily at the best of times.
Mr. Manley would not be drawn into a defense of Canada against persistent allegations that it bore responsibility for terrorists entering the United States. He said that even his American friends still seemed to believe that two of the Sept. 11 hijackers had gone to Boston from Canada, though neither American nor Canadian investigators have reported any evidence of this. He said Canadian diplomats in the United States had been asked to counter these assertions.

HEADLINE: Life Insurers Seek Study Of Terror Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
At a time when the fear of bioterrorism is spreading, the life insurance industry plans to ask the White House and Congress today to consider providing aid in the event of a major attack, according to the industry's chief lobbyist.
 But with both the Bush administration and many Congressional leaders saying they will refuse further pleas from businesses hurt by terrorism, the prospects for the life insurers appear doubtful. 
 Congress has already approved a $15 billion bailout for the airlines, and it is divided over the president's proposal to cap the liability of property and casualty insurers in future terrorist attacks. As a fallback, the life insurers want Congress to create a commission to determine whether the industry deserves government help. 
The life insurers say they have been developing their proposal ever since the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, and that their decision to present it today is not related to the anthrax attacks that have even affected Congress.
"The timing of the proposal and the latest anthrax episode is completely coincidental," said Phil Anderson, the chief lobbyist for the American Council of Life Insurers. The council drafted the proposal.
In trying to attach their proposal to measures to relieve the property insurers, the life insurers are trying to distinguish themselves from an array of industries seeking help. Their proposal, the life insurers say, would have no immediate costs.
They say they can pay all the claims from the terrorist attacks. "There is no visible evidence of a problem at this time," Mr. Anderson said. "But due diligence requires that we study the potential problems that could occur."
The life insurers want the commission, which would be headed by the secretary of the Treasury, to be established as part of the legislation to aid the property insurers. Under their plan, the commission would have a life of four months. "Given the unknowable aspect of what lies ahead," Mr. Anderson said, "it is only logical that the industry and Congress do some spade work about what they think about this." J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said he was not sure whether the life insurers might need government help. But he said that the industry itself should try to prove its needs, rather than asking Congress for a study. "They have all the data," he said. "They could say to Congress, 'Here's when we might need help, if we had 500,000 deaths, or if it's 50,000.' Then Congress could have a hearing and critique it."
Administration officials say they aided the airline industry and want to help property and casualty insurers, because both are essential to the economy in general. With some major insurers refusing to provide terrorism coverage beyond the end of the year, the White House and some lawmakers fear the disruption of many businesses, including real estate and construction, whose lenders demand full insurance coverage.
Congress is also reluctant to extend aid to other industries. Several Congressional aides, who have not yet seen a proposal, were dubious yesterday about whether such a life insurance measure would pass. Congressional leaders themselves were reluctant to comment. 
While life insurance plays a far smaller role in the economy than does property insurance, the life insurers say that a tragedy that exhausted their ability to pay could create major social strains. 
Mr. Anderson said that there was a critical difference in providing help to life insurers and to travel and leisure industries. "Families have depended on financial security via life insurance benefits," he said. "You don't have to take trips to Cancun. People do have to make the mortgage payments and pay for the kids' education."
Though the proposal anticipates the possibility of biological and chemical attacks, Mr. Anderson said the decision to issue it today had not been provoked by the anthrax incidents. "This is something we started on the morning after Sept. 11," he said. "It was the proper thing for us to be looking at."

HEADLINE: Candidates for Governor Have Differences, on Tolls and in Polls 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
A day after a radio debate that turned into a noisy free-for-all, the candidates for governor of New Jersey today sniped back and forth over parkway tolls and a new poll that may or may not show the race tightening.
 Bret D. Schundler, the former mayor of Jersey City, brought his crusade to rid the Garden State Parkway of tolls to the steps of the State House, where he stood side by side with Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a fellow Republican, who told how that state got tolls off the Merritt Parkway in the 1980's. 
 Mr. Rowland encouraged New Jersey voters to back Mr. Schundler so they could improve their state's reputation. "A lot of people look at this state as the toll state," he said.
Mr. Schundler said that he could make the Garden State Parkway toll-free in only nine months, and at relatively little cost to the state. But his Democratic rival, James E. McGreevey, has questioned Mr. Schundler's honesty with the voters, asserting that it would be impossible, and irresponsible, to remove the tolls in less than a year but that only Mr. McGreevey was willing to say so.
"To say that we can't get it done in nine months, when the state of Connecticut got it done in less time than that, is just ridiculous," Mr. Schundler told a crowd of supporters. "Just go to the polls and vote for me, and you will see that it does happen."
Moments later, however, Mr. Rowland acknowledged that the tolls were removed from the Merritt Parkway in phases, and that the state's gas tax was increased as a result. And Mr. McGreevey's campaign later provided news clippings saying that it had taken 27 months for the Merritt Parkway to become toll-free, and longer than that to take down the toll booths themselves, and that the Connecticut gas tax rose from 13 cents a gallon in 1984 to 39 cents in 1991. It has since dropped to 25 cents, Mr. Rowland said today.
Since last week, Mr. Schundler has been banging away at the issue of taxation -- tolls, for him, are just another tax -- by saying he would cut taxes while Mr. McGreevey would raise them. And his aides crowed at the results of a new Quinnipiac University poll released today, which showed Mr. McGreevey's lead at only 49 to 39 percent among likely voters. Other recent polls have had Mr. McGreevey's lead at 14 points.
"We've said it all along, and this new poll bears it out," said Bill Pascoe, Mr. Schundler's campaign manager. "Voters looking for strong leadership, who know that the best way to keep our economy strong is to cut taxes, are moving to Bret."
The respondents to Quinnipiac's poll, which had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points, may have included a greater share of Republicans than the voting public, however. When asked which party they identified with, 34 percent of likely voters said they considered themselves Republicans, and 28 percent said Democrats. But recent state election results have shown a greater turnout among Democrats.
In addition, this was the first time that Quinnipiac polled likely voters about the governor's race. A Sept. 27 poll of registered voters showed Mr. McGreevey leading by 44-30 percent. In today's poll, among registered voters, Mr. McGreevey, remained ahead by the same 14 points, but now by 49-35 percent.

Larger Story In the Tales Of the Jobless

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THEY came from Nyack and Ho Ho Kus, not to mention Bushwick and Rego Park. They were nowhere near the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, and they were down the block. 
 They are salesmen and women and lawyers, marketing directors and chambermaids, waitresses and clerks, and what united them yesterday was the hope that after standing for hours in the punishing wind outside Madison Square Garden, they might get that increasingly precious commodity in New York: a job. 
 The Twin Towers Expo, yesterday's city-sponsored job fair, drew about 8,000 people and 200 companies. The event was so mobbed that 2,000 of the job hopefuls never even got in after waiting for hours. If their patience holds out, they will get a second chance at another fair that the city decided to schedule for Oct. 25. 
Stunning enough.
Even more so were what the stories of those many seekers of jobs reveal about the New York City of today -- about the impact of the softening economy before Sept. 11 and the very broad secondary effect of the attacks. About the meshlike interconnections between what happens in Silicon Alley or in Lower Manhattan and the course of thousands of people's lives. All kinds of people.
Cristina Giovine of Toms River, N.J. She has been out of work for six months, victim of the dot-com debacle. No luck yet. "It's not for lack of looking" she said as she stood in front of Madison Square Garden, part of the crowd turned away because of the unexpectedly large turnout. Ms. Giovine, 26, had been a marketing specialist with YOUpowered.com, an Internet start-up company. Now she's marketing her resume and living back home in New Jersey. "Everyone told me, wait until Labor Day, when people are hiring again. Then everything went bust. You know the worst thing? It isn't the money factor, it's the psychological factor. I loved living in New York." 
Sabina Rendall of Brooklyn. She was laid off in the spring from the accounting department of the Radisson Hotels. "They cut down and started laying off," said Ms. Rendall, 44, who has an 11-year-old daughter. "It's getting tough because a lot of people lost jobs."
James Sestito, a marketing director. He was dropped on Sept. 26 by a company in Little Falls, N.J., that organizes conferences on diversity and other human resources subjects. People don't want to fly, he said. No flying, no conferences. "What happened down there was so terrible, and the ripple effect is amazing," said Mr. Sestito, 31, who lives in Neptune City, N.J.
Mary-Lee Costello, who handled imports for a children's dress company until Sept. 20. "My boss said there's going to be a protracted war and wants to focus on domestic production," said Ms. Costello of Ho Ho Kus, who is 50. She didn't find a job yesterday, but had to wait so long she got through a few chapters of "Pride and Prejudice."
Griselda Santiago, a hotel maid at the Hilton on 42nd Street, until she lost her job a week ago. Ms. Santiago, 37, who lives with her two children in Washington Heights, spent all afternoon speaking to prospective employers at the fair. "It's the same everywhere I go. No job. Leave a resume, put in an application. That's it."
Shin Moto of Brooklyn, a tour guide with a Midtown company for two years, until a week after the attack on the towers, where he used to take tourists every day. "Tourists don't come anymore." he said. "This is the first time I lose a job."
Denise Quevedo, 22, a hostess at a restaurant near the Winter Garden. Until Sept. 11. "The building is destroyed," said Ms. Quevedo, who immigrated from Ecuador four years ago and lives in Queens. She is having trouble getting unemployment insurance, she said. "They send me papers and papers and papers."
MS. QUEVEDO had not gotten a job by midafternoon, nor had anyone else cited above. Several hours of interviewing yesterday failed to find any people who had gotten job offers at the fair, though representatives of many companies said they hoped to hire some applicants who had left resumes with them. At a news conference with Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles, recruiters with a few companies said they had made offers for mostly entry-level or seasonal jobs, including 20 at Duane Reade and 12 at Macy's.
There were many others, said the mayor's office, but it had no hard numbers on total job offers. Mr. Coles declared success: "There are as many jobs available as people who want them," he said. "We have to match them to the right jobs." 
It was tempting to accept his arithmetic. But somehow, a day watching thousands of people looking futilely for work suggested that matters are not quite that simple.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE HOME STATE; 
Anthrax Scare Finds Way to South Dakota

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Mary Batcheller spent much of her 89th birthday worrying in front of the television.
 Her oldest grandson, Paul Batcheller, is an economic adviser to Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, in his Washington office. Mr. Batcheller sits around the corner from where an aide opened a letter on Monday that was contaminated with a potent strain of anthrax. But when Mrs. Batcheller returned home Tuesday night after a birthday dinner at Callaway's Kitchen with Paul's father and brother, the phone rang. 
 "Bless him, he called me on my birthday after all this," she said today in her apartment here in the Waterford retirement home. "He said, 'I want you to know I'm all right.' I thought that was wonderful."
Mr. Daschle's Capitol Hill office remained quarantined today and at least 31 of his employees tested positive for exposure to anthrax, as fears began to fester here in the senator's home state. Though officials would not identify the Daschle aides who had been exposed, about half of his Washington staff is from this sparsely populated state that is like one stretched-out small town, with people always saying how everyone knows everyone.
"It's home now, isn't it?" asked Chuck Pugh, referring to the national anthrax scare as he tended bar at Skelly's, a pub in the small historic downtown of Sioux Falls, a city of 124,000 people. "Right here. It's our people."
Indeed it is. The headline this morning in The Argus Leader, the local paper, shouted, "Anthrax Fears Ripple to S.D." At the Country Inn & Suites, where Mr. Daschle, a Democrat, stays whenever he is in town, a note taped behind the front desk warned: "Do not open any junk mail, may contain anthrax!"
Like everywhere across America, there have been needless scares here -- a church reported a suspicious letter with no return address; a lawyer called the police about a letter from a Middle Eastern client; a woman worried about an envelope with a New Jersey postmark -- but suddenly the distant crisis feels very close.
People were even starting to question whether it was merely coincidental that another letter actually containing anthrax had been received by Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor who grew up in Webster, S.D., a town of 12,000. "Maybe it's a South Dakota thing," said Earl Buckelew, a technology consultant, only half-joking.
This morning, Tracey Visser, the receptionist at an engineering firm that shares a two-story brick office building with Mr. Daschle's field office, was sorting the mail when she came across a postcard intended for the senator.
She brought it across the hall, only to learn that mail from Mr. Daschle's offices here, and in Rapid City and Aberdeen, is all being rerouted to Washington so it can be screened by the Capitol police.
"I don't think they're going to target Schmitz, Kalda & Associates in Sioux Falls," Ms. Visser said, thinking through her own mail-sorting procedures.
After a pause, she added, "I guess it can happen anywhere, whether you're in South Dakota or not."
Mr. Daschle's office here was quiet this afternoon, its reception desk, flanked by the American and state flags, vacant. On the bulletin board, newspaper clippings outlining facts about anthrax and how to handle suspicious mail hung above an Oct. 5 news release with Mr. Daschle's statement on a farm bill and a sign-up sheet for people to cook meals for a disabled employee. Many of the Washington staff members started as interns here in the field office; they are old friends from office retreats and the campaign trail.
"You think about what people who had people in the World Trade Center felt like," said Steve Erpenbach, Mr. Daschle's state director, who worked in Washington from 1994 to 1996. "It just gives you a little snapshot."
Throughout the state, relatives and friends of the Washington employees spent the day wondering who had tested positive and reminding themselves that the employees had been taking antibiotics since the letter was discovered. 
Faye Frerich, who lives on a 1,000-acre farm in Wilmot, a town of 500 in the northeast corner of the state, could not help but revisit her decision to let her 16-year-old son, Jason, spend the semester as a page in the Senate, delivering mail, among other things.
"He walks around all those offices and he's touching things and going in and out of everywhere," Mrs. Frerich said. "I'm wondering about everything and the facts that we're waiting for keep changing, so all we can do is wait.
"I keep on feeling like I should go out there to be with him, but he says he's fine. You know he's more worried than he's ever been. He said he saw a ghost this morning."
Mrs. Batcheller was hoping for another call from her grandson, to find out if he was among those who had inhaled the bacteria. "That's him when he was a little kid," she said, showing off his pictures. "Isn't he good-looking?"

HEADLINE: National Briefing Mid-Atlantic: Maryland: Cuts And A Freeze 

BYLINE:  By Gary Gately (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Gov. Parris N. Glendening imposed a statewide hiring freeze, ordered departmental spending cuts and delayed $65 million in construction projects. About $6 million in spending for added security since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks contributed to the budget squeeze, Mr. Glendening, a Democrat, said. He also cited a softening national economy and a decline in state tax revenue in the past month. All state departments except those with "critical security personnel" must freeze hiring and cut spending by 1.5 percent. The cost-cutting is expected to save $205 million by the end of the state's fiscal year on June 30.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ANTHRAX THREAT; 
TESTS SHOW ANTHRAX EXPOSURE IN AT LEAST 30 CAPITAL WORKERS

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Concern about biological terrorism heightened today as preliminary tests showed that 31 workers on Capitol Hill were exposed to anthrax spores from the contaminated letter sent to the office of the Senate majority leader.
 Early testing of the anthrax samples found in the offices of news organizations in New York and Florida showed that they were of the same strain, investigators said. 
 Attorney General John Ashcroft said there was no evidence that anyone in Washington had yet been infected with what he called a "virulent, strong, very serious" form of powdery anthrax that was found in a letter on Monday in the office of the majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. But word that more than half the workers in Mr. Daschle's suite were exposed prompted the closing of all six House and Senate office buildings for further screening. 
Investigators said it was still not known who had mailed the anthrax-laced letters or whether they all had come from the same source. They had already concluded, however, that the letter to Mr. Daschle appeared to match the one sent to the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw in New York.
And after preliminary testing, Dr. David Fleming of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, "The strain in New York appears to match the strain in Florida," which resulted in the only death so far in the outbreak, an editor at American Media Inc. in Boca Raton. 
Experts said the preliminary matching of the strains supported the possibility that the anthrax had come from the same source, since scientists have identified about 1,200 strains of the bacteria. Still, matching the strains is not definitive proof that the same person sent the material.
New York was the scene of another scare today as Gov. George E. Pataki and his staff were forced to evacuate their Midtown Manhattan offices after a small amount of anthrax spores was found. 
Although officials do not know the source of the spores, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik suggested that the state police might have inadvertently carried anthrax spores after escorting Mr. Pataki to news offices where the bacteria had either been found or was suspected to be present. 
In a further sign that the federal government was moving to a state of high alert against further bioterrorism, the secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, asked Congress for money today to stockpile 300 million doses of smallpox vaccine, enough to inoculate every American if necessary. And the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of two alternate antibiotics, besides the patented Cipro, to treat anthrax.
But officials also took pains to avoid prompting panic, with Mr. Daschle and government doctors emphasizing that tests showed that the anthrax strains identified so far were treatable by all antibiotics. 
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said House members would not meet in their Capitol chamber until Tuesday, but the Senate vowed to keep meeting and cast votes on Thursday, even as aides scattered from their adjoining office complexes.
Congressional aides said President Bush had encouraged them to close shop, but Mr. Bush left the country for an economic conference in China with only a brief mention of the concern in Washington. He told an audience of California business leaders this afternoon, "We're responding rapidly to investigate anthrax reports and to quickly give preventative treatment to any who are exposed."
F.B.I. and postal investigators concentrated today on the Trenton area, where the letters to NBC and to Mr. Daschle were postmarked on identical prepaid envelopes. Forensic experts examined the handwriting on the letters, and experts in ink and paper analyzed makeup of the letters themselves.
Other investigators fanned out to review earlier cases of anthrax threats and look for similarities. Agents interviewed officials at private and public research laboratories searching for possible suspects. Senior law enforcement officials said they had "substantive leads." 
One law enforcement official said that while the anthrax strain found in Florida appeared to match that sent to NBC, those samples were grainier than the fine powder sent to Senator Daschle.
Government officials and lawmakers spoke in dissonant, sometimes confusing voices today about the seriousness of the threat posed by the anthrax sent to Mr. Daschle. Some like Mr. Daschle and Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican who is also a doctor, seemed to play down the danger, pointing, for example, to preliminary findings that the anthrax had not been engineered to make it resistant to antibiotics.
But some officials said the material represented a highly refined, virulent form of the disease, so easily transmitted that 31 people had positive nasal swab tests showing they had been exposed to anthrax spores. Five were Capitol Police officers who responded to Mr. Daschle's office in the Hart Senate Office Building when the letter was opened, 3 were aides at Senator Russell D. Feingold's office nearby and 23 were workers in Mr. Daschle's suite.
Evidence of anthrax was also found in the Senate mailroom in the adjoining Dirksen Office Building, officials said. The rapid dispersal of the material indicated that it was in small particles easily transported in the air.
In an interview on "The News Hour with Jim Lehrer" on PBS, Mr. Ashcroft said tonight of the sample found in Mr. Daschle's office, "Our preliminary analysis indicates that it's a virulent, strong, very serious, but whether it had been treated in any way that would make it especially more dangerous, our tests are not complete."
Mr. Ashcroft was referring to measures that weapons designers might take to heighten the lethal effects of anthrax, like rendering it electrostatically neutral to enhance its dispersal in the air. At one of several briefings for reporters this afternoon, Senator Frist said testing of the material from Mr. Daschle's office was incomplete. 
But Maj. Gen. Jon Parker of the Army's biological research center at Fort Detrick, Md., said tests showed that the anthrax was "sensitive to all antibiotics," indicating that treatment would be relatively easy for those known to be exposed. General Parker described the anthrax as "common variety."
By day's end, officials said that about 2,000 Capitol Hill workers had been tested for exposure and that perhaps "a couple hundred" who either worked in or passed through the wing where the Daschle letter was opened were being prescribed a 60-day regimen of Cipro.
"There is absolutely no evidence of infection at this point," Mr. Daschle said.
There was, however, evidence of sharp disagreement between the two houses of Congress on how to respond today. Several House aides complained that the reason the House decided to shut down for testing was because of what Mr. Daschle had told its leaders at a private breakfast with Mr. Bush at the White House.
"Daschle said it was pretty serious and might be in the ventilation duct and was a particularly virulent strain," said John P. Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman.
In fact, Mr. Hastert initially told reporters that "this stuff has gotten into the ventilation system, is going through the tunnels" that link the Capitol and its office complex underground. He later amended that to say it was a "possibility."
One House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted tartly that the Senate was in "spin mode over there to calm everyone down."
Congressional aides said that the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, had told them that when Mr. Daschle had initially proposed closing the Senate, several senators told him they would not stand for it, and that he had relented, proposing to hold committee meetings on Thursday in the Library of Congress.
But there was considerable concern.
Part of Mr. Hastert's office suite on the fourth floor of the Capitol was closed today because the woman who opens his mail recognized the handwriting on the letters to Mr. Daschle and Mr. Brokaw pictured in a newspaper as similar to that on an envelope she had seen sometime in the past few weeks, Mr. Feehery said. At the time, she considered the letter suspicious and put it in a burn bag reserved for such mail. The Capitol Police have accumulated fewer than a dozen such bags since August and plan to check them.

HEADLINE: Argentina Tries to Swap Bond Debt 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Shrugging off a warning from two credit agencies, Argentine officials continued to negotiate a plan today with local pension funds and banks to swap as much as $16 billion in high-yield government bonds for securities that pay lower interest but offer stronger guarantees.
 The credit agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, said recently that they might rate the country in default if bondholders suffered in the deal. 
 Officials with the ministry of economy have been lauding the plan as a way to save the government at least $1.2 billion in interest next year and reduce the likelihood that Argentina would have to default on payments on its $132 billion debt. They say they expect an agreement in a few days. 
Some Wall Street analysts have concluded that the deal would be tantamount to a debt restructuring in which bondholders are forced to accept bonds with lower interest rates and longer payment schedules than those of their original bonds. In the two previous debt swaps this year, bondholders received new instruments at far higher interest rates.
Analysts consider Argentina, now in its 40th month of a deepening recession, the country at highest risk of a debt default.
Tax revenue, consumption and manufacturing have been dropping sharply in the last two months. Exports have risen modestly, but not nearly enough to lift the country out of its crisis. The prices of its agricultural and mineral exports have been weakened since the terrorist attacks in the United States. 
And with its currency pegged to the strong dollar and interest rates remaining stubbornly high, Argentina has problems competing with Brazil, whose currency has plummeted in value in recent months.
President Fernando de la Rua's political position was further weakened by the results of Sunday's legislative elections, in which his ruling Alianza coalition lost its position as the largest party in the lower house of Congress. 
Mr. De la Rua is expected to reshuffle his cabinet this week and announce new measures to stimulate the economy, but he has pledged to keep the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, in his post.
The worsening economy led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Argentina's creditworthiness last week, the fifth time it has done so this year. And on Tuesday, it issued a statement warning that it would consider Argentina in default if the new debt offers bondholders terms that are inferior to those of the original debt. Analysts at Moody's, which also recently downgraded Argentina's debt, offered similar comments.
Any additional lowering of ratings would probably lift interest rates here and possibly in other South American countries, further dampening investment and consumption.
Horacio Liendo, an adviser to Mr. Cavallo, said in a radio interview today that the government was moving ahead with the debt swap. The bondholders, he said, would benefit because the government would offer better guarantees for the bonds in the form of tax revenue pledged to pay off interest and principal on new bonds.
"I always speak of a voluntary and harmonious swap in which guarantees are improved so as to improve the value of public credit," Mr. Liendo said.
So far, despite the talk of possible default, the local bond and stock markets have risen sharply in recent days. And some market strategists say that the credit agencies are overreacting.
"The rating agencies are trying to cover their trail," said Walter Molano, head of research for BCP Securities, a brokerage firm in Greenwich, Conn., that focuses on Latin America. 
"They were wrong in pushing Argentina's credit ratings as high as they did in the late 1990's," Mr. Molano said, "and now they are overstating what the Argentine risk situation is."
He added that the $8 billion International Monetary Fund rescue package in August should enable Argentina to avert default until at least the second quarter of 2002. The package included $5 billion in new money and $3 billion in guarantees for an eventual voluntary debt swap to be negotiated with foreign lenders.
Today, a World Bank vice president, David de Ferranti, told Bloomberg News that the bank might supply additional financing for guarantees to ease Argentina's debt burden.
Argentine officials hope the deal they are trying to work out with local banks and pension funds could serve as a model for future swaps.
Part of the deal would allow for a swap of least $7.5 billion in provincial bonds with yields ranging from 30 to 40 percent, for bonds with a rate below 10 percent. Another arrangement would allow the government to exchange $3 billion or more in promissory notes held by pension funds and yielding more than 20 percent for new issues with interest rates of 8 percent.

HEADLINE: G.M. Extending Incentives As Ford Posts Another Loss 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
General Motors today extended interest-free financing deals on its vehicles through mid-November, escalating a price war with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group that began last month.
 There were signs today that the rising incentive costs were taking their toll. Ford reported a third-quarter net loss of $692 million, posting a second consecutive quarter of losses for the first time in nearly a decade. The loss was in line with analysts' estimates. 
 "I think it will be difficult to earn a profit in the fourth quarter," Martin Inglis, Ford's chief financial officer, said in a conference call. Shares of Ford fell 55 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $17.13. 
Mr. Inglis cited rising incentive costs as a leading problem. After the Sept. 11 attacks, G.M. started offering interest-free financing deals on its entire vehicle lineup in an attempt to bolster stagnant sales. Ford and Chrysler quickly followed suit.
While such deals are good for buyers, they drive up costs for the already beleaguered Big Three, which have been rapidly losing market share to foreign automakers. Executives at Ford and Chrysler have derided the rising tide of incentives as a costly tactic that borrows against future sales by making them less profitable now.
"The 'Ford Drives America' zero percent financing program did jump-start sales in mid-September, and I think that was important," Mr. Inglis said. "However, marketing rose to what I consider to be unsustainable levels."
Mr. Inglis said that incentives ate up 16 percent of revenue, compared with 11 percent last year. He estimated that each percentage point increase in incentives sliced another $1 billion from Ford's annual pretax profits. Asked about G.M.'s decision to extend its "Keep America Rolling" plan beyond the end of this month, to Nov. 18, Mr. Inglis spoke with a touch of irony.
"That was a thrill for me to read this morning that they had extended to the middle of November," he said. "I'm glad they are a very competitive company, and we will have a look at what is required for Ford to remain competitive."
In an interview Tuesday, Wolfgang Bernhard, the chief operating officer of Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, was also critical. "I don't think this is helping the industry," he said. "It's going to make it more difficult for the Big Three to be financially viable in the long term."
Ford's revenue was $36.55 billion, down 9 percent from the quarter a year earlier. The company had operating losses of $502 million, excluding one-time charges, versus operating earnings of $994 million for the year-earlier quarter. The company's net cash level is now at its lowest point since 1992. 
Mr. Inglis said reduced volume was the largest contributor to third-quarter losses. Ford cut its North American production 23 percent from the period a year ago. This was partly because of parts shortages stemming from halted air transportation and border closings after the Sept. 11 attacks, but was also a strategic move as the economic outlook clouded. Ford's Hertz unit reported a profit of $26 million, down from $143 million a year earlier. The car rental industry has been hit hard, as business at airports has fallen off.
Ford, which has also absorbed the cost of replacing millions of Firestone tires on its vehicles, is in the midst of a turnaround effort. The company has consolidated its car and truck development divisions; cut production; said it would cut 4,000 to 5,000 white-collar jobs; canceled bonuses for 6,000 executives; and cut its dividend in half. 
Ford's problems are causing increasing speculation about the future of its chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser. People close to the company say that he has lost the board's confidence and probably will not last the year, but Ford has dismissed such talk. 
"This was a difficult quarter, as our results were affected by an uncertain and slowing U.S. economy, compounded by the tragic events of Sept. 11," Mr. Nasser said today in a statement.
G.M. reports its earnings Thursday. The company, the world's largest automaker, has been losing market share for decades but has a new lineup of light trucks and actually gained share in September, while Ford and Chrysler continued to lose ground. But analysts say G.M.'s short-term gains could hurt profits. 
"G.M. feels like they're in the sweet spot, and they're trying to push their advantage," said Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, adding, "You don't really know the cost of all this until you know how much in future sales you pulled ahead at a discount."
John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said of the strategy,"it's very risky," but added that G.M. had to turn around its market share at some point so it could stay large enough to pay its legacy costs, like health and pension benefits to its many retirees. 
The risk, he said, is that G.M. is pushing incentives "to a level that will destroy everyone's margins."

In Quiet Corners, the Roots of Afghan Rebellion

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
While bombs fall in Afghanistan, a quieter war is being waged in the dusty border city of Quetta and, farther north, in the mud-brick city of Peshawar. It is a clandestine affair, intended to win converts for an attempt to overthrow the Taliban.
 Mujahedeen commanders, tribal chiefs and other prominent Afghans opposed to the ruling Taliban gather in carpet shops, in coffee houses and behind closed doors in both cities to discuss shifting alliances and strategies for exploiting a schism among Taliban leaders. Some travel from Afghanistan, crossing the mountains for talks that could shape the future of their country and the outcome of the American war. 
 In a discreetly guarded, high-walled villa in Quetta, Hamid Karzai receives a steady stream of visitors with rebellion on their minds. Mr. Karzai is an influential Pashtun chief and powerful mediator among the commanders and tribal leaders. Some guests are more welcome than others at his conclaves. 
Two men arrived the other afternoon from Pakistan's intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. They fell on the unwelcome side of the guest book because anti-Taliban Afghans blame Pakistan, particularly I.S.I., for arming the regime in Kabul, at least until Sept. 11.
"We have changed our policies," one agent said, according to a person who was present. "Don't worry."
Mr. Karzai was having none of it. "You didn't change your policies," he said. "You have been forced to change your policies by the Americans."
End of conversation. The visitors left without a cup of tea, a telling insult in a culture where even adversaries are usually treated politely inside someone's home.
Jamil Karzai, a cousin of Mr. Karzai's, said later that resentments run too deep for Pakistan to play a role in the overthrow and that many anti-Taliban leaders oppose granting Islamabad any role. "We tried Pakistan once and Pakistan failed that test," he said. "Now we are optimistic because of the Americans."
Of course, Afghanistan tried the Americans once, too, and the result was the Taliban.

Education, at a Price
Fatima Sakhi's tiny fingers moved swiftly and nimbly up and down the loom, expertly pulling the threads of wool into place and tying off the knots. Fatima, who is 9 years old, worked in imposed silence on a bench beside five other children, all between the ages of 8 and 12.
In the small, dim room, four sets of child weavers worked intently, producing rugs in traditional Afghan designs for sale in bazaars in Quetta and other Pakistani cities. The refugee children work 5 to 10 hours a day to earn $5 to $7 a month.
Fatima is lucky. She comes at 8 every morning, but leaves at 1 p.m. for school. Most of the 23 other children work until evening.
"Everyone in every family must work in order to survive, no matter how young or how little pay," said Kazim Wahdi, a teacher in the Afghan refugee settlement known as Hazaratown, on Quetta's outskirts.
In this world of shared misery, all things are relative. Fatima's family could not afford the $1 a month it costs to send her to school if she did not work. Is a tedious and difficult job too high a price for a 9-year-old to pay for her education?

Order From Chaos
The pecking order among refugees is well defined. Status depends on how long people have been here, whether they have a job and whether they have relatives who can help.
Few refugees have been integrated into Pakistani society. The government pushes them to the margins, and most say they want to go home when the time comes anyway.
The oldest refugee settlements have turned into villages or towns, and they are the top rung. Hazaratown is next. Most of its 100,000 residents arrived in the 1990's, and they have created a subsistence economy.
Not far away is the bottom rung, a camp with no name where hundreds of refugees arrive weekly. The fortunate ones join relatives already packed into tattered tents or mud-brick hovels. Others huddle in roofless enclosures. There are no jobs or schools, and women walk a mile each way to get water from a well.
The new refugees have one advantage: they can register with the United Nations to receive food assistance, while others get nothing unless they are widows or orphans.
United Nations workers said they had learned to recognize customers who come week after week for months, always claiming to be new arrivals. The rules led to a rare moment of levity recently when an old man walked up to an aid worker, followed by an old woman.
"This is my wife," the old man said. "She is a widow."

Reality Programming
The moment was cinematic: hundreds of young men charging across the shimmering desert sands, hell-bent for a convoy of trucks carrying journalists to the Pakistan-Afghan border. These were not movie extras, and as the mob closed in, screams of "Death to America!" began to sound like "Death to reporters!"
The 500 to 600 men were aiming for the railroad crossing where the vehicles would have to slow. Confronted with an obviously angry crowd, the journalists were of two minds: some shouted at the drivers to speed up, others told them to slow down for a closer look. The open truck carrying six armed Pakistani police at the head of the convoy never hesitated; it bounced over the tracks at full speed, well ahead of the mob.
Half the vehicles made it before the crowd poured onto the highway. Cut off, the others made a hasty retreat as the protesters pounded with sticks on a couple of cars.
The crowd had come from a nearby Afghan refugee camp, it turned out, but the big question was how they had known the journalists were coming. 
With so many journalists cooped up together in a country under military rule, conspiracy theories are always rife. This time fingers pointed to the police, who had allowed the press to take the trip only under duress and who mount a daily effort to keep the foreigners corralled inside the Serena Hotel. No one, however, was willing to go back and interview the young men.

Flying the Coop
The hotel, a walled compound of gracious adobe buildings, has become a gilded cage for the 60 or 70 foreign journalists staying there. Every morning they awake to find the big iron gates rolled closed and guarded by police. Every morning an argument ensues about whether they can get out of the hotel to cover the demonstrations in the streets or buy more rugs in local shops.
The police insist that they are protecting the journalists. The journalists insist that they know the risks. 
The police thought their argument was underscored when they used tear gas to turn back an unruly crowd of 300 men trying to get into the hotel. The journalists were all the more insistent on leaving.
In early October, The Associated Press, Reuters and The New York Times obtained an order from the province's highest court requiring the police to permit them to "move freely to make coverage of the latest developments at their risk and cost."
The order proved ineffective. The senior police officer in charge of keeping the foreigners inside the compound made that clear one morning as about 20 journalists surrounded him in the parking lot and he was handed the order.
The police officer read the order aloud and gave his interpretation. "This has negated the positive," he said triumphantly, stalking off without explaining the mysterious phrase.
The day after the Americans began to bomb Afghanistan, reporters stood on the roof of the hotel and watched smoke rising from fires set by demonstrators across the city.
Late in the afternoon, after pleas and shouts had failed to open the hotel gates, about 30 journalists gathered at the lowest point on the wall and began to scale it. The first over were whacked soundly by police with bamboo staves, but finally there was a large enough group outside that the police relented. 
The journalists were loaded into police trucks for a tour of the city. Shop windows had been smashed and three cinemas showing American films had been burned, but the eeriest scene was a gutted fire truck still smoldering in the middle of a busy street.

HEADLINE: Russia Closing 2 Major Posts For Snooping, One in Cuba 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Scrapping an outdated symbol of its superpower days, the Kremlin said today that it would abandon its largest electronic eavesdropping post in the West, at Lourdes, Cuba, and spend much of the savings on modern weapons for its armed forces.
 President Vladimir V. Putin also said Russia would begin a long-planned withdrawal from a major Pacific eavesdropping post, at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, on Jan 1. 
 Appearing after a meeting at Russia's Defense Ministry, Mr. Putin cast the closings largely as budgetary decisions, part of his campaign to streamline and rearm a military critically short of money, morale and expertise since the Soviet collapse. 
"The development of the armed forces to a new technological level will require money, and we are going to have to find it," Mr. Putin said. "Standing up to international terrorism has considerable military implications." 
There was no indication, however, that Russia had taken the step as part of any quid pro quo with the United States as Washington tries to assemble a global coalition against terrorism. 
Instead, Mr. Putin emphasized that without better weaponry and more combat training, Russia's armed forces risked turning into a glorified military school where soldiers learned the science of fighting without picking up the skills. 
But the symbolism of Russia's departure from two of its mightiest cold war outposts was impossible to ignore. The Lourdes post, which dates to 1964, was the hallmark of the Soviet presence in the Americas and, for decades, a major concern of American intelligence. 
President Bush today welcomed the Russian decision to close its eavesdropping site in Cuba. "This decision is another indication that the cold war is over," he said in a statement. "President Putin understands that Russia and America are no longer adversaries."
The site at Cam Ranh Bay had been a strategic American base before United States forces turned it over to the Saigon government in 1972. The Soviets, and later the Russians, used it to maintain a Pacific Ocean presence and to eavesdrop on Chinese naval activity.
The abandonment of both sites fits Mr. Putin's pattern of cutting back on global commitments that make little sense in an era when Russia has no clear enemy and scant reason to keep up a worldwide military presence it cannot afford. 
"Moscow's no longer running a superpower," John Pike, an American intelligence analyst who directs the Virginia-based research group GlobalSecurity.org, said in an interview today. "I think that basically, they're just trying to tidy up the map a bit."
Aleksandr A. Pikayev, a military expert at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the decision to leave Lourdes was nevertheless almost certainly a painful one.
"It definitely would be a big surprise for many analysts here," he said.
The two closings will save Russia $200 million a year in rent, all of it for the Cuba site and much of it, apparently, in the form of in-kind payments to the Cuban government, like fuel and food.
The Soviet Union and Russia have used the Cam Ranh Bay base free since the 1970's, but Vietnam said last year that it planned to charge $300 million a year in rent had Russia renewed its lease in 2003.
The chief of the Russian military general staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, said that for the money spent to rent Lourdes alone "we can buy and launch 20 military satellites into space" and buy dozens of modern radars.
The 28-square-mile Lourdes complex, employing up to 1,500 Russians, is said to be among the biggest eavesdropping stations anywhere. In 1993, President Fidel Castro's brother Raul, Cuba's armed-forces chief, said Russia obtained 75 percent of its strategic intelligence on the United States from data and voice communications intercepted there.
In its heyday Lourdes picked up telephone transmissions throughout the southeastern United States, tracked American naval operations in the Caribbean, sent instructions to Russian ships and submarines and monitored military and civilian space activity at Cape Canaveral.
Russian journalists have said Lourdes provides communications support for Russian intelligence agents in North America and, with another outpost in Russia, manages the nation's spy satellite fleet.
But Russia's global spy-satellite network has deteriorated, and most American telephone conversations today travel by fiber-optic cable, not microwave. Experts say the Lourdes station has turned increasingly toward intercepting transmissions from American spy satellites and on collecting economic and industrial intelligence beamed to and from commercial satellites.

The Democrats Fiddle

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Anyone who thought the city's most influential Democrats would recognize that New York and the nation are caught in a grave crisis, and therefore all cheap and petty and divisive politics should be put aside, has been thoroughly, if not sickeningly, disappointed.
 Enough already with the whining and the finger-pointing and the perennial caviling about this ethnic group and that. 
 Fernando Ferrer and his supporters are unhappy with the way Mark Green campaigned in the days leading up to last Thursday's runoff. They have reason to be unhappy. Mr. Green, a lifelong liberal and self-proclaimed candidate of unity, certainly played the fear card, if not the race card, in his attempt to fend off a Ferrer win by appealing to white voters unhappy with the thought of ethnic minorities in City Hall. 
But that strategy followed Mr. Ferrer's deliberate and very successful effort to forge a coalition of Latino and black voters -- an effort that almost brought the Democratic nomination to Mr. Ferrer, but also dismayed many of the city's white voters and all but invited some candidate to seek the benefits of a backlash.
Now the Ferrer forces are moving beyond the venues of the petty and the unseemly and into the realm of the ridiculous. Roberto Ramirez, a seasoned pol who is the Bronx Democratic chairman and a key Ferrer adviser, is accusing the Green campaign of suppressing the voting rights of minorities. And the Rev. Al Sharpton, another important Ferrer ally, is planning to file a federal lawsuit challenging the results of the runoff election, which are still unofficial but clearly show Mr. Green as the winner. 
Earth to Democrats: a major, life-threatening crisis has enveloped the city and the nation and it would behoove anyone aspiring to leadership to deal with that first and get back to your infantile squabbles sometime in the very far distant future.
In case you haven't noticed, much of Lower Manhattan is in ruins. And the germ warfare that people have worried about for so long is under way. Anthrax has turned up in the U.S. Congress and in the Manhattan office of the governor of New York.
If you could bring yourselves to look at the big picture, you might see that the city you claim to love so much is under siege. Thousands upon thousands of businesses have been crippled. Jobs are vanishing at a frightening pace. Both the city and state are hemorrhaging revenues, and enormous budget deficits loom. According to Felix Rohatyn, "The city is in greater economic jeopardy today than it was in the fiscal crisis of 1975." 
We are experiencing the awful beginning of a precipitous decline in the city's fortunes. So let's stop the mud-wrestling and move on. Let's do it this way: Let's agree that everybody's been offended. O.K.? We're even. Let's stash the lawsuits and stifle the recriminations.
Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Sharpton need to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. They can start by acknowledging that, whatever may have happened in this election, the voting rights of minorities were not suppressed. They should call in their lawyers and their surrogates and tell them to chill.
The two people who can do the most right now to bring New York together are Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer. I know both men and I don't believe either is a racist. They should sit down, one on one, as soon as possible. Lock the door and have it out. There should be no ground rules except one: They can't leave the room until they come to an agreement on the best way to cooperate in leading the city forward during the worst crisis in its history.
Mr. Green met yesterday with Dennis Rivera, the president of the politically powerful health care workers' union and a major Ferrer supporter. The meeting reportedly went well and I would be surprised if Mr. Rivera did not end up supporting Mr. Green. 
But time is growing short. Mr. Green may well be the next mayor and he will have trouble governing successfully without the enthusiastic support of Mr. Ferrer and his constituents. Big-time leadership is needed right now. The two principals should get together and there should be plenty of food in the room, because they need to stay there as long as it takes to work out their differences. The future of a very troubled city is at stake.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Expands on Economic Plans 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
In releasing a plan for economic development yesterday, the Republican mayoral candidate, Michael R. Bloomberg, rejected the idea of a new state authority to oversee the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, and also proposed putting high schools on Governors Island to free up school buildings citywide.
 The plan expanded on some ideas he had already hinted at, such as reducing the city's workforce by attrition and moving some city agencies from downtown Manhattan to the other boroughs. In a new twist on an old problem, he suggested that the Police and Fire Departments might grow during a citywide hiring freeze by recruiting workers from other city departments. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan also ventured into some new areas of economic development, with proposals on the devastation at the trade center site that were dismissed as inappropriate and naive by his Democratic rival, Mark Green. 
Most notably, Mr. Bloomberg rejected the idea of a new state agency to oversee the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, as has been contemplated in Albany. Mr. Bloomberg said the city, along with existing agencies like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, could handle the effort.
His remarks were in keeping with a philosophy he has promoted in his campaign, that there should be less direct state intervention in municipal matters, particularly in transportation and education. His plan yesterday also called for relaxing the need for intervention by the state Financial Control Board when the city runs a budget deficit, at a time when financial experts have worried that the board might exert a stronger hand now that the city's economy is reeling from the terror attack.
"Rudy Giuliani showed that this city can, with help from the state government, with help from the federal government, adequately control its own destiny," Mr. Bloomberg said at a business breakfast at the Grand Hyatt sponsored by Crain's New York Business. "Adding another level of bureaucracy is not something I am in favor of."
In another new suggestion, Mr. Bloomberg proposed turning Governors Island, which is federally owned, into an academic center, where students from across the city would be transported by aerial tramways and water taxis to a complex of new high schools and college campuses. He said that the federal government could be persuaded to hand over the island and that the high school construction could be paid for through bond sales.
By moving high school students to Governors Island, Mr. Bloomberg said, high school buildings around the city could be converted to elementary and intermediate schools. That would keep younger students closer to home and would overcome some of the opposition to new high school construction, he said.
"If somebody's got a better idea, I would be happy to hear it, but it is time to do something," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference. "Let us have this piece of property, and let us develop it for something that is good for this city and good for this country."
When asked about Mr. Bloomberg's proposals at a news conference, Mr. Green described them as "displaying the naivete of a novice."
Mr. Green suggested that Mr. Bloomberg was just reading a speech that somebody else had handed him. He also said that Mr. Bloomberg's proposal to have the city control the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan was unrealistic and he questioned the reasons for trying to build schools on Governors Island.
"I don't think he knows the city, and I don't think he understands government," Mr. Green said. "When he's been to all the neighborhoods like I have, perhaps he'll be slightly more insightful and credible."
Mr. Bloomberg, through a spokesman, was equally dismissive of Mr. Green's critique.
"I am happy to match my economic development credentials against a career gadfly with no economic record," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Among some of Mr. Bloomberg's other ideas for development was that the city should not depend solely on the financial industry to anchor Lower Manhattan. It should promote projects like biotechnology, fashion industry complexes and an information technology center, he said.
He also listed several priorities for new development outside Lower Manhattan, including "The Hub" in the Bronx; Red Hook in Brooklyn; Jamaica in Queens, and Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island.
In delivering a broad outline of his proposals at the Crain's breakfast, Mr. Bloomberg assumed the role of head cheerleader for the city and said the only way to keep businesses from leaving was to keep their employees happy. He also suggested that companies should not be interested in hiring people who live in the suburbs because they are not "the best and the brightest."
"There is a self-selection process," he said. "People that want to go there aren't the people that you want to have in your company."
Meanwhile, Mr. Green continued yesterday to try to ease some of the bitterness that existed among supporters of Fernando Ferrer, his opponent in the Democratic primary, over the hard-hitting campaign he ran. Mr. Green quietly met with Dennis Rivera, the head of the health care workers union.
Mr. Rivera, who met with Mr. Bloomberg on Monday, declined comment after the meeting, but a spokesman for Mr. Green said the meeting was friendly and productive. He said Mr. Green had called other Ferrer supporters, including Representative Charles Rangel, the Harlem Democrat, and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president.
The origin of a flier that some Ferrer supporters objected to, which said that a Ferrer-Sharpton ticket would bring down the city, became clear yesterday. It was issued by Isaac Abraham, an advocate for Jewish causes in Brooklyn. 
"We have a democratic right to denounce him," Mr. Abraham said of the Rev. Al Sharpton, explaining that he sent the letter to about 7,000 people. His authorship of the letter was first reported in The Village Voice.

AOL Meets Projections, But Internet Unit Falls Short
AOL Time Warner said that its third-quarter revenue grew by 6 percent and that its cash flow increased by 20 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier.
 Despite the results, which met or exceeded analysts' forecasts by most measures, the company's Internet unit, America Online, fell far short of Wall Street's expectations. Investors seized on that weakness and sent the company's shares down $2.69, to $30.81. Page C2. 

Cutbacks in Television Programming
Facing economic strains and a steep downturn in advertising, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox Broadcasting and USA Network are cutting back on TV programming. C6.

Stocks Fall on Greenspan Remarks
Stocks dropped after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, made disappointing comments about the economy and investors worried about bioterrorism. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 75.73 points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,646.34. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 151.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,232.97.

Steps Taken to Make More Cipro
Under intense pressure to respond to fears about anthrax, the government and the drug industry took steps to increase the production of the antibiotic Cipro and approve a broader range of drugs to fight the bacterium. A1.

Satisfying the explosive demand for Cipro has created problems for Bayer. And the company is trying to fend off politicians' calls that other drug makers be allowed to begin producing their own versions of the drug. B8.

Schools Oppose Visa Restrictions
Business schools, graduate programs and colleges have paid close attention to proposals to curb the number of visas issued to students, like a call last month by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California for a six-month moratorium on student visas soon after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Foreign students are particularly valuable to business schools because they are more likely to pay full tuition. That has made many institutions staunch opponents of what they see as excessively harsh restrictions on student visas. C5.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Economic Slide As Temporary 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the damage to the economy from the terrorist attacks should be temporary and that the United States would soon start benefiting again from the advances in technology that helped fuel the boom of the late 1990's.
 In an appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan described the short-term economic outlook as murky, and he said nothing to alter the assumption among investors and economists that the Fed would continue to cut interest rates. 
 "We are looking at a situation which is by no means as bad as numbers of us were fearful it might turn out to be," Mr. Greenspan said. "But it also has not exhibited a sharp snapback, which has been typical of what happens when you get a major hurricane or natural disaster." 
Mr. Greenspan said that once the initial shock from the attacks wears off, the economy should be able to draw on its underlying strengths and recover. In particular, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his faith in the power of technology to rekindle improvements in the growth rate of productivity, the single most important determinant of the economy's ability to expand without generating inflation.
"For the longer term, prospects for ongoing rapid technological advance and associated faster productivity growth are scarcely diminished," he said.
Mr. Greenspan's statements were no doubt intended in part as cheerleading at a time when the economy is plagued as much by fear and uncertainty as by more concrete problems.
But they also made clear that Mr. Greenspan has not given up on the notion of the new economy, the theory that improvements in productivity, or output per hour, had raised the economy's level of performance starting in around 1995. 
"Alan Greenspan is bullish on America," said Gerald D. Cohen, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
In response to questions from members of Congress, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his position that cutting the capital gains tax -- a proposal favored by Republicans as a way to help give the economy a quick boost -- would not have much immediate effect on the economy. He said he continued to view cutting capital gains taxes, or even eliminating them, as good long-term policy.
He said research at the Fed suggested that the best way of providing the economy with short-term stimulus was to provide tax breaks for business investment in new equipment by allowing companies to write off much of the cost of the investment immediately. And he gave a cautious endorsement to the Bush administration's proposal to cap the liability of the insurance industry on claims from future terrorist attacks.
"Even though I recognize that there are very significant difficulties in reconciling free markets and government reinsurance, in this very unusual circumstance they are indeed compatible," Mr. Greenspan said.
Many if not most economists now say the economy has entered a recession, which is usually defined as two or more consecutive quarters in which total economic output declines. The president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, said in a speech here today that he now thinks a recession is likely, the first time a senior administration official has acknowledged in public what private-sector economists have been saying for weeks or months.
But there is considerable debate among economists about how quickly the economy will bounce back, especially given the uncertainty about further terrorist attacks and the effect they could have on business, investor and consumer confidence. And there is also a division of opinion among economists about how much, if any, of the improvements in productivity that the nation enjoyed during the second half of the last decade are likely to continue.
In a report issued today, McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, concluded that productivity will continue to grow at rates higher than it grew for the two decades before 1995, but probably not as fast as it grew starting in 1995.
From 1972 to 1995, productivity grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate. From 1995 through 2000, it grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate. McKinsey concluded that nearly all of the improvement came from six sectors of the economy: retail, wholesale, securities, telecommunications, semiconductors and computer manufacturing.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said productivity growth would suffer temporarily as businesses were forced to take steps like increasing spending on security and backing up their computer systems.
Eventually, he said, productivity would pick up because businesses have only started to exploit the cost savings available from increased use of computers and communications technology, which offer a very high rate of return on investment.
But Mr. Greenspan hedged slightly about whether productivity growth would return to its 2.5 percent annual rate.
"The level of productivity will presumably undergo a one-time downward adjustment as our economy responds to higher levels of perceived risk, but once the adjustment is completed, productivity growth should resume at rates in excess of those that prevailed in the quarter-century preceding 1995," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Shares Fall, With Nasdaq Losing 4.4%

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks dropped yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made disappointing comments about the economy and investors worried about bioterrorism attacks.
 Technology stock followers, initially encouraged by earnings reports from I.B.M. and Intel on Tuesday that matched or slightly exceeded analysts' forecasts, touched off an early rally. But investors retreated after the confirmation of more than 30 positive cases of anthrax exposure in Washington and by Mr. Greenspan's assessment that the economic outlook for the next few months was uncertain. 
 Of major market gauges, the hardest hit was the Nasdaq composite index, which dropped 75.73 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 1,646.34.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 151.26 points, or 1.61 percent, to 9,232.97. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 20.45 points, or 1.86 percent, to 1,077.09.
Market breadth was negative. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,976 stocks declined, compared with 1,157 that advanced. Big Board volume totaled 1.47 million shares.
"Alan Greenspan started us off, but the ongoing fear of anthrax put a lot of concern in the market," said Arthur Hogan of Jefferies & Company. "He was very cloudy about what he wants to say about the future. For the most part his message is, 'We're not sure when this economy turns around.' One of his statements was, 'We're not sure if the fiscal and monetary policy will keep us out of recession.' "
Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said a pronounced rise in uncertainty after last month's terrorist attacks had dampened consumer spending and capital investment, and caused a withdrawal from the marketplace that "has been partial and presumably temporary." 
Although analysts said the market at first seemed to have absorbed Tuesday's developments on anthrax risks, investors were unnerved yesterday by the announcement that more than 30 people who worked in or near the office of Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, had tested positive for exposure to anthrax. Later, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said an environmental test of his Manhattan offices had come back positive "for the probability of anthrax." 
Alan Ackerman, chief market strategist at Fahnestock & Company, commented: "It's discomforting to know that the anthrax threat may be spreading. The extent of uncertainties we're dealing with now make decision-making difficult indeed." 
For much of the week, the market has sought direction from corporate America, which is in the third-quarter earnings season. About 180 of the companies in the S.& P. 500 are to report their results this week, and analysts expect some of the worst profit reports in decades.
Of the bright spots in the market yesterday, I.B.M. shares gained $1.05, to $102.90. John R. Joyce, the company's chief financial officer, said he thought Wall Street's expectations for I.B.M.'s fourth-quarter profit were reasonable. But shares of Intel, which met analysts' forecasts on Tuesday, gave up early gains and fell 39 cents, to $24.57.
Technology issues dropped sharply in the last half-hour of trading after Siebel Systems reported earnings that came in at the low end of Wall Street analysts' expectations. Siebel fell $4.16, to $17.38.
Some other technology issues weighing on the Nasdaq index included Microsoft, down $2.42, to $56.03; Cisco Systems, down $1.37, to $15.60; PeopleSoft, down $5.35, to $23.19; and Xilinx, down $3.27, to $27.48. 
EMC, the big maker of computer storage products, fell $2.24, to $11.21, after posting a net loss of $945.2 million, or 43 cents a share. --------------------

U.S. Treasury Prices Gain
By Reuters
Treasury prices edged higher yesterday after a stock rebound fizzled on the news that Senate staff employees had tested positive for anthrax exposure.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32 , to 103 15/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.56 percent from 4.57 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to 100 29/32 . Its yield fell to 5.31 percent from 5.35 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Bush Opposes More Aid Now For New York 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration balked today at providing billions more dollars in new aid to New York this year, in effect quashing any hopes Gov. George E. Pataki might have had that his $54 billion aid request would be considered soon.
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, said today that the administration had no intention of asking Congress for more money for any other terrorism-related need, at least until January. He said the issue could be re-examined next year, but he noted that New York was already beginning to get large portions of the $20 billion approved as emergency aid for the state, Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
 Mr. Daniels's announcement underscored the uphill battle that the governor faces in securing more aid. In fact, the aid request that Mr. Pataki shopped around personally on Capitol Hill just last week probably will not survive in its current form. 
A growing number of influential lawmakers on Capitol Hill are rejecting it, describing Mr. Pataki's proposal as freighted with huge spending items not directly related to the terrorist attacks, like transportation projects in upstate New York.
More than that, there seems to be a broader refrain among the state's own Congressional delegation that unless the governor retools his plan, he is jeopardizing the credibility of even the most legitimate aid the state and city are entitled to. Some members have even begun whittling away to come up with a much smaller, more realistic proposal. "It's not dead, but it's definitely on life support," an assistant to a senior House Republican said. 
An assistant to a House leader, while not dooming the proposal entirely, said: "They're just not going to get all that. Conservatives in Congress are watching to see that nobody takes advantage of this crisis to fund their own pork projects."
Another assistant to a prominent Republican senator urged Mr. Pataki, a Republican, to abandon some of the more excessive requests, particularly when Congress needs to cover the rising cost of the nation's war effort. 
"Those extraneous things that have nothing to do with recovering from the attacks will have to fall by the wayside," the assistant said. "You can't go overboard on these things."
That sentiment is being echoed even by members of New York's delegation, who complain that they had little say in outlining the plan that Mr. Pataki submitted. The biggest concern they have is that Mr. Pataki's request undercuts real needs when some conservatives in Congress are looking for any reason to deny giving New York significantly more aid than it has already got.
The governor and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have taken different tacks on seeking more federal aid. The mayor, most notably with a budget modification, charts and graphs, tried to demonstrate that he had put his own house in order -- cutting agency budgets, freezing $1 billion in spending -- just hours before he appeared with Mr. Pataki to announce the $54 billion aid package. And he stressed that the package should not be expanded to include extraneous things. 
The mayor has declined to lobby in Washington on behalf of the Pataki plan, according to officials monitoring the issue.
The governor, by contrast, released the plan, went to Washington the next day and waited nearly a week to impose his own budgetary restrictions, doing so at a previously unscheduled news conference on the same day that the White House budget chief told businesses and state leaders that there would be no more bailouts and urged them toward fiscal restraint.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the dean of the delegation, was careful not to criticize the governor in a recent interview. But he made it clear that he disagreed with the governor's approach, saying, "You can't just throw your whole laundry list at Congress."
An assistant to a Republican House member from New York expressed similar bafflement. "Should we have opened with this hand? Absolutely not," the assistant said. "It's caused sticker shock. Some members of leadership are expressing their concern."
In fact, some members of the delegation have already begun to pick apart the Pataki plan, trying to shape a smaller request that would finance projects directly related to the terrorist attacks and that would be easier to sell on Capitol Hill.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, explained that the delegation members "are assessing which pieces have the greatest chance of winning support in the House, the Senate and the White House" before presenting them.
Three weeks ago, the White House and Congress approved $17.5 billion in disaster aid to help with cleaning up the destruction in Lower Manhattan and restoring public buildings and infrastructure. But last week, the governor released a plan calling for an additional $36.5 billion in federal assistance.
In his plan, Mr. Pataki estimated that the cost of rebuilding would total about twice the amount that the federal government had originally set aside for New York, or $34 billion.
Lawmakers here say -- and the Pataki administration acknowledges -- that that figure could be cut considerably, since it does not reflect the fact that insurance companies will have to help pay for the reconstruction effort. "It struck a lot of people as disingenuous for them not to take into account that insurance would cover some of it," said an assistant to one senior member of the New York delegation.
The other part of the Pataki plan that is meeting resistance is the governor's request for $3 billion to finance transportation projects, including rail, road and bridge upgrades in upstate New York. 
The governor also drew sharp criticism for seeking up to $12 billion in federal aid to make up for the sharp decrease in tax revenue that both the city and state expect in the next 18 months because of the disruption that occurred in Lower Manhattan, the state's economic engine.
In other disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, the federal government has not bailed out local governments for lost revenues. 
Greg Crist, a spokesman for Dick Armey, a Republican who is the House majority leader, said the proposal would likely meet stiff resistance. "There's going to be a lot of scrutiny," Mr. Crist said.

President Bush, who came into office just months ago talking of China as a "strategic competitor," departed for Shanghai today on a trip expected to complete a significant shift in his policy toward Beijing as he seeks to build, maintain and expand a global coalition against terrorism.
 The importance attached to Mr. Bush's appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where he will meet with the leaders of both Russia and China, was clear simply from the fact that the president was taking the trip while his nation was at war and coping with spreading anthrax attacks. When President Bill Clinton was ordering the bombing of Iraq three years ago, he skipped the meeting. 
 But Mr. Bush made plain that his focus would not be the trade issues that traditionally dominate the Asian gathering.
"Of course we'll talk about economics and trade," he told Air Force personnel and their families during a stopover visit here. "But the main thing that will be on my mind is to continue to rally the world against terrorists," and to remind other leaders "that evil knows no borders."
The events of the last five weeks have made it critical for Mr. Bush to develop ties with China that more closely resemble the "strategic partnership" envisaged by President Clinton and once openly disdained by President Bush. 
All talk of strategic competition has been omitted from Mr. Bush's comments, officials say, and his aides have quietly sanded away all the hard edges from the message he will deliver to his Chinese hosts in his visit, starting on Thursday.
"You won't hear much about dissidents, or Taiwan, or the dust-up with the spy plane," one close adviser to Mr. Bush said this week, referring to the incident last spring when a Chinese fighter hit an EP-3 surveillance plane, forcing it to land. "He can't afford that now. The Chinese have never been in a better mood to rebuild their relationship with Washington, and they know that now the president needs them, too."
James Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser under Mr. Clinton, said, "You'll never hear the words strategic competitor again." 
While conservative Republicans called for a far tougher stance against China and a shift favoring Taiwan earlier this year, they have been silent in the weeks leading up to the Asian trip, mainly, some say, because their focus is elsewhere. 
Mr. Bush, on his first trip to Asia since visiting China when his father was envoy to Beijing a quarter century ago, will meet President Jiang Zemin on Friday. 
The breadth of Mr. Bush's plans for the months ahead will provide the subtext of that meeting and others during three days of intense diplomacy with 20 nations.
While many Asian and Pacific governments have supported his counterterrorism plans -- Australia even said it would send troops, and Japan has offered logistical support -- a backlash is already taking place on the streets of several countries.
The Chinese want to redefine terrorism to provide a further justification for their crackdown on Muslim Uighur separatists and Tibetan independence supporters -- people who might have been known in Mr. Bush's Washington, until a few weeks ago, as dissidents.
Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who will meet with Mr. Bush on Sunday, also sees his new cooperation with the president as leverage. He has already won a change of wording from the White House, which noted the participation of Al Qaeda terrorists in Chechnya, and he hopes to beat back the administration's plans to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
Another leader in attendance will be the new president of Indonesia, Megawati Sukarnoputri, leader of the world's most populous Muslim nation. She has made clear to Washington that while she condemned the Sept. 11 attacks, she cannot sign any declaration endorsing the war in Afghanistan.
Other leaders, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who has his own problems with resurgent hard-line Muslims, have been highly critical of the American military action.
Mr. Bush's aides are scrambling to find a middle ground at the summit meeting with a declaration against terrorism that leaves every country free to define how it pursues that mission. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, acknowledged recently that Mr. Bush had to be careful about giving other nations too much rope.
"It is clear our job is to make certain that we continue to draw a line in all of our discussions between legitimate dissent or legitimate movements for the rights of minorities," Ms. Rice said, "and the fact that there may be international terrorists in various parts of the world." 
The diplomatic task facing Mr. Bush is complex. Internal divisions run deep in a grouping that embraces countries as suspicious of American intentions as Vietnam, as eager to join the fight as Australia and as jittery as Taiwan.
Overarching all of this political dissonance is a problem Mr. Bush has rarely discussed but will have to confront here: a global economic downturn that has gained speed since Sept. 11 and has yet to be met with a coordinated response.
It is hard to overestimate how the twin economic downturns in Japan and the United States affect Asia's export-oriented fortunes. Many of Asia's weakest economies are reeling, including some that never fully recovered -- and never really reformed -- after the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998.
This might be the first economic summit meeting in memory for which an administration did not offer a briefing about its economic strategy -- another sign that Mr. Bush's focus was almost entirely on terrorism.

HEADLINE: NASA's Longest-Serving Administrator Says He Will Step Down 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Daniel S. Goldin, who revamped and re-energized the nation's space program during almost a decade as head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, announced today that he was resigning.
 Mr. Goldin, NASA's longest-serving administrator, said he would leave on Nov. 17 and look at opportunities in private industry. 
 He has accepted an interim position with the Council on Competitiveness, a Washington group that promotes American economic and business leadership.
"I decided now is the time," Mr. Goldin said in a telephone news conference. "I love my country. I love this agency, but it is time."
In 1992, President George Bush signaled that he wanted a new direction for the space agency by nominating Mr. Goldin, who had few Washington ties but had been a veteran executive with TRW Inc., a leading aerospace contractor. Known as an innovative administrator, Mr. Goldin set about restructuring NASA from an agency accustomed to expanding budgets and big projects, to one that could operate with decreasing resources.
To the consternation of some agency veterans, Mr. Goldin revamped NASA by decentralizing its administration and overseeing a one-third reduction in its civil service work force. He pushed the agency to do more with less and instituted the sometimes controversial policy of "cheaper, faster, better," emphasizing more small space missions instead of a few large, expensive ones.
The policy was generally considered successful, with the launching of dozens of small spacecraft to study planets, asteroids, comets and other phenomena that cost a few hundred million dollars each instead of the single craft costing more than $1 billion each that tried to do everything at once.
This approach resulted in successes like the Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997 and the NEAR mission that orbited and landed on the asteroid Eros this year. But the policy also was blamed for the loss of two Mars missions in a row last year, with investigators saying they were underfinanced and improperly managed.
Mr. Goldin was allowed to stay on at NASA in the Clinton administration. There he supervised revamping the nation's foundering space station program into the International Space Station, with Russia brought in as a full partner.
The 18-nation project has just completed its first major stage of construction in Earth orbit and is permanently staffed by rotating crews of three astronauts. But NASA now faces more than $4 billion in cost overruns for its share of the project, and the current administration has told the agency that it must make up the excess from existing budgets.
Mr. Goldin said he was sure that NASA would find ways to absorb the increased space station costs and complete the project.
"There is always a crisis at NASA," he said, adding that the agency always managed to overcome them.
Dr. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said that many of the changes spearheaded by Mr. Goldin were necessary and that approaches like "cheaper, faster, better" appeared to be working.
Mr. Goldin, 61, was born in the Bronx and reared and educated in New York. He said that he would return to California, where he lived before coming to Washington, and that he would work with the White

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 Searching for the Source

ANTHRAX IN CAPITAL: Concern about biological terrorism heightened as preliminary tests showed that more than 30 workers on Capitol Hill were exposed to anthrax spores from a letter sent to the office of the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle. A1

THE STRAINS: Preliminary DNA tests showed that the strain of anthrax that infected an NBC employee appeared identical to the anthrax sent to American Media in Florida. B5

THE EVIDENCE: As the government begins the hunt for those who sent highly concentrated anthrax to Congress, the best evidence may come from the anthrax itself. B5

The Threat to Congress

THE TONE IN WASHINGTON: Confusion and anxiety were much in evidence among the people who set the capital's tone. A1

SPREAD IN BUILDING: Experts said it was unlikely that the spores mailed to Senator Daschle could have been spread in dangerous amounts to the rest of the building. B6

TESTS AND FEARS: Senator Daschle's office remained quarantined, and many of his employees tested positive for exposure to anthrax. Fears for his staff began to grow in South Dakota, the senator's home state. B6

Search for a Cure

MORE TREATMENTS: The government and the drug industry took steps to increase production of the antibiotic Cipro and to approve a broader range of drugs to fight anthrax. A1

DRUG MAKER BESIEGED: Satisfying the explosive demand for Cipro has created a big opportunity and some big problems for Bayer. B8

PLANS ON SMALLPOX: The government is negotiating with four drug companies to buy 300 million doses of smallpox vaccine. A1

Reacting to Anthrax

AN EARLY SUSPICION: Days before anthrax was detected in Florida, a Manhattan doctor told the city health department that his patient, an NBC employee, may have contracted anthrax. But the department did not notify federal authorities. B7

SPORES IN PATAKI OFFICES: Governor Pataki and his staff evacuated his Manhattan office and began taking antibiotics after tests found anthrax spores there. B7

COORDINATION CALLED FOR: No single office is overseeing the government responses to the anthrax threats, leading to some delays in criminal investigations and health tests. B7

The Air Raids

TALK OF GROUND FORCES: President Bush said the air attacks in Afghanistan were intended to pave the way for anti-Taliban forces on the ground. An aide later said Mr. Bush was referring to rebel groups. B1

REBELS FRUSTRATED: The United States continues to avoid bombing the Taliban's front lines, and a sense of frustration is growing among rebel officials and soldiers. B2

Two American Travelers

BUSH TO CHINA: President Bush left for an economic summit in China, a trip expected to complete a shift in his policy toward that nation. B3

TALKS WITH INDIA: Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sought to reassure India about America's intensifying alliance with its rival, Pakistan. B3

ANTI-TALIBAN FERVOR: In Uzbekistan, a mostly Muslim country, public feeling against terrorism and the Taliban is a unifying force. B3

Diplomacy and Dangers

AFGHANISTAN'S FUTURE: The United Nations' point man on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, stressed that the quest was only beginning for what to do about a post-war Afghanistan. B4

TALIBAN LEADER DEFIANT: The Taliban's commander broke days of silence with an appeal to his warriors not to buckle under pressure. B4

RIGHTS IN CANADA: The Canadian government has introduced stringent antiterrorism legislation allowing preventive arrests and broader electronic surveillance. B4

Travel and Security

ON HIJACKINGS: The head of the F.A.A. retreated from assertions that an order to ground planes on Sept. 11 had prevented further hijackings. B9

LACK OF COOPERATION: Federal officials said Saudi Arabia and Egypt had refused to cooperate with efforts to identify terrorists on aircraft. B9

ACTIONS IN CONGRESS: The House passed legislation to fight money laundering, and Congressional negotiators reached a deal that would clear the way for the new antiterrorism powers. B9

SPENDING LIMIT: The Bush administration proposed a plan for dividing the next $20 billion of emergency spending. And it said did it not intend to seek any more money for the war effort this year. B9

AID REQUEST IN DOUBT: The Bush administration balked at providing billions more dollars in new federal aid to New York. D1

The Country's Mood

MUSLIMS SINGLED OUT: With hate calls and ugly scenes in stores, it has been a rough five weeks for Muslim families in Laramie, Wyo. B1

HARD LESSONS: Victoria Cummock, whose husband died in the bombing of Pan Am 103, learned earlier than most what terrorism is. B10

LETTER DRAWS IRE: Strong emotions were stirred by a letter that a congresswoman wrote to a Saudi prince, which seemed to support the prince's criticism of American policy and to apologize for Mayor Giuliani's rejection of a donation from him. B10

A CALL FOR EVIDENCE: The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, said the president should reveal the evidence against Osama bin Laden. B10

THINKING GLOBALLY: The City Council in Berkeley, Calif., approved a resolution calling for an end to the bombing in Afghanistan. A12

Aftermath in New York

THE MAYOR'S MESSAGE: After a month of funerals and anthrax scares, Mayor Giuliani acknowledges that these are frightening times. But he is sticking to his strategy of displaying calm and confidence. B1

FEARS ABOUND: The anxiety in New York and its neighboring communities seemed to ratchet up as officials scrambled to respond to anthrax reports. B12

PREACHERS THRIVING: Street preachers are flourishing around the edge of ground zero. B12

CONCERNS ON NUCLEAR PLANTS: A decision by the Coast Guard to cut back patrols of the Indian Point nuclear power plants has intensified concerns over how well they are protected from terror attacks. B11

RESTITUTION ORDERED: Four terrorists with ties to Osama bin Laden will be ordered to pay restitution to victims of the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa. B11

HELPING THE JOBLESS: A fair to help New Yorkers who lost their jobs after the trade center disaster drew 8,000 people and more companies than could be accommodated. D8

Business

GREENSPAN'S VIEW: The Federal Reserve chairman said that the damage to the economy by the terrorist attacks should be temporary. C1

AID TO INSURERS: The insurance industry plans to seek aid in the event of a major bioterrorism attack. C1

The Arts

A TIE TO THE PAST: "Moby Dick," with its tales of cataclysm told by a stranger in Manhattan, seems oddly resonant today, the 150th anniversary of its publishing. E1

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
U.S. and China, Entwined in Commerce and Mistrust

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author most recently of "Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry."

 BODY:
The coming of jihad to American soil, with jets turned into flying bombs and the mails used to carry anthrax, brings on a strange kind of nostalgia for the cold war. Even at its most frightening moments -- the Berlin blockade, the Cuban missile crisis -- Soviet and American leaders pulled back from the brink. The deterrence doctrine of mutually assured destruction assumed an enemy that, unlike radical Islam's holy warriors, did not welcome suicidal martyrdom as the fast track to paradise.
 All the events since Sept. 11, then, have posed a major dilemma for "Dangerous Straits," the documentary about tensions between the United States and China that will be shown on PBS tonight. A joint project of "Frontline" and The New York Times, "Dangerous Straits" clearly was begun before the terror attacks drastically redefined the ranking of America's foes and tore up modern war's rules of engagement, and it struggles to contend with these epic changes. 
 On one hand "Dangerous Straits" tries to stand by its basic premise, arguing that friction between the United States and China over the Taiwan Strait raises the specter of military conflict. On the other hand it tries to acknowledge the newly shared interest of both nations in battling terrorism by Muslim radicals and separatists. The result is a documentary that is both informative and uneven, perceptive and hyperbolic.
While "Dangerous Straits" is being broadcast to coincide with President Bush's trip to Shanghai for the Asian Pacific Economic Conference, the documentary derives from the confrontation six months ago, when a Chinese fighter plane collided with an American spy craft making a routine surveillance of the Taiwan Strait. The damaged American plane landed on a Chinese island, Hainan, and its crew remained in custody until Washington's ambassador to Beijing expressed regret for the death of the Chinese pilot in the episode. Meanwhile, amid a military buildup on the Chinese side of the strait, President Bush approved the sale of defensive weapons to Taiwan and declared American resolve to protect an endangered Taiwan.
That all this amounts to significant tension is self-evident. As produced and directed by Chris Oxley, however, "Dangerous Straits" implies that superpower war was imminent, that "the two countries, both nuclear powers, nearly came to blows." In its visual images, too, the documentary sometimes sensationalizes a conflict that is unsettling enough on its own terms. While the pilot of the downed American jet, Shane Osborne, recounts his exhausting interrogation by the Chinese, the screen flashes scenes that were obviously concocted in a studio: a chair being slammed down on a bare floor, a prisoner's shadow on the wall of a cell, a bare light bulb clouded by the smoke of an inquisitor's cigarette.
Nothing makes these B-movie effects more superfluous (and embarrassing) than the serious analysis that various diplomats, scholars and journalists offer in the documentary. They depict not a nuclear conflagration waiting to happen but a far more complex and fascinating interplay between China and the United States, massive trading partners even as they remain political antagonists. The significance of the showdown, "Dangerous Straits" points out a bit too belatedly, is how it affected that balance.
"I think China's one of those countries that has very complex feelings toward the United States," Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state, says. "They like our music. They like our movies. They like much about what the United States stands for. At the same time they are deeply dissatisfied with certain aspects of American foreign policy. Many Chinese believe fundamentally that the United States is set on destabilizing China, or at least trying to stop China from reaching its full potential."
For the Bush administration, the documentary explains, relations with China polarize two Republican constituencies. David Sanger, a Washington correspondent for The Times, describes these as "a very business-oriented camp" that sees China as "perhaps the greatest market anywhere in the world" and a "containment crowd" that perceives a "growing military threat from China."
"Dangerous Straits" would have been wise to devote most of its time to exploring exactly the thesis that Mr. Sanger and Mr. Campbell set forth. Their wise words suggest not the zero-sum story of war or peace, enemy or friend, but a narrative of dueling constituencies within each country trying to exploit either business ties or the divisive Taiwan issue for their own gain.
If the United States did not attack Mao's China at the height of the cold war, when Communist forces were raining a half-million shells on the Nationalist island of Kinmen, as "Dangerous Straits" recounts, then how plausible is it to imagine armed conflict with a nation where Motorola has invested $3.4 billion, employs 12,000 people, and sells five million cell phones a year? Is it truly accurate to say, as "Dangerous Straits" does in its final moments, that China regards assertions of Taiwanese sovereignty "with the same severity as if terrorists threatened their country"? Maybe, but a viewer is left to take that claim on faith.
In a quieter passage "Dangerous Straits" more accurately depicts the American engagement with China as a "policy of strategic ambiguity." When this documentary embraces and explores that ambiguity, it succeeds best. These days we know all too well what real war looks like and where it is being fought.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The stimulus package should fix the unemployment insurance program first.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
IT is often said that unemployment insurance is the first line of defense in a recession. The line needs some strengthening, however, because the program has not kept up with changes in the work force and has been neglected by many state legislatures.
 Economists have a well-worked-out theory of unemployment insurance. The program helps laid-off workers maintain consumption and search for a job that matches their skills. But these benefits come at a cost: more generous or longer-lasting benefits reduce the intensity with which unemployed workers look for a job. 
 To balance the intended and unintended effects, most states replace 40 to 50 percent of lost wages. Benefits are temporary, typically lasting up to 26 weeks. Through a financing plan known as experience rating, employers with worse records of laying off workers pay somewhat more into the program to discourage layoffs.
This is a distinctly American brand of unemployment compensation. In France, for example, benefits replace around 80 percent of earnings and last up to two years; there is no experience rating. The relatively low level and short duration of benefits -- and experience rating -- partly account for our lower unemployment rate.
Unemployment insurance is the quintessential economic stimulus: benefits ramp up temporarily in a downturn and reach those most in need. Outlays soared from $14 billion in 1989 to $37 billion in 1992, when the jobless rate peaked, and fell to $21 billion in 1995, when the labor market improved. By building up reserves in prosperous times and spending them in weaker times, the program helps stabilize the economy.
Unlike many other programs being considered for the stimulus package, unemployment insurance provides security for those who do not directly receive benefits. Just knowing that benefits are available in case of job loss inspires confidence. A strong safety net also makes it unnecessary to have industry-by-industry bailouts in response to adverse shocks.
President Bush recently proposed spending $3 billion to extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks for eligible workers. Extended benefits are a sensible and traditional response in a recession. The distortion caused by longer-lasting or more generous benefits is less significant in a downturn because jobs are less plentiful regardless of how hard people search for work, said Dale Mortensen of Northwestern University, who has done pioneering research on unemployment insurance.
Indeed, a bipartisan group in Congress is questioning whether President Bush's proposal goes far enough to mend the program and the particular way he would extend benefits.
In the president's proposal, benefits would automatically be extended in Virginia, New York and New Jersey, and in other states in which the jobless rate rises 30 percent, but only for those who lost jobs after Sept. 11.
This trigger mechanism has some peculiar implications. If the unemployment rate rises from 3 to 4 percent in one state, extended benefits will kick in, but if it jumps from 10 to 12.5 percent in another, that state will not qualify.
It is also unclear why Virginia, with an unemployment rate of 2.9 percent, the nation's third lowest, should qualify for extended benefits, while Washington -- which is across the Potomac from the the Pentagon and has a 6.4 percent jobless rate, the nation's second highest -- does not.
And why should a worker laid off on Sept. 10 be treated differently from one laid off on Sept. 12? Surely, those laid off before Sept. 11 will face tougher job competition because of the rise in unemployment after the attacks.
The terrorist attacks are not solely responsible for the slowdown: it was already in the works. The number of jobless workers rose 1.4 million in the 12 months before Sept. 11; unemployment claims reached their highest level in nine years over the summer.
Legislation sponsored by Representatives Benjamin Cardin, a Maryland Democrat; Amo Houghton, a New York Republican; and six others would do much more to strengthen the safety net than would the president's proposal. Their bipartisan bill would extend benefits for 13 weeks to those who exhaust their regular benefits in the next year; temporarily increase benefits by 15 percent, or $25 a week, whichever is greater; use more up-to-date earnings records to determine eligibility; and expand eligibility to those seeking part-time work.
Unemployed workers who seek part-time jobs are ineligible for benefits in most states even though their earnings are taxed to finance the program. Because many workers who left welfare for work in the late 1990's must work part-time hours to meet family obligations, they will not have much of a safety net to fall back on if eligibility is not expanded.
Mr. Houghton said, "There are so many part-time workers out there that you can't walk over that issue and think you have addressed unemployment insurance."
Mr. Cardin and Mr. Houghton failed in their bid to attach their $15 billion bill to the stimulus package that steamrolled through the House Ways and Means Committee last week, but they hope it will pass as a free-standing bill if it comes to a vote.
Mr. Cardin lamented that it was hard to understand why temporarily extending benefits to part-time workers had proved so controversial, but both he and Mr. Houghton made clear that they planned to pursue the issue.
In January I used this space to argue that many states -- particularly New York and Texas -- needed to shore up their unemployment insurance programs to prepare for a downturn. More than a dozen states let their experience rating lapse and failed to build up adequate reserves in the 1990's, hindering their ability to expand eligibility and provide adequate benefits.
Fortunately, the federal unemployment trust funds are flush and could be used to support the states in the current downturn if Congress and the administration act. But the longer-term issues -- like better experience rating, more realistic automatic triggers for extended state benefits, and adequate benefits and expanded eligibility in the least generous states -- still need to be addressed.
In announcing his goals for up to $75 billion of additional stimulus spending, President Bush urged: "We don't have time to try to invent new programs. We ought to make those programs that exist work better." Yet his proposal does little to fix unemployment insurance, a time-tested, antirecessionary program.

HEADLINE: Essay; 
Bush's Shanghai Gesture

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Here are a few do's and don'ts that will help coalition-wary realists measure President Bush's success or failure at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai.
 Don't get hung up in a free-trade love feast. Bush is not leaving his command post in terrorist wartime primarily to save the world from recession. Interminable blather about opening up markets is what China's Jiang Zemin wants most. The Chinese leader's diplomatic legions, drawn up in vast cumbrous array, will issue reams of plans for a "Shanghai round" of negotiations, but what makes this Bush trip necessary is getting, face to face, a promise of intelligence sharing about terror groups, to be followed by arrests and extradition. 
 Do focus on the central issue of the new era: All nations must choose sides in the terror war. Muslim Indonesia, with the world's fourth-largest population, is becoming a breeding ground for fanaticism. Bush needs to get commitments from nations like Japan, the Philippines, Australia, Taiwan and South Korea to help Indonesia -- as well as dictator-ridden Malaysia -- resist and root out Al Qaeda and its underworld brethren. 
Do not let China and Russia gang up on us in a trilateral meeting; stick to "bi-lats" only. Jiang wants to use this crisis to justify crackdowns on Taiwan, Tibet and its Muslim Uighurs, while Vladimir Putin sees a chance to brutalize Chechnya again and snatch independence back from Georgia. Bush should hold fast to his unequivocal position: Not all local autonomy need be separatist and not every separatist movement is a terrorist organization. 
Do seize the moment to advance missile defense. Bush shows no sign of wobbling on this. Next month is decision time to continue or to delay development, and that deadline coincides with his "friend" Putin's visit to the Crawford, Tex., ranch. Now is the moment to nail down his agreement to the principles of a "new framework" to replace the outmoded ABM treaty that now renders both nations defenseless. Then both presidents can instruct aides to complete the deal for signing at the November "Crawford summit."
Do not pay for the freedom to build a space shield (or for permission to hit the Taliban out of the formerly Soviet Uzbekistan) with an offer to bring unready Russia into the World Trade Organization or into NATO. No quid pro quo is required when all nations benefit from a planet-wide defense against terrorist missiles containing nuclear or germ warheads. Bush could offer Putin some face-saving wiggle room by promising to consult him before deploying the antimissile shield. 
Do follow up such a preliminary Russian-American missile handshake with a face-to-face pitch to Jiang to relieve the mind of his military. Bush's earnestness and charm are unlikely to stop China's inexorable missile buildup, but Jiang, as he nears retirement, may be looking for a graceful way to accept the newly reinforced American resolve. It's worth a shot.
Don't let our new warmth toward Pakistan allow China to get away with selling missile know-how to that nervous nuclear power. In November 2000, China agreed not to transfer ballistic missile technology to its longtime ally Pakistan. Then it did. When we objected, China stonewalled; we countered by denying U.S. companies the license to launch satellites on Chinese rockets. In Shanghai, Jiang will try to get a pass for its duplicity by saying we all love Pakistan's dictator now. Bush should not allow himself to be so rolled.
Do make clear to China that future relations with the U.S. hinge on sharing the intelligence gathered by its worldwide network of spies. "As you might imagine," a high official traveling with the president understates, "our intelligence relationship with the Chinese is not all that well developed." But even as we continue to steal each other's secrets, it should not be beyond the wit of spooks, when national interests coincide, to exchange secrets about a common enemy. 
This above all: Freedom of world trade, so devoutly to be wished, cannot blossom without freedom from fear. Those who want to participate in prosperity are obliged to join America in crushing the fanatical fearmongers and the nations nurturing them. That should be the message Bush drives home in Shanghai.

HEADLINE: The Shanghai Summit 

 BODY:
President Bush's diplomatic skills will get a workout over the next few days in Shanghai. Instead of talking economics, the usual subject at this annual autumn gathering of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations, Mr. Bush will be trying to strengthen the international coalition against terrorism that he has been assembling since Sept. 11. He should use his meetings with other leaders, including Presidents Jiang Zemin of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, to clarify what help they are prepared to offer and what they expect in return. 
 China has given strong rhetorical support to the American campaign against terrorism and has shared intelligence with Washington. It appears to have encouraged Pakistan, a close ally, to stand with the United States. In return, it seems to expect America and other countries to accept its mischaracterizations of the Falun Gong spiritual movement and separatists in Tibet and Xinjiang as terrorists. Mr. Bush should firmly decline. 
 To reward Beijing for its assistance in the anti-terror fight, Mr. Bush may allow the resumption of some American military and high-tech exports to China that were suspended after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. Unfortunately, Beijing continues to be dangerously lax about its own arms exports. Any easing of American sanctions should be linked to tighter Chinese controls on the sale or transfer of unconventional weapons technologies. 
Mr. Putin has moved aggressively since Sept. 11 to help Washington. Among other things, he has encouraged former Soviet republics in Central Asia like Uzbekistan to open their bases to American troops and planes. In return Mr. Putin has tried to get Washington to mute criticism of Russia's handling of Chechnya, something Mr. Bush should resist. More reasonably, Moscow is pressing Washington to slow its haste to discard the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. If the two countries can cooperate so closely against Osama bin Laden, they should be able to work out ways to amend the treaty to permit reasonable limited missile defenses. 
President Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia, leader of the most populous Muslim country, initially rallied to the American cause, but her government has wavered in recent weeks. She should move against the financial supporters of Indonesia's Laskar Jihad Islamic terrorists. The Philippines needs no encouragement in fighting Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic terrorist organization with ties to the bin Laden network. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo does need advice from Washington, however, in how to do so more effectively. 
Mr. Bush will not find uniform support for all his antiterrorism policies among the leaders in Shanghai. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, for one, has been notably critical. But if he can mobilize a shared sense of outrage and a recognition that terrorism is the common enemy of all decent societies, his time will be well spent.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "BAMANA: THE ART OF EXISTENCE IN MALI," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through March 3). African art is about envisioning a moral universe and shaping the world through spiritual energy to conform to that vision. The positive effects are evident in objects and images that unite communities, ease pain, forecast the future and explain the past. Nearly 100 of them are included in this wonderful show by one of the best museums in town. Among the highlights are exquisite iron ritual staffs, personable hand puppets, grave carved-wood maternity figures and a whole herd of the infinitely stylish antelope-shaped crest masks known as Ci-wara. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+; free on Sundays (Holland Cotter).

* "PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER: DRAWINGS AND PRINTS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 2). We could all do worse right now than to lose ourselves for a while in this show of drawings and prints by Bruegel, who knew a thing or two about vice and virtue. The world is anarchic and cruel and can drive all of us to despair sometimes, but good art is a realm unto itself, he tells us, and thankfully we can escape into it from time to time when we need to regain our senses. Against the narcissism of our fin-de-siecle milieu, the mysterious figure of the elder Bruegel comes as a small and fortuitous counterpoint. To judge from his pictures of the deadly vices, or his Everyman as a greedy, nearsighted merchant, or some of the nimbler drawings like "The Beekeepers," an image of lumbering, faceless figures in woven masks and bulky clothes, Bruegel doesn't come across as a compassionate artist, never mind his beloved pictures of peasants and ice skaters. Instead, his dark-humored viewpoint seems strangely moving and modern. Solace, he implies, comes only from the integrity of the artist's effort, not a bad lesson today. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "ALBERTO GIACOMETTI," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 8). Giacometti as the Sartre of sculpture might lead you to imagine him the right subject for troubled times. But that would be the wrong reason to see this exhibition. The right reason is that like all perceptive and eloquent art, it tells you why it is good to be alive. It investigates the pleasure of thinking and looking long and hard, which is never as simple as it sounds. The work is more varied than you may think -- sometimes black-humored, playful, sensual, even devoutly tender -- and includes plasters, painted bronzes and even a clunky stone garden sculpture, a splendid oddity, that demonstrate the material virtuosity and subtle coloration of an artist too often presumed to be pretty much just dark and heavy. Spread chronologically across two floors, compressed then open, like the art they contain, the show has as its unnecessary excuse the centenary of Giacometti's birth. We don't learn much that isn't already known, but it is a thorough, serious, very elegant exhibition, and there is nothing the matter with being reacquainted from time to time with what great art looks like. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "BEN KATCHOR: PICTURE STORIES," the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 10). Set in a milieu of 19th- and 20th-century Yiddish-American culture, characters like Julius Knipl, a real estate photographer, and Nathan Kishon, a slaughterhouse worker dismissed for mixing kosher with nonkosher animal tongues, are the antiheroes of Ben Katchor's zany, loquacious cartoon strips, which have appeared in The Village Voice, The Forward, The New York Press, Metropolis and other publications since 1988. What's most artful about his drawings, mostly in black-and-white with gray ink wash, is their evocation of New York's demoniacal energy, the look of its down-at-the-heels neighborhoods and storefront facades and its ethnic faces. Although this show seems to include miles of cartoons -- with other embellishments, like film projections and a display of fabricated artifacts -- you don't have to eyeball every one of them to agree that Mr. Katchor is an outsize talent, one who has brilliantly explored a very special world. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* "MEETING GOD: ELEMENTS OF HINDU DEVOTION," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through Feb. 24). Visitors to this amazing, often moving hodgepodge of a show may or may not encounter the divine presence. But they can easily enter into its mood of euphoric reference and spiritual graciousness while also learning a lot about one of the world's great religions. The displays roam through art, craft and kitsch; they include beautiful facsimiles of household Hindu shrines and lavishly costumed, spice-daubed statues. Connecting links are provided by videotapes, music, text panels and most of all the color photographs of Steven P. Huyler, one of the exhibition's organizers. The centerpiece is a stupendous trompe l'oeil re-creation of a sacred banyan tree bedecked with offerings and surrounded by sculptures produced by the museum's diorama artists. It is rare to see so much information, spiritual feeling and visual beauty brought into such effective alignment. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $7.50, students and 60+; $6, children (Roberta Smith).

"SIGNAC 1863-1935: MASTER NEO-IMPRESSIONIST" AND "NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: THE CIRCLE OF PAUL SIGNAC," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 30). These shows give an excellent view of the career of Signac, the first and most fervent convert to George Seurat's color theories and Pointillist technique, and their chief proselytizer after Seurat's death in 1891. Redolent of Signac's intelligence, discipline, faith in progress and unflagging energy, the first show moves in clear-cut chapters, beginning with his awkward attempts at Impressionism and a gallery of beautiful transitional works that are among the show's best. Next come his Seuratesque seascapes and more distinctive figurative works; the radiant St.-Tropez paintings in which he made Neo-Impressionism his own; and his exuberantly eccentric late paintings and not-eccentric-enough watercolors. The importance of Signac's color to the development of Modernism -- starting with Matisse and the Fauves -- is unmistakable, but so is his tendency to be mechanical and a little soulless. The smaller exhibition of work by the artists he knew, from Seurat to Matisse, clarifies both his deficiencies and his achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "TRADITIONAL JAPANESE DESIGN: FIVE TASTES," Japan Society Gallery, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Jan. 6). This inspired exhibition parses nearly 150 objects of everyday use according to distinct, if not entirely separate, sensibilities; and in the process it reveals the complex role that aesthetics has always played in Japan's social, economic and intellectual life. Spanning periods from the prehistoric Jomon to the late-19th-century Edo, the beautifully installed show includes tools, clothing, weapons, shop signs, sake bottles, tea bowls, a range of lacquer and much else. The simple household objects of artisans and farmers are contrasted with a more contrived simplicity of the masters of the tea ceremony. The ostentatious kimonos of noble women are followed by the discreetly luxurious robes of Edo merchants' wives, whose extravagances were restricted by sumptuary laws. Despite considerable diversity in craft, material and visual ideals, the exhibition is united by a profound reverence for the beauty of the natural world and the conviction that it should not be marred by manmade objects. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5 (Smith).

Galleries: Uptown

"EXQUISITE MOMENTS: WEST LAKE AND SOUTHERN SONG ART," China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 9). New York's big fall show of Chinese painting is installed in a very small space: two galleries at the China Institute that together could fit in a coat-check room at the Met. But square footage doesn't matter. Scale and quality do. Most of the 40 or so paintings in the show, on loan from premier American museums, are also small. Created in the form of album pages and fans, they are a one-on-one sort of art, meant to be brought out every now and then and savored, like love letters, in private. And as with love letters, the emotions conveyed are sweet, intense and sometimes deep (Cotter).

DAVID MANN, James Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Nov. 3). Mr. Mann's abstract paintings have lush, glossy surfaces and mysterious, swirly depths. He paints translucent glazes over oily, spotty underpainting, then adds gestural shapes like knotted ribbons or jelly fish or fluttering butterflies. Color ranges from the incandescent blood red of "Spanish Manners" to the cool blues and jade greens of "Coincidence." "Inevitable Skin," with its thick, pearlescent pink surface, is weirdly sexy (Ken Johnson).

THOMAS RUFF, "l.m.v.d.r.," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 3). Mr. Ruff's photographs of houses in Europe by the great Modernist architect Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe (i.e., "l.m.v.d.r.") are big and beautifully produced, but bland despite various digital manipulations. Don't miss the nifty stereoscopic viewing boxes: put your nose close to the glass and you discover a remarkably vivid three-dimensional image of a Mies interior (Johnson).

ROBERT THERRIEN, Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Oct. 27). In one of two mercurial sculptures, a football-size metal teardrop is poised upright on the corner of an eye-level table top; in the other, two thick red panels jut divergently from the wall like Minimalist planks or the Dutch door of a giant's house. As his playful, archetypal drawings do, Mr. Therrien's sculptures appeal simultaneously to one's Modernist sophistication and to one's inner child. In this they evoke dreams of pure new beginnings (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

LYNN DAVIS, "Ice," Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 58th Street, (212) 750-7070 (through Nov. 3). In her second show on the subject, Ms. Davis focuses on the architectural structures of icebergs that inhabit Disko Bay, Greenland. Their majestic formations of cubes, towers, arches and cliffs and the reflections they cast in shimmering water make awesome subjects. The austere elegance of these photographs is in keeping with the manmade and natural monuments she has shot in Asia and Africa, but the icebergs are more mysteriously elemental (Glueck).

BODIL MANZ, Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through Nov. 3). This highly regarded Danish ceramicist makes beautiful cylindrical and oval porcelain vessels with crisp geometric surface designs. Some have walls so thin they look as though they were made of paper. A set of new large and thick pieces with crusty, Expressionistic surfaces are impressive, but they lack the exquisite refinement and seductive intimacy of the smaller works (Johnson).

GERHARD RICHTER, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 27). Mr. Richter's latest New York gallery exhibition feels like a cross between a new car showroom and a tutorial in postmodern painting. It is full of undeniably handsome new Richters -- 38 in all -- hot off the assembly line. Dominated by a silvery, penitential gray and filling four galleries, they rehearse the artist's famous disdain for distinctions between abstraction and representation, industrial production and artistic touch. While revealing nothing new about his art, they offer assurance that the product is still reliable, especially if one takes quantity as ultimate confirmation of quality (Smith).

* ALMA W. THOMAS, "Phantasmagoria: Major Paintings From the 1970'S," Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Nov. 3). With each new showing, Thomas's paintings look fresher and livelier, their totally abstract vocabulary of color markings conveying the spirit of a vibrant inner life. After decades of teaching art in the public schools of Washington while doing realist still lifes on her own, she found her voice as an abstract color painter. She pared down her style from tight realist brushwork to geometric, mosaiclike dabs and patches of high-energy hues. Laid down in irregular allover patterns on solid grounds that show through in webs and networks, her late works are sophisticated color structures that still reveal a debt to the natural world. Joy may be in short supply elsewhere, but it resonates in these paintings (Glueck).

VACLAV VYTLACIL, David Findlay Jr., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 486-7660 (through Oct. 27). Born in New York, Vytlacil (1892-1984) studied with Hans Hofmann in the 1920's and later became an influential teacher himself. From 1946 to 1978 he taught at the Art Students League. This selection of modest Cubist-style figurative and abstract pictures, mainly from the 30's and 40's, reveals an artist with a deft touch who thoroughly assimilated the formalist lessons of Hofmann as well as Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

NICOLA DE MARIA, "La Testa Allegra di un Angelo Bello," Sperone Westwater, 121 Greene Street, (212) 431-3685 (through Oct. 27). Mr. De Maria's work is all about color, not that you'd know it from the title of his show, which translates roughly as "The Cheerful Head of a Beautiful Angel." He uses color from its brightest, warmest, most primary manifestations to subtle, sophisticated combinations of hues and textures that seem cued by the stones and mosaics of ancient civilizations. He has covered a gallery wall with a playful mural in which ovoids and parts of circles disport in bright colors on a bright blue ground. In an adjacent gallery appear works of quite another tonal presence, a series of white, heavily impastoed canvases embellished with random scratchings that suggest ghostly faces and bodies, along with patches, pocks, dots and tiny squares of paint. As rough and weathered-looking as the facades of old Venetian palazzos, they are in vigorous contrast to the sunny chromatics of the mural. The tension between the two makes this show all the livelier (Glueck).

TERENCE LA NOUE, David Beitzel, 102 Prince Street, (212) 219-2863 (through Nov. 10). This veteran abstract painter creates dense, colorful crazy-quilt collages of Cubist and biomorphic shapes, Expressionist gesture and quirky symbols on irregularly shaped unstretched canvases. Driven by playful hedonism and cosmic intuitions, Mr. La Noue's paintings have a richly sensuous presence, but feel, ultimately, more tastefully decorative than adventurously imaginative (Johnson).

AMY O'NEILL, "LOKN4U," Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455 (through Oct. 27). There is a lot of attention to detail in Ms. O'Neill's elaborate theatrical installations. One simulates an old-fashioned carnival game under a blue- and red-striped tent; with inflatable weapons for prizes, it's an antiwar statement. An old bar with dark wood paneling, tacky lights and artificial smoke seeping out from behind the shot glasses has a nice ambience, but its point remains unclear (Johnson).

RAVINDER G. REDDY, Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Oct. 27). This Indian sculptor's painted and gilded fiberglass figures have been among the most visible examples of contemporary South Asian art. For his first New York show, several pieces have been installed at Deitch's hangarlike space, among them colossal heads of wide-eyed women with flowers twined in their hair, and gold-skinned nudes, one of which is a reference to ancient Buddhist sculptures of nature spirits. The results are a hybrid, with roots in the past but also in the pop cultural present: a heroic art with a common touch, kitsch for the ages (Cotter).

Galleries: Chelsea

JEFF BROUWS, "Inside the Live Reptile Tent," Robert Mann Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 989-7600 (through Nov. 3). Serpentine roller coasters, dazzling neon signs, sideshow freaks, intrepid high divers, hokey games of chance, Ferris wheels and targets that you sock with a ball are grist for the lens of Mr. Brouws, who has been photographing the dying American carnival scene for more than a decade. In this show, the California-born photographer, who has previously focused on derelict gasoline stations and other highway phenomena, offers a fine wallow in carny nostalgia (Glueck).

FRANCIS CAPE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372 (through Oct. 27). An expert woodworker, Mr. Cape has transformed an entire wall of the gallery into a faux-antique, Early American-style facade, the intricate frame and panel construction painted a warm off-white. But for all its well-built concreteness, it isn't what it appears to be; it's a simulation like a Warhol Brillo box, a slightly surrealistic representation of a certain sort of domestic kitsch, a meditation on the allure of fake traditionalism (Johnson).

MARK COHEN, "Trespass," Bruce Silverstein Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-3930 (through Nov. 10). Mr. Cohen zeros in on an arm, a leg, a foot, a shoulder tattoo, even a gum bubble so huge that it replaces the face of the young girl blowing it. Taken out of bodily context, these fragmentary (but uncropped) pictures often make fine street poetry. His use of strobe often lends a surreality to his shots, making light as much a part of the impact as the image itself. The head of a young boy, brightly silhouetted by light against the background of a dark street takes on a visionary aspect. Through the eloquence of Mr. Cohen's laconic lens, a town gradually reveals itself (Glueck).

"EPIC PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION," Cuban Art Space, 124 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-0559 (through Oct. 27). For a brief time before the Cuban Revolution turned catastrophic, it had a kind of Hollywood glamour, with troops in scruffy-chic beards and berets and the baby-faced Fidel Castro and the Byronic Che Guevara as superstar leaders. A handful of Cuban photographers, including Raul Corrales and Osvaldo Salas, were responsible for promoting that image, and some of their signature work is on view. The leading image maker, though, was Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, or Korda, who came to the job through a career in fashion photography and advertising and created the image of Che as "Heroic Guerrilla" (Cotter).

BARBARA GROSSMAN, Bowery, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 230-6655 (through Oct. 27). Ms. Grossman had her first solo exhibition at this gallery in 1973. In this, her ninth since then, she presents medium large, bushy Matisse-style paintings in which two or three blocky women in loose dresses read or sing from sheet music against bright, busily patterned rug and wallpaper backgrounds (Johnson).

"INK STUDS," Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through Oct. 27). At its best, as in the work of Daniel Clowes, creator of "Ghost World," the comic book can seem a form of infinite possibility. This unfortunately titled but engaging exhibition features original inked pages by Mr. Clowes as well as samples of variously funny, bizarre and adolescent frame-by-frame narratives by Charles Burns, Kaz, Gary Panter (set designer for "Pee-Wee's Playhouse") and Chris Ware (Johnson).

STEPHEN MUELLER AND DION JOHNSON, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-3318 (through Nov. 17). Glowing watery plaids, candy-colored stripes and checks, and emblematic shapes that look Middle Eastern are playfully layered by Mr. Mueller in canvases both optically riveting and mystically suggestive. Mr. Johnson combines thick paint -- troweled, combed, smeared and dribbled -- schematic diagrams of machinery, furniture and architecture and neatly painted images in a child's picture book style to dreamy and sensuous effect (Johnson).

BERNIE SEARLE, Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 741-2582 (through Oct. 27). Ms. Searle's New York debut introduces a promising young South African artist whose aesthetic is still in formation. Over the course of works dating from 1998 to this year, the show traces a development from relatively superficial, almost glamour-magazine images of the artist's body and face covered with spices, to a haunting photo-performance piece called "Still," in which flour becomes a vehicle for labor, ancient ritual and racial difference. But the best piece is "Stain," a series of small photographs that illuminates connections between power, sex and violence with help from the title's dictionary definition (Smith).

BUZZ SPECTOR, "All the Books in My Library . . . ," Cristinerose, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Oct. 27). An artist known for making art out of and about books presents witty, large-format Polaroid pictures of items from his collection. "Freeze Freud" has the complete works of the psychoanalyst frozen in blocks of ice. "(All the Books in My Library) By or About Christian Boltanksi" is just that -- a picture of 18 volumes with the spines turned away. In "My Fiction," a large six-panel piece, the artist presents himself shirtless surrounded by stacks of modern literature (Johnson).

Other Galleries

ZARINA BHIMJI, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096 (through Oct. 27). This show brings a double debut: the inauguration of Talwar Gallery and the first New York solo appearance of the African-born, London-based art Ms. Zarina Bhimji, seen here previously in museum group shows. She offers an idea-rich multimedia photographic installation that touches on different kinds of gardens -- English parks, slave plantations, paradise -- and adds enigmatically sensual abstract images that tie their meanings and histories together. As a bonus, the pictures are gorgeous (Cotter).

* "EXPANDING ON A LEGACY: AMERICAN ART FROM THE MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM," UBS Paine Webber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Nov. 30). In the 19th century Montclair, N.J., was a thriving art colony whose best known member was the landscapist George Inness (1825-1894), and had high-minded citizens with cultural aspirations. A splendid result was the Montclair Art Museum, opened in 1914 and today one of the country's leading small museums of American art. This sampler of some 80 paintings, sculptures and American Indian art is meant to bring its treasures to a larger audience while it completes a renovation. A 1782 portrait by Gilbert Stuart; a major Inness landscape; realist canvases by John Sloan and Edward Hopper; a good slice of early Modernist work by Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis and Morgan Russell; an early Abstract Expressionist theme by Adolph Gottlieb; a group of sculptures by names like Daniel Chester Frency, Louise Nevelson, Man Ray and George Rickey, and an elegant Tlingit totem pole from the Northwest Coast make this an appetizing prelude to the feast across the river (Glueck).

"SHIFTING TIDES: CUBAN PHOTOGRAPHY AFTER THE REVOLUTION," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Oct. 27). This show begins in the 1970's with revolution-era Cuban photography in a documentary mode and then rapidly brings the picture into the present with young artists today. Conceptually grounded, often multimedia in format and obliquely critical, focused on personal perception rather than historical events, their work is too varied to be tagged by a look or a style. It ranges from the elegiac photomontages of Rogelio Lopez Marin, known as Gory, to the ritualistic tableaus of Marta Maria Perez Bravo to a sardonic take on epic photography by Manuel Pina in the series "Manipulation, Truths and Other Illusions." The title could be applied to the show as a whole (Cotter).

Last Chance

"FIELD OF STONES: SCHOLAR ROCKS, INKSTONES AND PAINTINGS," China 2000, 5 East 57th Street, (212) 588-1198 (through Wednesday). The Chinese scholar rock, a piece of stone discovered in nature, was selected for its unusual form; cradled in a beautiful wooden base, it served as an object of philosophical contemplation. This display of scholar rocks from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries is notable for being drawn from the collection of a single Beijing collector. The show also includes paintings of stones, inkstones and rocks simulated in wood or porcelain (Johnson).

"INTERWOVEN LIVES: GEORGE PLATT LYNES AND HIS FRIENDS," DC Moore, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111 (through tomorrow). More than 140 photographs, paintings, drawings and prints tell the story of the New York portrait and fashion photographer Lynes (1907-1955) and the enchanted circle of artists, friends and lovers to which he belonged. Lynes felt his most important works were his male nudes, which combine classicizing style and soft pornography; but his portraits of people like Paul Cadmus, Katherine Anne Porter, W. H. Auden and many others remain most compelling today (Johnson).

JACK YOUNGERMAN, "Wood Relief Paintings and Watercolors," Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through tomorrow). The zingy high colors and color contrasts of Mr. Youngerman's wood relief paintings make this one of his most sparkling shows. Occurring for the most part in jagged, asymmetrical shapes that are at times stylized and emblematic, at others biomorphic like flowers, the reliefs are quirkily incised. The surfaces are painted in the same, different or slightly variant colors. In "Claustral," a rough diamond shape with four points, the deep, lustrous green of the inset makes a subtle and pleasing play with the bright blue of the raised surface. The hand of the artist is always refreshingly visible (Glueck).

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
A Detailed Look at Roosevelt, the Intelligence Consumer

BYLINE:  By PHILIP BOBBITT; Philip Bobbitt, a former director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council, holds the Walker Centennial Chair in Law at the University of Texas and is the author of "The Shield of Achilles," forthcoming from Knopf.

 BODY:
ROOSEVELT'S SECRET WAR
F. D. R. and World War II Espionage
By Joseph E. Persico
Random House. 564 pages. $35.
 Can a rather spoiled but handsome paraplegic, deceptive by nature and mistrusted by most of his colleagues, gamely presiding over an intensely isolationist country sunk in the deep trough of an economic depression, manage to defeat the most dynamic economic and military powers of the globe and take his nation to international supremacy? 
 He can if that man is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In "Roosevelt's Secret War," a well-paced and memorable account of Roosevelt's experiences with World War II intelligence operations, Joseph E. Persico takes up the general theme of American global engagement as refracted through the complex moral and psychological temperament of the American president.
Roosevelt's relentless single-mindedness contrasted with the bonhomie of the aristocratic president. Like many wealthy people in international society, Roosevelt was susceptible to the conspiratorial view of life that a few largely hidden, largely interpersonal events lay beneath most headlines.
This partly accounted for his susceptibility to secret missions by the socialite Vincent Astor, the well-connected columnist John Franklin Carter and the Philadelphia Main Line figure George Earle III. What Roosevelt made of their reports one can only guess, but he repeatedly authorized individuals -- ultimately more than 100 -- to report directly to him, outside customary military intelligence channels and often financed from the president's emergency accounts.
Mr. Persico depicts a Roosevelt whose strongest trait as an intelligence consumer was his relentless pursuit of the big picture and his strategic goals. 
The first of these goals was to get the United States into war before it was too late. When we reflect upon Roosevelt's fears of a Nazi nuclear weapon and the ultimate success of the German ballistic missile program, we can appreciate the urgency of the president's efforts. A Gallup poll taken just a month before Pearl Harbor disclosed that only 17 percent of the American public would support a war against Germany. Even after the Japanese attack, it was not only Hitler's timely, if fatal, declaration of war against the United States, but also Roosevelt's having prepared the public for a moral struggle against Nazism that allowed him to turn to the European theater first, despite the slaughter in the Pacific.
Second, Roosevelt was determined to keep the Soviet Union in the wartime alliance. This was not out of any ideological sympathy or political flaccidness on his part, though he was capable of always appearing in sympathy and he rarely opposed anyone head-on. Rather, it reflected Roosevelt's unsentimental awareness of Soviet power in the Eurasian region and his ruthless assessment of the basic duplicity and unreliability of his Soviet ally if Stalin were presented with a German peace proposal. Roosevelt even went so far as to order captured Soviet codes returned to Moscow, to the dismay of American intelligence officials and the perplexity of their Soviet counterparts.
Third, Roosevelt strictly adhered to the war aim of unconditional surrender when the prospect of German peace proposals to the Western allies might have tempted them into a premature armistice. Roosevelt understood, as many since have not, that the war was about the destruction of fascism and that nothing less than the discrediting of fascism in the eyes of the Great Powers where it had taken hold -- Germany and Japan -- could prevent this malignant ideology from flaring up again.
Finally, Roosevelt's persistent pursuit of the earliest possible second front also reflected his deep understanding of the political purposes of the war. Mr. Persico writes that Roosevelt even made British participation in the Manhattan Project depend upon British consent to Overlord, the cross-channel invasion in 1944.
Like the Scarlet Pimpernel whom he so much resembled in the chatty and frivolous mask with which he clothed his secret purposes, the president apparently ran intelligence operations out of his residence. The newly formed Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency, sent him an average of five pieces of raw intelligence a day throughout the war. These were not so-called finished intelligence; that is, they were not assessed for their reliability, nor put into the political, diplomatic and strategic contexts that would indicate their usefulness. There was no analysis to cushion the necessary fallibility that accompanies intelligence collection.
Partly this was offset by Roosevelt's experience with raw intelligence when he was assistant secretary of the Navy during World War I. Partly it was offset by the invaluable Oshima cables, in which the Japanese ambassador to Berlin did provide finished intelligence to Tokyo that was intercepted by the United States. But mainly the approach succeeded because Roosevelt's chief interest was not in the accuracy of the questionable products he received, but in his being able to use that information to achieve political results at home and within the alliance.
There are two kind of secrets: those that someone knows (like the date of the Normandy invasion) and those that no one knows (like whether Germany would collapse after the loss of Italy and France). Roosevelt's matchless political judgment rightly put the higher value on the latter.
Mr. Persico's entertaining and even inspiring book has many points of correspondence with intelligence problems today. Mr. Persico asserts that the publication of the news by The New York Times that Winston Churchill and Roosevelt were linked by a scrambled trans-Atlantic line enabled the Germans to intercept this correspondence and decode it, much as the press's report of Osama bin Laden's reliance on cellphones caused him to stop using them.
The Chicago Tribune published Gen. George C. Marshall's Rainbow Five Plan, which detailed the American force structure needed to fight the war, in repeated efforts to show that Roosevelt wanted war to distract the public from his political failures, not unlike the American news media's attempt to portray the Clinton administration's attack on Afghanistan and the Sudan as a "Wag the Dog" scenario.
Then as now, the United States was in a race to defeat a shrewd and creative enemy of infinite malice before he could acquire a decisive weapons technology. 
Like today, the fragmentation of intelligence sharing -- lucidly discussed in Gregory Treverton's new book, "Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information" -- repeatedly thwarted truly effective United States action. Like today, Congress played an approach/avoidance role, alternately outlawing wiretapping and searching the government for Communists.
Classic questions of the period are addressed, and revisionists are dispatched. Did Roosevelt permit the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to go forward to bring the United States into World War II? Could the United States have done more to rescue Jews or break up concentration camps? Did the president exceed his constitutional authority in his efforts to aid Britain and China before the United States entry into the war? Did American covert action inadvertently provoke the Japanese to attack the United States? Would Roosevelt have used nuclear weapons against Japan? Mr. Persico offers well-reasoned judgments on all these questions and often brings new research to bear.
Through it all, flashing a debonair smile while he placed a fresh Camel cigarette in his ivory cigarette holder, was the purposeful, undeterred president, often in pain but never showing doubt.
In spite of Roosevelt's love of prevarication, his temporizing and his chaotic institutional arrangements, Mr. Persico obviously admires his subject. This entertaining and thoughtful book shows there was much to admire.

HEADLINE: Aging With Boomers, The Accord Turns 25 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS

 BODY:
THE Honda Accord, the car that put the Japanese in the mainstream of the American auto market, is a quarter-century old.
 The first Accord arrived in dealer showrooms in June 1976 as a somewhat sporty but mostly practical hatchback that, while fairly compact, was larger than most Japanese cars of the time. A sedan version came three years later. 
 For the American Honda Motor Company, which had previously offered only subcompacts like the Civic, the Accord was a significant first step toward becoming a major manufacturer with a full line of vehicles. It also gave Honda a major presence in the United States, which remains the company's strongest market.
For the world's auto industry, the Accord represented the Japanese entry into the mainstream car business that Detroit dominated. At the time, Toyota's largest car was the Mark II, now largely forgotten.
For millions of American baby boomers, the Accord mirrored the changes in their own lives. It grew and matured with them as they left college, started careers and raised families. As they moved into middle age and toward retirement, the Accord became ever more comfortable, reassuring and reliable.
Before the Accord, Japanese automobiles were mostly small economy cars, which leaped in popularity after gasoline prices jumped in the early 1970's. Detroit loyalists disparagingly called them "rice burners."
But the Accord struck closer to the heart of the American market, offering more space along with excellent economy. The midsize segment in which it now competes is the single largest part of the market, accounting for annual United States sales of about four million.
Honda sold 75,995 Accords in 1977, the car's first full year on the market, but the line has steadily gained popularity. Honda sold 404,515 here last year, and total Accord sales have topped 7.5 million.
The Accord was the first car from a Japanese company to be an American best seller, surpassing the Ford Taurus in 1989. And although the current Accord has grown dated -- a new version will arrive in a year -- it is likely to regain the sales crown for the 2001 calendar year. It came in first for the '01 model year, which ended on Sept. 30; production of the Toyota Camry, the sales champion of recent years, slipped as that car underwent a thorough redesign.
The Accord has undergone a metamorphosis over the years. The first one, a boxy three-door hatchback, was 162.8 inches long and had a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The sticker price was $3,995.
It has grown substantially, and for 2002 it comes as a coupe and sedan, which are now distinctly different models. The sedan is 189.4 inches long and has a 2.3-liter, 135-horsepower four-cylinder (or a 3-liter, 200 horsepower V-6). Prices range from $16,740 to the upper $20,000 range.
The Accord has had many firsts. It was the first passenger car built in the United States by a Japanese company; Honda began building Accords in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio.
It was also the first gasoline-powered vehicle to meet California's strict SULEV standard (for super-ultra-low-emissions vehicles).
The Accord has served as a platform for other models, including the 3.2TL sedan and 3.2CL coupe from Honda's luxury brand, Acura. Accord components are used in the Odyssey minivan, the Acura MDX sport utility and a Honda sport utility yet to come.

HEADLINE: Russia Becoming an Oil Ally 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE with BIRGIT BRAUER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
With the developed world nervously eyeing the security of oil supplies in the Middle East, Russia is stepping forward as a new friend in need. Alongside its support for the United States' military campaign in Afghanistan, Russia is offering its oil fields as a secure alternative to dependence on the turbulent Persian Gulf.
 Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union together produce about one-tenth of the world's oil and one-third of its natural gas. Russia's oil industry is booming, with exports up by 9 percent so far this year. Next week, production will begin at a northern gas field with reserves equal to two-thirds of all those in the rest of Europe. 
 Neighboring Kazakhstan is developing huge new fields and expects to more than double its output by 2010. Last month, speaking to businessmen in Germany, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, offered to step up oil deliveries if supplies came under threat.
"Non-Middle East oil will be seen as being more desirable than ever," said Stephen O'Sullivan, head of research at the United Financial Group, a Moscow investment bank. 
Most analysts say Russia is not now able to export enough oil to completely replace Middle Eastern sources in the event of a major disruption, in large part because of limited pipeline capacity. But construction of new pipelines is expected to gain greater urgency now.
Crucially, in the Caspian basin, where Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and other states are developing immense reserves, a decade-long rivalry for influence between the United States and Russia could now turn into something more like cooperation. Instead of squabbling over the routes exports would take, the two sides now share a common interest in ramping up total pipeline capacity, the main constraint on growth in recent years.
The opening of a new pipeline from the Tengiz field in western Kazakhstan to a Russian port on the Black Sea is a major milestone for the region, where international oil companies like ChevronTexaco and British Petroleum have spent billions of dollars since the fall of the Soviet Union to explore and develop energy resources.
Throughout the 1990's, Russia and the United States backed competing pipeline routes out of the Caspian basin, a region that the United States Department of Energy estimates holds 110 billion barrels of oil -- about triple the United States' own reserves. For political reasons, the main American objective was to build export routes that avoided crossing either Russian or Iranian territory -- to the irritation of Moscow, which sees the region as within its sphere of influence and pipelines as powerful levers for political control. 
Russia prevailed in 1999, when an international consortium of oil companies led by Chevron began building the $2.6 billion pipeline to Novorossiysk, which made its first commercial delivery of crude oil on Sunday. On top of the billions of dollars in royalties Russia expects to earn over its 40-year life, the pipeline maintains Moscow's direct control over oil flows from the region.
Analysts said that Russia's new alliance with the United States in the coalition against terrorism has accelerated the shift away from antagonism over the vast oil resources of the former Soviet Union.
"The trend was already towards a depoliticization of Caspian energy, and this definitely advances that," said Laurent Ruseckas of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consultancy in London. "This whole idea of the U.S. and Russia fighting over Caspian oil seems completely outdated. The West would like to see Russian and Caspian oil on stream as quickly as possible."
For its part, now that the Novorossiysk pipeline is open, the Russian government says it no longer objects to construction of a a second pipeline on the Azerbaijan-to-Turkey route that the United States has favored.
"We will not hamper this project," said Russia's energy minister, Igor Yusufov, in an interview, adding that Russia believes it can hold its own in attracting foreign energy investment even if the second line is built. "Our close connections will allow us to bring to fruition more valuable long-term projects," he said. 
Western diplomats doubt that Russia will give up trying to influence and profit from development of oil fields in the former Soviet republics to its south. Mr. Putin's decision to ally himself with the West in the war against terrorism may come at the cost of ceding some of Russia's historical political dominance in Central Asia. The diplomats said it was unlikely that he would surrender what he considers Russia's share of Caspian oil riches.
"The interesting geopolitical issue is whether the Russians will climb down from a zero-sum, even hostile, view of American commercial, political and military relations in the region," said Stephen Sestanovich, a former special adviser to the United States Secretary of State on matters concerning the former Soviet Union. "We are seeing some indications from Mr. Putin that he is telling his government to back off that kind of approach. Will he apply that less competitive outlook to energy issues as well? We'll have to see."
Russia is also extending its energy reach to other lucrative markets. It is pushing ahead with a planned new natural gas pipeline under the Black Sea to Turkey that would increase Turkey's dependence on Russian gas to 80 percent of its needs, from about two-thirds now.
Russia is even making progress with a proposal to build a pipeline to carry Russian crude to eastern China. Though China is busily developing its domestic energy resources, economic growth has been far outrunning its efforts to step up production, and China has been a net oil importer since 1993.
Energy exports have become the lifeblood of Russia's economy, accounting for half its export earnings and one-third of the federal government's budget revenue. A sharp drop in oil prices could wreck its budget and complicate the repayment of the billions of dollars in foreign debt that fall due in the next two years.
Still, Russia's eagerness as a supplier has often put it at cross-purposes with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which even before Sept. 11 was straining to prop up world oil prices by restricting supply. Russia's steadily rising production undercuts those efforts, and though the country pledges to cooperate with OPEC, oil executives here say they have no plans to cut back.
Russian oil companies, flush with cash from several years of high prices, have been spending heavily on new equipment and technology to increase production. But foreign oil companies with interests here, like BP and Exxon Mobil, have had a harder time, with new production set back by legal and tax difficulties.

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The German government acknowledged today that economic growth had stagnated, and it predicted that the economy would expand by just 0.75 percent this year and show meager growth in 2002.
 The downward revision matches forecasts that had already been made by many banks. But it means that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is perilously close to a recession, and it puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to follow the lead of the Federal Reserve and cut interest rates. 
 The new forecast was made by Hans Eichel, the finance minister. On Wednesday night, the chief economist of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, made a similarly bleak forecast and warned that the budget deficits would rise sharply next year.
"There is much evidence that one will have to expect a longer problem zone," said the economist, Herman Remsperger. "That means not only that an economic turnaround is unlikely this year, but that the situation will only gradually return to normal next year."
Germany, heavily dependent on exports of big industrial products and sensitive to the downturn in the United States, is likely to remain one of the slowest-growing countries in Europe this year and next. Its problems affect much of the rest of the Continent, and all European countries have been hit much harder than they expected by problems in the United States.
Unemployment is once again edging up across Europe, as scores of companies announce plans to eliminate jobs. The list of German companies shedding workers includes Siemens, the electronics conglomerate; Infineon, the semiconductor producer; Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors; and all of the major banks.
But the same pattern is shaping up elsewhere in Europe, from Philips Electronics in the Netherlands to Ericsson in Sweden.
In contrast with the United States, most European governments have been cautious about trying to stimulate growth by enacting deep tax cuts or stepping up spending.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany has repeatedly rebuffed pleas for special programs to shore up particular industries. French leaders are toying with a modest package of tax reductions, some of them temporary, but economists say they are too small to have much impact.
The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for all 12 countries that have adopted the euro, continues to resist reducing interest rates.
The economic slowdown is also taking a toll on government budgets. Here in Germany, the Bundesbank predicted that the budget deficit would double from 1 percent of gross domestic product to 2 percent.
European leaders have already given up hope that countries will continue to reduce their budget deficits this year. But fear of higher deficits has been the main reason that governments have not tried to stimulate growth with big new tax cuts or spending projects.

HEADLINE: MasterCard And Visa Lose a Ruling On a Lawsuit 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
A federal court has rejected an appeal to stop an antitrust lawsuit against Visa USA and MasterCard International from including four million retailers. It was the latest blow to the leading credit card networks.
 In a 2-to-1 decision issued late Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan rejected an appeal from Visa and MasterCard to stop retailers from receiving class certification in a 1996 suit that accuses them of using their dominance in credit cards to force merchants to accept their debit cards. 
 The suit, led by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., seeks $8 billion in damages, a figure that would be tripled to about $24 billion under federal antitrust law if the retailers win.
Earlier this month, Visa and MasterCard suffered a setback in a separate antitrust case when a federal judge ordered the networks to end a policy that blocked member banks from issuing cards from rivals like American Express.
Visa and MasterCard are owned by major banks and together control more than 75 percent of credit card sales.
"The merchants have won the appeal, and Visa and MasterCard have lost the appeal, as we expected," the plaintiffs' lawyer, Lloyd Constantine, said yesterday. "We are gratified and are now going to trial." A trial date has not been set.
Wal-Mart and other retailers object to having to accept Visa and MasterCard debit cards because they say these cards carry higher transaction fees. Visa has argued retailers must honor all its cards.
Visa, encouraged by a long dissenting opinion from a senior appeals judge on the case, said it would press for a rehearing before the court and, if needed, consider a petition to the Supreme Court.
Visa and MasterCard have argued that the retailer class would be too large to be manageable and that retailers used flawed economic theories in presenting their case.
Retailers contend that without class certification, millions of merchants would be deprived of compensation for damages.

HEADLINE: City Known for Military Jets Is Beyond Them 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: PALMDALE, Calif., Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Few towns have been more closely identified with the military's mastery of the skies than this high desert outpost of sand, Joshua trees and the most advanced aircraft in the world. 
 Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier on the legendary testing grounds at Edwards Air Force Base here, and the area's military contractors have built everything from U-2 spy planes to fleets of F-117 stealth fighters and B-2 bombers. 
 But as many of those jets now pound Afghanistan, few people here expect to see much if any impact in the new Palmdale, beyond anxious moments and the waving of flags. The prospect of big new contracts to shore up a military at war, which was often the case in the past, barely causes a stir now because what was once a one-company town -- the company being the military establishment -- has developed into a small city with a booming, highly diversified economy. 
After a devastating recession following the cold war, when the Pentagon reduced its weapons orders, Palmdale has remade itself. The military industries have become just one of many important sources for jobs and identity.
Palmdale is merely a more conspicuous example of a deep transformation affecting scores of cities around the country, one of the main reasons that the economic impact of this new kind of battle will be far different from that of past wars.
If the emblems of the old Palmdale were the huge production hangars, now they are huge box retailers, like Home Depot and Kmart. Its economic pulse is most evident not at the fenced-off runways where residents still come to watch awesome jets roar into the desert skies, but on the freeway, where tens of thousands of commuters jam the lanes each weekday morning for the 65-mile trip to civilian jobs in Los Angeles.
A similar tale is told in other cities in Los Angeles County. Indeed, in the county as a whole, the aerospace industry accounts for less than 3 percent of total jobs today, compared with nearly 8 percent in 1986.
Palmdale, however, has not just changed. It has boomed in an entirely new direction. Twenty years ago, it had a population of 12,277, a great many of those people employed by Boeing, Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin -- or at Edwards.
Today, the city has 122,400 residents, many of them young, middle-class families who could not afford $300,000 or more for starter houses in the Los Angeles area. The desert scrub has been replaced with grassy quarter-acre plots with houses at half the cost. The city is now far younger than the rest of the county, and its median household income, about $65,000, is higher. And the Antelope Valley, as the area around the city is known, sends about 57,600 people a day to work in Los Angeles.
Anthony G. Nakonechnyj, a director of photography in the movie industry, is typical. Since moving here seven years ago, Mr. Nakonechnyj said, his daily commute to Los Angeles has gone from a one-hour jaunt to a two-hour endurance contest. But it has been worth it, he said, because he was able to move his family from a rented house with no yard on a busy street in the city to a comfortable home on a one-acre lot with a swimming pool -- at half the price.
"You get to see the stealth bombers flying occasionally, which is really pretty cool, but that's about all you see of the military here," Mr. Nakonechnyj said. "It's a typical bedroom suburb, and we like that."
David J. Myers, president of the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance, a business promotion group, said that the sentimental ties to the military remained strong and that the military facilities, while smaller, were still big employers. But the major events that point to the future are the openings of new industrial plants or large retailers.
Mr. Myers described the recent groundbreaking for a plant for U.S. Pole, a manufacturer of commercial lighting, as a more apt emblem of the city than the heavily guarded hangar nearby where the F-117 stealth fighters were produced. In addition, a number of other manufacturers have taken advantage of the low costs here, and there is a huge mall.
"It surprises a lot of people when they come out here and see how we've changed," Mr. Myers said. "There was a time when we had more congressmen in the valley than supermarkets. But it's just a different world now."
Jackie Snider, the head of the local chamber of commerce, said that when the Pentagon began cutting its procurement budgets more than a decade ago, "this city was in a world of hurt," adding, "It was awful."
But the sprawling growth of Los Angeles and the demand for less expensive housing saved Palmdale, Ms. Snider said. Though residents often complain about traffic jams, she said, they do not complain about being able to shop here rather than having to travel 50 miles for quality produce, as in the past.
Larry Chimbole, a former mayor who has lived in Palmdale for more than 40 years, said the waves of military cuts "almost destroyed the community."
"I mean it was devastating," Mr. Chimbole said.
He said that in the old days, few people even considered commuting across what was known as the cactus curtain between the desert and Los Angeles, for logistical and cultural reasons. The people of the desert had disdain for those in the big city, Mr. Chimbole said.
But the cultural divide has been all but bridged, he added, and the old attitudes evaporated once it was clear what benefits suburbanization would bring.
Boeing, which acquired the plant here where the B-1 bombers were built several decades ago, now has a skeleton staff of about 290 people in Palmdale. "It's just odds-and-ends work, and some work on the space shuttle," said George Sillia, a Boeing spokesman.
Northrup Grumman, which built the bat-winged $2 billion B-2 bombers here, now has about 1,200 local employees compared with 4,500 a decade ago. 
And Lockheed Martin, which built U-2's and the F-117 stealth fighters, has shrunk to about 3,750 employees from 18,000.
"Sure, if you heard there were more B-2's that were going to be built here, people would be pleased," Mr. Myers said. "But we're not going to sink if that doesn't happen by any means. We've just moved on."

HEADLINE: Berlin Journal; 
Picking a Gay Mayor, Maybe, Over an Ex-Marxist

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Berlin likes to fancy itself a city without taboos, but it may be about to break two longstanding ones, political and sexual.
 In Sunday's elections for a new government of this capital redux, Berlin's voters are likely to elect an openly gay mayor, Klaus Wowereit, a Social Democrat. More striking yet, perhaps, they could allow the successor to the East German Communist Party a share of power in a city that same party divided when it ordered the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. 
 Unsurprisingly, in a city formed by superpower clashes beyond its borders, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America and the subsequent bombing of Afghanistan are adding another twist to Sunday's outcome. 
If the results reflect the polls, the often bland Mr. Wowereit and the charismatic leader of the former Communists, Gregor Gysi, will finish first and second. But Mr. Gysi's party is the only one that has starkly opposed the American bombing of Afghanistan. That opposition to the war, which the Social Democratic Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, supports so strongly, makes it next to impossible for him to back a coalition between the two parties in the nation's capital.
Resisting the partnership, however, may be difficult because of the extent of Mr. Gysi's support. It would also rob Berlin of a chance to unite a city whose western and eastern halves are still sharply divided in spirit, even 12 years after the infamous wall came down.
Mr. Gysi campaigns, without apparent irony, on his party's ability to bring Berlin together by empowering those in the east, 40 percent of whom support his party.
His antiwar stance should enhance the appeal of his Party of Democratic Socialism to younger voters in the west. Indeed, the 53-year-old Mr. Gysi is a more compelling and complicated character than Mr. Wowereit: witty, eloquent, ironic, a trained lawyer and national legislator who has lived down a file showing some collaboration (on behalf of his clients, he says) with the Communists' old Stasi secret police.
Mr. Wowereit -- a 48-year-old lawyer thrown into office as a transitional mayor in June -- had one distinction, however. Just before a Springer newspaper, the tabloid BZ, "outed" him as gay, Mr. Wowereit said so openly, and became a national celebrity a week before becoming mayor. He was appointed in a temporary capacity after the collapse of the previous administration in a finance scandal.
In a phrase that has become so famous that someone else has copyrighted it, Mr. Wowereit said: "I'm gay, and it's good that way."
Now, "und das ist gut so" has become the tag line for advertisements and is even used for the party's election Web site (www.spd-und-das-ist-gut-so.de).
Mr. Wowereit's election is acknowledged even by Mr. Gysi as a breakthrough for sexual freedom and tolerance. Dirk Bachhausen, the deputy leader of the Social Democrats' gay and lesbian group, said that Mr. Wowereit's success has been "to show that he is a normal person and citizen, and being gay is simply a part of himself."
The mayoral candidate for the Christian Democrats, Frank Steffel, 35, has by contrast suggested that Mr. Wowereit has "a deformed character." The conservative, widely acknowledged as a disaster, has campaigned ostentatiously with his wife, talks of Munich as Germany's "secret capital" and acknowledges that he used racial slurs about blacks and Turks when he was a teenager.
Berlin is a pauper after years of spending money like water on maintaining its superficially united dualities: three opera houses, three airports, two zoos, two television towers and scores of museums.
The city is $35 billion in debt, with the slowest economic growth of any of Germany's 16 states and an unemployment rate of some 16 percent, compared with a national average of 9 percent.
Mr. Wowereit campaigns on getting the city moving again, as if his party had not been a part of the coalition with the Christian Democrats that fell apart in June and was responsible for much of the lavish spending.
The mayor has been spare on specifics on how to salvage Berlin, and it is hard to point to many accomplishments in his four months of rule. Still, reflecting his own and Mr. Schroder's popularity, the Social Democrats are expected to do well.
While the election may clear a sexual hurdle, the ghosts lurking from the Communist past could prove harder to conquer. Mr. Gysi acknowledges, a touch wearily, that his party has "done the basic reforms, but there's more to be done." 
It was a struggle to get the party to condemn the building of the Berlin Wall, and Mr. Gysi failed to get his party to apologize for it. Now, he is trying to push the party itself over the vanished wall and gain a larger constituency in the west.
"This election is a chance to make the party more popular in the rest of the country," he said. "We want to make clear that we don't stand for walls, but for bridges."
It is a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, the party is popular with easterners for representing their values and current grievances about jobs, lower pay and lower status. But the party is also trying to appeal to the left wing in the west, particularly as the Social Democrats, in power under Mr. Schroder, have moved further to the center.
Beyond the policies, Mr. Gysi's wit comes through, appealing to the young and the disaffected in east and west alike. He likes to say, given Berlin's corruption and near bankruptcy -- "Vote for the P.D.S. -- it can't be worse with us."
A campaign poster shows an old black-and-white photo of infants crawling around, mostly without pants, in the bathroom of East Germany's once ubiquitous state-funded kindergarten. The caption reads: "Not everything was awful, and mommy could go to work every day."

HEADLINE: Profit Increases 2% at Reynolds 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company reported a 2 percent increase in third-quarter profit today but warned that lower interest rates on investments would cut into its full-year results.
 The company reported net income of $119 million, or $1.22 a share, up from $117 million, or $1.16 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Excluding a 9-cent-a-share charge to reflect a reduction in the gain on the sale of Reynolds International, the company earned $128 million, or $1.31 a share.
Analysts expected earnings of $1.29 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Revenue for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, rose 9 percent, to $2.27 billion from $2.08 billion.
Shares of Reynolds fell $3.45, or 6 percent, to $56.68, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Martin Feldman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the company's profit was based on fewer outstanding shares and increased interest earnings, not cigarette sales.
"The whole tobacco operation essentially achieved flat earnings," Mr. Feldman said. "The bottom line is that earnings grew largely as a result of a shrinking number of shares outstanding and growing interest income."
In the third quarter, the company sold 23.5 billion cigarettes, down from 24.7 billion a year earlier. The company said shipments of its three full-price brands had fallen 5.8 percent over all. The Camel and Winston brands had increased sales, while Salem was flat.
Higher selling prices cut the volume of sales, Reynolds said. The company said its share of the retail market for the three-month period was nearly unchanged from the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Bill to Alter Bankruptcy Seems to Stall 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
A bill that would have made it more difficult for consumers to dismiss their debts by filing for bankruptcy has effectively been pushed aside in Congress, unlikely to re-emerge this year, lawyers and analysts say.
 The Senate and House passed versions of the legislation in March, and a conference was scheduled for this fall to reconcile the differences. But with consumer confidence considerably weaker since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, lawmakers' enthusiasm for the legislation may have dimmed. 
 "This bankruptcy legislation is more protective of the lenders than the consumer," said Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Wachovia Securities who follows credit card companies. "Given that so much of the economy hinges on the consumer, no one in Washington wants to be perceived as anticonsumer."
Bankruptcy filings have been on the rise this year as consumers and corporations have found it hard to pay their bills. The number of consumers filing for bankruptcy has also risen in anticipation of passage of the bankruptcy bill, which would make it more difficult for individuals to file under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
Chapter 7 permits consumers and businesses to shed most of their unsecured debts. Under the bill, more individuals would be forced to file under Chapter 13, which requires debtors to come up with a plan to pay off at least a portion of their debts, usually over three to five years.
With little talk about reviving the legislation, Visa International told its network of bank credit card issuers earlier this week that it was lowering its projections for bankruptcy filings by individuals this year to an increase of 21.1 percent from a previous estimate of a 23 percent increase, Ms. Whitney said. A spokeswoman for Visa declined to confirm the projections, saying the numbers were confidential. Ms. Whitney said she had access to the data because Wachovia is a credit card issuer.
Congressional staff members said the legislation had not officially been tabled, but there were no signs it was a priority, either. A conference to reconcile the two versions of the bill was scheduled for the day after the terrorist attacks, but it was canceled, said Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee.
Bankruptcy lawyers said the weakness in the economy meant that more consumers would remain in dire straits in the near future.
"The economy was bad before Sept. 11, but things have really deteriorated since," said Max Gardner III, a bankruptcy lawyer in Shelby, N.C. "I have never before seen the sense of personal desperation and fear that I've seen. Filing for bankruptcy provides some certainty in a sea of uncertainty."

HEADLINE: Claims Filed By Jobless Remain Near 9-Year High 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits approached a nine-year high last week as the Sept. 11 attacks compounded the economic damage from a factory slump, government figures showed today.
 First-time jobless claims increased by 6,000 in the week ended Saturday, to 490,000, the Labor Department reported. 
 Initial applications had soared in the last week of September, to 535,000. Both weeks are the highest since a strike at General Motors in July 1992.
Economists had expected jobless claims to rise last week to 480,000 from the previous week's initially reported 468,000.
Workers are staying unemployed longer, the report showed. The number of people continuing to draw unemployment benefits jumped in the week ended Oct. 6, to 3.65 million. That is the most since 3.70 million in May 1983, when the United States was climbing out of an earlier recession.
Statistics on continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to new claims.
With manufacturers like United Technologies and service providers like Unisys announcing job cuts this week, analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise.
The unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.9 percent in August and September. Analysts say it may reach as high as 6.5 percent in 2002. It was last that high in March 1994.
"The job picture is getting worse," said Geoffrey Somes, an economist at Fleet Bank in Boston. "Joblessness will continue to increase over the next few months."
The economy lost 199,000 jobs last month, the biggest decline in more than 10 years, the Labor Department reported two weeks ago. Those numbers are based on surveys that do not reflect the job cuts after Sept. 11. Industrial production fell for a 12th consecutive month in September, suggesting factories were still a drag on the economy.

Sharply Lower Sales Propel Losses at Nortel Networks and Corning

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Nortel Networks, the big producer of telecommunications equipment, and Corning Inc., the largest maker of optical fiber used in telecommunications networks, posted third-quarter losses yesterday on falling sales.
 The loss at Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, widened to $3.47 billion, or $1.08 a share, from a loss of $586 million, or 20 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales slid to $3.69 billion from $6.73 billion. 
 Excluding special charges, the loss was $854 million, or 27 cents a share. On that basis, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected the company to lose 28 cents a share.
Phone companies have bought less networking equipment this year amid a global slowdown in economic growth, and Nortel and many rival suppliers are not expecting demand to improve for at least a year. Nortel, which is eliminating more than half its work force to cut costs and selling businesses to raise cash, says it can break even in 2002 with quarterly sales figures of less than $4 billion.
Michael Cohen, who manages the Alpha Analytics Digital Future Fund, said, "The current spending environment looks quite bleak." Phone companies, he said before the results were released, "are waiting for demand to catch up with the capacity they already have online."
Nortel reported its quarterly figures after the end of trading. The shares closed in New York at $5.92, down 3 cents. After hours, they sold at $5.90. The company declined to forecast this quarter's results, or next year's, citing the uncertain effects of the attacks on Sept. 11.
Corning lost $220 million, or 24 cents a share, in contrast with net income of $254 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 21 percent, to $1.51 billion from $1.92 billion. Excluding costs related to job cuts and acquisitions, the company said it would have reported a profit of $85 million, or 9 cents a share. On that basis, which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Corning had been expected by First Call's analysts to earn 3 cents a share.
The company is eliminating as many as 12,000 jobs, or 28 percent of the work force at the beginning of the year, and is closing plants in response to the falling sales.
Before Corning announced its results, its shares closed at $8.02, down 14 cents. In after-hours trading, they settled at $8.30.
Corning said it expected fourth-quarter sales around $1 billion and a loss, excluding certain costs, in the range of 20 to 25 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 6 cents a share, excluding certain costs.

HEADLINE: New York City Jobless Rate Jumps to 6.3% 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
The effects of the World Trade Center disaster are only beginning to show up in economic statistics, but already the unemployment rate in New York City has surged, the New York State Department of Labor announced yesterday.
 In September, the jobless rate leapt to 6.3 percent from 5.8 percent in August, and 5.0 percent in July, all adjusted for seasonal factors. "It's a large jump, not typical at all," said James P. Brown, an analyst for the labor department, adding that the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since October 1999. 
 The surge of unemployment in the city is far worse than the state's increase of 0.2 points, to 4.9 percent. The nation's unemployment rate in September, also 4.9 percent, was unchanged. 
The increase in the unemployment rate, based on statistics collected at a regularly scheduled monthly point, which occurred the week of the attack, reflects the sudden slowdown in the city's economy even before Sept. 11. 
The rate is based on a monthly survey of households, and everyone who worked at all that week is considered employed -- even if those jobs disappeared with the twin towers. 
The rate is almost certain to rise; since Sept. 11, 21,930 people have requested jobless benefits as a direct result of the trade center disaster, the labor department said.
Between the terrorist attack and the already crumbling economy, "it's clear we face a long road back to economic renewal," said Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki.
A monthly survey of employers' payrolls also took place the week of Sept. 10 through Sept. 14, and so is probably not an accurate picture of the post-disaster economy. Many employers prepared their data before the attack, and even those who had previously announced layoffs may continue to count laid off workers in their payroll until their unemployment benefits expire, according to the office of Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller.
Companies reduced their employment by only 300 positions in September, said the comptroller's office, which adjusts state data for seasonal factors. But the job losses in August were revised upward, to 10,400, from a preliminary figure of 8,200.
The biggest losses in September were in business services, which shed 4,000 jobs, for a cumulative loss of 25,000 positions since April. This sector of the economy includes computer services, advertising, and temporary agencies. Some of those losses were offset by gains in areas like construction and utilities, the comptroller's office said.
The picture on Wall Street was mixed. Securities firms, which had cut 7,200 jobs from May to August, actually added more than 2,000 positions in September, after the comptroller's adjustments. But on an unadjusted basis, which economists prefer for looking at extended time periods, employment in the securities business is now as low as it has been since May 2000.
For New York State, employment fell by 18,200, or 0.3 percent. The northern part of the state has been hard hit by problems at paper plants, while Rochester has been battered by the continued financial decline of major employers like Kodak and Xerox.

HEADLINE: A Company Rethinks Its Mooring In the City 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Too many Ted Kauffmans would add up to one big headache for New York City's municipal and business leaders.
 Mr. Kauffman is the co-owner of a package delivery company that does business throughout the Northeast, and before Sept. 11 there had been no question in his mind that the company would always have an office in Manhattan, as it has for its entire 18 years. After all, about 25 percent of the company's business was in the New York region, and Manhattan is the region's commercial heart. 
 But now Mr. Kauffman is questioning the need for a Manhattan office. He wonders whether its dispatch, sales and customer service operations can be run just as well from outside the city, say, New Jersey.
Until the World Trade Center attack, the New York office of the company, Eastern Connection, was at 11 Park Place, a 20-story office building three blocks from the trade center. But the office, with 25 employees, was among the thousands of businesses displaced from Lower Manhattan. 
On Tuesday, five weeks after the attack, Eastern Connection began moving back to Park Place from its temporary quarters at a company warehouse in Carlstadt, N.J., and at the main office in Woburn, Mass. It followed many businesses that had returned home as buildings in the area were repaired and cleaned, and phone and data services restored. 
Mr. Kauffman said he was happy about returning. But he also said he had begun wondering whether the return should be permanent. 
"We see we were able to function outside Manhattan," he said. "We have to take a long hard look at whether this office needs to be in Manhattan." 
Mr. Kauffman said he was even considering leaving the city or state entirely to save money. Yet there are also strong reasons not to make such a move, he said, not the least of which is his love for the city. 
Since Sept. 11, the public focus on reviving Lower Manhattan has largely involved seeking the return of the large corporations forced from the area. While the city comptroller's office has tracked the relocations of such corporations, it lacks the resources for a similar effort involving small businesses, a spokesman, David Neustadt, said recently. 
So the city has no estimate of the number of displaced small businesses that intend to return to the area, Mr. Neustadt said, or of those considering leaving the city. 
Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the local business improvement district, said he thought that some businesses were considering such a move. But "I think the vast majority will stay," he added.
Richard Feldman, a senior managing director with Williamson, Picket, Gross, a realty firm based in Lower Manhattan, said, "I suppose there are some people who might leave," but most would not or could not. "People have leases," he said, and have an obligation to continue them if their buildings are habitable.
Mr. Kauffman said he had two and a half years to go on his lease at 11 Park Place, but did not necessarily see that as an obstacle. "Maybe we can sublet," he said, adding that the destruction of so much office space in Lower Manhattan would probably make 11 Park Place easy to sublet. 
Mr. Kauffman's company conducts its dispatching, sales and customer service operations by phone, fax and e-mail, so after Sept. 11 he sent employees from Park Place to Carlstadt and Woburn and added communications lines at those sites. Dispatchers there did what they would have done at Park Place: called the van driver or foot messenger already making pickups or deliveries in the vicinity to fetch the latest New York City package.
If the Park Place office were relocated permanently, Mr. Kauffman said, the vans and drivers in the city would still be based at a company warehouse on West 30th Street. 
Finding cheaper rent, he said, is one reason he is considering moving the office. He now pays $9,000 a month for the Park Place office, and said cost-cutting was important because the company was struggling to recover from a sharp plunge in business. Mr. Kauffman estimated that a quarter of the company's New York City business had come from the trade center and its vicinity. In September, total company revenue was off about 15 percent from the previous September, Mr. Kauffman said.
He said he did not believe that fears of anthrax would further affect business, because his company delivers packages from clients it knows.
One argument for keeping the office in Manhattan is the quality of his work force, he said. "I have great workers," he said, and most would be unable to commute outside the city.
If he decided to relocate the Park Place operation to Carlstadt or elsewhere in New Jersey, up to 25 workers would lose jobs that paid an average of $35,000 to $40,000 a year in a city where a slowing economy and the trade center destruction have wiped out thousands of jobs.
If Mr. Kauffman goes, and if more businesspeople like him go, the blow to the economy could be severe. Eastern Connection's employees pay a total of about $70,000 in state and city income taxes annually, estimated Andrew Watkins, a Manhattan accountant. He also said that if Mr. Kauffman moved the office out of the city, the city could lose taxes on profits from the company's New York business, which Mr. Kauffman indicated had been grossing about $7 million a year. 
"I hope this company decides to stay," Mr. Weisbrod said.

HEADLINE: Behind Las Vegas's Glitter, Heavy Losses and Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Although the Bellagio's brilliantly lighted fountains still dance magically each night and the gondoliers at the Venetian still serenade tourists with arias, this city's tourism machine has sputtered badly since Sept. 11.
 Business has fallen so sharply that the casino hotels have laid off enough housekeepers, waiters, bellhops, receptionists and croupiers to populate a good-size town, 15,000 in all. 
 The steep drop in visitors and the spike in unemployment have many people here questioning whether boom times in Las Vegas -- for the last decade the nation's fastest growing city -- are a thing of the past. What is clear is that this city of showgirls, neon and carefree risk, this epicenter of entertainment, has had the wind knocked out of it. 
The hotel layoffs here, industry experts say, are the largest in the nation although in New York, San Francisco and Washington, hotels have also experienced huge losses in business, with many laying off one-fourth of their staff or more.
On the famed Strip here, the pain is largely invisible. The roulette wheels still whir, the out-of-towners still feed the slots and the $7.49 all-you-can-eat buffet lunches are still served. But each morning, several hundred yards from the Strip, under a giant tent that sprouted two weeks ago, there is a huge and highly visible outpouring of suffering.
Starting around 7 a.m., hundreds of jobless people mass around the tent to seek help from government agencies and the United Way. They are desperate to avoid evictions, to avoid having their cars repossessed and their lights shut off.
"It's very depressing what's happening," said Nolberto Dela Pena, a laid-off casino janitor. "Sometimes we lose faith."
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Dela Pena and his wife, Anicia, were milling around the tent, seeking help because their landlord planned to evict them that afternoon. Mr. Dela Pena, an immigrant from the Philippines, said he was still not receiving the $248 weekly unemployment insurance check promised him, adding that he doubted he could support his family on such a modest amount. With his slumbering 11-month-old son slumped over his right shoulder, he said he had no idea where his family would live, if evicted.
At the tent Mr. Dela Pena was told that the United Way had no money left for rent assistance; it had already given away $500,000 to 790 others facing eviction. After hearing the Dela Penas' plight, the County Department of Social Services agreed to come up with $759 to cover the October rent and the late fee.
"I've been around a long time, but I've never seen anything like this," said Garth Winckler, president of the United Way of Southern Nevada. "The reality out here is a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck. We're not used to rainy days because the economy just kept booming along. People thought it could never happen to us."
In the two weeks after Sept. 11, so many unemployed people were running around Las Vegas to so many government offices seeking aid that the hotel workers' union proposed setting up a tent in the union's parking lot so that workers could visit a dozen agencies at once. County officials provided the tent, which now means one-stop shopping for the newly needy.
D. Taylor, the union's staff director, said the social safety net was inadequate to handle such an explosion of need. Unemployment insurance, he said, is too meager for people to pay $500 to $700 a month to continue their health insurance. 
Estimating that half the 15,000 laid-off workers are immigrants, Mr. Taylor criticized the 1996 federal welfare law for barring most legal immigrants from receiving food stamps. "We have a situation where a lot of unemployed immigrants cannot get food stamps even though they have worked hard, paid taxes and done everything legally." 
In the days immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, with flights canceled and Americans terrified, the occupancy rate at many hotels here plunged by 30 percent or more, and many companies canceled conferences. Occupancy has since crept up, approaching its normal October rate for weekends of 98 percent, but it is still well below the normal midweek level of 90 percent midweek. To lure back tourists, many hotels have chopped their room rates in half.
"You get this double whammy of lower occupancy and lower room rates," said Alan Feldman, a senior vice president at MGM Mirage, which runs six casino hotels here. "Business levels fell across the board in every category: entertainment, hotel, retail, food and beverage and, let's not forget, gambling. Occupancy has rebounded somewhat, but much of the rest has not."
Last month, MGM Mirage laid off 6,000 of its 37,000 employees here. In recent days, it has called back more than 1,000 for mostly part-time work.
While waiting inside the tent, also desperate for rent assistance, Sherry Unson said she would be delighted if her former employer offered her even part-time work. Ms. Unson, mother of a 4-year-old and 8-month-old, was laid off after working for six years as a restaurant cashier at the Golden Nugget. And her boyfriend has lost his job as a limousine driver. 
"It's hard having to pay rent, pay for the car, buy milk," Ms. Unson said. "I worry, really worry, about the kids and whether we'll be able to keep a roof over our head."
Sounding more optimistic than many of the unemployed, the city's visitors and convention authority predicted a rebound. Hal Rothman, a history professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, agreed. 
"The thing to remember is that leisure and entertainment suffer less in bad economic times than other industries," said Mr. Rothman. "You know all the people who pay their cable bill before they pay their water bill. We live in a self-indulgent culture in which people think of leisure as a right not a privilege. So people will continue to come."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: EDUCATION; 
Anti-Western and Extremist Views Pervade Saudi Schools

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: RIYADH, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The textbook for one of the five religion classes required of all 10th graders in Saudi public high schools tackles the complicated issue of who good Muslims should befriend.
 After examining a number of scriptures which warn of the dangers of having Christian and Jewish friends, the lesson concludes: "It is compulsory for the Muslims to be loyal to each other and to consider the infidels their enemy." 
 That extremist, anti-Western world view has gradually pervaded the Saudi education system with its heavy doses of mandatory religious instruction, according to Saudi officials and intellectuals. It has seeped outside the classroom through mosque sermons, television shows and the Internet, coming to dominate the public discussions on religion.
Tireless efforts to spread a fundamentalist view of Islam through Saudi-financed charities have taken the message well beyond the borders of the kingdom to places including Afghanistan. 
"If you review the curriculum in Saudi Arabia, you would see that it promotes any kind of extremist views of Islam, even in the eyes of very devout Muslims," said Abdul Khadir Tash, the editor of Al Bilad newspaper. 
This extremism, born of the local, puritanical Wahabi brand of Islam, constrains life here, shaping the way people live and the way Saudi Arabia greets the world. The United States seeks to build a coalition against terror with the kingdom, long a Western business and military ally, and yet the country has revealed itself as the source of the very ideology confronting America in the battle against terrorism. 
These anti-Western views aid Osama bin Laden or other extremists in finding recruits, some Saudis believe, because they can mold the imperfectly formed religious creed of young, easily influenced men, convincing them that their faith condones violence against non-Muslims. Even Saudi Arabia's famous oil wealth -- Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, earned $80 billion last year -- has been no insurance against economic and political unrest.
As a result, many fear that the pool of potential recruits is swelling as tens of thousands of young Saudis emerge with an education that leaves them unqualified for work -- an estimated 50,000 per year cannot find jobs. With half the 14 million native population under age 25, some estimates say unemployment among the youngest job seekers is as high as 30 percent. 
"They exploit some of the half-educated people and uneducated people and they give them the illusion that this is the real Islam," said Adnan Khalil Basha, secretary general of the International Islamic Relief Organization. 
The F.B.I. list of 19 suspected hijackers in the attacks in New York and Washington includes the names of at least six missing Saudi Arabian men who left their country ostensibly to join the Islamic fighters battling the Russians in Chechnya, plus four others whose parents lost contact. They included a seminary student and recent college graduates. 
Investigators are convinced that the sudden movements of the Saudis believed involved in the attack, with up to 10 young men all departing within a couple months of one other, indicate that they were likely recruited here, according to an American official. 
The attacks have rekindled a debate within Saudi Arabia about the amount of religious instruction in schools. Parents say up to one third of every child's schooling is on religious topics. 
In the early years the curriculum focuses on simple things like the rules for prayer. By the time Saudi students reach high school, though, they have at least one period in six devoted to study of religious topics including interpreting the holy texts and ways of keeping their faith pure.
Some parents worry that the system overemphasizes religion. A student cannot move onto the next grade if he flunks a religion class, unlike other topics. Learning is by rote, with questions discouraged 
"It looks innocent, they are just trying to teach religion, but in a subtle way it is a recruiting mechanism," said a humanities professor at King Saud University in Riyadh. "If a pupil shows enthusiasm, he is recruited into their circles and then suddenly, bang! -- he takes a gun and goes to Afghanistan to fight for Islam."
Those who support religious instruction contend that students need more. "Don't put the blame on the curriculum but on the misinterpretation of the Koran and the Sunnah," or the sayings and actions of prophet Muhammad, said Hamid al-Majid, a professor of education at Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud University, the country's leading seminary. "I believe the way to minimize extremism is to put greater emphasis on religious education, but in a good way."
There was a time when the mosque was the only place to learn to read and write. More secular topics were introduced, though, as Saudis educated abroad came back to run the schools. By the 1960's, a Saudi high school graduate would have been exposed to topics like Roman history and the Protestant Reformation.
In those years, however, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt preached Arab unity, fought the Muslim Brotherhood and sought to undermine King Faisal. In response, the king offered political asylum to thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members. Most ended up as teachersand junked the Saudi curriculum.
"They said this is infidel knowledge and gradually their teaching crowded out all useful information," a former government official said. 
With every challenge to Saudi family rule -- like the 1979 seizure of Mecca's Grand Mosque by a group of Islamic militants led by Juhaiman al-Utaibi -- the dynasty ceded more ground on social affairs to shore up its own Islamic credentials. 
Its princes generally viewed such matters as unimportant anyway, far inferior to glamorous ministries like defense, where government contracts generated lucrative commissions. But social affairs ministries have been dominated by descendants of Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahab, and they seek to advance his austere teachings. 
Senior members of the ruling family reject the idea that they somehow allowed the education system to help shape extremists. "People can get deluded into doing acts of horrendous consequence and Saudi Arabia is not immune to having some of its citizens deluded in this way," said Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister. "We may have a different education system from other countries, but that doesn't make them more susceptible to delusion." 
But other Saudis suggest the environment does exist within the kingdom because of the constant barrage of messages that Wahabi teachings are the purest form of Islam. 
The attack has left the government looking for options. "Embracing the Islamist forces was a way to channel fervor and to distract criticism," one Western official said. "Now it is the Islamists who are a threat. It has become problem No. 1."
Saudis and Western diplomats said the Saudi government seemed to have inadvertently exported that attitude through large investments in spreading the faith. The kingdom has built hundreds of mosques worldwide, but many propagate the anti-Western, Wahabi attitudes because their prayer leaders were trained on scholarships at religious institutions here or in Saudi-financed schools. 
Inside Saudi Arabia, at least through the 1970's, mosques were strictly for prayer, with one sermon each Friday. Now speeches unroll almost nightly in some of them, long after prayers end. 
Nor is the anti-Western extremism limited to mosques. Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a religious sheik with a popular Al Jazeera television show, often adopts an anti-Western stance. 
Recently he entertained a question from a viewer named Ali in Saudi Arabia asking whether American civilians working in Islamic lands should be considered warriors and warned to leave or be killed. The sheik did not flinch at the idea, giving a legalistic answer that all those invited in deserved protection. A guest columnist in Al Watan, Saudi Arabia's answer to U.S.A. Today, wrote that Islam and the West are natural enemies, disputing a writer who said the religion was peaceful. 
"He says that Islam means peace, while I say no interpretation ever said so, and God said to fight all the infidel," wrote Mohammed al-Rameh of the Supreme Institution for the Judiciary. The dissenting response came from someone in Spain, not Saudi Arabia. 
The arguments also roll forth on the Internet. Hamoud al-Shuaibi, an elderly sheik who issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, condemning the American attacks on Afghanistan, answered a question on the Net about when jihad, or holy war, is permissible. "Jihad is allowed against infidels like the Jews, Christians and atheists," he answered in part. 
The extremely religious people focus much of their attention on social matters, handing out colorful pamphlets with bold type at shopping malls. One pamphlet said it was a sin even to vacation in the West, and another condemned those who wish non-Muslims well on their holidays.
The very same lessons were echoed in the nearly 20 pages in the high school textbook devoted to the involved principle known as "Al Wala and Al Bara," or showing loyalty to Muslims and shunning outsiders. 
"One of the major requirements in hating the infidels and being hostile to them is ignoring their rituals and their festivities," the textbook says. 
Later in the chapter it is recommended that Saudi youth do nothing to imitate non-Muslims in the way they dress, walk, eat, drink, or talk. 
"It is social fanaticism," said Jamal Khashoggi, the deputy editor in chief of The Arab News, "but it takes just a few small adjustments to turn it into political fanaticism."

HEADLINE: Schundler Record: Taxes Held Down, but at a Cost 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
At almost every campaign stop, Bret D. Schundler recounts how he held property taxes down in his eight and a half years as mayor here by reforming government to make it more efficient.
 He impresses audiences with the story of how he closed a $40 million structural deficit soon after taking office. 
 He says he did it all even as the state was drastically cutting its aid to Jersey City, simply by learning to do more with less.
These claims -- along with the resurgence of Jersey City's economy, its booming waterfront, and its plummeting crime rate -- make up the heart and soul of the Schundler mystique: a financial wunderkind who has turned around New Jersey's second-largest city. Mr. Schundler says he is now ready to tackle even larger economic challenges in Trenton as New Jersey's next governor should he defeat his Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey. 
But a close examination of Jersey City's finances shows that Mr. Schundler's rendition of his record often overlooks the costs of the decisions he has made.
Even his critics say Mr. Schundler did some truly innovative things as mayor. But a study of city records and interviews with current and former city officials show that he overstates both the challenges he faced and his successes at addressing them; that to avoid raising property taxes he often used budgetary sleight of hand, and at other times tried new financial devices with mixed results; and that, if he had inherited a rickety fiscal house, the one he left to his successors had been mortgaged to the hilt.
Mr. Schundler prides himself on finding creative approaches to solving problems. And his earliest coup may stand up as his signal financial accomplishment. In the early 1990's, Jersey City property tax bills were so high that many people, unable to pay, were losing their homes to foreclosure. The city's tax collection rate fell so low at 78 percent that its budget was snowballing: it had to set aside as much money in each year's budget as was uncollected the year before.
Mr. Schundler broke that cycle.
After winning a special election in November 1992, Mr. Schundler, a former Wall Street broker and analyst, won a full term the following spring by promising a huge tax cut based on a bold, but complex idea. He found a way to recoup millions in back taxes the city had failed to collect. It took a special state law, which the Legislature's Republican leaders pushed through on his behalf.
The plan: Jersey City would bundle delinquent tax liens and sell them in bulk to underwriters, for $25 million in cash and a note for $19 million more. The underwriters would issue bonds, to be paid off as they collected back taxes or foreclosed on the properties.
It did not all go smoothly. Collections dragged out far longer than anticipated. Homeowners sued the underwriter, and in July were awarded $30 million in damages. Jersey City also sued the underwriters when its note went unpaid, and received a settlement of just $6.25 million.
Still, the bulk-lien deals dramatically improved the city's tax collections, as many property owners paid their taxes faster out of fear of foreclosure. For the last four years, the tax collection rate has been better than 99 percent. The city's reserve for uncollected taxes, meanwhile, is just $2.5 million, down from $25 million in 1993.
Henry A. Coleman, director of the Rutgers Center for Government Services, who studied the bulk lien sale, said Mr. Schundler brought many city properties back from tax delinquency. "That's something he deserves credit for," he said.
Mr. Schundler has repeatedly blamed the state for Jersey City's fiscal problems, saying Trenton continually shortchanged the city. But despite a few steep cuts, over all, state aid to Jersey City actually rose during Mr. Schundler's mayoralty, his own budgets show.
In response, Mr. Schundler says state aid was effectively cut because it did not keep up with inflation, and that because it made up such a large part of his budget, those cuts hurt more than cuts in other cities.
Mr. Schundler eventually struck a Faustian bargain with state officials: he received an extra $15.6 million from Trenton in 2000, but had to endure Jersey City's being branded a "distressed city," as well as submit to more state scrutiny of his finances.
That scrutiny gave rise to sharply critical reports during the Republican primary campaign and again last week.
Those reports have cited Jersey City's continuing structural deficit, which Mr. Schundler says he closed soon after taking office.
A structural deficit is what happens when a city's recurring revenues, like taxes, are not enough to support its regular annual expenses, like salaries and benefits. To eliminate it requires raising enough in taxes each year, or cutting enough spending, so that the two even out.
Instead, Mr. Schundler has turned to a series of nonrecurring, or one-time, revenues. Fiscal experts and credit-rating agencies frown on these so-called one-shots, like the sale of city-owned land, to pay for operating expenses. Once sold, after all, an asset cannot be sold again.
Indeed, Jersey City's most recent bond offering statement acknowledges that the structural deficit persists: the city continues to require "approximately $20 million to $30 million in nonrecurring revenue sources for the budget."
Mr. Schundler says that some nonrecurring revenue, like land sales, should be treated as recurring revenue -- even though his own budgets do not do that. There are always going to be some nonrecurring revenues, he says, so they might as well be called recurring.
Mr. Schundler's critics call this Bretspeak.
Tom Gallagher, Mr. Schundler's former chief of staff and now a campaign assistant, defended Mr. Schundler's use of one-shots. "In general, you'd rather not have them," he said.
"But if the choice is between one-time revenues or an increase in property taxes, we'd take the one-time revenues."
In one case, the city found $9 million to plug a hole in its 1997 budget by selling Cochrane Stadium, a ball field at Caven Point on the waterfront near Liberty State Park. The buyer was the city school district, which had to borrow the money.
The net effect of the deal, critics said, was to make city residents take out a mortgage on a property they already owned.
The ostensible reason for the school district's purchase of Cochrane Stadium was to ensure that school teams and students would have access to it.
But Mr. Schundler said that the deal was more a roundabout way to get extra money from Trenton, since the state runs the Jersey City school district and assumes any increases in its costs.
One-shots were one way to avoid property-tax increases. Others were to shift expenses off the city's budget, or cannibalize the surpluses of other city agencies.
Just before Mr. Schundler took office in 1992, the Jersey City Sewerage Authority raised its rate from $1.50 to $3.29 per 100 cubic feet of water use. Fulfilling a campaign promise, Mr. Schundler cut the rate by 85 cents in July 1993, and twice thereafter. By March 1997, it was down to $2.25.
But in 1995, Mr. Schundler also took the $15 million surplus that the sewer authority had accumulated by raising rates, and used it to fill holes in the city's budget, not to return money to ratepayers.
In 1996, Mr. Schundler struck a highly acclaimed public-private partnership with a utility, United Water Resources Inc. The company took over management of the city water department. In return, it gave the city $2.5 million in cash and promised $7 million a year in added revenue and savings.
Two years later, Mr. Schundler came up with a more ambitious deal, one that he said would produce similar savings but that ultimately did little more than allow the city to plug a huge hole in its budget using an elaborate version of a cash advance on a credit card.
In January 1998, Mr. Schundler created a Municipal Utilities Authority to combine the existing sewer authority and the city's water department. The authority immediately borrowed $36 million. Of that, it paid the city $31 million as an up-front "franchise fee" for control of the water system. It also agreed to make eight annual payments to the city of $16 million each.
The authority, in turn, renegotiated with United Water, and optimistically predicted its payments to the city could be paid for with future operating profits.
The deal seemed like a windfall for the city. But by all appearances, it was too rich for the authority.
Since the deal was done, the combined sewer and water rate has soared, to $4.53 per 100 cubic feet -- nearly the $4.60 it was when Mr. Schundler took office. It is scheduled to rise again to $4.66 next year, and more after that.
Worse, the authority has still failed to keep up with its yearly payments to the city. Last year, it gave the city $14 million and recorded an i.o.u. for $2 million. And the authority's revenues now are $2 million behind last year's, officials say.
Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the deal is that at the end of the eight years, in which time the authority will have paid the city $159 million for the water system, the water system is to revert back to the city. The deal, thus, is not a sale, but a lease.
Mr. Coleman, of Rutgers, said the M.U.A. deal, which he had not examined closely, "raises at least the question in my mind of whether there have been short-term solutions for problems that may have longer-term consequences. Have we solved some problems for this administration that are going to add to the problems of subsequent administrations?"
Critics say that while Mr. Schundler accurately blames his predecessors for leaving behind a fiscal mess, he has done the same, by reaching far into the future to close his budgets and by deferring millions of expenses. Such actions enhanced his image as a tax-cutter but came with hidden costs to residents.
In 1985, Jersey City got a $40 million federal Urban Development Action Grant and lent the money to the developers of the Newport Mall. The $40 million in principal was due in 2035. In 1999, the city retired the loan in exchange for $5 million, which was split in half and used in the next two budgets. The conversion of the bond benefited a major Jersey City developer and campaign contributor to Mr. Schundler.
Robert F. Cavanaugh Jr., a Democratic councilman until this year who frequently criticized Mr. Schundler, said council members, as usual, did not stand in Mr. Schundler's way. "What Bret would do is he'd go to the Council and say, 'If you don't take this one-shot and plug it into the budget, I'm going to have to raise taxes or lay people off,' " Mr. Cavanaugh said. "They didn't have the stomach to make those decisions."
Then, last year, Mr. Schundler cobbled together $24 million for his final budget by getting developers who had received tax abatements from Jersey City to make ahead-of-schedule payments in lieu of taxes. Those early payments will be credited to the developers in the next four years. In other words, Mr. Schundler took as much as $6 million a year straight out of his successor's next four budgets.
Mr. Schundler defended the move by saying new payments were scheduled to materialize in the next few years so that there would be no net drop in revenue to the city. "I don't think there's anything inappropriate whatsoever about that," he said.
"The issue becomes, what's the best way to keep development going so you have more revenues coming on line?" Mr. Schundler said. "The answer is to keep taxes down. What we did was keep taxes down, so you got economic growth."
Had he instead raised property taxes by $24 million, of course, homeowners' tax bills would have soared, and Mr. Schundler's record would have looked much worse as he entered the governor's race.
All in all, because of the many things Mr. Schundler did to avoid raising taxes, the city still collects roughly the same amount in property taxes that it did when he took office. 
But debt is up by $107 million, or nearly 18 percent. Water and sewer rates are nearly back to record highs, and rising. The city's structural deficit remains at least $20 million, possibly twice that or more. And Jersey City's new mayor faces mounting short-term obligations and receding payments in lieu of taxes.
Mr. Schundler said that given the enormous problems that he inherited, his successes loomed far larger than any failings, especially when his record was compared with Mr. McGreevey's in Woodbridge.
"His was a lot easier city to manage, and he did a poor job of it," Mr. Schundler said. "I think mine was a very difficult city to manage, and I did a really good job with it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE WORKERS; 
Day Laborers at Ground Zero Say They Are Not Being Paid

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
The state attorney general's office is investigating complaints that day laborers hired to clear debris from office buildings surrounding the site of the World Trade Center have not been paid, some of them for up to two weeks of work.
 The complaints here are hardly unusual. Day laborers are frequently illegal immigrants who are promised payment in cash. They have no formal employment contracts, and they know their employer only through a crew leader who hires them on a street corner. 
 Officials with the cleaning company in this case, Milro Services Inc., of Freeport, N.Y., say they are not responsible for hiring and paying the laborers; the company hired a subcontractor to do that. (Late yesterday afternoon, the subcontractor said she was making arrangements to pay the workers.)
What is unusual here is the setting. In this case, the day laborers are at the center of the mammoth cleanup effort in Lower Manhattan. By 8 a.m. each morning, they are lined up, 100 deep, on the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street for a day's work. Escorted past barricades by police officers, they clear shards of glass, wipe soot off desks and sweep floors covered with ash and debris. 
They are promised $60 for an 8-hour shift, $90 if they work 12 hours, and the buildings they clean include the offices of several city and federal agencies. But in interviews at the hiring site this week, several laborers, including some men and women freshly unemployed from shops and delis near the trade center, said they had not seen a dime for their work -- some for a week, some for two. 
One man, Gonzalo Carmona, opened his datebook and pointed to his nine days of work, starting on Oct. 1; by his calculations, he was owed $780. A woman, Cecilia Linares, said she had worked for seven days straight; when she asked about pay, the woman who hired her, whom she said she knew only by her first name, Lumi, told her, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow."
Early Wednesday morning, Ms. Linares showed up again and looked, in vain, for the woman. 
The complaints first surfaced when an organizer with the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health went to the hiring line to talk to workers about safety precautions; he heard an earful about how they were not being paid.
Yesterday morning, lawyers from the state attorney general's office came and the workers lodged their complaints.
"They gave us very specific information about where they worked, what they were promised, what they were paid, what they weren't paid," said Patricia Smith, the assistant attorney general in charge of the agency's labor bureau, whose offices are around the corner from the hiring site. "We've talked to the employer, we are investigating and, hopefully, we'll be able to resolve it."
Officials with Milro Services said yesterday that they were surprised and dismayed to learn of the charges. But they said hiring and paying the day laborers was not the company's responsibility, but that of a supervisor, Lumi Morel, who was acting as a subcontractor.
"I don't like that this is happening, if it is happening," said Tom Milici, the vice president of Milro. But, he added, "that's out of my hands." 
Late yesterday afternoon, Ms. Morel, reached by telephone, said she had been delayed in paying the workers because of paperwork. She said that she owed money to about 80 workers, and that she planned to pay them by today.

To the Editor:
With the anthrax scare shutting down the House of Representatives (front page, Oct. 18) and weakening the economy, we must conclude that the country is heading for a government and financial crisis unless there is substantial presidential and Congressional action to prevent it. 
 America cannot have butter and Cipro. The president must return from China to take hands-on control from the situation room. Unless there is some immediate action toward resolving the crises, dissent and controversy will continue to tear the nation asunder.

HEADLINE: Green Holds Quiet Meeting With Ferrer 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY and DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
For the first time since their bitter runoff contest, the Democratic candidates for mayor, Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer, met last night in an apparent effort to keep their differences from continuing to spill over into the compressed general election season.
 Neither camp would reveal the content of the conversation, but it had been clear for the last day or so that campaign supporters of Mr. Ferrer had been approached by Democratic leaders and Mr. Green's supporters to try to unify the Democrats behind Mr. Green, the apparent nominee. 
 In the week since the runoff on Oct. 11, the campaign has been fraught with charges and countercharges that Mr. Green ran a biased campaign and was challenging the validity of minority votes, and that Mr. Ferrer and his supporters had been divisive and were hurting the Democratic Party's chances to win the mayoralty. Mr. Ferrer withdrew his concession late Sunday after learning that Mr. Green's lead had narrowed. Last night, with counting still unfinished, his lead stood at roughly 19,000 votes. 
Leaving Mr. Ferrer's campaign headquarters in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Green would not disclose what they talked about. "We had a good talk," he said several times. "Have I told you we had a good talk?" he asked on the fourth question. 
The two men met alone, without aides. The secrecy surrounding the meeting suggested the tension that exists between the two men. Aides to the candidates prevented a reporter and a photographer from entering Mr. Ferrer's offices, and Mr. Green left through a back door.
Yesterday was the first time that Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Green had spoken since primary night. Mr. Green called Mr. Ferrer on Friday morning, but Mr. Ferrer waited until yesterday afternoon before calling Mr. Green and inviting him to his headquarters.
Mr. Ferrer's press spokesman, John Del Cecato, said the two Democrats "had an honest, candid and forthright discussion of the issues of concern" to Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. He would not comment further.
Later, Mr. Green returned to Mr. Ferrer's campaign headquarters to meet with several of Mr. Ferrer's supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Ferrer was not there. As he walked in, Mr. Green said, "I'm looking forward to having a good conversation with whomever of Freddy's supporters are there." The two-hour meeting ended at midnight, and Mr. Green and Mr. Sharpton declined to say what had transpired.
The friction between Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Green has provided fodder for the Republican candidate, Michael R. Bloomberg, who has criticized Mr. Green several times this week for the tenor of his runoff campaign. In addition, Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, announced that the Senate's Elections Committee would hold a hearing in New York City on Wednesday to look into the runoff. A news release issued by Mr. Bruno's office said that the hearing would look into "miscounts, and allegations of vote fraud, racism and questionable campaign tactics."
"We're interested in some of the things raised by Ferrer's people," said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans.
A person close to Mr. Green's campaign called the Bruno hearing "a naked, raw, overtly political attempt to damage Mark." A spokesman for Mr. Green, Joseph DePlasco, also questioned the Republicans' motives. "This hearing is a questionable campaign tactic," he said. "If he is serious about campaign reform -- and we think it is needed -- he should hold bipartisan hearings after the election and support real campaign finance reform in New York State."
William Cunningham, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said the Bloomberg campaign had not been notified about the hearing and had nothing to do with the decision to hold it. Mr. McArdle said the committee would approach Mr. Bloomberg about testifying, but Mr. Cunningham said he saw no reason for Mr. Bloomberg to appear.
The infighting among the Democrats overshadowed what Mr. Bloomberg had hoped would be a notable endorsement, that of Raymond W. Kelly, who served as police commissioner under Mayor David N. Dinkins and was commissioner of the United States Customs Service in the Clinton administration. Mr. Kelly said the city needed a mayor with Mr. Bloomberg's business expertise more than at any time since the Great Depression.
Mr. Kelly has been an adviser to the Bloomberg campaign on law enforcement, but his remarks yesterday were directed almost exclusively at the economy. He said issues of public safety were dependent upon how the next mayor guided the city through its economic problems.
"He has what it takes," Mr. Kelly said of Mr. Bloomberg. "He is not a talker, he is a doer. He is not glib, he gets the job done."
Another former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has already endorsed Mr. Green. In offering his endorsement of Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Kelly said he did not "want to get personal" about Mr. Green. But in keeping with Mr. Bloomberg's own strategy of late, he belittled Mr. Green's experience over the last eight years as public advocate.
"I would simply say if you look at the position of public advocate, it has less than 40 employees, a very small budget," said Mr. Kelly, who works at Bear, Stearns as senior managing director for global security. "If you look at the charge of what the office is expected to do, it is essentially asking questions and writing reports."
Mr. Bloomberg, who is making his first bid for public office, is a billionaire businessman who is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg L.P., the communications company. 
Mr. Kelly sidestepped questions about whether he might be interested in returning to his old police job. Instead, he and Mr. Bloomberg said they intended to "double-team" Bernard B. Kerik, the current police commissioner, and try to persuade him to remain in the job should Mr. Bloomberg win. Mr. Kerik has said that he would step down at the end of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's term.
Mr. Bloomberg, who appeared with Mr. Kelly at a news conference at his Midtown campaign headquarters, used the opportunity to continue his jousting with Mr. Green over their styles of campaigning and to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Mr. Green's unofficial victory in the runoff. At one point, he said he hoped that voters would know by Election Day on Nov. 6 who had actually won the Democratic nomination.
In that regard, Mr. Bloomberg said it was arrogant of Mr. Green to be talking about his transition team, a reference to a news conference Mr. Green held on Tuesday. At that time, Mr. Green said he thought it was more important to plan his transition team than to spend time investigating allegations about the campaign against Mr. Ferrer.
"He should talk about why people should vote for him and not go and measure the drapes for Gracie Mansion," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Told by reporters that Mr. Bloomberg had described him as arrogant, Mr. Green turned the tables.
"He probably should avoid using personal terms like that," Mr. Green said during a campaign stop in Lower Manhattan. "But since he's opened the door, allow me to walk through it: It's probably more arrogant for him to think he can buy the election, than for me to reflect the statistic, according to the Board of Elections, that I have an 18,000-vote majority as of now."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing Connecticut: Hartford: Comptroller Urges Session 

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 Breaking with fellow Democrats, State Comptroller Nancy Wyman is urging lawmakers to meet soon in a special session on the state's growing budget deficit of possibly $180 million. Ms. Wyman's position puts her at odds with Democrats who control the House and Senate and marks a turnaround from her own comments less than three weeks ago, when she cautioned against making "rash" budget adjustments. Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, has also called for a special session, saying the state's economy is deteriorating faster than expected.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Shares Rise, but Worries Affect Blue Chips

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Technology stocks eked out gains yesterday, but the broad market fell on jitters about widening anthrax scares and downbeat earnings from bellwethers like McDonald's and General Motors.
 "There are still unfortunately a lot of unknowns," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which oversees $1.3 billion. "We have this whole anthrax issue and we are coming into earnings season. Even though everybody has been talking about how weak earnings are, it's still a shock when the news rolls on the tape." 
 Also unnerving Wall Street was economic data showing a rise in the number of Americans claiming jobless benefits and a bigger-than-expected drop in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region. This came hard on the heels of a report this week that industrial production fell last month. Such negative statistics raise concern that a rebound in the economy may be further out than thought.
This week is the heart of the third-quarter earnings reporting season, but fears over bioterrorism are grabbing the spotlight. 
Investors are wary of stocks. Holders of mutual funds pulled a record $32 billion out of stock funds in September, as the terrorist attacks were followed by a big market sell-off, the fund tracking company Lipper Inc. said.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average slumped 69.75 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 9,163.22, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 8.48 points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,068.61.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,652.72.
Stocks had crept higher in the last three weeks as investors clung to hopes that more government spending and lower interest rates would revive the economy and corporate profits. Some of that enthusiasm carried over to technology stocks yesterday.
Microsoft rose 72 cents, to $56.75, as investors bet on upbeat earnings from the software giant. After the close, Microsoft posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, but said sales of its popular corporate software were strong.
McDonald's fell 16 cents, to $29.24, weighing on the blue-chip Dow average. The restaurant chain's profits slipped 1 percent.
General Motors fell 75 cents, to $42.02. The automaker reported a 54 percent drop in earnings, reflecting the sharp fall in United States car sales and the costs of cheap loans to customers.
Merck & Company dropped $2.75, to $66.30. The drug company said profits rose 6 percent, but also cited sluggish sales of its Vioxx arthritis drug.
"Until the earnings are out of the way and we get past the anthrax scares and get some progress on the terrorism front, it will be hard for investors to sustain the kind of confidence they need to really continue that rally," said Linell McCurry, executive vice president at Walnut Asset Management, which oversees $750 million.
Analysts are predicting the third quarter will bring the worst drop in corporate profits in a decade as the economy tries to escape recession.
The latest economic data continued to paint a bleak economic picture. Manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic decelerated at a faster pace in October, falling near lows hit early in the year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which conducted a survey after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The Philadelphia Fed said its monthly business conditions index plunged to minus 27.4 in October from minus 7.3 in September, its 11th consecutive month of contraction. Economists had expected a reading of minus 15.3. A reading below zero indicates economic shrinkage. The index hit a decade low of minus 36.8 in January. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By The Associated Press
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32 to a price of 103 13/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.57 percent from 4.56 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 , to 100 27/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.32 percent from 5.31 percent on Wednesday.

Microsoft's Profit Report Beats Wall St. Estimates

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Microsoft reported quarterly profits yesterday that surpassed Wall Street's expectations -- ignoring, as most securities analysts do, a big charge for bad investments in telecommunications and cable-television companies. And Microsoft executives delivered an optimistic outlook for the company's prospects, despite further weakening in the economy and the personal computer business in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
 Microsoft executives attributed the strong quarterly results to sales of software that runs big data-serving computers in corporate networks and other products beyond its traditional mainstay of operating system software for desktop computers. 
 "We're very pleased with these results," John Connors, the chief financial officer of Microsoft, said in an interview. "Our diversification strategy is paying off." 
Microsoft joins I.B.M., which reported its results on Tuesday, as a second bulwark in the battered technology sector. Both companies have reported solid quarters and have made encouraging remarks about the future at a time when many of their rivals are suffering badly.
Microsoft reported its quarterly financial results after the close of the stock market. Its shares rose modestly in after-hours trading, rising initially to $57.36 a share, up from $56.75 a share at the close. In later after-hours trading, though, the stock gave back some of the gains to settle at just above the closing price.
The after-hours trading seemed to reflect the view of investors that Microsoft's performance had been remarkably resilient in difficult times, but that it is facing challenges ahead. In a conference call with analysts, Microsoft said that it expected PC shipments for its fiscal 2002, which ends next July, to decline slightly. And Microsoft still derives more than 65 percent of its revenues from PC software, various versions of the Windows operating system and productivity applications like word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation software.
"It was a remarkable accomplishment that Microsoft has reported results as strong as they have," said David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. "But it also faces an extraordinary challenge ahead."
The demand for personal computers in the quarter was weaker than Microsoft had projected before Sept. 11, and the company reduced its guidance for PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2001. 
Earlier, Microsoft had said that it expected personal computer shipments to rebound somewhat in the last quarter of the year, rising perhaps 5 percent, helped by the introduction of its new Windows XP operating system, which will be introduced next Thursday.
But in the conference call, Mr. Connors said the company now expected PC shipments to decline about 2 percent in the fourth quarter. Microsoft did not give a projection for Windows XP revenues, but Mr. Connors suggested that internal expectations had been scaled back somewhat recently.
The big software maker's reported net profits were hit by a $1.24 billion after-tax charge to account for the drastically reduced market value of Microsoft's investments in telecommunications and cable-television companies. Including that charge, Microsoft had net earnings of $1.28 billion, or 23 cents a diluted share.
Wall Street analysts tend to brush aside these one-time investment write-offs because Microsoft's cash position is so strong. The company's nest egg of cash and short-term investments is $36.1 billion, up from $31.6 billion three months earlier. 
Microsoft's earnings, excluding the big charge for bad investments, were 43 cents a share.
The consensus profit estimate among Wall Street analysts was 39 cents a share on revenues of $6.16 billion.
Microsoft reported revenues of $6.13 billion, slightly under but essentially in line with expectations.
In the quarter, Microsoft's results were bolstered by strong gains in sales of the Windows 2000 operating system, especially the version that runs on data-serving computers that act as the hub of corporate networks; sales of that version rose 20 percent. Database and e-mail server software SQL Server 2000 and Exchange 2000 Server were up more than 30 percent. 
Microsoft executives said they were also encouraged by the performance of the company's MSN Internet businesses, both a collection of Web sites and an Internet access service. The MSN access service now has seven million subscribers, an improvement but still a distant second to America Online.
Despite continued weakness in the economy and in the PC industry, Microsoft said it expected to report revenues for the last three months of 2001 to rise to $7.1 billion or more, and per-share earnings to reach 49 cents or 50 cents a share.
"Microsoft is somewhat decoupled from the PC trend," said Don Young, an analyst for UBS Warburg. "And for the company to look ahead and still see earnings growth is impressive in this environment."

HEADLINE: Congress Will Allow Ban on Internet Taxes to Expire 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct, 18 

 BODY:
In a move that will allow a ban on Internet taxes to expire this weekend, Congress declined today to extend it, remaining mired in a dispute over how state sales taxes should apply to billions of dollars in electronic commerce.
 Analysts and lawmakers say it is unlikely that state and local governments will rush to impose new taxes after the moratorium expires on Sunday. But given enough time and an increasing need to raise revenue, that could change. 
 "Starting Monday, there's an opportunity for considerable economic mischief," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. 
There is concern that tax officials around the country could begin interpreting a variety of their tax laws as applying to the Internet. Some lawmakers say that would drag down a major economic engine, adding to the nation's economic problems.
"This is no time for Congress to permit a new onslaught of taxes on the consumer, or on the tech sector," said Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California.
The moratorium imposed in 1998 prohibits taxes on Internet access and bans any tax that singles out the Internet. It does not, however, address a more complex issue involving uncollected state sales taxes on electronic commerce estimated at nearly $26 billion in 2000.
Fearing huge future revenue losses, state and local government officials say that if Congress renews the ban it must also give them authority to require that out-of-state Internet, catalog and telephone sellers collect and remit sales taxes.
That position is supported by most traditional retailers, including many of the nation's largest chains, who say Internet competitors have an unfair advantage.
A state is barred under a Supreme Court decision from forcing an out-of-state business to collect its sales tax unless the business has a physical presence, or "nexus," in that state.
Earlier this week, the House passed a straight two-year extension of the current moratorium that did not address the sales tax question. That was blocked in the Senate.
"We ought to deal with both sets of problems at the same time," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. "I would object to a two-year moratorium that doesn't address the second problem."
Mr. Dorgan failed today to win Senate approval of an extension until June 30 that included nonbinding language encouraging states to continue working on a simplified system to collect taxes on remote sales.
That sealed the moratorium's fate for the time being. Both houses are in recess until Tuesday.
Sales taxes are levied by 45 states and the District of Columbia. Buyers are generally supposed to pay the tax when they purchase something from an out-of-state retailer, but the laws are rarely enforced.
"A lot of mayors and governors don't want the political heat of collecting those taxes," Senator Wyden said.
Internet sellers have resisted a new sales tax system unless the current patchwork of tax rates and rules in some 7,500 jurisdictions is replaced by something less burdensome. They also fear being subjected to dozens of other kinds of state taxes and audits, particularly involving corporate taxes.
Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said sales tax simplification should result in "one form, once place to send your check, and one audit."
Republicans and Democrats insisted today that they would resolve their differences and pass an extension of the moratorium before adjourning for the year. There may be an effort to take up the House-passed two-year extension next week in the Senate and allow votes on a series of sales tax amendments.
"There is an interest on both sides of the aisle," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the minority whip.

HEADLINE: Reagan National Airport Will Expand Flight Schedule 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Flight operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport will be expanded to an additional 18 cities on Oct. 26, the Department of Transportation said today.
 The airport, which is in Virginia across the Potomac River from the White House and other national landmarks, reopened on Oct. 4 with flights authorized to just eight cities in the United States, including Atlanta, Boston, New York, Chicago and Dallas. 
It was the last major airport to resume operations after all commercial flights were grounded in response to the attacks on Sept. 11. 
 Flights will resume next week between Washington and Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Orlando in Florida. And flights have been added to and from Charlotte, N.C., Cincinnati, Phoenix, Seattle and Toronto among others.
"Reagan National Airport is an important symbol of the enduring strength of our nation," said Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation. "The Bush administration will continue to work with aviation and law enforcement officials to ensure the safety and stability of flight operations."
Airport and aircraft security has been increased by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies. 
Administration officials said President Bush wanted to be certain about thorough security at the airport, including the presence of air marshals on flights, before lifting restrictions. The shutdown created a battle between security and economics, with Virginia lawmakers threatening to push through legislation to force the airport open if the president did not act. 
The new flight rules exceed the original plan of adding 10 cities in the second phase of expansion, which is expected to last 45 days.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE BIOLOGICAL THREAT; 
Bush Officials Step Out in Force In Effort to Calm Anthrax Fears

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
After more than a week of sometimes conflicting information from federal authorities about the threat of bioterrorism, Tom Ridge, the Bush administration's new domestic security chief, and other senior health and law enforcement officials stepped forward today to try to calm public fears about anthrax.
 Mr. Ridge's first public appearance in his new position was meant to send a more focused and authoritative message to the public after two days of intense concern about highly dangerous anthrax found in a Senate office. 
 The briefing this morning -- with Mr. Ridge joined by the attorney general, the F.B.I. director, the postmaster general, the surgeon general and officials from the military and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- also seemed to be a response to criticism that the Bush administration had been slow to give the public clear information. 
"Thousands and thousands and thousands of people have been tested for anthrax exposure, and thousands of environmental samples have been taken as well," Mr. Ridge said, emphasizing that only six actual cases of infection had been detected so far.
At the briefing, Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, said the government would offer a $1 million reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone responsible for anthrax attacks. John Potter, the postmaster general, said his office would send a postcard "to everyone in America" within a week outlining how to handle suspicious mail. 
Projecting an air of confidence and looming physically over his Bush administration colleagues, Mr. Ridge said, "Instead of speculating, we'd like to focus on the facts."
With that, Mr. Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a combat veteran of Vietnam who was sworn into his new job on Oct. 8, became a brisk, self-assured moderator of a live televised update on the anthrax scares, featuring some of the powerful officials whose heads it may well become his job to knock.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, a frequent critic of the Bush White House, said he considered Mr. Ridge's appearance "very important, because it's the first time we're getting an authoritative source rather than a chorus."
In a round table with reporters later, Mr. Ridge himself took note of questions about his previously low profile. "My kids used to read the book, 'Where's Waldo?' " he said, by way of explaining his debut. "Where's the Gov? I thought it was the appropriate time to come out."
Since Monday, when finely grained anthrax spread from a letter opened in the office of Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, critics in Congress and second-guessers in the news media had asked why Mr. Ridge failed to take charge publicly of the government's response.
President Bush was traveling to China for an economic conference, and Congressional leaders argued among themselves about the severity of the anthrax threat -- but shut their offices for environmental testing. So the White House was under pressure to arrange a more coordinated public relations response.
But administration officials said today that Mr. Ridge had been getting up to speed behind the scenes, and had always planned to make his public debut today or Friday.
On Wednesday, they said, he told White House aides that he was ready. Other planned announcements were consolidated into a single news conference under his command.
"From a communications standpoint, we have to do everything we can to provide the facts to the American people, but in a factual way," said the White House communications director, Dan Bartlett. "The worst thing that can happen to the federal government is to lose credibility with the American people, and that's why we will continue to be very careful with the information we have and make sure it will be accurate."
Once the decision was made to go forward, Mr. Ridge apparently wasted little time. A member of the staff of the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, said Department of Health and Human Services officials told him and his deputy, Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu, that they were expected at the White House at 10 a.m.
"We just got told to go, and so we went," the aide said.
In his afternoon talk with about 20 reporters, Mr. Ridge acknowledged that "there has been some concern that there are mixed messages."
He added, "The decision was made to get out and try to encapsulate all the information and tell you from this day forward, we're going to do regular conferences."
From his first day on the job, Mr. Ridge said, he met daily with Mr. Mueller, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services. Mr. Bush spoke to Mr. Ridge from Air Force One this morning, and the two planned to talk again before Mr. Ridge went to bed tonight.
Mr. Ridge said he was calling agencies with requests to take on new missions or to provide him with more information. "I have the authority from the president," he said. "I have the access."
Repeatedly, Mr. Ridge said his goal was to transform the 46 federal agencies charged with duties that come under the heading of homeland defense so they could respond to threats like bioterrorism and "other man-made disasters."
But he played down discussion of whether he would call for drastic changes at those agencies.
"My job is to step back from all of these different agencies, take a look at all their moving parts," he said. "Then I can see where there can be some refining, some strengthening and some improvements."
In the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush created the homeland defense office by executive order, and some members of Congress have said that they thought Mr. Ridge would need statutory power to coordinate the work of some famously proud bureaucracies. But Mr. Ridge said he told Congressional leaders this week that he declined their offers to strengthen the office, at least for the moment.
"I may need some statutory authority down the line if I'm going to rearrange some of the responsibilities and give cleaner lines of responsibility to the agencies," he said.
Mr. Ridge said, for example, that he would not be the official to decide whether the military should shoot down a commercial airliner that behaved suspiciously. "My role, if there is time, would be more as an adviser," he said.
But, asked in the morning if he was "the boss here or are you a coordinator," Mr. Ridge replied, "The coordinator, it's like the conductor of an orchestra. The music doesn't start playing until he taps the baton."
In any emergency, he said, "you've got several agencies that spring into action immediately, simultaneously, and my role would be to participate in that effort to make sure that the response -- agency-wide, cross-government-wide -- is coordinated so that it is quick and as aggressive and as complete as possible."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "How Anthrax Can Infect and Kill"1. Entering the BodyAnthrax spores can cause three types of infection, depending on how the spores enter the body. THE SKINSpores can enter through cuts in the skin and begin to germinate into anthrax bacteria. THE LUNGSIn rare but serious cases, spores can be inhaled into the alveoli in the lungs. THE STOMACH AND INTESTINESIn rare cases, spores that are swallowed can cause ulcers or lesions in the stomach or intestines. 2. The SpreadTHE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONDS In all three types of infection, cells from the body's immune system destroy some of the bacteria, but may also carry some to the lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, anthrax can thrive and multiply. The bacteria produces cell-killing toxins. 3. DeathToxins spread through the lymphatic system, as well as through the blood stream. If the toxin build up is too much, the body begins to shut down. As the toxins spread, they can cause liquid build up in the lungs, dangerously low blood pressure, organ failure. Drawings of human bodies shows areas effected including Lymph Node, Alveoli, and White Blood Cell.(Sources: Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, Johns Hopkins University; Journal of the American Medical Association; The New England Journal of Medicine; Medline Plus Health Informations)(pg.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TROOPS; 
Special Forces Leave for War Without Fanfare

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD

DATELINE: CLARKSVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Judy Pryor did not show up to teach her aerobics class at the Clarksville Athletic Club on Sunday evening. She apologized to her students the next day. She had been saying goodbye to her husband, who is a member of the Fifth Special Forces Group, one of the Army's Green Beret units based here at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. He had received orders to leave for operations in Afghanistan.
 As the air attacks on Taliban targets in Afghanistan have presumably softened the Taliban's air defenses, commando units are widely expected to begin their search for Osama bin Laden soon, and some of them will come from Fort Campbell, which is better known as the home of the 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles. 
 But unlike a full-scale deployment by the 101st Airborne, which occurred in the gulf war in 1991, with big Air Force transport planes lifting out thousands of soldiers from an airfield inside Fort Campbell, the special forces troops are leaving quietly, with no fanfare and amid as much secrecy as possible.
Laura Skelly's husband, a captain in the Fifth Special Forces, left almost immediately after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, going somewhere in Uzbekistan, the former Soviet republic on the northern border of Afghanistan, she said. Lisa Kirkland's husband, Sean Kirkland, a staff sergeant in the Fifth Special Forces, left on Oct. 1. And one woman who works as a Web site coordinator for the press office at Austin Peay State University and spoke on the condition that her name not be used, said she expected her husband to leave in the next few days. He has already left twice, but each time returned the same night after someone changed his orders.
Mrs. Kirkland, whose husband is a sniper in Bravo Company of the Fifth Special Forces, said she did not know where he was, except that it was in "a forward position." He has been sending her e-mail messages, or telephoning, every day, until today.
"That is kind of scary," she said. "Maybe they are going into action."
Sergeant Kirkland was excited to go, said Mrs. Kirkland, who is a receptionist at the Clarksville Economic Development Council. Clarksville abuts Fort Campbell, and with a population of 104,000, is the fastest growing city in Tennessee. The Army is its biggest industry.
"He's wanted to do this since he was 5 years old, in Wyandotte, Mich., honestly," Mrs. Kirkland said of her husband's reaction to going to war. They have a photograph of her husband, as a 5-year-old boy, with a rifle and army gear. "Now he was really anxious to get there and is very proud of their abilities in unconventional warfare," she said. 
Sergeant Kirkland's company trained in Uzbekistan for four months last spring, his wife said. 
As for her own feelings, Mrs. Kirkland said, "I'm torn. I'm happy he's actually getting to do what he trained so hard for, but he's not playing around."
The woman at Austin Peay, whose husband is a first sergeant in the Fifth Special Forces, says she and her husband, both from Springdale, Ark., had been watching "Band of Brothers," the HBO series about the exploits of the 101st Airborne Division in Europe in World War II. "He loves it, seeing all the tactics, and it has really helped him," she said. "He knows from watching it he can't be afraid."
"But I look at it from a different perspective," she said of the combat scenes. Referring to all the casualties, she said, "I say, 'Oh, that could happen to him.' "
To try to prepare herself, and help her husband, she has written him a series of letters and sealed them, so that when he gets into combat and is not reachable by e-mail, he will have something from her to read.
"I read my Bible," she said. "It's what gets me through the day."
"I know I have to hold myself together now, till he leaves," she said. "Otherwise, it would upset him."
One of the last things the soldiers did before leaving was strip off the shoulder patch in the form of a lightning bolt that identifies them as members of the Fifth Special Forces, and their insignia of rank. "It's in case they get captured," Mrs. Skelly said.

U.S. SPECIAL FORCES STEP UP CAMPAIGN IN AFGHAN AREAS

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
American Special Forces troops have been operating inside Afghanistan to support armed groups opposing the Taliban there, according to a senior military officer.
 Military officials in Pakistan said that, in the past 48 hours, there had been increased activity by American forces at Jacobobad, one of two Pakistani air bases designated by the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as staging posts for what have been described as "search and rescue operations." 
 Previously, officials in Pakistan's military intelligence agency had said that helicopter-borne special operations troops were expected to use that base and another, Pasni, about 350 miles southwest of Khandahar.
Jacobabad is about 200 miles southeast of Khanadar, the spiritual headquarters of the Taliban and headquarters of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's leader. 
"There is nothing that we have not been doing for a while," an American officer said. Army Special Forces soldiers are known to be at bases in Uzbekistan, across Afghanistan's northern border, and aboard the carrier Kitty Hawk, south of Pakistan.
Any American troop activity from these bases would have to be under conditions set by General Musharraf, who has said on several occasions in the past month, including just this past week, that there are no American ground troops in Pakistan. But by using the term "ground troops," military specialists say, Gen. Musharaff may have left open the possibility that he has secretly agreed to American special operations being mounted from those bases without publicity.
In Shanghai this morning, where he was attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, President Bush declined to talk about current military activity in Afghanistan.
The latest operations were first reported tonight by The Washington Post.
Since Defense Department officials have said repeatedly that special operations forces would be a critical part of the campaign against the Taliban and the terrorist groups it has been sheltering, American forces have been operating in Afghanistan to coordinate with the Afghan opposition, to identify targets and to be ready for combat action against terrorist targets once intelligence identifies them. 
Members of a Special Forces group from Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee border have received orders to leave for Afghanistan, a deployment that is being undertaken with as much secrecy as possible. Page B3. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that the United States was prepared to give direct military assistance to opposition groups hoping to move on the Afghan capital and topple the Taliban regime.
Mr. Rumsfeld gave his most precise checklist to date of how the offensive to uproot the terrorist network called Al Qaeda and punish its Taliban sponsors would be coordinated with the Northern Alliance, the main opposition group. The alliance, frustrated until now with the targets of the American bombardment, has made little headway against the Taliban after years of civil war and 12 days of American-led bomb and missile strikes. "They're going to have some help in food, they're going to have some help in ammunition, they're going to have some help in air support and assistance," Mr. Rumsfeld said. 
While giving neither a timetable for an opposition ground offensive, nor any prescription for a postwar government in Afghanistan, Mr. Rumsfeld said that American military action would be designed to help the Northern Alliance advance.
"Our effort would be to try to make them successful," he said, "to do things that are helpful to them so that they have the opportunity to move forward, as they are, towards Mazar-i-Sharif; to move forward, as they are, towards the northeast, where there is an Al Qaeda unit that they've been working on; to move south towards Kabul." 
Mr. Rumsfeld's statement raised several questions, not least how it could be squared with the clear opposition of a chief American ally, Pakistan, to a Northern Alliance advance on Kabul. This week, speaking in the Pakistani capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell suggested that Pakistan's concerns would be respected. 
In an interview today with the Cable News Network, Mr. Rumsfeld was asked about concerns that America "might leave the Taliban in place and make them and Osama bin Laden even bigger heroes." 
"That's not going to happen," Mr. Rumsfeld replied.
It was not the first time that tensions appeared between a Pentagon eager to push the military campaign vigorously and a State Department concerned about preserving the delicate alliances that make up America's coalition against terrorism.
Mr. Rumsfeld said assistance would include providing ammunition and coordinating American airstrikes with Northern Alliance operations. He made clear that air power alone would not be enough to achieve America's aims: the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden and the ousting of his Taliban protectors. 
"There are things you can find from the air," Mr. Rumsfeld said, including clusters of enemy troops and weaponry. "But you cannot really do sufficient damage" with air power alone. Warplanes, he added, "can't crawl around on the ground and find people." 
The Northern Alliance is on the ground in parts of northern Afghanistan. But its senior officials say they are increasingly baffled by the signals from the administration and increasingly frustrated by the apparent reluctance to bomb front-line Taliban positions. 
These officials, including Gen. Baba Jan, a prominent Northern Alliance general, say the front line near Kabul is packed with thousands of Arab and Pakistani volunteers, including followers of Mr. bin Laden.
The defense secretary has been the strongest voice in the administration calling for the demise of the Taliban, and he has repeatedly stated that the people of Afghanistan should rise up and oust the regime. 
Other administration voices, however, have cautioned against anointing the Northern Alliance as America's proxy. The Northern Alliance is dominated by ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks, and it is not acceptable to many Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan. 
Although the Northern Alliance is focused on trying to take Kabul and the strategic northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif, it is not clear that even their capture would free Afghanistan of the Taliban, whose main base is in the south around Kandahar.
Up to now the Northern Alliance has provided little or no evidence that it has the military capacity to dislodge the Taliban. It appears to be awaiting the kind of bombing that would dent the Taliban's military advantage. Taliban forces outnumber those of the Northern Alliance by about three to one. 
Similarly, it is not clear that reports of defections from the Taliban to regional commanders of either the Alliance or other anti-Taliban forces are credible. Politics in Afghanistan is intensely local, with many warlords swapping sides in alliances of convenience that have shifted with the changing fortunes of the 22 years of war that began with the Soviet invasion in 1979. 
Defense Department and military officials say that target recommendations and other intelligence from opposition groups have so far been unclear and unreliable. Mr. Rumsfeld today accused the Taliban and the terrorists of hiding in civilian areas, even using the camouflage of religious sites to complicate planning for attacks against them. 
"There's no question but that the Al Qaeda and the Taliban are using mosques," and that is being done purposely, he said, "because they know that we are a country that tries to avoid high-collateral-damage targets." 
Mr. Rumsfeld said that the United States would "like to receive targeting information" from opposition groups. An important role of Army Special Forces in particular is to provide a reliable bridge between guerrilla forces and American commanders as well as to find targets with precision. 
A senior Defense Department official said after Mr. Rumsfeld spoke that the United States had not yet provided munitions directly to opposition forces in Afghanistan.
A military officer indicated that ammunition and small arms would were more likely to be provided by other countries interested in seeing the Taliban fall, and who have an arms industry more compatible with the Northern Alliance's arsenal.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: STRATEGIC RELATIONS; 
Russia and U.S. Optimistic on Defense Issues

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Russia and the United States signaled tonight that they were near a breakthrough on the key strategic issues that had divided the two countries since President Bush came into office, in particular Washington's plans to build missile defenses and Russia's troubled relations with an expanding NATO alliance.
 The progress was reported tonight after a meeting here between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. 
 A Russian diplomat said the meeting had created "favorable conditions" for "forming a new framework for strategic relations" between Moscow and Washington when Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin meet here on Sunday on the sidelines of a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders. 
The diplomat, quoted by the Russian Interfax news agency in a dispatch from Shanghai, said the meeting of the two leaders, to be followed by talks next month in Crawford, Tex., at President Bush's home, "would be of exceptional significance in this sense."
The momentum in the strategic arms negotiations, stalemated for months after the two leaders opened them this summer at their first meetings in Slovenia and Italy, follows Mr. Putin's announcement last month that he was opening Russian air space to the American airlift of military and relief cargoes to Central Asian republics for deployment on Afghanistan's northern frontier.
Along with its support for the American military campaign in Afghanistan, Russia is offering its oil fields as a secure alternative to dependence on the turbulent Persian Gulf. Page W1. 
"Not only is the cold war over," Secretary Powell said, "the post-cold-war period is also over." 
Washington and Moscow now regard the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States as a watershed event in international relations, a number of experts say, that has offered opportunities for Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush to battle a common enemy. 
This could generate a level of cooperation that allows Mr. Putin to overcome the objections of domestic critics who grumble that he is compromising Russian security by making concessions to Washington. Mr. Putin's strong support for American intervention in Central Asia allows Mr. Bush to promote a greater role for Russia in Western security.
Neither side made public the details of any prospective agreement. But in recent days Secretary Powell has underscored that Washington is now prepared to make the kind of cuts in its nuclear arsenal that Moscow has been seeking as a possible trade-off for amending the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Russia might also choose not to object to a testing program for missile defenses that might otherwise be construed as a violation of that 1972 accord.
The Bush administration's determination to build a missile defense shield has been a source of tension with Russia because such a shield violates the ABM treaty, regarded by Russia as the basis of all strategic arms control.
A senior State Department official traveling with Secretary Powell said tonight that he would not go so far as to predict that Mr. Putin was ready to accept American proposals to modify the ABM treaty to allow extensive testing. But the official emphasized an "across the board" change in attitude by the Russian leadership toward cooperation on everything from strategic issues to fighting terrorism and closer relations between Russia and NATO.
The American official said Russia's decisions this week to abandon a Soviet-era electronic eavesdropping base in Cuba and give up its lease on the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Vietnam signified a change of thinking that went beyond the financial savings that both steps would yield for the Russian military.
"Clearly the Russians, in making these decisions for financial or whatever other reasons, do see this as a new opportunity in a changed time," the official said, "and it comes up again when we talk about NATO-Russian cooperation." 
The official said NATO and Russian officials had stepped up their consultations in recent weeks to expand their cooperation, but he would not elaborate beyond saying that the cooperation did not include joint military action.
Mr. Powell met Mr. Ivanov after a day of meetings with the foreign and trade ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The ministers completed a statement condemning terrorism, though efforts by the United States to get a specific pledge of support for its military operations in Afghanistan foundered after Indonesia and Malaysia raised objections. Both have large Muslim populations. Secretary Powell declared that he was satisfied with the statement.
"I got a resounding signal of support from all the members present," he said. 
Mr. Bush arrived this evening, and he and the secretary will meet Mr. Putin on Sunday after his talks with President Jiang Zemin on Friday.
Mr. Putin's decision to align Russia with the fight against the bases of Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been hailed as a significant turn in Russia's post-cold-war policy toward the West. It has secured one immediate benefit for Russia: greater Western acceptance of the military campaign Mr. Putin is waging in the rebellious territory of Chechnya.
The Russian leader characterizes the Chechnya campaign as Moscow's battle against terrorism by Islamic militants, some trained in Afghanistan. Though the Bush administration abruptly shifted its policy to acknowledge that terrorist groups had exploited the Chechnya conflict, the White House and State Department continue to admonish Mr. Putin to seek a political settlement there, and to hold accountable Russian military commanders who had presided over atrocities. Since last summer, Bush administration officials have been pressing Moscow not to put Washington in the position of withdrawing from or violating the ABM accord. Such a step would probably incite renewed concerns in Europe and the Middle East that Mr. Bush was still pursuing a unilateralist course in foreign policy, and could undermine his coalition-building against terrorists.
For his part, Secretary Powell said the terrorist attacks on the United States and its commitment to build a worldwide coalition against terrorist groups had ended any pretense of American unilateralism.
"Nobody's calling us unilateral anymore," he said in remarks to American businessmen here. "We're so multilateral it keeps me up 24 hours a day checking on everybody."
The secretary applauded Russia's decision to abandon the bases in Cuba and Vietnam, which were hallmarks of America-Soviet rivalry.

HEADLINE: A Lethal Web With No Spider 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
"He sits motionless like a spider in the center of its web," is one description of the villain, "but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organized," though it is "impossible to get evidence which could convict in a court of law."
Such are the wiles of the evil Professor Moriarty, described by his nemesis, Sherlock Holmes, shortly before they plunge into Reichenbach Falls, apparently to their deaths. 
 This metaphor of a spider web with a masterly evil plotter at its center is appealing as a description of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, but it may also be incorrect. A web, after all, has crucial vulnerabilities. Eliminate its creator, and the threads weaken. Destroy a few crucial links, and the strands collapse. 
 But terrorist organizations are generally referred to as networks, which can be quite varied. Instead of being built around a controlling hub surrounded by terrorist cells, a network can be a sprawling, decentralized arrangement. In fact, the declarations that Americans are engaged in a different sort of war than ever before may have to do with this structure and not just with terrorism itself. Disabling a network often requires different strategies from those used to attack a nation or a hierarchical organization. The challenge may also be a distorted reflection of more profound shifts in culture and politics. For better or worse, the world has entered an era of networks.
In recent years, for example the idea of a network has received substantial attention in mathematics, computer science and sociology. A network is, to put it simply, a collection of connected points called nodes. A node can be a telephone connected to switching stations and other telephones. It can be a computer using the Internet. Or it can be an individual communicating with other individuals for a common purpose. Networks are being studied for their properties (in a mathematical field known as network theory), for their applications (as in the Internet) and for an understanding of social organizations (ranging from online newsgroups to terrorist groups).
The design of a network determines its resilience, its vulnerability and its power to expand. Manuel Castells, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, argues in a dense analytic trilogy, "The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture" (1998, Blackwell), that the development of computer networks, the Internet and banking networks has begun to affect the world order.
As has been argued by other scholars, Mr. Castells says that these networks are creating new social structures. Once commerce and communication take place beyond national control, the status of the state changes. Notions of sovereignty and self-sufficiency are weakened. These developments have been welcomed by many for their promise of new forms of governance. But at the same time, these wide-ranging networks inspire an opposing reaction. The more the state withers, the more anxious and rootless its citizens become. And so there is an increasing pursuit of identity and a stronger urge to assert distinctions that have nothing to do with the state.
In extreme form these network effects are reflected in the current situation. Technological networks helped terrorist networks flourish; agents could ignore national boundaries, rely on remote financial dealings and use the Internet to obtain news, send e-mail and book flights. (The hijackers even walked out of one hotel because it did not offer high-speed Internet access). Such international coordination and communication would have been far more difficult a decade ago. But these technological networks are also being used in fanatical pursuit of fundamentalist identity. The supranational network serves a supranational identity, creating a double threat to the state.
Purely apart from its fundamentalist fury, in fact, Al Qaeda's network is trying to undermine at least some aspects of the modern nation-state. But unlike those who welcome a world free of nationalism, Al Qaeda seeks an almost premodern form of association. The modern state is partly founded on rational principles and is given shape by bureaucratic hierarchies and evolving canons of law. The terror networks are after something different: the dissolution of such principles and hierarchies and the expansion of religious connections across all national boundaries.
In this case the attack had an archetypal quality, mounted against the most powerful nation-state on the globe. The vulnerability of the modern state is partly its transparency; its organization is based on interlocking webs, each dominated by a central authority. The sites targeted for the Sept. 11 attacks included crucial nodes of the state, the points required for maintenance of civic order: military and financial centers and possibly executive and legislative centers.
The difficulty is that now a state must fight a network, which is far from easy since a network can be made unusually resilient and need not be designed around dominant power centers. This was, for example, a characteristic of a computer network designed for the Defense Department in the 1960's. It was meant to be invulnerable to nuclear attack. There was no hierarchical organization. No single computer or computer site was the center for the transmission of communications. Every message was broken into "packets" that could take completely different paths to their goals. If one node -- a computer system or communications center -- was taken out, messages could continue unimpeded. The Internet is the heir of that early network and preserves the same resilient design, which is one reason it was so much less affected than local telephone and television service on Sept. 11.
It may be that Osama bin Laden's network and many others are built on similar principles. What if the network is designed so that if Mr. bin Laden were removed, the network would proceed unimpeded? What if the network is less hierarchical than it seems, so there are few if any agents with a complete overview of what is happening? Some people in intelligence have theorized that this was the case with some of the hijackers. How is this kind of network, a modified human version of the Internet, to be undermined, particularly given its intermeshing links with other terror networks with their own design?
The answers to these kinds of questions are undoubtedly being debated. But if an Internet-like network is the model, warfare will have to change its focus; the state will have to take on network capabilities that may include espionage as well as intricate coalitions and collusions. As has been emphasized, no single attack or approach will be sufficient.
In fact, one important strategy for bringing down a sophisticated network may be (as has been seen with the Internet) a metaphorical virus that could -- confuse communications and connections with disinformation and covert and subtle disruptions. Such viruses may be in the process of development. But the outcome, as President Bush has already warned, is not likely to be a wrestling match with a single villain crashing to his death at Reichenbach Falls.

HEADLINE: Central America Reminded Of Its Own Era of Conflict 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
The war against terrorism may be focused on Central Asia, but it has revived fears and memories across the political spectrum in Central America, where the United States was long ensnared in civil wars and skulduggery in the battle against Communism.
 El Salvador and Guatemala have eagerly responded to the American effort by beefing up armies and military budgets, alarming human rights advocates who fear a setback to the peace accords that ended long and violent conflicts. 
 In Nicaragua, where the Sandinistas are seeking to capture the presidency in a tight election next month, campaign advertisements for the right-of-center parties incessantly remind voters of the Sandinista revolution's close ties to terrorist governments.
But there is fear, too, of unlearned lessons from an era when the United States supported Latin American dictatorships with atrocious human rights records. 
As the United States now courts allies among Central Asian nations torn by regional differences and saddled with their own human rights problems, some people here offer cautious advice from their own bitter experience.
Sergio Ramirez, a former Sandinista vice president who has since broken with the party, noted that for political reasons, Pakistan and its military ruler have been embraced since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.
"That is what happened in Latin America during the cold war," he said. "The United States dealt with people like Pinochet or Somoza for reasons of national security and allowed them to do what they wanted because they were struggling against Communism. But that guarantee against Communism resulted in greater internal wars and deaths among our own people."
It has been difficult, Mr. Ramirez said, to talk about such things, since no one wishes to appear insensitive to the suffering in the United States or to condone terrorist acts. Instead, memories of the region's past conflicts have colored the local response to the attacks in familiar ways.
Since Sept. 11, Guatemala has sought increases for a presidential security detail that has been linked to human rights abuses and political assassinations. Honduras, which was the base of operations for the contra army that fought the Sandinistas, has sought tens of millions of dollars more for its military.
In El Salvador, the government cited national security concerns when it sent 400 soldiers and police officers to take over the international airport and main seaport, barring entry to the more than 200 workers employed in cargo handling and security. Legislation was also passed to give the president more control over intelligence matters.
Coming after years of civil war and military juntas, those moves are troubling to those who now fear that governments might use the fight against terrorism as an excuse to reassert power they lost in peace accords.
"In part it is a knee-jerk reaction: the small boy wants to be with the big boys, to show his loyalty and to be part of the bigger international picture," said the Rev. Rodolfo Cardenal, the vice rector of the University of Central America in San Salvador. "But it is a bit over the top. The Salvadoran ports are not installations of any real international security interest."
He and others in the region said that rather than seek to strengthen armies, governments would be better off cracking down on the lucrative trade in alien smuggling or curtailing violent crime.
For those who fought in Nicaragua's jungles in the 1980's, the current military campaign in Afghanistan seems familiar. Veterans of the contra army in Nicaragua said that they understood the need for the United States to take quick action, and that they saw the Northern Alliance as their latter-day counterpart. But they also said their battle against a single foe had been less complicated than this one.
"This is not like Latin America, where the United States strengthened militaries to do away with insurgencies," said Fernando Avellan, who was the contras' director of psychological operations. "There is no insurgent group like Fidel Castro's in Cuba or in Bolivia which can be defeated by strengthening militaries."
He argued that the problem was far deeper and that a solution had to get at what he said was the root of the problem between the United States and the Islamic world: the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The theme of terrorism has become central in Nicaragua's presidential race, in which the Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega is tied in opinion polls with the candidate of the governing Liberal Party, Enrique Bolanos.
With the Liberals courting several thousand undecided voters who will determine the result of the election, newspapers and television broadcasts have hammered home Mr. Ortega's links to the leaders of Cuba, Iraq and Libya.
While there is no proof that Mr. Ortega ever met him, one televised spot also shows Osama bin Laden among the rogues' gallery, while an announcer warns people, "If they could vote in Nicaragua, they would vote for Daniel Ortega."
The ads come at a time when the United States has expressed serious concerns over the prospect of a Sandinista victory, given not only Mr. Ortega's allies, but also the Sandinistas' record on human rights and unresolved claims over properties confiscated when they were in power. If the United States reduced its foreign aid or investors decided to look elsewhere, Nicaragua's already weak economy would be further hobbled.
The Sandinistas, who denounced the terrorists attacks, see the ads as a way to divert attention from accusations of corruption and mismanagement that have dogged the Liberal Party. 
At the same time, some among the Sandinistas have questioned the definition of terrorism, recalling the United States support for the contra army that tried to topple their government. They cite a 1986 World Court ruling against the United States for its role in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
"If the U.S. likes you, you're a freedom fighter," said the Rev. Miguel D'Escoto, the former Sandinista foreign minister. "If they don't like you, you're a terrorist."

The Other World Trade Centers Vow to Persevere

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANIERO, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
These are perilous times for any entity calling itself a World Trade Center.
 "This tragedy has thrown a big spotlight on us," said Neels C. P. Swart, chairman of the Johannesburg World Trade Center. "The awareness and the noise level around the name of the world trade centers are higher than they have ever been." 
 Directors of the 300-odd buildings with that name around the globe, apprehensive but resolute, gathered this week in Sao Paulo at an annual conference that was quickly dominated by sobering assessments of their delicate situation. 
Delegates pointed out that New York's World Trade Center stood out from its namesakes not just in size and fame, but also in its associations in the popular mind. Its location and tenant mix made it more a symbol of Wall Street than of global trade. By contrast, other world trade centers in nearly 100 countries are mainly home to enterprises like import-export companies, trade associations and shipping and cargo companies.
"We've been doing good for 30 years," Mr. Swart said. "It is important to tell that to the world now and make it clear what we stand for."
The World Trade Center Association, whose slogan is "Peace and stability through trade," has met annually since 1970, and Sao Paulo, whose center is one of the largest outside the United States, was chosen four years ago as host of this year's conference.
"Everyone feels vulnerable right now, but that doesn't mean we should stop doing what we've been doing," said Guy Tozzoli, who is president of the association and oversaw construction of the twin towers in New York. "We make a statement by coming here. If anything, we should be more active now, because when people come together to trade, they don't kill each other."
In one sign of confidence, Mr. Tozzoli said, he has received assurances from the Chinese government that construction of Beijing's second World Trade Center, designed to be even taller than the destroyed towers in New York, will go ahead as planned. In addition, since Sept. 11, the association has gone ahead with planned admissions of new members with trade centers, or plans for one, in longtime trouble spots like Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
"For us, this is as good a time as any to join," said Seyoum Yohannes, the Addis Ababa delegate, who is trying to interest other members in the potential for tourism and the export of coffee and leather goods from his country. "Having lived through the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and a communist government, we have come to believe that trade is our salvation."
Delegates were keenly aware that world trade is likely to suffer in the aftermath of last month's attacks. They worry that political leaders are now focused almost exclusively on military and national security challenges, leaving trade issues to languish.
"This is a very bad time, a terrible, dangerous time, for the world trade center movement," said Nayef Gheith, representing Amman, Jordan. "People are angry, and that is no good. It is bad for business and bad for everything else."
Mr. Tozzoli said the association must also contend with being frequently confused with the World Trade Organization, the international body that sets trade rules and settles trade disputes. As a result, antiglobalization forces often mistakenly lump the association with such protest targets as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
In fact, Mr. Tozzoli said, the association strives to avoid politics and steer an impartial course. Trade centers have been the sites of talks between North and South Korea, for instance, and between the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela and the apartheid regime that formerly ruled South Africa.
"As an apolitical organization, the world trade centers can offer a neutral venue with a neutral focus," Mr. Swart said. "It levels the playing field, and people are much more comfortable talking in that kind of environment."
Even so, trade centers are often the tallest and most conspicuous buildings in their home cities, and can seem to be an inviting target.
"These buildings are symbols of prosperity," said David Lee, who represents both South and North Korea on the association's board. "The World Trade Center in Seoul, for example, is a symbol of the Korean economic miracle, and the heart of Korea, really. But I think these buildings are well secured."
To make its goals and purpose clearer, late in September the association dispatched a ship to sail around the world offering free trade advice and information about trade centers. The group is also organizing a World Trade Center University in California. "We will not be intimidated by terrorism, and we must show that to the world," Dr. Lee said. "But we also have to take positive steps to spread the gospel of trade."

HEADLINE: Merrill Lynch Will Offer Voluntary Severance Deals 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Before it starts laying off more employees next month, Merrill Lynch will offer them the chance to volunteer to resign and receive a severance package.
 On Monday, Merrill will begin an open-enrollment period of sorts for employees to indicate their willingness to quit. The opportunity to resign with a buyout will precede the dismissals next month of what analysts expect will be thousands of Merrill employees. 
 The package will include a lump sum of cash based on an employee's length of service -- to a maximum of about one year's pay -- plus 40 percent of any year-end bonus received for last year, people inside the firm said.
Those who volunteer will not necessarily be accepted. That decision will be left to their managers and will be made in a few weeks, said Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman.
Terry Kassel, senior vice president for human resources for Merrill, told employees yesterday morning that the severance terms would be the same for those who are dismissed as for those who quit.
Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, has already eliminated 6,100 jobs this year and its executives are conducting a review for further dismissals. It has not been determined how many of the firm's remaining 66,000 employees are being considered.
On Thursday, Merrill reported earnings that were 52 percent lower than in the third quarter of 2000.
This is the first time Merrill has had a formal voluntary buyout program and its terms indicate how eager it is to quickly reduce the size of its staff. On Wall Street, few people quit their jobs late in the year because the bulk of their annual pay comes in a single bonus check early in the next calendar year. 
"As senior management has said in recent earnings reports and in talks with analysts, we are working to adjust our resources to the changed business climate," Mr. Cohen said. "This offer is intended to make it possible for employees interested in leaving the firm to volunteer to do so and receive a very generous severance package."
Merrill officials said yesterday that the firm's senior executives -- including David H. Komansky, the chairman and chief executive, and E. Stanley O'Neal, the president -- would return next week to their offices in the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan. Next weekend, they said, Merrill's trading operations would begin moving back to Merrill's headquarters there. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Merrill's traders have been working from buildings in Jersey City.

HEADLINE: Social Security Checks to Rise 2.6%, an Average of $22 a Month 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Retirees will receive $22 more a month next year, on average, in their Social Security checks because of the moderate rise in inflation this year.
 The higher benefits, a 2.6 percent cost-of-living increase, reflect the modest growth of the Consumer Price Index for the 12 months through September, the time span used by the government to calculate annual changes in Social Security payments. Monthly Social Security checks for 45.6 million Americans are adjusted annually to keep rising prices from eroding recipients' benefits. 
 The increase was in line with most of the annual adjustments over the last decade of generally low inflation. But it was more modest than the 3.5 percent rise for 2001, which was a nine-year high.
The Labor Department, which measures the changes in a set market basket of food, clothing, housing, energy, medical costs and more that go into calculating the price index, announced yesterday that the gauge rose 0.4 percent in September.
"Today's news tells us that inflation continues to be low, which is certainly good news for the elderly and disabled," said Larry G. Massanari, the acting commissioner of Social Security.
For the average recipient of Social Security, checks will rise beginning in January to $874 a month from $852. The maximum retirement benefit will rise to $1,660 from $1,536, and the monthly benefit for a widowed mother and two children will rise to $1,754 from $1,719, on average.
The government also announced yesterday that monthly Medicare premiums will increase $4 a month next year to $54, an 8 percent increase.
For working Americans, the maximum annual earnings subject to Social Security taxes next year, which follows a different formula than the benefit adjustment, will rise to $84,900 from $80,400. Of the 154 million workers who pay Social Security taxes, about 10.5 million will be affected by the higher wage base in 2002.
The moderate inflation rate is one of the few silver linings of a faltering economy, said Brian Nottage, director of macroeconomic forecasting at Economy.com. That, in turn, opens up room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively, he said, because "they can focus on the slower economy" without worrying about rekindling higher inflation.
Falling energy prices are a crucial reason inflation has remained low, said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for Wells Fargo & Company. "We expect the price of oil to decline as the global economy plunges into a recession," he said.

HEADLINE: The Job of Imagining the Unimaginable, and Bracing for It 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL with JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
How do you calculate risk in an era when nightmares are becoming headlines? 
 That question can be terrifying these days for anyone who flies in an airplane or opens an unfamiliar envelope. But it is particularly perplexing for those who practice the relatively new profession called risk management. 
 Actuaries who set insurance rates, bank lenders who assign credit limits, Wall Street managers who keep their traders in line -- all try, in various ways, to look at the past and figure out what could go wrong in the future, hoping to assure that their companies are not hurt too much if disaster strikes.
Now that disasters are striking, these risk managers are revising their formulas and trying to figure out how to manage risks they never took seriously before. 
"The things that happened a month ago were pretty darn improbable, the sort of things you worry about in your sleep," said Wilson Ervin, the global head of strategic risk management for Credit Suisse First Boston. "We are living in a different world today. You have to re-examine every assumption you have made."
The insurance industry reacted the fastest after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Insurers that included terrorism coverage as a free bonus in property policies are now reluctant to provide it, at any price, without taxpayer backing. Other insurance rates are shooting up.
Wall Street traders are pulling in their horns, too, reducing their positions and their leverage. They are especially worried about any disruption that would again prevent trading, as when the New York Stock Exchange was closed for four days after the trade center attack.
In addition, lenders, beyond shying away from the industries that have been hardest hit, like airlines and insurance, are generally becoming more cautious about making loans, whether to businesses or consumers. Just yesterday, the Providian Financial Corporation, a big credit card issuer, said that with its third-quarter profits down 71 percent, it would stop offering cards to people with weak credit histories, raise interest rates on some loans and curtail credit-line increases. Providian also said it would replace its chief executive.
All these changes since Sept. 11 -- like every decision to cancel a business trip or a vacation, or to hold off on a factory expansion or a kitchen renovation -- add up to an uncertainty tax on the economy. 
That drag, intensifying the slowdown that had already begun, stands in sharp contrast to the risk-taking that helped define America's recent economic boom, when banks rushed to offer credit cards to people who never could get them before and when investors jumped at the chance to buy a start-up company's stock.
Now, old-economy virtues like a healthy balance sheet have once again become essential. "There is far less capital available than there was," said Leah Modigliani, a portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley. "The companies that are already strong and well positioned will tend to dominate."
At Capital One Financial, another big credit card company, computerized risk models were telling executives even before Sept. 11 to lower credit lines as a way of limiting risk. Since then, it is hard to be sure what is conservative enough, said Richard D. Fairbank, Capital One's chief executive.
"No one can tell whether the economy will worsen even more than anything we have imagined, more than it has in past recessions," he said. "That's entirely possible, given what we see on MSNBC every day."
The insurance industry is already coping with something worse than it has ever faced.
Analysts estimate that the total payout for the Sept. 11 attacks will range from $30 billion to $60 billion, more than from any other catastrophe. Harder to calculate is the cost of underlying assumptions about the world that largely determine how insurance rates are set.
"You know how often a big hurricane is likely to hit, and a hurricane today is very much like a hurricane 25 years ago," said Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns several big insurance companies. "But terrorism today is not at all like terrorism 25 years ago. And now you've got something where the nature of the risk, the power to inflict damage, has gone up a factor of who knows what -- 10, 50? You can't price for that."
So, besides asking the government to help shoulder the cost of future terrorist attacks, insurance companies are replacing open-ended policies that covered nearly any risk with much narrower ones that cover only certain specified hazards.
"When things like Sept. 11 happen, there is a natural reaction to say: Oh, my God, I never anticipated something like that; what else is out there?" said Charles R. Lee, a principal with Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an insurance consulting firm. "The underwriters get more concerned and cautious. That's not very profound, except that when underwriters get concerned and cautious, it's not a good thing for their customers."
In contrast to the frenzied tightening of insurance underwriting standards, the attacks prompted only a modest adjustment to risk management policies on Wall Street. That was largely because banks and brokerage firms had already endured financial disasters, from the default of Latin American debt starting in 1982 to the 1987 stock market crash to the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management investment fund in 1998.
In the wake of each shock, Wall Street developed ever more sophisticated mathematical models designed to measure the risks of trading positions.
Generally, these systems look at each stock, bond, currency and other trading vehicle and calculate how much its price moves daily over one or two years. This measure of a security's volatility, as it is called, is used to predict the probability that a holding's value might jump or drop by a larger amount. Those predictions, in turn, allow the firms to set limits for each sort of instrument traded. That way, risk is diversified and the traders -- in theory -- will not put the firm in a position to lose more than a set amount, even in the most improbable market move.
The early versions of these systems turned out to be very effective in controlling day-to-day risks. But they could not adequately protect against the truly unexpected and devastating loss. When Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998, setting off a chain reaction throughout the financial markets, the turmoil was more than the risk managers' computer programs could withstand.
As Long-Term Capital and many other investors all tried to get out of their losing positions at once, the market for a multitude of securities fell simultaneously. And the natural protection investors thought they had by spreading their eggs among many baskets was not there.
After the 1998 market turmoil, the brokerage firms supplemented their historical models with a process of stress-testing their portfolios against various imagined disasters.
"You try to learn from history, but you can't let history be your only guide," said Robert H. Litzenberger, a managing director in charge of market risk management at Goldman Sachs. "You have to assume events that never have occurred will occur."
As often happens, though, the latest stress was not one foreseen by the tests.
"The whole idea that the New York Stock Exchange would be closed for a prolonged period of time was never factored into our models," said Mr. Ervin of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Investment firms need the markets to stay open because today's risk-management strategies require adjusting positions day by day, even minute by minute. If a firm buys a block of corporate bonds from a customer, it may hedge some of the exposure by selling some government bonds at the same time. Some options positions require a firm to adjust its hedging positions every day, even if it does not undertake any new trades with customers. So if any market is closed for several days or longer, these hedges could become mismatched, exposing the firm to unexpected losses.
As things turned out, the market's retreat since the spring of 2000 cushioned the blow from the mid-September interruption in stock and bond trading.
Stock prices fell after the attacks, but the 8 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on the day that trading resumed was far less than most firms' worst projections. With the market falling all year, risk managers explained, most brokerage firms and many hedge funds had taken enough short positions -- bets that certain securities will fall -- that their portfolios were more likely to benefit from the market's decline than be hurt by it.
Nonetheless, investment firms are now adding another previously unthinkable wrinkle into their risk-management strategies. In addition to double-checking their backup computer systems, scattering their office operations and urging the stock exchanges to do the same, the firms are trying to build weeklong trading halts into their stress tests.
But the hardest thing for many on Wall Street -- as for individual investors, lenders, insurers, mailroom workers and frequent fliers -- is trying to conclude which of the dark visions raised daily in news reports is the next nightmare plausible enough to allow it to color decision-making.
"On Sept. 10, our downside case was a global recession," said Ms. Modigliani at Morgan Stanley. "Now we still have a global recession case, but it's also a war scenario."
What about something even worse, say an incident involving a crop duster and a densely populated area?
"It's the same decision you make when you get up in the morning and get on the subway to go to work: You assess the risks, and you prepare for them," Ms. Modigliani said.
Besides, she said, recent events have not altered the relationship between risk and reward.
"A time of great uncertainty is a time of great opportunity," Ms. Modigliani said. "You need to position yourself to be safe, but you can't sell everything and go to all cash. That's the same as going into the basement and not coming out."

 BODY:
 The SPX Corporation, which owns dozens of companies that make brakes, hydraulic gear and fiber optic equipment, said today that third-quarter earnings fell and that it would lay off an additional 500 workers. 
Net income fell to $59.2 million, or $1.45 a share, from $62.7 million, or $1.94, a year earlier, the company said. SPX, which in May bought United Dominion Industries for $2.58 billion, said revenue almost doubled, to $1.22 billion from $645.1 million. SPX now plans to cut 2,500 jobs by May.

HEADLINE: Europe Wary of Wider Doors for Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: MONTGERON, France, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
In the wake of the terror attacks in the United States, Gerard Herault, the mayor of this tidy Paris suburb, took the step he could to reduce immigration to France: he decided he would no longer issue "certificates of welcome," the papers required to show that a potential visitor, asking for a visa, has a place to stay. 
 He readily acknowledges that most requests for the certificates come from the three low-income housing projects here, home to thousands of poor Muslims of North African origins. In 1998, he got about 50 requests for certificates. Already this year, he said, he has had more than five times that many. 
 "I am not saying that immigration equals terrorism," Mr. Herault said the other day, before giving a tour of his largely well-to-do town of 23,000. "But people come here and we don't know much about them and we don't know when they actually leave. And, in fact, many do not leave." 
The mayor's actions are one more indication of how the terror attacks have heightened suspicion and fear of immigrants not only in France, which has Europe's largest concentration of Muslims, but across the continent. 
Even before Sept. 11, France had an uneasy relationship with its Muslims, most from former North African colonies who have long complained of being marginalized and discriminated against. Those strains have only worsened here and elsewhere, particularly as it becomes clear that European cities as open and affluent as Hamburg were used as terrorist bases.
Many experts now expect that the attacks could undercut what had been a growing movement toward more liberal immigration policies in France and other European Union countries, whose Muslim populations have steadily grown as their economies and social safety nets have made them magnets for migrants from across the world. 
Mr. Herault was not the only French mayor to suddenly refuse to sign the certificates. Two others from southern French towns with large Muslim populations did the same. While their decisions probably amount to no more than an inconvenience for the visa seekers -- police officials can also issue the papers -- they are a sign of a shift in the political winds. 
"The events in America have produced a totally different atmosphere in the society here," said Karl Kopp, a spokesman for ProAsyl, a German refugee advocacy group. "Now everyone is talking about asylum seekers who might be terrorists. We were on the way to a new way of thinking, but now the liberal approach has just been stopped dead."
Before the Sept. 11 attacks, the European Commission had been encouraging the European Union's 15 members to write broader, more generous definitions of refugee rights. Both Britain and Germany, each with sizable Muslim populations of their own, had proposals for the creation of nonrefugee status for some immigrants, much like America's green-card system. In recent years, people wanting to immigrate to Europe have generally had to portray themselves as refugees.
After years of debate, a consensus had been building that the old "fortress Europe" zero-immigration mentality was not going to work. With a low birth rate and an aging population, Europe seemed to have recognized that it needed immigrants if it was to grow and prosper.
But since the attacks, the signs of backpedaling have multiplied.
Germany's interior minister, Otto Schilly, delayed debate on a nonrefugee bill, intended to attract much-needed skilled labor into the high-technology sector, saying it needed to be re-evaluated.
Britain announced a stricter system of security checks for asylum seekers suspected of involvement in terrorism.
In Austria, far-right populist Jorg Haider said that only European asylum seekers should be allowed to reside in the European Union while awaiting a decision on their applications. The others would go to "safe third states" on their own continents.
In Italy, a high-level government official declared on television this week that the country should consider excluding Muslims from immigration. "Given the situation of peril," said Francesco Speroni, chief of staff to the minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi, "let's close the borders to Muslims because no one forces us to have them here." He compared such a policy to the American decision during World War II to intern citizens of Japanese descent. 
Even in the Netherlands, a country renowned for its tolerance, one poll showed last month that more than 60 percent of the Dutch believed that Muslims who approve of the terrorist attacks against the United States should be deported.
These remarkable poll results came after widespread coverage of Islamic youngsters in the Netherlands celebrating the attacks in New York and Washington.
Some 15 young people in Ede made the national news when they were seen celebrating in the streets while making a V-sign for victory and calling Osama bin Laden "our leader." Teachers in some schools with primarily foreign students declared they did not observe the three minutes of silence in honor of victims.
The Dutch are not the only ones reeling from expressions of support for the terror attacks by Muslim youth. The French, too, have been horrified by reports that there was cheering and chanting in Muslim neighborhoods from Paris to Lyon after the attacks.
Such incidents, experts say, illustrate the tensions between Europe and its large and varied Muslim populations. The estimates of the populations vary widely, ranging as high as four and half million in France, more than three million, mostly Turks, in Germany and about two million, mostly Pakistanis, in Britain, the scene of violent race riots just a few months ago. 
Throughout Europe these populations have complained of being made second-class citizens. They are much more likely than whites to be jobless and uneducated. Their young men, they say, are far more likely to be harassed by the police. Resentment has been building. 
In recent years, more attention has been directed at these problems. Countries including France have begun to look at affirmative action programs. But the reactions of some Muslim youth to the attacks on America have been deeply disturbing to many Europeans.
It was after these incidents that all three French mayors, one a socialist, two from President Jacques Chirac's conservative party, announced they would no longer sign the "certificates of welcome." All have been denounced by various groups, including SOS Racisme, a French human rights advocacy group. One mayor was taken to court, but the judge in the case said he could not act without a specific complaint. Still, the groups said they had made their point.
Many experts believe, however, that the events of Sept. 11 mean that discussions of migrant, refugee and asylum policies will now take place in a context where antiterrorist efforts take priority. Few doubt that conservative voices have been given more strength in arguing against liberal immigration and refugee policies.
"Of course, it has an impact," said Michael Emerson, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies. "It will change the course of events, but exactly how is hard to predict."
Mr. Emerson and others say that Europe cannot simply shut its doors. In addition, it must deal with the fact that European countries have different approaches to asylum seekers and migrants, a fact that has led to some tense situations. 
In France, for instance, thousands of refugees and migrants have gathered at the entrance to the English Channel tunnel in the hopes of hiding in trains and trucks headed to Britain, which has more generous policies than France.
Mr. Emerson says he believes that Europe will begin adopting new immigration policies, though as a rule they will be more conservative than they might have been. He also believes that some issues like common asylum rules and a common definition of terrorism will take priority, while others like decisions over long-term migration policies will be put off. 
"Europe needs an influx of migrants," Mr. Emerson said. "Otherwise there will be all kinds of consequences, including our pension systems going bust."

HEADLINE: Jump in Price Of Gasoline Put InflationA Bit Higher 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
A temporary jump in gasoline costs pushed consumer prices higher in September, but lower energy costs since then, along with the slumping economy, should keep inflation subdued.
 The Consumer Price Index, a closely watched inflation gauge, climbed 0.4 percent last month, after a 0.1 percent advance in August, the Labor Department reported today. 
 In another economic report, the Commerce Department said today that America's trade deficit shrank to $27.11 billion in August, the lowest level in 19 months, as the ailing economy depressed Americans' demand for foreign-made computers, televisions and other consumer goods. 
Imports fell 1.1 percent in August, to $111.57 billion, while exports rose for the first time since May, rising 1 percent, to $84.46 billion.
Virtually all of the rise in consumer prices in September, meanwhile, was fueled by a sharp increase in the price of energy products, especially gasoline, which rose by the largest amount in 15 months. Those prices went up immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but then quickly retreated, economists said.
"With the economy faltering, inflation is not a threat, especially since the energy price jump has already completely unwound," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
The core rate of inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose in September for the third consecutive month. It rose just 0.2 percent, suggesting that most other prices were well controlled.
Because the economy is so weak, companies are expected to discount their merchandise and services even more to try to bolster sales.
To promote economic growth, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates nine times this year, with two of those reductions coming after the attacks. One reason the Fed has been able to act so aggressively is because inflation has not been a problem. Economists said there was nothing in the inflation report that would deter the Fed from cutting interest rates at its next meeting on Nov. 6. Many economists are looking for a quarter-point reduction, though a bigger half-point cut has not been ruled out.
After falling 1.9 percent in August, energy prices soared 2.6 percent in September, largely reflecting a surge in gasoline prices right after the attacks, economists said.
Gasoline prices jumped 8.6 percent in September, the largest advance since June 2000. More recently, gasoline prices have fallen.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 
At Oregon, Pigskin and Sheepskin Collide

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The Stanford band last displayed its famous irreverence at a football game here in 1990. Forming an ax and then a gun with human bullets, the band struck a raw nerve. It poked fun at the divisive issue of the spotted owl, whose status as an endangered species played havoc with Oregon's timber industry. The crowd booed, and the University of Oregon barred Stanford's band from a return appearance.
 On Saturday, for the first time in 11 years, the Stanford band will return to Eugene. It will not, however, be invited onto the field to perform at halftime at Oregon's homecoming. This languorous college town of 130,000 has always been sensitive about environmental issues. It is a strikingly verdant place, with the fog-tufted meander of the Willamette River and thick forests dressed in the riotous green-gold colors of autumn and Oregon football. The university mascot is not some ferocious predator like a tiger, but rather a Disneyesque duck. 
 An idealist 1960's ethos persists here, and quality-of-life issues are paramount. A governor from that period, Tom McCall, created the unofficial state motto: Come visit, but please don't stay. 
The sawmills and plywood mills are mostly gone now from Eugene, replaced by high-tech industry, computer chips having become more vital than wood chips. But growth has always been a contentious issue, and it has generally occurred in a directed, measured way.
Given this spirit of preservation, the rapid growth of athletics at Oregon has come under intense public scrutiny. The football team is 6-0 for the first time since 1964 and is ranked ninth in the New York Times computer ranking and fifth in the Associated Press poll.
Quarterback Joey Harrington, with his penchant for last-minute comebacks, is a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy. As are many college towns, this one is consumed by victory. Yet, as the athletic department budget has expanded to $30 million today from $12 million a decade ago, the university is engaged in a roiling public debate about the role of big-time sports on a college campus.

Spending Brings Criticism
This debate is occurring nationwide as most major-college athletic departments operate with financial deficits and many educators express growing concern that academic standards are being lowered as money and corporate involvement are on the rise. Perhaps nowhere, however, has the discussion been as open and as vigorous as at Oregon.
By turns, the issue has been quarrelsome and collegial. The university has made some clumsy moves, low-salaried faculty have felt ignored and the football coaches and athletic department officials have felt misunderstood. Harrington's appearance in the summer on a 100-foot billboard in Midtown Manhattan, at a cost of $250,000, led to criticism of Oregon as the epitome of an athletic department with twisted priorities.
The debate even alienated the university's most important benefactor -- Phil Knight, the co-founder of Nike -- and as a result a planned stadium expansion endured a year's delay in construction and at least $10 million in added costs.
In recent weeks, however, Knight has returned to the social and financial fold of the university. And administrators, faculty and athletic officials say the lines of communication have opened in recent months as the university attempts to find a sense of balance between athletics and academics.
"Athletics are spiraling out of control financially and morally around the country," said Nathan Tublitz, a professor of neuroscience and the president of Oregon's university senate. "At the University of Oregon, we're trying to prevent that from happening by having people in the athletic department with high integrity who espouse academic values and believe in financial self-sufficiency and fiscal prudence and aspire to excellence academically and on the playing field."
The athletic department is expected to become self-sufficient by 2004, when an annual $2 million contribution from the university's general fund will end. As a good-faith gesture last year, the university's athletic director, Bill Moos, contributed $200,000 from his department toward faculty raises. Dave Frohnmayer, the university's president since 1994, will soon name an internal committee to monitor the prudent growth of athletics.
"The real concern is that we not be in an arms race that's not sustainable except for the five or six most successful, richest institutions," Frohnmayer said, apologizing for the metaphor. "We're prepared to compete in a conventional war scenario. We're not prepared to compete in a thermonuclear war scenario. We don't want to become a pseudoprofessional team."
Oregon football has produced stars like Norm Van Brocklin, Dan Fouts and Ahmad Rashad (known then as Bobby Moore), but until a decade ago the Ducks were usually mediocre as a team. Track and field once ruled the athletic program. Nike was born here, with running shoes fashioned on a waffle iron by the legendary coach Bill Bowerman. The most iconic Oregon athlete remains the runner Steve Prefontaine. Twenty-six years after Prefontaine's death, the university continues to sell T-shirts bearing his name.
"People could appreciate a victory in football and not get too bitter about a defeat," said the writer Kenny Moore, who attended Oregon and finished fourth in the 1972 Olympic marathon. "There wasn't a sense of desperation. You never felt like football was all there was, like in Tuscaloosa."
Football became a more consuming passion in 1989, when the university essentially bought its way into the postseason, agreeing to buy 14,000 tickets at a cost of $350,000 to participate in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La. Only half the tickets were sold and Oregon lost $178,000 on the deal, drawing criticism for wasteful spending. Athletic department officials viewed the ticket outlay as a worthwhile investment to ensure Oregon's first bowl appearance since 1963, making the team more attractive to potential recruits.
The Ducks made it to the Rose Bowl in 1995 as champion of the Pac-10 Conference, and in 1998 Oregon spent $15 million to build the first indoor football practice complex on the West Coast. 
"We've made the commitment that if we're going to compete at the Division I level, we're going to compete to win," said Moos, who became athletic director in 1995. 
The rapid growth of the athletic budget unnerved faculty members, who the university admits are significantly underpaid. Oregon belongs to a group of 61 prestigious research universities, and its faculty salaries rank 60th or 61st in that group, said Tublitz, president of the university senate. Disquiet increased when the university announced plans to expand Autzen Stadium by 12,000 seats and 32 luxury boxes at an estimated cost of $80 million, which has now risen to $90 million.
"Coughing up $90 million to build luxury skyboxes when you can't pay faculty is a form of insanity," said James Earl, a literature professor and past president of the university senate.
The stadium expansion plans nearly collapsed in April 2000, after the university announced its intention to join a workers' rights group that criticized Nike's labor practices in overseas factories. This infuriated Knight, the company's co-founder and an Oregon alumnus. Nike sponsors the university's athletic teams and he is the university's primary donor, having given an estimated $50 million for additions to the library, a new law school and 16 endowed professorships. He had pledged $30 million to the stadium expansion, but he severed his ties to the university and halted his donations.
Meanwhile, Coach Mike Bellotti felt that critics of Oregon's athletic department did not appreciate his commitment to athletics and academics. The Ducks won 10 games in 2000, a team record, and appeared in their fifth bowl in Bellotti's six seasons as head coach. According to the American Football Coaches Association, Oregon was the only Pac-10 university at which 70 percent of the players graduated over the past two seasons. Yet, Bellotti chafed as critics focused on the stadium expansion and on his $750,000 salary, with escalator clauses up to $1 million.
"It frustrated me, this perception that we sold out to something," Bellotti said. "We haven't."
More criticism followed over the summer after Harrington, the quarterback, appeared on the $250,000 billboard across from Madison Square Garden. Some people criticized the university, saying the billboard demonstrated the athletic department's skewed priorities. 
University officials remain unapologetic about the billboard, which was paid for by donors, saying it served its intended purpose. They point out that Harrington is an honors student in business administration and an accomplished classical and jazz pianist. 
"Whether we were blasted or praised, people were talking about Oregon," Moos said.

Success Goes Hand in Hand
Late last month Knight, in a reflective mood after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, ended his feud and resumed his donations to the university. "For all of us, a tragedy of this nature can kindle the desire to reunite with a distant sibling or friend with whom you've had a dispute," Knight wrote in The Oregonian, Portland's daily newspaper.
Frohnmayer, the university's president, said he remained convinced that Oregon's athletic success could boost its academic status. He pointed to a record enrollment this fall of nearly 19,000 students. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into a recent capital improvement campaign from donors who had first given to the athletic department, he said.
"It may not be every institution's experience, and may not be the experience of an institution over a long period of time, but it has been our experience in a significant way," Frohnmayer said.
Skepticism remains. Earl, the former university senate president, said it was risky to use athletics as a marketing tool for academics because sports, by nature, are a cyclical enterprise. 
The plan to expand the stadium has been revived, with the university seeking to issue as much as $29 million in state bonds to pay for the project. The university intends to repay the bonds with revenue from the additional seats and skyboxes. But Earl wonders about the university's financial commitment during the current economic downturn, when all state agencies are facing budget cutbacks of 2 to 10 percent.
Tublitz said he was cautiously optimistic. At Oregon's urging, seven other faculty senates in the Pac-10 are urging college presidents to moderate the exponential growth of athletic programs.
"This is the emerging issue in college athletics," Tublitz said. "It's a time bomb. The current model is not stable. We're trying at Oregon to develop a new model."

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Downtown New York 

 BODY:
Politicians, civic leaders and ordinary citizens alike agree that the only appropriate response to the tragic events of Sept. 11 is to refashion the southern tip of Manhattan into a vibrant commercial center that offers an attractive place to live and work and an appropriate memorial for the World Trade Center victims. There is certainly no shortage of ideas about what to do. The question now is how best to manage the restoration, and on this point there is far less agreement. In fact, there are already inklings of a turf war between the state and city. Surely in this case political rivalries need to be set aside in service of the larger cause. 
 Power struggles between Albany and New York City are a standard part of local political life. It's not surprising that some city officials want the city to run things, while state officials demur. As a result, some would-be peacemakers have suggested that the federal government should step in with some sort of blue-ribbon commission. But among those who have studied the tangle of government authorities involved in the World Trade Center site, a consensus seems to be forming around the notion of a joint city-state authority with Gov. George Pataki in a leadership position that reflects the state's historically dominant role in large-scale development projects. 
 Technically, the governor could appoint an authority to rebuild downtown New York City almost immediately, possibly as a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation. That would be a swift and uncomplicated way of approaching the job, especially since the new authority would be exempt from city zoning and other time-consuming reviews. But any unilateral move of that sort, as Mr. Pataki surely knows, would cost him the broad political support he needs over the long haul. He would be on much stronger ground if he asked the State Legislature to create a separate commission. The commission should have all the power to cut through red tape and raise money that the Empire State Development Corporation now has, but it would have legislative support and broader representation.
Mr. Pataki is likely to wait until after the city's mayoral election to unveil his ideas. Since any plan he devises will require the city's long-term cooperation, he cannot afford to present the new mayor-elect with a fait accompli. No rebuilding plan can succeed without the enthusiastic participation of the next mayor, and the two main candidates in the Nov. 6 election have offered very different proposals.
Mark Green, the Democratic nominee, has proposed a city-state "superagency," accountable to the mayor and governor with input from other voices around the city.
Michael Bloomberg, the Republican nominee, sees no need for an additional authority and says the next mayor should be the point person on the city's downtown's recovery.
New Yorkers will have a chance to express their own opinions when they go to the polls. But they need assurance that whatever city, state and federal leaders decide will not add to delays or cost the city its focus on restoring this part of the city.

HEADLINE: It's the New Upstate, Way Out There 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Call it majestic. Call it magnificent. Just don't call it Northern California.
 Following in the state's rich tradition of self-reinvention, economic development officials from California's 20 northernmost counties have banded together to rechristen their region upstate California. 
 "Folks see Northern California as San Francisco or, if we're lucky, Sacramento," said Robert Berry, a development specialist who is president of the new upstate California campaign. (Slogan: "Above It All.") "We've had a tremendous identity problem. We needed to create a new brand."
The new moniker is intended to bring "the cachet" of upstate New York, in Mr. Berry's words, to a rural area about the size of Ohio. That area comprises the counties north of San Francisco except for Napa and Sonoma, which have been deemed part of the psychic and economic orbit of the Bay Area.
The region, home to only 4.5 percent of the state's total population, has historically lagged behind the rest of California, said Dan Ripke, director of the Center for Economic Development at California State University at Chico, in the heart of upstate. The unemployment rate is typically 4 percent to 5 percent higher, and the median income 10 percent lower, than in the rest of the state. The goal of the upstate campaign is to attract new business.
"In New York, when people talk about 'upstate,' they know they're not talking about New York City," said Sam Aanestad, a California assemblyman from the Sierra foothills. 
That may be the rub. To New Yorkers -- the ones from New York City, that is -- the word "upstate" has complex associations. To some, it is the Adirondacks or the never-ending snow belt along the Thruway between Albany and Buffalo. To others, it is Poughkeepsie or any piece of grass north of Co-op City in the Bronx.
"It connotes the sticks," said one native New Yorker, Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's the place you had to study in eighth grade."
The notion of an upstate California north of wine tasting-room territory is not the first effort to forge a new identity. In the 1930's, there was a short-lived move to create a new state of Jefferson in Northern California, as leverage to garner more road money from California officials. More recently, in the 1970's, radical environmentalists dubbed the north Eco-topia.
"One of the keys to understanding California is that it's always been sold as a new land," said Tim Hodson, director of the Center for California Studies at California State University at Sacramento. 
Upstate boosters proudly point to the region's capital (Redding, population 80,000), its drink (Crystal Geyser Mineral Water) and its crops (rice, tomatoes, almonds and dried plums, known as prunes until their recent makeover).
But some advocate a more exciting name.
"How about the Better Half?" said Bruce Anderson, the iconoclastic editor of the weekly Anderson Valley Advertiser in Boonville, noting the region's plentiful trees, fish and marijuana.
Jerry Nachman, a native New Yorker and former television producer who is now a staff writer for the show "UC:Undercover," moved to Los Angeles five years ago. He suggests Up There, or Heaven, or Valhalla.
"The idea of a new name makes sense," Mr. Nachman said, "because it's a schizy state. The top has nothing to do with the bottom. The average Angeleno either thinks or hears that Northern California is a nice place, whereas nobody in San Francisco would ever say, 'I hear it's nice down there.' "

HEADLINE: Father and Son Plead Guilty to Paying Bribes to Bridgeport Mayor's Associates 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Two contractors, a father and son, admitted today in federal court that they gave bribes to close associates of Bridgeport's mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, to secure contracts that included work on a multimillion-dollar office park.
 The contractors, Alfred Lenoci Sr. and Alfred Lenoci Jr., pleaded guilty to mail fraud and bribery charges in Federal District Court here, bringing to 10 the number of people who have admitted wrongdoing in the three years since the federal government began its investigation into corruption in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city. 
 The guilty have included several friends of Mr. Ganim, including his fund-raiser, his former chief of staff and a state economic development employee. In each case, the defendants have said they and an "elected official" benefited from some form of kickbacks, like cash, goods, contracts or services. 
Federal officials have declined to name the elected official. But in one instance, public documents have linked Mr. Ganim to a contractor who pleaded guilty to a fraud charge. In addition, court documents in previous pleas have referred to the address of Mr. Ganim's home.
Mr. Ganim, who will turn 42 on Sunday, "absolutely denies any wrongdoing," said his lawyer, Richard T. Meehan Jr., though he acknowledged that Mr. Ganim appears to be the ultimate target of the federal investigation.
Today, the younger Mr. Lenoci said he paid $500,000 in "consulting fees" to Paul J. Pinto, a Democratic Party fund-raiser and former friend of Mr. Ganim, knowing that some of the money would be forwarded to an "elected official." The money was paid to secure contracts for environmental remediation and demolition at "Bridgeport-related sites," said Ronald S. Apter, one of the assistant United States attorneys prosecuting the 10 cases.
The Lenoci family owns two companies in Bridgeport. The elder Mr. Lenoci is president of United Properties, a development firm, and his son is president of United Environmental, an environmental remediation firm. Neither returned calls left for them today at their offices.
Mr. Ganim's lawyer, Mr. Meehan, said the mayor was saddened "to see this happen to the Lenocis," whom Mr. Meehan described as "very good developers."
"I just think it's another example of the greed and avarice of Paul Pinto and his insidious ability to corrupt and betray the people who have befriended and trusted him," Mr. Meehan said.
In their guilty pleas, the Lenocis admitted they agreed in January 2000 to raise about $500,000 for the unnamed official's coming campaign in their effort to be selected as developer of Steel Point, a harbor development project on the site of the former Carpenter Steel Company, Mr. Apter said. Mr. Ganim, who is serving his fifth term as mayor, was considered a leading Democratic contender for governor before the scandal broke this year.
The younger Mr. Lenoci also admitted paying about $10,000 to subcontractors for work on the residence of an unnamed elected official.
In addition, he and his father said they had provided $35,000 worth of landscaping and other services to Mark R. Trinkley, an official of the State Department of Economic and Community Development, in return for preferential treatment on their application for a $6.5 million state grant. The grant was to finance the construction of a light industrial park on the site of a former housing project known as Father Panic Village, Mr. Apter said. Mr. Trinkley pleaded guilty Sept. 6 to mail fraud and filing a false income tax return.
Both Lenocis admitted today that they had an agreement with Mr. Pinto to pay him $1 for each square foot of office space their companies built in Bridgeport, knowing that Mr. Pinto would forward a portion of that money to the unidentified official. In June, Mr. Pinto pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering, mail fraud and tax fraud.
The Lenocis, who were released on a $100,000 bond, will be sentenced on Jan. 7. Prosecutors said the son could face a minimum of three or four years in prison, and $420,000 in fines and restitution. There was no agreement on the father's sentence. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the guilty pleas of two contractors, Alfred Lenoci Sr. and Alfred Lenoci Jr., to charges of having bribed associates of the mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., misspelled the name of a former housing project where the two men had planned to build a light-industry park. It was Father Panik Village, not Panic.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUNERAL BUSINESS; 
Disaster's Toll Doesn't Necessarily Mean Profit for Those Who Bury Dead

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN

 BODY:
The funeral industry, one of the few businesses expected to profit in the World Trade Center attack, has seen no significant spike in revenues and, according to some industry analysts, may actually be losing money in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
 People in the funeral business say that even with the staggering number of casualties, funeral homes may stand to lose out, with some discreetly discounting their services or hiring extra help to handle unusually high attendance at memorials. 
 "I would say that's a very, very strong possibility," said Ron Hast, the publisher of Mortuary Management magazine. "These people have looked at this as a way of trying to serve their community." 
Experts like John Carmon, the president of the National Funeral Directors Association, cite many reasons for the disaster's negligible economic effects on the "death care industry," as people in the business call it. The victims were geographically dispersed, he said, and the slow pace of the medical examiner's office, which has thousands of body parts to identify, means that funerals will be spread out over time. In the meantime, funeral homes are not preparing human remains or selling profitable items like coffins.
Instead, funeral directors, who insist they are not watching the bottom line, have taken on the role of organizer or counselor. Many families have bypassed funeral homes, planning services themselves.
"There are times like this when a funeral home probably loses money," said Jim Nolan Jr., a co-owner of Nolan Taylor-Howe Funeral Home in Northport, N.Y. But those cases could be looked at as an opportunity for people who normally must juggle money and death to demonstrate compassion, he said. "The more people who attend funerals and see what we do here and get value from it, the better it is for the industry."
It is difficult to come up with the total cost of funerals and memorial services that have been held so far. But as of yesterday, the Red Cross had paid nearly $5.6 million to 1,029 families for funerals or memorial services and related expenses like limousines and flowers, said Mitch Hibbs, a spokesman for the agency. That is an average of $5,400 per funeral, far less than the agency's initial estimate that each funeral in the metropolitan region would cost about $10,000. In some cases, the low numbers reflect in-kind donations from funeral homes, and in other cases, the Red Cross paid only part of the costs, Mr. Hibbs said.
More funerals have been paid for by the New York State Crime Victims Board; as of Oct. 14, it had filled 2,612 claims, some of which included funeral costs. The amount allocated specifically for funerals has yet to be calculated, said Caroline Quartararo, a board spokeswoman.
The amounts of public and charitable dollars for funerals and memorial services are not enough to significantly affect the balance sheet in an industry where the amount of business at any single home can vary 10 or 15 percent each year, funeral directors say. Funeral homes in the New York City region and in New Jersey combined have an annual revenue of about $700 million a year, said Wilson H. Beebe, the executive director of the funeral directors associations representing both areas. 
In the World Trade Center disaster, there have also been difficult questions to ponder, and sometimes the answers are unavoidably tied to profit. For example, does a family with only some human remains need a full-size coffin for symbolic satisfaction? Many funeral directors say they will follow a family's lead.
"Undoubtedly a tragedy like this does bring out the best in the funeral industry," said Lisa Carlson, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, which educates people on how to protect themselves from price-gouging. The alliance has received no complaints of abuse or exorbitant charges in the weeks after the attacks, she said.
Mr. Beebe said that for auxiliary enterprises like limousine services, any increase in business has likely been diffuse enough to go virtually unnoticed. At the Batesville Casket Company, a national manufacturer, "it's basically, from a business standpoint, been business as usual," said Joe Weigel, a spokesman.
Even offers of free or discounted services have not drawn an overwhelming number of requests.
For years, Service Corporation International, which owns about 40 funeral homes in the metropolitan area, has offered a free basic funeral package to public servants who die in the course of duty. The package is worth $6,000 to $8,000 and includes a coffin, said Robert Budway, the director of operations for the company's funeral homes. He said that more than a dozen such funerals had been donated for trade center victims, but that the homes perform 15,000 funerals a year in the region. 
If families of police officers, firefighters or emergency medical technicians choose a more elaborate coffin or services not included in the package, Mr. Budway said, the city pays the difference.
Several cemeteries have offered discounts for victims as well. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which operates several cemeteries on Long Island, waived overtime and surcharges for work done on Saturdays. But again, with only about 400 bodies identified, few have made use of the offer.
Even funeral directors in suburbs that were disproportionately affected have not had that much to do. Gregory Pfleger, the owner of the Pfleger Funeral Home in Middletown, N.J., where 36 residents were lost, said that he had handled about a dozen memorial services for trade center victims, compared with 325 total funerals a year. He is charging enough to cover supplies, but not overhead, he said. 
"I don't even bring it up that this is what I'm doing. They don't want to talk about what it costs, they just want it done," he said. "Right now, it just seems like the right thing to do."
Yet if the workload has been relatively light, funeral directors said, the emotional toll has been great. "If you talk to a funeral director who has handled five or six or more funerals for the service people, they'll probably never be the same," said Mr. Carmon, of the National Funeral Directors Association.
Even for professionals trained to deal with bereavement, tragic deaths are hard to bear. In addition to handling memorial services, Mr. Pfleger has buried one trade center victim: his next-door neighbor.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Getting Serious About Casinos 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA with JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The World Trade Center disaster has rekindled serious negotiations for Indian casinos in western New York and the Catskills, with Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature said to be close to a deal for five or six casinos as lawmakers desperately seek new revenues to stave off budget cuts.
 The outlines of a sweeping agreement that would include casinos, New York's participation in the multistate Powerball lottery and the installation of video lottery terminals at horse-racing tracks emerged this week from talks among the Senate, the Assembly and the governor's office. 
 Officials involved in the talks said that revenue from such activities had been tentatively earmarked for, among other things, aid to struggling cities like Buffalo and, perhaps, Yonkers, and for a wide range of social programs run by nonprofit groups that have barely clung to solvency through the state's six-month budget stalemate. 
Officials are trying to close the deal by Monday, when the Legislature will return here. But most of the people involved in the talks cautioned that so many details were unresolved that a pact by Monday was unlikely -- and that, in fact, the whole agreement could still founder.
"The talks have really intensified in the last few days, and they'll continue over the weekend," said a top legislative assistant who like most of those interviewed, insisted that his name not be used. "We know now where the parameters of the deal are, but there's still a few tough issues to get beyond."
Governor Pataki's communications director, Michael McKeon, said today, "We're working closely with the Legislature on an economic package that includes a variety of things and will allow New York to move forward."
The Pataki administration estimates that the trade center disaster will cost the state from $3 billion to $9 billion in lost revenue in the next 18 months, a tremendous blow to a state that was already feeling the effects of the recession before Sept. 11.
The governor has pledged to cut $3 billion in spending over that time, and has asked the federal government to bail the state out, but the response from Washington has been skeptical.
The gambling proposals, which could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the state, have been under discussion for months, but lawmakers say they became more attractive after Sept. 11.
"In Albany, things seem to suddenly occur and move forward when the stars are in alignment," said Assemblyman Jacob E. Gunther III, a Catskills Democrat who has long advocated casinos in that region. "The catastrophe may have been a catalyst."
The deal under discussion envisions three casinos run by the Seneca tribe in western New York -- in Niagara Falls, Buffalo and a still-undetermined location -- and two or three -- including at least one run by the Mohawk tribe -- in Sullivan County, in the Catskills.
Even if the legislation is passed, casino development remains years in the future. The governor must first negotiate agreements, known as gaming compacts, with the tribes, and the compacts are subject to approval by the United States Department of the Interior.
Earlier this year, Mr. Pataki and the Senecas announced the outlines of a compact, but some hard bargaining remains, and there is no deal with the Mohawks.
The Department of the Interior approved a Mohawk casino at the Monticello Raceway last year, but that project fell through.
Since then, the tribe and its development partner, Park Place Entertainment, have reached a tentative agreement with Sullivan County to develop a casino at Kutsher's Country Club, owned by Park Place, and they have had extensive talks with state officials.
The legislation being hammered out does not specify locations for the Catskills casinos, but it is likely that one would be at Kutsher's.
A pact with the Legislature would give Mr. Pataki a prize he has long sought, the power to enter into gaming compacts without legislative approval.
Governors can act alone in hammering out compacts for casinos on reservations, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo did that twice. But all of the new casinos being considered are off tribal lands, and the New York courts have ruled that such projects require legislative approval.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has argued that having to take a compact to the Legislature would undercut his bargaining position with the tribes, and asked for a law giving prior approval to his compacts.
But the Democrats who control the Assembly and their allies in organized labor balked, demanding various protections for workers and unions. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver also insisted that he would not approve casinos in western New York unless the Catskills also got them.
The Republican-controlled Senate expressed some reservations about including the Catskills, particularly in the absence of a firm proposal there, but was eager to approve a deal for western New York.
Complicating the mix, Donald Trump has spent lavishly on lobbyists and campaign contributions, gaining him considerable influence here, particularly in the Senate, and he opposes Catskills casinos that would compete with his casinos in Atlantic City.
Negotiators said they planned to put all the gambling elements -- the Seneca casinos, the Catskills casinos, Powerball and the video lottery terminals -- into a single bill, to improve the chances of passage. Otherwise, they fear, legislators would be able to pick and choose, and some pieces of the package might fail.
The bill being worked out would give the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union the provisions that it had sought, but that the Senecas at first resisted, including allowing workers to unionize simply by having a majority of them sign union cards, rather than requiring an election.
Elizabeth Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Seneca, confirmed that the governor's office had approached the tribal council earlier this week with a compromise on labor issues and that tribal leaders had agreed to it. She would not provide details.
The union already has a deal with Park Place and the Mohawks, who agreed to its conditions.
Mr. Pataki proposed in January that New York join the Powerball lottery, and lawmakers in both houses have said for months that that was likely to win approval.
The video lottery terminals at racetracks, however, were more controversial, meeting some opposition in both parties and in both houses. Some legislators with racetracks in their districts fear that the machines will create social ills, while others see the terminals as a needed financial boost for their local tracks.
Negotiators say they expect the bill to provide for the terminals at Yonkers Raceway and at Aqueduct, and probably at two other tracks upstate, though which ones is still being debated. They are also trying to craft a deal to share the proceeds among all tracks around the state.
Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders have said that the state should find a way to help not-for-profit groups that provide services like counseling for AIDS patients and legal services for the poor, hundreds of which were left out of the budget passed in August.
But it remains unclear how much money they will approve, and which programs will be saved.

 "The Courage to Lead" is a 30-second advertisement for Bret D. Schundler, the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, in his campaign against James E. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge. The ad is appearing on network television in the Philadelphia and New York City markets and on cable television systems in New Jersey.

PRODUCER -- Alfano Communications Inc.

ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with Mr. Schundler seated in an office, an American flag nearby. The words, "Bret Schundler on Leadership" flash across a white background. Next, Mr. Schundler is shown walking with his wife, Lynn, and their infant son, along a sidewalk lined with row houses. The words: "Bret Schundler: Jersey City property taxes lower than 10 years ago" appear on screen. Next, Mr. Schundler is shown with a group of people in a school. Text on the screen says, "Bret Schundler: Violent crime down 37%." Then, there is aerial footage of bleak tract housing. The text on screen says," Jim McGreevey: Raised property taxes 59%." Finally, Mr. Schundler is shown amid a crowd of supporters on the night he won the Republican primary last spring.

THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Schundler: "I think the first we have to ask of a governor is to have the courage to lead. To be strong. To cut taxes to help our economy rebound and to keep our people safe."
Announcer: "In Jersey City, Bret Schundler said no to special interests and cut property taxes. He got guns off the streets and reduced violent crime 37 percent. Jim McGreevey raised taxes 59 percent and violent crime has soared."
Mr. Schundler: "We have to reform our programs. We have to do the right thing. We have to put people first. That's leadership."

ACCURACY -- Mr. Schundler cut property taxes several times in Jersey City but over all, they increased during his eight and a half years as mayor. The assertion that Mr. McGreevey raised taxes 59 percent is also misleading. The Schundler campaign gets this result by comparing the total tax levy in Woodbridge between 1991, the year before he took office, and 2001. But tax increases are more commonly measured using the municipal tax rate. By this measure, taxes rose about 30 percent, which is well within the rate of inflation. By the same measure, taxes rose in Jersey City by about 19 percent. The crime statistics, while accurate, are even more misleading. The annual number of violent crimes in Woodbridge has ranged from 309 to 450 during Mr. McGreevey's tenure; last year it was 347. The violent crime rate was 3.6 per 1,000 residents. In Jersey City, the number and rate of violent crimes have indeed fallen more precipitously, but it remains a much more dangerous place, with 9,694 violent crimes committed, or 12 for every 1,000 residents.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Schundler, who is making his first run for statewide office, continues to make an effort to introduce himself and his philosophies to the voters of New Jersey. The ad conveys confidence, which is reinforced by upbeat piano background music. Mr. Schundler makes a pointed effort to portray himself as an advocate of good government and of the people. But while the ad is an effective introduction, this spot alone is not likely to seal a deal with voters who may want to hear more from Mr. Schundler on such salient issues as education and auto insurance.

HEADLINE: Q&A; 
A Head-On Collision Of Alien Cultures?

BYLINE:  Samuel Huntington, a political scientist at Harvard University, has argued that global politics will be dominated by a "clash of civilizations," most likely pitting the West against the Muslim world and other cultures. Michael Steinberger talked with him.

 BODY:
 Is this the clash of civilizations that you have been warning about nearly a decade? 
 Clearly Osama bin Laden wants it to be a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. The first priority for our government is to try to prevent it from becoming one. But there is a real danger that it could move in that direction. The administration has acted exactly the right way in attempting to rally support among Muslim governments and people. But there are great pressures here in the United States to attack other terrorist groups and states that support terrorist groups. And that, it seems to me, could broaden it into a clash of civilizations. 
Were you surprised the terrorists were all educated, middle-class individuals?
No. The people involved in fundamentalist movements, Islamic or otherwise, are often people with advanced educations. Most of them do not become terrorists, of course. But these are intelligent, ambitious young people who aspire to put their educations to use in a modern, developed economy, and they become frustrated by the lack of jobs, the lack of opportunity. They are cross-pressured as well by the forces of globalization and what they regard as Western imperialism and cultural domination. They are attracted to Western culture, obviously, but they are also repelled by it.
You have written that "Islam has bloody borders." What do you mean by this?
If you look around the borders of the Muslim world, you find that there are a whole series of local conflicts involving Muslims and non-Muslims: Bosnia, Kosovo, the Caucuses, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Kashmir, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, North Africa, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Muslims also fight Muslims, and much more than the people of other civilizations fight each other.
So are you suggesting that Islam promotes violence? 
I don't think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of roughly 16 and 30. During the 1960's, 70's and 80's there were high birthrates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birthrates are going down; in fact, they've dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don't think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology. Islam, like any great religion, can be interpreted in a variety of ways. People like bin Laden can seize on things in the Koran as commands to go out and kill the infidels. But the pope did exactly the same thing when he launched the Crusades. 
Should the United States do more to promote democracy and human rights in the Middle East?
It would be desirable but also difficult. In the Islamic world there is a natural tendency to resist the influence of the West, which is understandable given the long history of conflict between Islam and Western civilization. Obviously, there are groups in most Muslim societies that are in favor of democracy and human rights, and I think we should support those groups. But we then get into this paradoxical situation: many of the groups arguing against repression in those societies are fundamentalists and anti-American. We saw this in Algeria. Promoting democracy and human rights are very important goals for the United States, but we also have other interests. President Carter was deeply committed to promoting human rights, and when I served on his National Security Council, we had countless discussions about how to do this. But to the best of my recollection, nobody ever mentioned the idea of trying to promote human rights in Saudi Arabia, and for a very obvious reason. 
Apart from our closest allies, no country has lined up more solidly behind the United States than Russia. Is this the moment Russia turns decisively to the West?
Russia is turning to the West in these circumstances for pragmatic and ad hoc reasons. The Russians feel they are seriously threatened by Muslim terrorists and see it as in their interest to line up with the West and to gain some credit with the United States in hopes that we will reduce our push for NATO expansion into the Baltic states and missile defense. It's a coincidence of interests, but I don't think we should blow it up into a big realignment. I think, though, that they are very worried about the rise of China, and this will turn them to the West.
India and China, two countries that you said would be at odds with the United States, have joined in this war on terrorism. Instead of the West versus the rest, could the clash shape up to be Islam versus the rest?
Conceivably. You have Muslims fighting Westerners, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists. But one must also recognize that there are a billion Muslims in the world, stretching across the Eastern hemisphere from Western Africa to eastern Indonesia, and they interact with dozens of different people. So you might say they have more opportunity to clash with others.
The most frequent criticism leveled against you is that you portray entire civilizations as unified blocks. 
That is totally false. The major section on Islam in my book is called "Consciousness Without Cohesion," in which I talk about all the divisions in the Islamic world, about Muslim-on-Muslim fighting. Even in the current crisis, they are still divided. You have a billion people, with all these subcultures, the tribes. Islam is less unified than any other civilization. The problem with Islam is the problem Henry Kissinger expressed three decades ago with regard to Europe: "If I want to call Europe, what number do I call?" If you want to call the Islamic world, what number do you call? Islam may pose problems because it is less cohesive. If there was a dominant power in the Islamic world, you could deal with them. Now what you see is the different Islamic groups competing with each other.

HEADLINE: Rosie the Riveter In a New Generation; 
Military Industry Regains Self-Respect

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
In the heyday of the new economy, the Raytheon Company's military plant in the Southern California industrial town of Goleta was easy to ignore. Corporate mergers and cuts in military spending sliced the work force in half. There was little to keep employees loyal when Internet executives from nearby Santa Barbara came calling.
 "Some of our brethren have gone to the dot-coms," said John Bowen, a senior manager at Raytheon's Infrared Operations, which makes the technology for, among other things, night-vision goggles. 
 Indeed, said John Fennell, a manager of human resources, they could not compete with the fun-and-games work environment promised by the dot-coms. "It became not a sexy place to work," he said, "because we didn't have slides and beer on Fridays." 
Even though the Raytheon plant, which also makes decoys that lure enemy missiles away from American combat planes, is Santa Barbara County's sixth-largest employer, many people ignored its nondescript building and barely knew the company's name. 
But after Sept. 11, Raytheon workers in Goleta, about 100 miles up the coast from Los Angeles, are feeling a renewed sense of self-respect.
Executives are almost surprised by their newfound relevance. While Internet stocks have nose-dived and many Americans are worried about layoffs, Raytheon's Goleta office hopes to fill 150 positions in the next few years.
"It's an ability once more to show we are a stable, vital company," said Jack Saunders, acting general manager of Raytheon's Electronic Warfare Operations.
Something similar is being felt across Southern California, particularly in towns like Long Beach, where aircraft plants once dominated the landscape but have faded in importance in recent years. Many military contractors in the region scrambled over the last decade to transform themselves into anything else. Most notable was Hughes Electronics, which sold its military business to Raytheon in 1997 for $9.5 billion, and became a satellite and media company.
But companies that stuck with the Pentagon are seeing virtues in their old businesses and a revived sense of being needed. Some analysts are even predicting that military contractors here will prosper.
"I would call these companies both the hidden and reluctant beneficiaries of what's going on," said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Goldman, Sachs in New York. "It may not be in a lot of big stuff right away. It will be in parts and small stuff. But this elevates the prestige of the military back to where it should be."
Some of those who joined the exodus have even come back. Kris Brawn, a San Diego-based project manager for Northrop Grumman who works on software for the B-2 bomber, left his job two years ago for a finance-related dot-com, but returned in January after just 13 months.
"Coming back to a defense company gives me the opportunity to proactively make a difference," said Mr. Brawn, who also hated the long hours and time away from his family. And during times like these, he added, "at an Internet company you sit on the sidelines."
But it will never again be like it once was.
During and after World War II, Southern California suburbs blossomed to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of workers building and designing missiles, planes and other weapons. But when the cold war ended, many of those jobs withered away. Companies, in turn, became more streamlined.
In Los Angeles County, 113,000 people now work in aerospace and military jobs, a far cry from the 290,000 of 15 years ago, said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation.
As a result, military contracting in this new era of terrorist warfare will rebuild only gradually as the military turns to companies that offer products that meet specific needs, particularly in information and technology.
Among those expected to prosper is Northrop Grumman, which makes the Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance aircraft being built in Palmdale, Calif. The company acquired the technology when it bought Ryan Aeronautical, based in San Diego, in 1999.
The military has agreed to buy 60 Global Hawks in the next several years, and Northrop said it expected to hire 100 people to help with research and production.
But in all of Southern California, Long Beach has long been the psychological center of the once-thriving aerospace industry, in part because it benefited most from the World War II military buildup and the commercial jetliner business it spawned in the postwar era.
"If you didn't work on airplanes, you weren't anybody," said Jim Wieser, owner of the Thirsty Isle, a local bar where test pilots celebrated after successful flights, signing posters and drinking 34-ounce schooners of beer well past midnight.
From 1942 to 1945, Douglas Aircraft, which had substantial operations in Long Beach and merged with McDonnell Aircraft of St. Louis in 1967 to become McDonnell Douglas, built about 16 percent of all American planes, according to a company history. Wartime employment peaked at 160,000.
Among those workers was Bette Murphy, now 82, who started in 1942 -- one of the first women the company hired to work on the assembly line. She earned 60 cents an hour working on the B-17 bomber, which was used for daytime bombing raids. "They wanted me to go to the dispensary," she recalled. "I said, 'No, I want to build airplanes.' "
The hangar was camouflaged and soldiers with machine guns were stationed outside. "It was scary," she said. "We had gals from the farm, sales clerks, you name it. There was even a rumor going around we hired hookers from Pasadena."
She stayed at the company 37 years as neighborhoods sprouted around the manufacturing plants, which as recently as a decade ago still had 48,000 workers. But in a sign of changing times, the buildings where she first worked are scheduled to be torn down and the sites turned into high-technology or light-manufacturing operations. 
"Isn't that terrible?" she asked. "We are so proud. It really makes me sad."
Though much of that production is gone now, the Boeing Company, which bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997, is still the largest employer in Long Beach, with 13,000 workers. Near Highway 405, in a hangar large enough to hold 64 blimps and not far from Ms. Murphy's first factory job, Boeing workers now assemble the C-17 Globemaster III, a five-story-high cargo plane designed in the 1980's and heralded as the most versatile plane the Air Force flies today.
"I saw the first flight," said Steven Dunham, a 56-year-old engineer who joined Douglas Aircraft in 1966 and has stayed with the operation through all its twists and turns since. Mr. Dunham tested the stress on the wings of the first C-17, a plane once plagued by so many defects and cost overruns that the government threatened to scrap it.
In September 1991, Mr. Dunham, along with hundreds of workers, lined the runway listening to the control tower on hand-held radios as the plane readied for flight. "When it came zooming down the runway, it kind of gave me a chill," he said. And it still does. Every time a new plane leaves the hangar, Mr. Dunham heads out to the tarmac. And he is not the only one beaming with pride.
After recent news reports lauding the C-17, sales of shirts, hats and sweatshirts with the plane's logo and image soared at the Boeing shop. But engineers and workers are concerned about the future. Boeing recently announced that because of the attacks, it would lay off 30,000 people, many in commercial aircraft production. And some of those are likely to be in Long Beach.
Boeing said this week that it was considering shutting down operations for the 717, one of the company's least-profitable airplanes, which is built there. The Air Force, too, has yet to approve the production of 60 new C-17's.
"We are lobbying everyone," said Mr. Dunham, who is also president of the Southern California Professional Engineering Association. "Even with the reductions, we are going to fight. We are not going to go away."
That may be good news to Beverly O'Neill, the Long Beach mayor, who after watching the aerospace industry in town shrink to a shadow of its former self, has pursued other areas of growth -- helping tourism by expanding the convention center, shoring up the port for international trade and encouraging more retail stores and technology concerns.
"You can long for the past," she said, "but you have to have a sense of reality." 
Still, she has an even greater appreciation for those military workers who built communities like hers. "I hate to say it, but I hadn't been talking about the defense industry before Sept. 11," she said. "It has changed my thinking. This is something we have to protect because it is, in a way, about protecting ourselves."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SALES CAMPAIGN; 
Jet Makers Use Patriotic Theme in Final Bid for Government Contract

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
"The men and women who defend our nation's freedom are the best in the world," a radio advertisement now being broadcast in Washington says.
 The spot is not just an attempt to lift morale, however. "And they deserve the best equipment," it continues. "That is what the Boeing Joint Strike Fighter is all about." 
 The Boeing advertisement is the final pitch in a long and costly advertising and lobbying campaign to persuade the Pentagon to pick its aircraft over a model by Lockheed Martin. The winning prototype will secure the most lucrative military contract in history, the Joint Strike Fighter program estimated to be worth more than $200 billion.
The Boeing spot's patriotic undertones blend with the new mood on television and in advertising, from the "Keep America Rolling" automobile ads by General Motors to the red, white and blue peacock on the NBC logo.
But the direct promotion of military hardware could be jarring at a time when the country is under terrorist attack and at war in Afghanistan. To some, it sounds as though Boeing is taking advantage of a newly martial spirit to secure a Pentagon contract.
Or so its rival suggests. James Fetig, a Lockheed spokesman, said that Lockheed resumed running print ads for its own Joint Strike Fighter model in The Washington Post and trade publications on Monday, and only after it saw that Boeing was pressing ahead with radio and print ads.
"We didn't want to run advertising for military equipment that could look like we are seeking to profit from the tragedy," Mr. Fetig said, noting that Lockheed had pulled all its ads after Sept. 11. So had Boeing. Asked if enough time had passed to resume advertising, Mr. Fetig replied dryly, "Our competitor seems to think so."
Thomas R. Young, Boeing's director of advertising for military aircraft and missile systems, said that Boeing had halted its advertising campaign as "inappropriate" following the attacks, but resumed radio commercials on Oct. 3, and print advertisements in The Washington Post and The Washington Times Oct. 4 and 5. The Pentagon is scheduled to announce the winner of the contract next Friday, though a report by the Congress's General Accounting Office critical of the plane's technology raised the possibility of a delay. 
Mr. Young said that the radio spots and print advertisements did not exploit the crisis because "decision-makers already know that the fighter would not be ready in time to be of service in Afghanistan."
These days all advertisers tread on delicate ground. Most Americans have accepted the notion that buying is patriotic, a way to aid an imperiled economy. But the act of selling -- whether a product or company image -- remains more ambiguous.
A Washington lawyer who represents military contractors said that he has advised his clients to avoid aggressive advertising or litigation that could suggest to the public that they were focused on anything other than serving the nation.
For more than six years, Boeing and Lockheed have vied to produce a fighter-bomber that could replace aging aircraft in three services -- Air Force F-16's and A-10's, Navy F-14's and F-18's and Marine Corps Harriers -- as well as be used by the British Royal Navy and Air Force. The project calls for 3,000 new planes over 20 years.
Officials who helped initiate the fighter program did not seem offended by the rivals' last-ditch effort to push their prototypes.
"This is the biggest program in history and they can't resist playing up their benefits," said Jacques S. Gansler, a professor at the University of Maryland who was under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics during the Clinton administration.
"I am just not sure any of these ads will have an impact," Mr. Gansler added.
The Boeing radio advertisements, which were scheduled to start on Sept. 12 and were held back after the attacks until Oct. 3, do not directly refer to the terrorist attacks or to the retaliatory bombing in Afghanistan.
Still, some listeners in the Washington area said they thought there was a link. One reason could be that these days, any mention of the American military seems connected to the conflict in Afghanistan and at home.
Boeing's television commercials, also broadcast in the Washington area, do not mention the fighter. Instead, they are a salute to brave young men and women in uniform, a campaign that was actually produced six years ago.
Boeing changed some words of the narration and began broadcasting it after Sept. 20 to show its corporate solidarity with the war effort. The ad is a gauzy montage of images of soldiers and sailors; a female vocalist sings "America the Beautiful."
Before Sept. 11, Boeing had also broadcast TV commercials for its Joint Strike Fighter, placed mostly during Sunday-morning talk shows.
Anne Toulouse, director of corporate brand advertising at Boeing, said that after the attack, those ads were replaced with the salute to the men and women in uniform.
"We did an assessment three of four weeks ago and concluded that we had to be careful about a hard sell," Ms. Toulouse said. "The tone had to be very careful so the message is not misperceived."
Lockheed has also revived television ads that feature a similar tribute, a "Salute to the Armed Forces" -- which also combines images of military personnel, somber words and stirring music -- that was originally produced to celebrate Armed Forces Day.
"Whatever you think of defense contractors, we are very patriotic people," Mr. Fetig said.
Mr. Young of Boeing concurred.
"Any company, ours or Lockheed, has a lot of former military people in it," he said. "They have a pretty good feel for what is appropriate."

The First Ground Strikes, Hints of Terrorism to Come

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
The anthrax scare has so dominated Americans' consciousness that it was almost possible for a while to overlook the war in Afghanistan. But the harsh reality of combat returned in a rush with the start of American ground operations in and around Kandahar, a city in southern Afghanistan where the Taliban rulers and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network are strongest.
 More than 100 Army Rangers and other special forces swooped down by helicopter on at least one main military target. Two American military personnel were killed in a helicopter accident related to the mission as the helicopter returned to its base in Pakistan. It was not clear what their targets were -- a Taliban stronghold, a bin Laden camp or something else entirely. But military officials said the assault's size was intended to send a psychological and political signal. 

TOUGH NEW TASK -- But as air raids continued, this land operation signaled an important new phase. So did the disclosure that a small number of American special forces were already in southern Afghanistan, trying to organize an effective resistance to the Taliban. The main opposition is concentrated in the north, but from the United States' perspective, the south needs work.
And the task in that part of the country will not be easy, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned, saying that the anti-Taliban forces there are not yet strong enough either to bring down the government or to run down Mr. bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda. The Taliban are tough and they are "survivors," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "It would be unwise to think that the outcome is determined," he said. "It's not."
President Bush monitored the attack from Shanghai, where he was attending an economic conference, and said he had "near unanimous" support from Pacific Rim nations for both the military action in Afghanistan and his broader war against terrorism. On this presidential trip, China agreed to share intelligence on terrorist groups. But American officials said they were unsure how much that promise was really worth.

ANTICIPATING TERRORISM -- There was important intelligence from elsewhere, though, and the news was ominous. Officials in six countries in Europe and the Middle East said that based on intercepted communications among bin Laden associates and other tools, they are convinced that more terrorist attacks are coming. They had yet to connect the recent anthrax letters in the United States to Al Qaeda, these officials said, but even if they were Mr. bin Laden's work, new episodes of terrorism can be expected.
Two more cases of anthrax came to light -- a worker at The New York Post and a postal carrier near Trenton. The total number of infected Americans now stands at eight, including a Florida man who died.
Given that several thousand people have been tested with negative results, the small number of actual cases could be considered good news. Then again, through the entire 20th century in this country, there were only 18 known instances of inhalation anthrax, the most severe form of the disease. From that vantage, the current news is far from cheery.
There were also signs that anthrax spores may have spread to other countries, including Kenya, Argentina and Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, the offices of The New York Times received a letter, postmarked New York City, that tested positive for anthrax traces.

ANSWERS AND QUESTIONS -- One potentially important conclusion was announced in Washington by Tom Ridge, director of homeland security. Letters sent to NBC News in New York, to the Florida offices of a supermarket tabloid and to the office of the Senate majority leader all seemed to share the same strains of the anthrax bacteria. In other words, all may have come from a single source, though that source is still unknown.
A few days ago, the majority leader, Tom Daschle, said he had been told by law enforcement officials that the anthrax mailed to his office was very potent and could infect many people. Now, federal officials are saying that the anthrax found in his office did not seem to be a very high-grade type restricted to military use. Was Mr. Daschle's early account wrong? It was not clear.
More certain, however, was the public unease. There were continuing runs on Cipro, the popular antibiotic for anthrax -- even as far away as Tijuana, Mexico. But there was no sign, federal scientists cautioned, that the anthrax seen thus far had the properties of an effective biological weapon. "It's a weapon of mass hysteria," one scientist said, "not mass destruction."

Who the Afghans Are and What Motivates Them: A Reading List

 BODY:
Suddenly Afghanistan, a country that few Americans are familiar with, has been thrust centerstage. Arts & Ideas asked five experts for their pick of the best book on the country.
 Larry P. Goodson, an associate professor of international studies at Bentley College and the author of "Afghanistan's Endless War: State Failure, Regional Politics, and the Rise of the Taliban". 
 Ahmed Rashid's "Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia," although redundantly subtitled, is my favorite reference on the Taliban movement. Richly detailed, the book grows out of Rashid's more than two decades of reporting from the region. No book provides as much insight into the Taliban movement's rise and success, including chapters on its religious ideology, organizational structure, heroin economy, policies toward women and shadowy support for Osama bin Laden and the "Arab Afghans." 
His portraits of Afghan leaders whose names are now in the headlines are especially striking, with the recently assassinated Ahmed Shah Masud portrayed as a brilliant and vital "master of guerrilla warfare" adored by his men; the Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum as a "hard-drinking bear of a man" who has criminals crushed under tank tracks, and the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar as shy, reclusive and decidedly uncharismatic. This is a must read for anyone wanting to understand America's new war.
David B. Edwards, professor of anthropology at Williams College and the author of "Before Taliban: Genealogies of the Afghan Jihad".
As we contemplate the entry of American troops into Afghanistan, it is worthwhile to recall three books that tell the story of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from the soldiers' point of view. Svetlana Alexievich's "Zinky Boys" (the term comes from the zinc coffins in which the bodies of Soviet soldiers were returned home) is a composite oral history of the war in the style of Studs Terkel. "Afghan Tales" by Oleg Yermakov is a collection of short stories dealing with the experiences of Soviet boys growing up at war, while "The Hidden War" by Artyom Borovik is a journalist's memoir that brings to mind the gritty irreverence of Michael Herr's "Dispatches" from the Vietnam War. And if the incompetent commanders, elusive enemy, unnecessary fatalities and frustrated libidos, seem all too familiar to American readers, the stories remind us that there have always been human as well as strategic costs for those who have chosen the course of intervention in Afghanistan.
Barnett R. Rubin, director of studies at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University and the author of "The Fragmentation of Afghanistan" and "The Search for Peace in Afghanistan". 
The French scholar Olivier Roy has written several books that address various aspects of the current crisis. "Afghanistan: From Holy War to Civil War" analyzes how Islamic mujahidin turned into ethnic warlords, paving the way for the rise of the Taliban. Anyone who wants to understand the danger of destroying the Taliban without a plan for political succession should read this book. "The Failure of Political Islam" generalizes this analysis to the whole Muslim world and also provides a unique account of the involvement of Arabs -- including Osama bin Laden -- in the Afghan war. Sayed Askar Mousavi's book "The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study" provides a rare evaluation of Afghan society and history from the perspective of the Hazara ethnic group. This predominantly Shia group from the Central Highlands of Afghanistan has formed the country's underclass and been victimized repeatedly by Pashtun-dominated governments, including the Taliban. As Mr. Mousavi make clear, however, the Tajik elements of the so-called Northern Alliance also fought and even massacred Hazaras in Kabul. This book shows both how problematic Afghanistan is as a nation, and yet how committed to that nation's existence even its most oppressed ethnic group remains.
Margaret A. Mills, professor of Near Eastern languages and cultures at Ohio State University and author of "Rhetorics and Politics in Afghan Traditional Storytelling".
Peter Marsden's book "The Taliban: War, Religion and the New Order in Afghanistan succinctly reviews Afghanistan's history and complex ethic and linguistic map, then situates the rise of the Taliban in the context of Islamic reform and revival movements of the modern era and the emergent politics of the anti-Soviet and civil wars. 
Benedicte Grima's "Performance of Emotion Among Paxtun Women" is one of the very few extended studies of Pashtun women. The Pashtun (or Pathan, or Pakhtun, or Paxtun) ethnic group predominates among the Taliban and in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province, where Ms. Grima conducted her research. Drawing on the words of Pashtun women who tell her their life histories, she argues that a powerful ethic of forbearance severely limits traditional Pashtun's women's ability to mitigate the suffering they acknowledge in their lives.
Ashraf Ghani, adjunct professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University. 
War, gender discrimination, drugs and religious extremism are the images that are now dominantly associated with Afghanistan. In "Three Women of Herat," Veronica Doubleday describes the lives of three ordinary women in the provincial city of Herat in the 1970's. She demonstrates the place of music in Afghan society and the aspirations of ordinary people for a decent life. "The Fragmentation of Afghanistan" by Barnett R. Rubin is a monumental study of events from 1978 to 1995. He brings comparative knowledge, detailed empirical analysis and a graceful style to communicate the complexities of Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Ford Motor Cancels Program To Give PC's toIts Employees 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company today canceled its program to give employees personal computers as the company tries to reduce expenses because of slowing sales and financial losses.
 Ford had distributed about 166,000 personal computers and printers to employees from February 2000 until the end of May, when the program was deferred until the fourth quarter. At the time, Ford said there had been questions about how the giveaway affected taxes for workers in different nations. 
 Ford's United States vehicle sales fell 11 percent this year through September, twice the industrywide decline. The company this week reported a third-quarter loss of $692 million, its second consecutive loss. Vehicle demand has fallen this year from a record in 2000 because of a slowing American economy.
 "The economic situation is substantially different than when we launched" the program, said a Ford spokesman, Peter Olsen. "This is one of the programs that came under review for cost-cutting."
 The computers were distributed mostly to employees in the United States and the Philippines, with limited distribution to workers in Britain and Venezuela, he said. Employees were also provided Internet access at a reduced charge of $5 a month. Employees who received computers will retain the cheap access, Mr. Olsen said.
 Ford provided the computers and access through PeoplePC Inc., which is based in San Francisco. 
 When Ford announced the plan, it said it needed employees to be skilled on the Internet. "Individuals and companies that want to be successful in the 21st century will need to be leaders in using the Internet and related technology," Ford's chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., said last year.
 Shares of the Dearborn-based company fell 26 cents, to $16.51. They have declined 30 percent this year. PeoplePC shares, which rose 3 cents, to 14 cents, have lost 81 percent of their value.

A Bush Admirer Longs to Join America's A-List

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has never made a state secret of his political crush on the American president, George W. Bush.
 Or of his disappointment when Mr. Bush did not think to put Italy on the list of countries, including Britain, France and Canada, that he thanked for their support on the day the bombing of Afghanistan began. (Mr. Berlusconi, who is famous for taking his politics personally, was said to have been beside himself.) While the leaders of A-list allies got calls from Mr. Bush, Mr. Berlusconi had to hear about the American-led military action from Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 This week, after some prodding from the Italian ambassador to Washington, Ferdinando Salleo, Mr. Berlusconi was at last received at the White House. 
"You can see, when you look at a man and a woman together, or at two men, if they're in touch," said Mr. Berlusconi's spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, who was along on the trip. Mr. Bush and Mr. Berlusconi, he reported, "have that look of being in touch."
After returning to Italy, Mr. Berlusconi promptly announced that a pro-American rally would be held here on Nov. 10 -- an idea widely criticized by the right as well as the left.
Mr. Berlusconi apparently feels otherwise, after a state visit to the United States that many in the Italian press found woundingly short on pomp.
He has strategic reasons to bond with Mr. Bush. "He feels left out with Social Democrats in charge" across most of Europe, one Western diplomat noted, "and this is one way to counterbalance that."
He is also under fire for his recent comment that Western civilization is superior to Islam. Today, protesters pelted Mr. Berlusconi's car with eggs as he arrived at a European Union summit meeting in Belgium, whose foreign minister recently said on television that he would give Mr. Berlusconi a zero, on a scale of 1 to 10, for his leadership since the Sept. 11 attacks.
With Europe so hostile to him, no wonder Mr. Berlusconi seeks solace in America. La Repubblica reported that, "George Bush finally made the time to meet the Italian premier, who would have liked to have been greeted with far more solemnity." Corriere della Sera ran a cartoon of Mr. Berlusconi reciting Walt Whitman's "O Captain! My Captain!" to Mr. Bush.
"It's a one-way relationship," said James Walston, a professor of political science at the American University of Rome. "It's embarrassing."
One reason for the low-key reception in Washington, of course, was precisely Mr. Berlusconi's recent comments about the West and Islam.
In some ways, Mr. Berlusconi's frustration is not that new. Italy is the world's sixth-largest economy and a sophisticated Western democracy, but because of its history of revolving-door governments, it has had difficulty being taken with the seriousness and respect it feels it deserves.
After Mr. Berlusconi, who is Italy's richest man, was not invited to a meeting of French, British and German leaders just before today's summit meeting, he showed how much he minded. At a news conference, he said he could not have fit the meeting into his schedule anyway, because he had a previous engagement with center-right leaders from Spain, Austria, and Luxembourg.
Of that group, he boasted that he was "the leader of the most important country."
Mr. Walston said that for both Mr. Berlusconi and Italy, "the preoccupation is, 'Why don't we count more?' " 
Mr. Bush did tell reporters at his joint appearance with Mr. Berlusconi earlier this week that: "I'm pleased to be able to give him a lunch. After all, I had one of the best lunches I've had since I've been the president because of the prime minister." A Berlusconi aide said he was fondly recalling the tricolored pasta in the red, white and green of the Italian flag, prepared by Mr. Berlusconi's personal chef during Mr. Bush's visit to Rome last summer.
Giulio Ferrara, editor of the newspaper Il Foglio, who first suggested the idea of a pro-American demonstration, said his friend Mr. Berlusconi "likes the plain speaking of Mr. Bush, including the gaffes from time to time. That's the bridge between them."
In an interview during his campaign last spring, Mr. Berlusconi was self-mocking about his admiration for all things American: "I am on whatever side America is on, even before I know what it is."
He had been widely criticized in Europe even before the remarks about Islam, particularly over his handling of antiglobalization protests in Genoa, where the police shot and killed one young demonstrator.
The Italian prime minister's pro-American agenda also leaves him at least theoretically vulnerable to criticism at home, where he is popular but America is not. "The main feeling here is anti-American," said his friend Paolo Guzzanti. "The left here thinks the only good Americans are Woody Allen and the Kennedys."

Building on Prosperity

BYLINE:  By Bill Keller

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
THE last time George W. Bush visited China, it was 1975 and he was just out of business school. His father was ambassador to Beijing. The son found the country unbearably drab and yearned to go back to Texas and seek his fortune. The few sentences he devoted to that youthful experience in his 1999 campaign biography have been mocked as evidence of his incurious nature and his knack for the obvious, but reading them here this week, I was struck by something else. His unsophisticated reaction to China as a young man -- apparently unchanged as he packaged his life story for the electorate two years ago -- coincided closely with what the Chinese say about themselves today. Mr. Bush took no notice of political or religious repression or the explosive question of Taiwan. He did not suggest that China might be tamed by American pressure.
 His bottom line was the bottom line: "My visit underscored my belief in the power and promise of the marketplace, and deepened my belief that by introducing capitalism and the marketplace, China will free her people to dream and risk." 
 Mr. Bush's return to China this week is, in a sense, a return to the rest of the world. Since Sept. 11 he has been focused, naturally, on mobilizing the world against fundamentalist terror, and he has kept terrorism the headline subject here at his meetings with Asian leaders. But the attack on America has also made the president and his public more attentive students of the globe, silenced the lone-superpower arrogance that marked his first months, enhanced his administration's stature abroad and created new opportunities.
A few months ago our China theology seemed to be in the hands of those Republican pessimists who regard China as the next great threat to American interests. Now, suddenly, American diplomacy seems to be moving more in the spirit of that 29-year-old Harvard M.B.A.
Shanghai is as powerful an endorsement as Mr. Bush could want for his belief in the curative effects of the marketplace. With its peacock skyscrapers, its neon-spangled shopping malls and its Nokia-packing middle class, it is a vibrant contrast to the colorless place Mr. Bush remembered. Compared to the third-world life of rural China, or even the ant-farm bustle of Beijing, Shanghai is a tidy theme-park China. If this city does not represent what China is, it represents what China desperately wants to be.
Young Chinese from the prospering class remind me a bit of George Bush circa 1975, minus the party-animal quality. They are self-absorbed and materialistic. They are devout believers in the global marketplace. They are reflexively nationalistic -- that's the word we use for the other guy's patriotism -- and insulted at the idea that another country would preach to them about internal affairs. They look upon political boat-rockers as trouble. They were children when the government crushed the democracy uprising in Tiananmen Square and, grotesque as this may seem, many think the government was right.
They regard the Communist Party as corrupt and ideologically bankrupt, but necessary for now. They imagine that what would replace it in the near term would be worse -- and certainly bad for business. They see eventual unification with the island of Taiwan as a birthright. They trust that economic development will, in time, lead to political freedoms, as it has already led to expanded personal freedoms, but they are in no hurry. As one accounting student at the Ivy-League Fudan University happily reported: "We don't talk about politics. We talk about the job market."
Although tens of thousands of their peers pursue U.S. degrees, their sense of America seems as superficial as the American sense of their world. "All we know is McDonald's and Hollywood," a young journalist said.
That distance helps explain the unofficial, and dishearteningly ambivalent, Chinese reaction to the attacks on America. A lot of people think that the United States had it coming, that the country that bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and sent spy planes to play chicken along the Chinese coast deserved to be brought down a notch. At the notice board in one school here, a poster materialized on Sept. 12 with "U.S.A." crossed out and "Who's next? Japan!" written in. There is also low-grade anxiety that our campaign in Afghanistan is a grab for strategic advantage in a region that sits astride Caspian Sea oil and on China's western flank.
The first sentiment may be callous and the second paranoid, but neither should be dismissed. They mirror views held in powerful precincts of the Chinese military and Communist Party. And, like the far more virulent antipathy in the streets of the Islamic world, they represent popular feelings that even authoritarian rulers ignore at their peril. 
You don't have to look far for what could have inspired the bristling resentment of American power. The hostile bluster toward China in the first half of this year convinced even a lot of levelheaded Americans that Mr. Bush had decided to make China the new bogeyman. Our new defense strategy shifts the emphasis toward a potential enemy in Asia -- guess who? -- and puts a premium on an antimissile defense scheme that, on paper, would neuter China's nuclear deterrent. In the minds of Mr. Bush's most hawkish advisers, in fact, the really exciting prospect of missile defense is not that it would protect the United States from a rogue nuke but that it would give us a free hand to move in defense of Taiwan.
THE relationship had been growing more civil in the past few months. Americans were pleased when China returned not only the crew of the downed spy plane, but the plane itself in pieces large enough to be reassembled. The Chinese were charmed when Colin Powell visited in July. Presidents Bush and Jiang chat on the hot line. Then Sept. 11, by moving America's cross hairs to a new target, brought a startling change. China has rhetorically enlisted in the war on terror, helped stiffen the spine of its ally Pakistan and offered quiet intelligence help. Mr. Jiang has pointedly not raised in public his generals' uneasiness with the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. This is not exactly Tony Blair's dispatching of British commandos, but the Americans are grateful. They take these as real concessions from a Chinese leader who is trying to orchestrate a succession in the face of some strong nationalist resistance.
"Jiang's got his neck out here," said a senior member of the Bush entourage, adopting the newly sympathetic tone that makes China pessimists cringe. There is fresh hope that China will finally keep its overdue promise to stop the proliferation of missile technology in the region, and that in return the U.S. will let China back into the lucrative business of launching our satellites into space. 
This budding rapprochement will be tested by the president's determination to bull ahead on missile defense and by the course of economic reform here. Even the more sanguine China-watchers see a possibility of domestic turmoil as China opens its state-protected farms, factories and banks to the shock of foreign competition. On our side, while President Bush will no longer have Jesse Helms howling anti-Chinese invective from the Senate, there is still a deep reserve of skepticism in the Pentagon, a well-oiled Taiwan lobby and a vociferous Capitol Hill constituency for China-bashing.
American presidents usually take awhile to get a fix on China. Even the first President Bush, more credentialed in geopolitics than any president of this century, missed the significance of Tiananmen Square in the first year of his presidency and was tone-deaf to the outrage it stirred in America. 
The younger Bush sounds as if he wants to shape a relationship based on the same premise that prompted Mr. Jiang in July to invite capitalists into the Communist Party: that the best hope of bringing China fully into the club of civilized nations is to make prosperity the national religion. Some of Mr. Bush's more conservative followers will scoff that, like the President's new friendship with Vladimir Putin, this is an example of faith-based foreign policy. But betting on China's becoming a menace is a good way to make it one. If the new respect endures and grows, Mr. Bush will have salvaged a great good from a great tragedy.
Several readers have pointed out that George C. Marshall was not, as my Oct. 6 column put it, "the last four-star secretary of state." That phrase overlooked both Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. and General Marshall's fifth star.

HEADLINE: No Way to Boost the Economy 

 BODY:
The first item on the House agenda next week will be the Republican leadership's economic stimulus bill. Nobody doubts the need for an economic transfusion of some sort. But this bill is not the right way to achieve it. Even the Bush administration has expressed doubts. Paul O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, described the measure as partly "show business." And while the White House rebuked Mr. O'Neill for his apostasy, President Bush himself is said to have misgivings about adding a huge new layer of tax cuts to those already enacted. 
 Since the package is expected to be passed by the House, it will be up to the Senate to produce an alternative that is efficient, temporary, safe and equitable -- virtues in which the House bill is almost wholly deficient. The legislators can begin by ridding the bill of provisions that have little or no chance of reviving the economy any time soon. 
 For example, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, at a cost of $25 billion in 2002, would not guarantee a single cent of new investment. It would simply give money to businesses that usually find a way to elude taxes through deductions and loopholes anyway. Indeed, misdirected corporate tax breaks could even hamper growth by reducing corporate taxes on the state level, forcing states that are required by law to balance their budgets to cut spending. Lower spending would hinder economic recovery.
The bill would create another short-term danger by lowering tax rates on capital gains held more than one year but less than five years. If investors took advantage of the lower tax rates and sold shares to raise cash, share prices would drop. Private wealth would fall, at least on paper, and consumers would spend less. Both Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, have warned of this possibility.
The package would also pose a threat to the economy's long-term fiscal health. Only two of the bill's 15 tax-related initiatives would expire after 2002. The Treasury would lose a stunning $60 billion in tax revenues -- almost 40 percent of the bill's cost -- in 2003 or later, when the economy should already have recovered. The resulting deficit would drive up long-term interest rates across the entire economy, stunting growth.
Apart from its economic flaws, the measure is flat-out unfair. Of the $54 billion in accelerated tax cuts, every penny would go to the top 30 percent of taxpayers. Half would go to the top 5 percent. Eighty percent of the benefits from the capital gains tax cuts would go to the top 2 percent of households. Only one tax cut, a supplemental rebate for people who paid less than $300 in income taxes this year, would directly help poor and working-class Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that just $2.3 billion of the $100 billion the bill pledges for the stimulus in 2002 would be spent to lengthen cash and health benefits for unemployed workers. Sadly, these groups are the ones most likely to spend and stimulate the economy. They suffer the most during recessions, yet the Republican leadership wants to help them least.
The nation needs a stimulus package that will send money where it is needed most. That might include increasing unemployment benefits through federal subsidies. Existing federal investment programs in high-return areas like education and infrastructure could be accelerated. Any other tax breaks for corporations should be aimed only at new investments that were unplanned or unscheduled -- not just unused -- before Sept. 11. And to minimize the effect on the nation's finances, all these initiatives should expire after 2002.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: PRESIDENTIAL TRIP; 
BUSH MEETS JIANG

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush said here today that "support is near unanimous" among Pacific Rim nations for both the military strikes in Afghanistan and the broader war he has declared against terrorism. But to cement the antiterror coalition, he spent his first day in China playing down a series of contentious issues with his hosts and with the president of South Korea.
 At a joint news conference this morning with President Jiang Zemin of China, Mr. Bush made no mention of his missile defense plans, which China has opposed, and alluded only briefly to differences with Beijing over Taiwan, China's military buildup and its treatment of dissidents. 
 The Chinese, perhaps wary of how the first meeting with a new American president would play out, did not broadcast the news conference live, and when excerpts finally ran on local television tonight, they were edited to remove any hint of criticism of Chinese policy. 
The meetings with Mr. Jiang, a prelude to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum beginning on Saturday, included formal talks earlier today and lunch at a Communist Party guest house on the edge of Shanghai. Officials familiar with those closed sessions described the interaction between the two leaders as gracious but without much warmth. And it was unclear whether China's promise to share intelligence on terrorist groups would prove of much value.
"This wasn't like the first meeting with Putin," a senior official said tonight, referring to Mr. Bush's declaration that he had looked into the eyes of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and seen a man he could trust. "It was quite scripted."
Mr. Bush's declaration that Asian countries had overwhelmingly endorsed his strategy came as his aides were trying to toughen language in a statement on terrorism scheduled to be issued on Saturday by the Asia-Pacific forum, the loose group of 21 nations meeting here. It is not known for taking bold stances, except on trade.
The statement, as now drafted, condemns terrorism but makes no mention of the American airstrikes on Afghanistan, at the insistence of Muslim nations like Indonesia and Malaysia that have backed Mr. Bush's declared campaign on terrorism but not the military action against the ruling Taliban.
Today, Mr. Jiang ignored a reporter's question about whether China endorses the Afghanistan operation. Still, administration officials insist that the forum document gives them the support they need. 
Later in the afternoon, meeting South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, Mr. Bush publicly voiced support for the Nobel Peace laureate's "sunshine policy" of engagement with North Korea. Mr. Bush's refusal to do so at a first meeting six months ago at the White House opened a rift between the United States and South Korea. It also revealed the division in the administration between those who wanted a harder line on Communist North Korea and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who argued for a policy of engagement similar to the one pursued by President Clinton. 
After a administration review of Korea policy, Mr. Powell won the argument. Today Mr. Bush declared that "my administration wishes to begin a dialogue with the government of Kim Jong Il," the secretive North Korean leader, and noted that Mr. Kim had not responded.
But while other leaders here had a variety of agendas -- Mr. Putin answered questions about the Russian economy, and many others worried about strategies to restore global economic growth -- Mr. Bush would not be diverted from his focus on terrorism.
"I've come to Shanghai because China and other Asia Pacific nations are important partners in the global coalition against terror," he said.
His words seemed in response to those Republicans who worried he should not be out of Washington at a time of war and anthrax attacks.
This was his first trip abroad since the Sept. 11 terror attacks in New York and Washington, and today one of his senior advisers, Karen Hughes, acknowledged that a number of days ago the White House reconsidered the question of whether to come here at all.
She said "the president concluded that it was very important that he come to make the case" for joining the counterterrorism coalition. 
Mr. Bush got a good deal of what he wanted. President Kim of South Korea praised him warmly for "his calm composure and his very wise decisions in bringing together, first of all, the people of America so that they will be able to effectively fight this war against terrorism." Mr. Kim promised to give the counterterrorism effort South Korea's full support, with his aides adding that the biggest contribution the South could make is nudging the North into reforms that would get it off the State Department's list of nations that support terrorism.
Mr. Bush kept a light schedule here, retreating to his hotel by midafternoon to meet with his aides and make calls back to Washington. He talked several times by phone with his new director of homeland defense, Tom Ridge, and received intelligence updates amid reports, which he declined to confirm at the news conference, that American special forces were on the ground in Afghanistan.
He also raised the possibility that the anthrax scares in the United States were a case of domestic terrorism, though he said he simply did not have evidence about the source. 
"Anybody in America who will use this opportunity to threaten our citizens, will think it's funny as a hoax to put out some kind of threat, will be held accountable and will be prosecuted," he told reporters.
The president was particularly artful in sidestepping the most difficult issues between them. He and Mr. Jiang never discussed the collision last spring of an American surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter. But Mr. Jiang mentioned Taiwan twice, saying the United States must deal with the issue "in accordance with the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques," which bolster the one-China policy that both Republican and Democrats have upheld for nearly three decades.
Mr. Bush said little about Taiwan in public, though a senior administration official who sat in on the closed meetings said he had reaffirmed the one-China policy and then moved on to other subjects.
Mr. Bush also briefly told Mr. Jiang that the American missile defense plan was intended to protect against attacks from rogue states and terrorists, not "multiple launches" from a national arsenal. Mr. Jiang never responded, the official said.
That seemed a somewhat perfunctory review of what may well prove the most contentious issue between the two nations, with China saying it plans to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal if it feels the missile defense plan undercuts its own minimum deterrent. Bush administration officials say China was already planning that modernization process years ago. 
Similarly, Mr. Bush raised, at least in public, almost none of the long list of human rights abuses in China that the State Department catalogs annually. He did, however, say the fight against terrorism "must never be an excuse to persecute minorities," apparently referring to the Chinese actions against Uighur separatists and others who have resisted government control. The administration has been concerned that Mr. Jiang would use the battle against terrorism to justify repression in China's western regions, including near its border with Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: The New Young Turks 

BYLINE:  By Fernanda Eberstadt; Fernanda Eberstadt's most recent novel is "When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth."

 BODY:
 CRESCENT AND STAR
Turkey Between Two Worlds.
By Stephen Kinzer.
252 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
 Stephen Kinzer came to Turkey in 1996 as the New York Times bureau chief in Istanbul after an intensive stint in Central America. Pessimistic Turks will tell you that Latin America provides an ideal background for understanding Turkey -- a country plagued by coups, earthquakes, a boom-bust economy and a guerrilla war that has killed tens of thousands of conscripts and civilians and flooded the cities with dispossessed peasants. 
Yet colonialism cannot be blamed for Turkey's griefs, unlike Latin America's. Until the Ottoman defeat in World War I, Turks were masters of an empire that in its prime included much of the Middle East, the Crimea, North Africa, Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Turkish schoolchildren are taught that their ancestors were Mongol horsemen, but in fact most Turks you meet boast a Georgian, Macedonian or Kurdish grandparent, and genetic anthropologists are discovering that the contemporary Anatolian gene pool owes less to Turkic invaders than to the earlier populations they conquered. As a consequence of their multiethnic past and 600-year European presence, Turks have long been seized by a collective identity crisis known as the "East-West debate," a sense, as Kinzer explains in "Crescent and Star," his lively account of Turkey in the late 1990's, of remaining between two worlds.
The psychonational ambiguities are multifold. Although its present-day population is 99 percent Muslim, the country has enjoyed uneasy relations with its Arab and Iranian neighbors -- indeed, it is symptomatic of Turkey's anomalousness that its best friend in the region it once ruled has been Israel. Yet although educated Turks may consider themselves Western -- after all, the Europe-Asia line runs through downtown Istanbul -- few European leaders appear willing to return the compliment. The European Union, to whose progenitor Turkey first applied for associate membership in 1959, postponed the country's candidacy decade after decade, judging it unassimilably poor, authoritarian and, one suspects, Muslim. Where, then, is Turkey's rightful home? 
Kemal Ataturk, republican Turkey's founder, believed he had answered this question decisively. To Ataturk, Turkey's sole salvation lay in joining Western civilization, with its premium on reason, equality of the sexes and technological advance. Ataturk abolished the sultanate and the caliphate, outlawed the fez and the veil, imposed Swiss civil law in the place of Shariah, or Islamic law, and substituted the Latin alphabet for Ottoman Arabic script, thus cutting off Turks from the glories of their written past. As he once drily told an American reporter, "I am dictating democracy to my people."
Present-day Turkey is a fast-changing country with areas of immense sophistication and entrepreneurial drive, yet its admirers are sometimes thankful that Ataturk's efforts to convert the Ottoman pasha into a European technocrat were only partly successful. Most Turks appear to have retained a hierarchy of values in which pleasure, tranquillity, respect, openhandedness and family loyalty are at least as prominent as money or career. Kinzer is alive to the delights of so convivial a culture, taking us on an enthusiastic tour of narghile, or water pipe, salons and bar-restaurants overlooking the Bosporus called meyhanes, where Turks drink raki and eat melon and sing along to the mournful tunes of a gypsy band. We meet fighting-camel owners, Kurdish mountaineers, women medical students too pious to shake the author's hand. Best of all, Kinzer introduces us to one of the greatest of 20th-century poets, Nazim Hikmet (1902-1963), a Communist who spent most of his adult life in Turkish jails and died in Moscow, whose passionately patriotic verse was banned in his homeland for years. 
Kinzer revels in the generous contradictions of a country in which cybernet yuppies have evil-eye amulets dangling from the rearview mirrors of their BMW's, and Courvoisier-swilling prime ministers belong to mystical dervish sects. But he is continually frustrated by Turkey's inability to achieve its democratic potential. Turks have been "taught since time immemorial that authority is something distant and irresistible, and that the role of the individual in society is submission." The consequence is an abysmal gap between those who are elected and those who rule. 
Up front, Turkey is governed by squabbling opportunists, many of them the same mediocrities who have been plunging the country into disaster since the Cyprus invasion in 1974. Behind these tired front men, Kinzer explains, are the generals who run the National Security Council: a ruling elite convinced that without its intervention the republic would be dismantled by Kurdish secessionists, militant imams or Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries. When they decide the national politicians are making a mess, the generals step in and restore order.
It is the book's subtlest accomplishment to do justice to Turkey's military. "The average general is better educated, more worldly and in some ways more liberal than the average politician," Kinzer writes. "Unlike many civilian politicians, the generals do not take bribes or extort money from contractors. When they retire they do not live in mansions, and their children do not attend expensive schools or drive flashy cars. Instead they set an example of probity and expect everyone in uniform to follow it." But if Turkey's military elite has retained many of the Ataturkist virtues, it has also made Ataturk's failings permanent and defining features of the state -- his indifference to the economy, his tendency to regard citizens as subjects, opposition as treason and any assertions of religious or alternate ethnic identity as threats to Turkey's territorial integrity. 
Today, it is a crime frequently prosecuted to express ideas or even think thoughts that "run counter to . . . the historical and moral values of Turkishness, or the nationalism, principles, reforms and modernism of Ataturk." It is also a crime for a political party to suggest "that minorities exist in the Turkish Republic based on national, religious, confessional, racial or language differences." 
Despite international prodding, improving human rights does not appear to have a high priority for the Turkish state: torture by the police remains endemic; detainees disappear; government-paid assassins operate freely; editors, academics, religious leaders and members of Parliament are tried for what less thin-skinned countries might consider an opinion. Istanbul's last mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a young Islamic firebrand who probably will rule the country some day, though not known as an aesthete, served four months in prison for reciting a poem.
One of the destructive effects of the "devlet baba," or "daddy state," has been to keep both politicians and electorate immature. Thus Necmettin Erbakan, who became prime minister in 1996 (and was persuaded by the military to resign a year later in what has been described as Turkey's first "postmodern coup"), can propose forming an Islamic NATO and raising a campaign to capture Jerusalem. Or Osman Durmus, the far-right Nationalist Action party's minister of health, who contributed to the political debacle following the 1999 earthquake by suggesting that victims should refuse Greek blood and Armenian medicine.
To me, the most depressing story in "Crescent and Star" is of the disco-loving antiques dealer who, Kinzer discovers, intends to vote for the Welfare Party, an Islamic party that has since been abolished. But what if they really do create an Islamic state? Kinzer asks. Don't worry, the young man replies, if they try anything serious, the generals will throw them out. These are a bulimic's politics, where you can gorge yourself on dervish demagogues because you know the army is ready to stick its finger down your throat.
But if Turkey is its own worst enemy, luckily it has friends like Kinzer. Recent histories like Nicole and Hugh Pope's "Turkey Unveiled" offer a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of the country. But for painstakingly honest advice as to what needs fixing in order for Turkey yet to become "a light unto the nations," "Crescent and Star" cannot be beat.

 DUGAN UNDER GROUND
By Tom De Haven.
286 pp. New York:
Metropolitan Books/
Henry Holt & Company. $25.
 THESE are the sunset years of the Greatest Generation of American cartoonists, those hardy men of World War II vintage whose strips and panels dominated the newspaper funny pages over the last half-century. Charles Schulz and Hank Ketcham, of "Peanuts" and "Dennis the Menace" fame, have recently left us; Mort Walker of "Beetle Bailey" and Bil Keane of "Family Circus" are pushing 80. At the same time, the funnies themselves face an uncertain future; newspapers suffer from declining readerships, and the readers of comics today are more often adults than kids, which doesn't augur well in an age of zingier youth attractions like MTV and PlayStation.
Accordingly, there's an elegiac cast to "Dugan Under Ground," the final installment in Tom De Haven's trilogy of novels about a fictional comic strip called "Derby Dugan and His Dog That Talks," a popular, long-running adventure serial starring a bald, itinerant orphan boy and his verbose canine companion, Fuzzy. Whereas the trilogy's first installment, "Funny Papers" (1985), chronicled Derby's origins in the rough-and-tumble world of the Hearst and Pulitzer papers in turn-of-the-century New York, and the second, "Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies" (1996), captured the strip at its 1930's zenith, the new book begins with Candy Biggs, the last in a line of cartoonists to draw Derby, receiving the news from King Features Syndicate that his venerable strip is getting the hook. The year is 1960, when gag-a-day maestros like Ketcham and Walker are hitting their stride and adventure strips have become passe. 
De Haven, like many a comics snob, has professed his greatest admiration for old-timey strips such as Chester Gould's "Dick Tracy" and Richard Outcault's "Yellow Kid," and "Dugan Under Ground" is peppered with bursts of indignation over what the comics have become. "Newspapers are murdering the funnies, shrinking them down and killing them off," says a character named Joel Clark, a former publisher of 1960's underground comics who in 2000 teaches a course entitled "American Comics: A Social and Aesthetic History" at the New School for Social Research. "And don't get me started on comic books! How many superheroes does one country need? No vision, ladies and gentlemen, no originality, style, no subversion! Just coffee mugs! And greeting cards! And Dilbert on a mouse pad!" 
The neat trick De Haven pulls is to bridge the Derby saga from the lamentably vanished golden age of the funnies (Derby "was in the damn newspaper being rousted by a cop the same day the headline read 'Teddy Storms San Juan Hill' ") to that other palmy period fetishized by comics snobs, the late-60's heyday of Robert Crumb's "Zap Comix" and the Rip Off Press's "Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers." Biggs, not long after his sacking, has a chance encounter with a boy named Roy Looby, a kid who was just getting into "Derby Dugan" when it was canceled. Looby becomes the unemployed Biggs's protege. And as the 60's progress and Looby grows up, he revivifies the defunct Derby as a perverse underground-comix character named the Imp Eugene, and becomes a counterculture hero in his adopted city of San Francisco. Voila! -- a whole new milieu to explore.
De Haven is an expert milieu man, getting every last detail right, whether navigating a cartoonists' banquet attended by the "silver-haired Westport strip men" whose unbearably mild material was all the rage in 60's broadsheets -- Bob Dunn (They'll Do It Every Time') was M.C." -- or explaining the extent of Roy Looby's newfound cult fame: "Bootlegged Imp Eugene bumper stickers keep turning up on mud flaps and microbuses, not to mention on Tommy Smothers's acoustic guitar." De Haven, without straight-out strip-mining Robert Crumb's life for a plot, has assigned Looby many of the traits familiar to anyone who's seen Terry Zwigoff's engrossing documentary "Crumb" (1994): the same casually worn misanthropy, the same torturous family dynamic, the same love of old 78-r.p.m. records, the same ready cult of acolytes who misread weirdo iconoclasm as kinship with the hippie movement.
But De Haven doesn't quite capitalize on his selected mise en scene's potential for fun; instead, he seems to have gotten swept up in his central character's misanthropy. The time-jump narrative, which flits back and forth between the present day and the 60's-into-70's period of Looby's greatest notoriety, is essentially an agglomeration of humiliations and grim destinies: Biggs not only loses his strip but is cuckolded by his wife, mutilated in a car accident and ultimately shunted aside by Looby; Looby's kid brother, Nick, dreams of working alongside Roy as he did in their younger days, when he inked Roy's pencil-drawn panels, but ends up a sad-sack sign painter, partnerless after a bad romance with the wife Roy abandoned (and that's another grim story); Roy himself winds up a homeless drifter and a comatose hospital patient. 
De Haven's penchant for grotesquerie, which served him well in the gouty, pustulant Old New York realms of his earlier novels, merely seems curdled and gratuitous here. Roy has been totally bald since the age of 9 ("Alopecia areata, said the pediatrician") and is prone to getting shirt-soaking nosebleeds when he draws; Nick Looby has "thick glasses, bad skin and the physique of a custard doughnut"; their mother's boyfriend has "god-awful eczema at his hairline"; Cora Guirl, Roy's girlfriend for a time, has a "scar that runs from the corner of her left eye raggedly down her cheek to her jawline"; poor old Biggs lost his left ear in that car accident, and suffered the further indignity of having the doctors sew it back on too high ("Makes me look like Mr. Potato Head!"). It's as if De Haven, in the process of leafing through all those old "Zap Comix" for research, with their surfeit of bug eyes, jivey gaits and swollen bosoms, fell prey to the precepts of juvenile freak-out humor. A little of this sort of thing goes a long way in a novel. There's a lot of it.
"Dugan Under Ground" is, alas, the weakest entry in the Derby Dugan series, but collectively, the Derby books, with their multiple viewpoints, carefully interwoven plot lines and potted social-history lessons, are a mighty accomplishment: John Dos Passos' "U.S.A." trilogy as rendered for comics geeks. The funnies have always been too lightly regarded as a great American entertainment form, and it's nice to see someone besides Art Spiegelman laboring to bolster their place. And though this novel is apparently De Haven's last word on Derby, I wouldn't begrudge him if he reversed himself and expanded the trilogy into a tetralogy: after all, isn't it painfully likely that the suits at DreamWorks, in a characteristic rush of boomer nostalgia, would secure the rights to Derby and hire Robert Zemeckis to make an overblown live-action feature starring Haley Joel Osment?

 BODY:
 THE RADICAL CENTER
The Future of American Politics.
By Ted Halstead and Michael Lind.
264 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $24.95.
 The attack on the United States has changed the tone and content of American politics, at least for the time being. It has also upended all sorts of received wisdom. An era of big government is beginning, featuring huge expenditures to pump up the economy and ensure the nation's defense and reams of regulations for "homeland security." It is inaugurated under a conservative Republican president who lost the popular election but became more popular than any president in modern history and a once-bitter and factious Congress glowing in bipartisan resolve. For its part, a public that was abysmally cynical about Washington, interested only in political sleaze and sex and eager to throw the bums out, is rallying behind incumbents of whatever stripe. 
This is not the perfect time for a book that seeks to explain why American politics is divisive and immobilized. Yet "The Radical Center," by Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, provides useful insights into a system that's still broken in fundamental ways and may revert to its old ways as soon as the shock wears off. According to the authors, the basic problem is that the two dominant parties have been captured by their extremes. "Instead of expanding their voter bases, both parties have allowed themselves to be taken hostage by narrow pressure groups on certain defining issues," Republicans by "social conservatives and economic libertarians" and Democrats by "a constellation of aggrieved minority groups and public employee unions." Neither camp is willing to think boldly about what's good for the country as a whole. Halstead and Lind propose a new "center" that's not halfway between right and left but outside the standard range of political debate. The result is a sort of triangulation for policy wonks. 
Few of their ideas are new, but they've pulled them together nicely under a few broad themes. Invoking a "new, citizen-based social contract," for example, Halstead, president of the New America Foundation in Washington, and Lind, a senior fellow there, want to chuck universal Social Security and Medicaid and end corporate tax breaks for employee health care and pensions. Instead, everyone would buy basic health insurance and stash away a minimum amount of savings for retirement, while those who couldn't afford these basics would be subsidized. In addition, newborns would be credited with a $6,000 nest egg from the government, which would automatically grow to about $20,000 by the child's 18th birthday -- to pay for higher education or otherwise invested. 
Calling for a new era of "digital democracy," the authors would replace state and local sales taxes with a national progressive tax on personal consumption, with the proceeds rebated to the states on a per capita basis. They favor school choice, but would equalize funding per pupil across the country. They would replace environmental regulations with tradable carbon-emission permits and require companies to pay the market value for use of the electromagnetic spectrum, trees in national forests, minerals on public lands and grazing rights. In pursuit of a new "liberty and community" they would bar affirmative action based on race and allow more skilled immigrants into the United States. 
The authors also advocate a new form of "instant runoff," intended to encourage third parties by enabling voters to rank three or more candidates. If no candidate got a majority, the second-choice votes for the top scorers would be instantly redistributed to them, then the third-choice votes, and so on, until one candidate emerged with more than 50 percent. Halstead and Lind see major-party candidates forging coalitions with third-party candidates to court voters who might be persuaded to pick the major-party candidate as their second choice. 
Their list is something of a hodgepodge, but hats off to Halstead and Lind for at least rising above policy blather and advocating some unconventional things. Notwithstanding that most of these ideas don't have a prayer of being enacted, there's value merely in stirring public debate. Yet their underlying premise that the parties have been captured by their extremes seems dubious. Even before the current detente, it wasn't so much that the parties were captured as that their Congressional wings reflected increasingly distinct demographics. The trend began in the late 1960's, when Richard Nixon launched his Southern strategy to win the region for the Republicans, and continued through the 80's and 90's as America split between a culturally conservative heartland and liberal coasts. Meanwhile, the presidential wings of both parties have been moving relentlessly toward the political middle. Indeed, a plausible case can be made that Americans have been turned off presidential campaigns -- the only times they pay much attention to national politics -- precisely because campaigns have grown so utterly predictable and unremittingly centrist. 
Later in the book the authors suggest that the core problem facing the country is widening inequality. "Mounting inequality of wealth and opportunity has turned the United States into the country with the greatest degree of economic polarization in the developed world. . . . Our nation's transition to an information-based, service-oriented economy has produced levels of wealth and income inequality not seen here since the 1920's." There's a plausible connection between widening inequality and voter disengagement (after all, most of the people who don't vote are poorer than the people who do), but Halstead and Lind don't make it. Nor, curiously, do they seem to be especially interested in energizing the nonvoters. Their agenda is explicitly aimed at independents, professionals, young middle-class whites and "the newly wealthy and influential elites of the technology sector." It's hard to figure why such a putative coalition would fight to overcome widening inequality or lobby for health care subsidies and retirement benefits that would go only to people who couldn't afford to buy or save for them on their own. 
No one knows whether the terrorist attack on America will usher in a new era of high-minded bipartisanship, but I have my doubts. Americans are united in defending the values we cherish, and one of those values is fierce political debate. Paradoxically, this is the very value most at risk in a time of war, when dissenting voices are marginalized or banned from the political arena altogether. Rather than reinforce the "radical center," our greater challenge in the months or even years ahead will be to make ample room for the discordant fringe.

At War With the World

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz

 BODY:
Anyone who doubts that literary critics can play a part on the bloody stage of history should consider the example of Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, born in Egypt in 1906 and university educated, was a Western-style literary critic until he devoted himself to Islam after spending two years in the United States exposed to what he viewed as our decadence. He died in 1966, when he was hanged along with other Muslim radicals by the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qutb's books of hard-line political theology have had a direct influence on the Saudi Arabian Muslim opposition; the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria; the Palestinian group Hamas; the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon; Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric jailed for several thwarted terrorist plots and linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and the Iranian writer Ali Shariati, who helped foster the Islamic revolution in Iran. 
 Qutb's key concept is jahiliyya. In traditional Islamic thought, that word refers to the dark period in Arab history before Muhammad received the Koran, but Qutb redefined it as a spiritual malaise, the condition of having strayed from the path of true Islam. Jahiliyya is any political system that places man above God -- representative democracy as well as Communism -- and all culture inconsistent with Islamic law, including any form of Islamic observance that makes concessions to modernity. Jahiliyya, in this sense, characterizes life as it is lived around the globe today, and opposing it grants Islamic militants their warrant to commit acts of terror anywhere against just about anyone, capitalist or socialist, Arab or Western, Jewish or Christian or insufficiently Muslim. 
 If we have learned anything from the 20th century and its murderous utopianisms -- Stalinism, Nazism, Maoism, Khmer Rougism, a list to which we must now add Islamic extremism -- it is that there are ideas that demand an uncompromising rebuttal. A new book called "The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics" makes it clear, however, that Western thinkers have often had a hard time rising to the occasion. The author, Mark Lilla, rehearses the sorry histories of the great philosophers who openly collaborated with evil, the most notorious being Martin Heidegger, an enthusiastic Nazi at least in the early years of the Third Reich. But Lilla comes down almost as hard on those who equivocated instead of holding firm, or whose philosophies he believes amounted to moral obfuscation. This list rather surprisingly includes Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish cultural critic who was still flirting with Marxism when he killed himself in 1940 while fleeing the Nazis. Lilla also criticizes the French philosophers Michel Foucault, whose celebration of life on the edge included paeans to violence, and Jacques Derrida, against whom he levels the rather tired accusation of deconstructing morality out of existence.
American intellectuals aren't compiling a very good record either -- or not when it comes to responding to the events of last month. Many on the left have retreated into a knee-jerk anti-Americanism. Many on the right have wasted their time heaping abuse on those who failed to exhibit the correct degree of patriotism or seriousness. Religious leaders haven't been much more impressive, and have mostly evaded the problem that faces religious intellectuals of all faiths, not just Muslims, in an era of fundamentalism: how to accept responsibility for violence committed in the name of religion.
Lilla offers no guidelines for proper intellectual behavior. In his epilogue, he gives us Plato's dictum: self-mastery, or recognition and control of the lust for intellectual supremacy. But he never explains how thinkers are to achieve such mastery, or even know when they have achieved it; nor does he say how it would help in the fight against evil. 
Edward W. Said, in his 1994 book "Representations of the Intellectual," is much more certain about what intellectuals are supposed to do. Their job is to speak truth to power, Said says, and he couples this familiar nostrum with a fierce aversion to power itself: "The intellectual always has a choice either to side with the weaker, the less well represented, the forgotten or ignored, or to side with the more powerful." But this is a recipe for becoming history's fool. Said's doctrinaire oppositionalist never has to rethink his position or perform a fresh moral calculation. He always already knows which side he's on, because the side with power is wrong. Following Said's rule to the letter, an intellectual would have had to side with, say, the Confederacy during the Civil War.
It's tempting to despair of intellectuals right now, but in fact we need them, as we always have, to help us move beyond immediate experience to wider insight. But how should they proceed? The reason no one can come up with rules that stick is that rules don't work: they have a way of suppressing rather than encouraging thought. On the other hand, some rough indications have emerged in the past several weeks that will have to do for the moment. First, we should agree that strict and seemingly objective causal analyses -- economic, diplomatic, postcolonialist, globalist or anti-globalist -- are useful as tools but insufficient in a crisis, because they lack an ethical dimension. Only a well-developed moral sensibility will allow us to determine and say forcefully what is good and worth defending, and what is bad and should be stamped out. 
We also have to admit that we don't yet know what we're dealing with. Hannah Arendt said of totalitarianism that it was horrible in its originality: "Its very actions constitute a break with all our traditions; they have clearly exploded our categories of political thought and our standards for moral judgment." Whatever it is that the followers of Qutb want to foist upon the world, it has already shattered received ideas in the same way. We haven't even come up with the words to characterize it. ("Fascist" and "totalitarian" won't do, since the regimes those terms describe were secular, technologically advanced and involved a total concentration of power, while Islamic ones are theocratic, distrustful of technology and more decentralized.) When the paradigms of the past don't work for the present, all we have to go on is imagination and intellectual honesty. Given that our side values these qualities and the other does not, we'll have to hope that they'll be enough.

HEADLINE: Fear Itself 

 BODY:
Japan in the 1990's is a dismal example, but postwar Germany is a hopeful and instructive one. The German government had nothing to offer but encouragement and leadership. 
A grand partnership and bargain among business, labor and government made reconstruction and prosperity the common goal. Quarterly earnings were de-emphasized, and fairness was a necessary component.
Krugman is right about everything, but we should look to more than central-bank monetary actions and government spending to banish fear and restore prosperity. Our recent prosperity has been fueled by business investment, functionally full employment and consumer confidence. Our downward spiral now is made of large, high-profile layoffs, refusal of business to invest and consumer worry about jobs and income. 
 We need business and government leaders to spread the gospel that layoffs should be forsworn. Corporations should address the country's needs for energy-saving technology and equipment, health care, education and security. Congress ought to subsidize and bail out corporations as it is doing with the airlines, but this should be conditioned on their maintaining and making use of their work force.

Some Are Traveling Again, to Some Places

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
WHEN the nation's airlines resumed flying a few days after terrorists hijacked four planes on Sept. 11, Linda Myers in Ithaca, N.Y., resolved to go ahead with plans to attend a family bar mitzvah in Kansas City, Mo., over the Oct. 5 weekend. So did her 93-year-old aunt, Anne Lewis, who flew from Boston.
 But that was before the United States and Britain launched retaliatory strikes on Afghanistan on Oct. 7, after which the resolve of many potential airline passengers lessened. Still, Ms. Myers, a writer for the Cornell University news service, said if she had it to do over again, she would still make the trip. "I'd go rather than be cowed into staying home by terrorists," she added. 
 But not everyone is as unconcerned. While passenger loads had been rising slowly since Sept. 11, the allied strikes have added another layer of uncertainty.
"We were doing all right with our bookings right up until the bombing raids," said Marcy Vance, manager of 1 Step Travel in Barboursville, W.Va. "But now with all this talk about more domestic attacks, it's slowed down a lot." 
While many other travel agencies have been hit by cancellations, a surprising number of Americans had booked flights for later this year. Dixie H. Stewart, president of Ship and Shore Travel Agency in Macon, Ga., had booked flights to Europe for clients for next spring.
But that was before the American air strikes. Since then, Ms. Stewart booked a couple to Venice in January, but a family of eight recently canceled its bookings to Disney World in Orlando. 
Conversations with travel industry executives as well as surveys by the AAA Auto Club South and many of the 1,100 Carlson Wagonlit Travel agencies have found that with each successive week after Sept. 11, a small but increasing number of Americans have been boarding airplanes, trains and buses. The Auto Club South survey, among its 3.4 million members, found that travel sales had increased by 30 percent in the two weeks since Sept. 18. But the allied strikes are too recent to be reflected in industrywide passenger counts, although it is widely expected that the numbers are still well below normal. 
The decision to continue flying, according to several travel officials, has been inspired by many things, ranging from a defiance of terrorism to needing a break from "cable fatigue" after camping out for days in front of the television set. 
Some travel agents have coupled their comments with reminders that the lagging economy has also contributed to near-empty airplanes.
While 51 percent of those who responded to the Carlson Wagonlit survey early this month said that it has never been safer to fly, 21 percent of those who found it unsafe cited lax security as the reason. Recent examples of security lapses at 7 of the nation's 20 highest-risk airports -- which Kenneth M. Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, disclosed to a Congressional aviation subcommittee on Oct. 11 -- have since done little to make the flying experience inviting. 
Although travel officials say that airplane passengers for almost anywhere have not been this sparse since the Persian Gulf war a decade ago, some agencies in the West and Midwest said that a number of their customers are traveling to Hawaii, even though the island's tourism is in a deep slump. According to Patty J. McGregor, the co-owner of Travel Creations in Hamilton, Mont., Hawaii's popularity has to do with the fact that it is part of the United States, and tourists feel safer going there. Special offers of low fares have also helped. After the strikes against Afghanistan, two clients of the World Travel Center in Larkspur, Calif., switched their bookings from the South Pacific to Kona, Hawaii, said Rita Puccinelli, the agency's owner.
Throughout the United States, the patriotic fervor suggested by the American flags displayed everywhere appears to have inspired increased attendance at some historic sites. For example, visits to Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Mass., a park that includes the house occupied by four generations of the Adams family that produced two American presidents, soared 61 percent last month over the same month last year. Much of the increase undoubtedly reflects patriotic pride. But some is also attributable to the success of David McCullough's current best-selling biography of John Adams, said Caroline Keinath, the park's deputy superintendent, who recounted a recent conversation with a woman who explained her reasons for visiting the site: "I wanted to be reminded of the principles our forefathers fought for."
Colonial Williamsburg, the restored former capital of colonial Virginia, experienced numerous cancellations after the terrorist attacks, but it has since recorded what Tim Andrews, the city's public relations director, described as a significant rebound each week thereafter. 
Perhaps because many people have to fly to get on a tour bus, tour buses have been noticeably absent at many destinations. The decline has been palpable at Yellowstone National Park, where the number of tour buses last month was down 50 percent from the same month a year ago, said Cheryl Matthews, a park spokeswoman. 
Despite the airlines' woes, Ms. Vance of 1 Step Travel said that it's already hard to get airline reservations for Thanksgiving, adding that bookings through December are also filling up. If most of those bookings translate into flights rather than cancellations, Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for the AAA, agreed that Thanksgiving travel could provide some sense of what to expect at least in the near term for the nation's ailing travel industry.

Slow Crawl at the Border

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA; ANTHONY DePALMA is a reporter for The Times who has been chief of its bureaus in Mexico and Canada.

 BODY:
IT all used to be so simple. Americans who drove into Canada or Mexico on vacation didn't need passports. Customs inspectors rarely left their booths. In rural areas along the northern border, a traveler's biggest worry was getting through before 10 p.m., when officials left an orange traffic cone or two in the road and went home for the night. 
 Crossing the borders of America was so quick and hassle-free, so comfortable and routine, that some Americans didn't feel that they were traveling to a foreign country at all. 
 Not anymore. 
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States, North America's borders have been battened down and toughened up as officials try to keep out terrorists and prevent future attacks. Passports still are not required, but a comprehensive combination of heightened surveillance, intensified scrutiny, and a general wariness on the part of border officials in all three countries means that traveling to America's nearest neighbors now definitely seems like entering another country, perhaps even another world. 
Since an hour after the attacks on Sept. 11, all 301 ports of entry along the northern and southern borders have been on highest alert, and are expected to remain at that level for some time. Short of shutting down the border completely (despite reports to the contrary, no crossing ever was closed as a direct result of the attacks), this Code Red alert is the highest level of security, a steel trap that is supposed to ensnare people and material law enforcement wants kept out. 
The antiterrorism operations under Code Red mean that all private vehicles, trucks and buses may be inspected, sometimes by agents using trained dogs. The United States Customs Service added to the traffic jams by temporarily shutting down lanes used exclusively for regular international commuters, saying they did not provide sufficient security. 
With 350,000 vehicles and millions of passengers entering the United States every day, imposing all the new security measures stretched out the inspection of each vehicle and added time to a border crossing. Lots of time. 
After Code Red was imposed, traffic backed up for miles at busy border crossings with Canada and Mexico. For days, there were monumental delays that made the wait to cross the border into the United States, in some areas, last nine hours or more. 
More recently, additional American border agents have been put on the line and they have been working longer hours to help keep traffic moving. American border officials say they do not yet have definitive figures, but they say the volume of private vehicles crossing the border generally appears to have diminished, which evidently has also played a role in reducing backups. 
The combination of fewer cars and more border agents means delays have been greatly reduced at most outbound crossings, and wait times have returned to almost what they were before Sept. 11. But the busiest entry points remain clogged, especially heading into the United States. Clear outbound lanes may seem tempting, but monstrous backups on re-entering the United States have discouraged many travelers.
"Tijuana is like a ghost town right now," said Carlos Gomez, general manager of the Senor Frog's restaurant in Rosarito, Baja California, just south of Tijuana. The number of American visitors to his restaurant has dropped 80 percent since Sept. 11, and he is afraid the bombing in Afghanistan will only keep more people off the roads. 
"Americans are afraid to cross the border," Mr. Gomez said. "With a war on, they want to be able to get back faster, but here that can take three hours." 
By all accounts, those who do not stay home are finding it just plain harder to get across the border. Each crossing, no matter how small or infrequently used, is guarded by at least two customs agents every hour of every day. Many ports of entry, like the remote crossings in Antler and Neche, N.D., still close for the night at the homey hour of 10 p.m., but the border agents are supposed to remain on duty until morning, making sure no one disregards the orange traffic cones placed in the road during off hours. 
Congressional critics, like Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, say that simply adding personnel is not sufficient to handle new security concerns. Senator Dorgan said he would continue to push for a strengthening of rural border crossings. 
Though Americans don't need a passport to enter Canada or Mexico, border officials in those countries say it is a good idea for travelers who have passports to carry them when entering their countries. 
Both Canada and Mexico also have bolstered their border vigilance and advise Americans traveling into those countries to be prepared to undergo more thorough inspections than in the past. 
In Canada, the government is hiring 300 new immigration officers as part of a package of measures to tighen border control. The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency has been cautioning Americans without passports to bring photo identification; in the past, a birth certificiate or baptismal certificate was enough. And the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has stepped up patrols of rural border crossings, some of which remain unmanned overnight on the Canadian side.
In Mexico, Enrique Berruga, deputy secretary of foreign affairs, said that since Sept. 11, Mexico has increased security measures on its side of the border, not only for entering vehicles but also for those leaving. Using a system similar to that in major Mexican airports, vehicles are stopped and inspected randomly before entering the United States -- a machine flashes a red light to indicate when a car is to be stopped. 
"We are all in the same neighborhood, and we all now need to have greater surveillance," Mr. Berruga said. At the same time, he added, there is pressure to keep the border functioning smoothly to avoid economic disruptions that would worsen a deteriorating economic picture. 
Tourism, one of Mexico's biggest sources of income, is down as much as 30 percent since Sept. 11. Resorts in the northern states of Baja California and Sonora have been among the hardest hit, Mexican officials said. 
The Mexican government has begun a special tourism promotion at the border and through its consulates in the United States to persuade Americans that it is safe to travel and to solicit suggestions for making Mexico more tourist-friendly in the new era of heightened security.
In Canada, officials say traffic at some border crossings has dropped 50 percent and, as a result, tourism has been badly battered. Toronto and Montreal hotels have reported a wave of cancellations, and regular attractions popular with American road travelers, like the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, have had periods when they issued more refunds than tickets. 
Colleen Blake, the festival's managing director, said American group ticket sales have plummeted, but certain individuals continue to cross the border, including one couple that drove from St. Louis after their flight was canceled. "It's very heartening," Ms. Blake said, "and shows the resiliance of human nature." 
Canadian tourism officials and travel agencies are hoping that there might be some residual benefit for them in the intensified concerns over travelers' security. Susan Iris, the Canadian Tourism Commission's managing director in the United States, said a few travel agents are beginning to see a trend where people who canceled winter and spring trips to Europe and the Middle East are making reservations in Canada, which they can reach without flying. 
"There's a certain comfort level for Americans coming to Canada that's especially important right now," Ms. Iris said.In addition, she noted, the American dollar remains strong, worth about $1.56 in Canada.
Waiting times at the United States's borders with Canada and Mexico, continually updated, are available at the U.S. Customs Service Web site, www.customs.gov/sep11infof.htm.

The World Gets Its Guard Up: Mexico City

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON; GINGER THOMPSON is chief of the Mexico City bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
September has marked the nadir of the low tourist season for so long in this city of castles and museums that workers in restaurants and hotels refer to it as "Septi-hambre," a play on the Spanish word for hunger.
 The tourist famine has worsened this year in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the United States. Nearly 90 percent of foreign tourists to Mexico come from the United States, and their absence has left a void at popular attractions from the pyramids at Teotihuacan to the floating gardens at Xochimilco. There are lots of vacancies at the city's high-end hotels and empty tables at tequila bars. Business is down by as much as 30 percent. 
 But in many ways, and in many places, life among Mexican people continues as usual.
In some circles, there are expressions of concern about whether Mexico will become involved in the war. There is worry, too, about whether its airports and borders are secure enough to detect terrorists and stop them from using this country as a backdoor to the United States.
Security has been increased at the Mexico City airport, and travelers are advised to arrive at least two hours before international flights. Inspectors have become more vigilant -- some travelers have even complained of harassment -- in searching bags and raising questions about any kind of video or office equipment. (One agent almost pulled apart a professional photographer's 100-year-old camera, saying he wanted to see how it worked.)
Everywhere, however, there is a palpable edginess about the steady decline in the economy. Mexico's economy relies heavily on tourism -- the nation's third largest source of foreign income -- and exports to the United States. Shrinkage in those sectors has plunged the country into recession and forced hundreds of thousands of people out of work. Cabdrivers, street vendors and hotel bellmen worry openly about making ends meet. Waiters at tourist cantinas and restaurants measure the atmosphere in tips. At the popular Bar La Opera, in Mexico's historic center, waiters took a break from watching television reports of the bombing of Afghanistan to lament that their weekly tips had declined from $100 to $50. And competitions for gigs among mariachi musicians at Plaza Garibaldi have turned into fist fights. 
Luxury hotel operators have said that occupancy at their establishments has dropped between 10 and 15 percent compared with this time last year, especially among business travelers. Still, in spite of a sharp decline in profits for September at the Sheraton Maria Isabel, the company planned to go forward with construction of a 450-room hotel in the city's historic center, officials said.
Crime continues to menace tourists and residents alike. But in the coming months, said officials in Mexico City's Tourism Ministry, the government will deploy 250 "tourism police officers" from the National Auditorium in Chapultepec Park to the fine arts palace, called Bellas Artes, to offer assistance to visitors. Officials also said that some 650 new streetlights would be installed along Reforma, a broad east-west avenue modeled after the Champs-Elysees.
Tourism officials in Mexico hope that its proximity will help keep it an attractive destination for United States tourists -- some 2.5 million of whom travel to Mexico by car. During dinner at La Terraza in the historic district, where the spectacular view of the Zocalo more than compensates for the unspectacular menu, Doug and Marsha Taylor of Seattle said that after the terrorist attacks, they had canceled their plans to visit Bali and decided to come to Mexico for two weeks. After paying less than $30 for their meal, the couple did not seem to regret their decision.
"It's safe, and there's not an automatic anti-American sentiment," Mr. Taylor said. "We can be our normal selves here, and be O.K."

The World Gets Its Guard Up: Hong Kong#NEWLINE#An unsentimental look#NEWLINE#at the bottom line

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER; MARK LANDLER is chief of the Hong Kong bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Despite its claims to being the Manhattan of Asia, Hong Kong has reacted to last month's terrorist attack in New York in a way that reveals the distance between this financial center and its American counterpart.
Hong Kong's government did not hold a memorial service for the victims in New York and Washington. One top official responded to the news with a dry-eyed analysis to reporters of how lower interest rates -- prompted by the weakened United States economy -- would benefit businesses here. 
Local people say Hong Kong's response was not coldhearted but reflects its historic reluctance, as a British colony turned Chinese special administrative region, to involve itself in international politics.
Albert Cheng, a columnist and radio commentator, wrote in the South China Morning Post, "It is not exactly fair to condemn Hong Kong officials for having failed to condemn terrorism, though whether their wording could be stronger is a matter of judgment."
Whatever the reason, Hong Kong has kept throbbing, with little sign of the crisis at hotels, restaurants or tourist attractions. While the business-as-usual mood may be reassuring for visitors, it is a reminder that this is a Chinese city, where feelings about the United States are ambivalent.
Government officials insist that Hong Kong is not a target of terrorism, though the American consulate closed briefly on Sept. 17 because of undisclosed security concerns. At Hong Kong International Airport, security forces stepped up patrols of flights departing for the United States and Britain after Washington launched strikes against Afghanistan.
Police Deputy Commander M. G. Howard said the elite units, armed with automatic weapons, were trained to respond to terrorism or more mundane issues, like passengers frustrated by the rigorous security procedures.
The economic fallout from the crisis is likely to hit Hong Kong in the pocketbook. Plunging arrivals from the United States and Canada have forced airlines to cancel flights, left hotels with empty rooms and robbed Hong Kong of what it had expected to be a bumper year for tourism. 
"It doesn't matter what strategy you have or how much money you have, people just aren't traveling," said Mark Lettenbichler, the general manager of the Ritz-Carlton, a hotel in the Central District that has had a flood of cancellations.
The Hong Kong Tourism Board had projected that 14 million people would visit the city this year, a 7.8 percent increase over 2000, driven in large part by an influx of mainland Chinese tourists. It now says the drop in North American tourists will wipe out that expected increase.
A spokeswoman, Donna Mongan, said the tourism board had pulled its advertising in the United States and Canada to focus on traffic from China and Taiwan, which are less likely to be affected by fears of terrorism.
Ms. Mongan said that Hong Kong might draw tourists over other Asian destinations because of its relative insulation from events. Indonesia and the Philippines have substantial Muslim populations, and the State Department has warned about possible anti-American sentiment in those countries.
 "It's terrible to say we could benefit from this," she said. "But compared to some of our Asian neighbors, possibly we could."

Signing Up

BYLINE:  By Nina Roberts

 BODY:
 In the wake of Sept. 11, Americans have volunteered their time, their expertise and their blood. Some have enlisted in the Armed Forces. Here, fresh recruits -- the first two joined after the attacks; the second two, before -- discuss the impact recent events have had on their decisions to serve.

Shawn Crouse, 19, carpenter: "To me, if you are an American citizen, you have to want retribution. There is no other way to look at it. War has always fascinated me. I'm a patriot. I'm an American citizen. I would not hesitate to die for this country."

Pablo Narvaez, 28, delivery person: "I don't want to talk to my Muslim friends about the war: what sounds to me like rationale might sound to them like hate rhetoric. My feeling is that somewhere in their hearts, their loyalty is not to America."

Husein Palmer, 24, unemployed: "Fight for our freedom, for our country, why not? I'm down with that. Now that the attack happened, I'm scared. Me and my sergeant were talking, and I asked, Am I going to be in front lines? He tried to calm me down."

Renalda Luli, 20, student: "I joined the Marines as a reserve this summer. Boot camp was really tough, but it's almost like I got born again or something. I want to go active really bad. What happened on the 11th made me want to go even more."

Back on Home Turf, a Breeding Ground of Unrest

BYLINE:  By LAURA WINTERS; Laura Winters's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung and his film "The Vertical Ray of the Sun."

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
ROBERT GUEDIGUIAN'S new film "The Town Is Quiet" ("La Ville est Tranquille") was inspired by a memory of Marseille.
 "There is a hill in Marseille with a basilica that overlooks the whole town," Mr. Guediguian said recently, speaking in French at his production office here. "In the evening, standing there, with the city slowly becoming more quiet, it's easy to imagine that people are peacefully going home. But I've always been haunted by the thought that underneath that apparent tranquillity lurk things that are dangerous and frightening, that could in a moment catch fire. I wanted to talk, in this film, of all the things that make me afraid." 
 In the devastating tapestry that Mr. Guediguian creates in "The Town Is Quiet" -- his 10th film, opening in New York on Friday -- his native Marseille, an unquiet, rough-and-tumble seaport on the French Mediterranean coast, becomes a symbol of a far more universal urban unrest. 
Michele (played by the actress Ariane Ascaride, Mr. Guediguian's wife) unloads fish on the docks at night so that by day she can take care of her unemployed husband, her drug-addicted daughter and her baby granddaughter. Michele has two unlikely allies: a sinister bartender (Gerard Meylan) and a taxi driver (Jean-Pierre Darroussin), who is a disillusioned former union man. Meanwhile, in a high-rise building not far from Michele's, a young, black ex-convict (Alexandre Ogou) preaches peace to his angry friends. But his voice becomes increasingly drowned out by the racist propaganda of the far-right party, the National Front.
For Mr. Guediguian (pronounced gay-dee-GYAHN), such social ills stem from a common root. "Most of these characters, no matter what their milieu, have no real concept of the world," he said. "They go step by step, struggling, without thinking of the big picture. They have lost their sense of direction and their beliefs. But how can one live without some plan, some sort of hope for the future?"
Mr. Guediguian asks these questions but doesn't pretend to have answers. One of the most politically engaged filmmakers working in France today, he is a former Communist who still maintains a strong, if troubled, idealism. Not that his vision is always grim. The film that made his reputation in 1997 was the surprise hit "Marius and Jeannette," a mature love story that is as sunny as "The Town Is Quiet" is dark.
Though all his films are set in Marseille and focus on the working class, Mr. Guediguian has reached a new level with "The Town Is Quiet." "I think this is the film of Guediguian's which has the broadest and most generous vision of Marseille and of French society," said Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which showed the movie earlier this year. "Generous in the sense that his characters may be in trouble but they have their reasons. He's conscious of cinema as a social tool, but I don't think he's a filmmaker who's pushing an agenda. His agenda is to make people reflect."
In person, Mr. Guediguian, who is 47, is warm and unaffected, sporting an aureole of brownish curls and an unabashed Marseillais accent even after 25 years in Paris. He has a quiet authority, which surfaces as he gives a tour of Agat Films & Company, an unusual collective of six producers, including himself. The company, which he helped to shape, has produced several recent French hits, among them Tonie Marshall's "Venus Beauty Institute."
Mr. Guediguian's current standing is a far cry from his early days. Then, he said, "I produced my own movies because nobody else wanted to." But even now he insists on a home-movie ethic. He has written his last six films with Jean-Louis Milesi and has shot all of them using the same small group of actors, including his wife, Ms. Ascaride; Mr. Darroussin, and Mr. Meylan, a childhood friend who is not a trained actor but a night nurse in a Marseille hospital.
"Whereas I once played a 28-year-old man in Robert's films, now I play a 48-year-old man," Mr. Meylan said, speaking on the phone from Marseille. "Robert is quite unique in that he uses the same actors as tangible witnesses to the passage of time, somewhat as Fassbinder did."
The fact that he has worked with the same actors has also made Mr. Guediguian's films a kind of larger chronicle. "Robert's films have become the history of a particular generation in France," said his fellow Agat producer Yvon Davis. "This is a generation that had tremendous ideals, that participated in the events of 1968 in France, but that also partook of the subsequent disillusionment."
Mr. Guediguian's films start always from the personal. "I talk of Marseille because I was born there, and because its colors and its landscapes are my language," he said. "As Chekhov said, if you want to talk of the whole world, talk of your village."
Though his style is realistic, he insists on his films' being extreme. "My films are either comedies or tragedies," he said. "I don't think you should mix the two registers. You have to go to the depths of each one, like opera: only in that way can you move the audience."
This leads to some shocking moments in "The Town Is Quiet." In one, Michele, driven to distraction by the simultaneous crying of her daughter and her granddaughter, warms milk for the baby while she heats up heroin in a spoon for the baby's mother.
Ms. Ascaride's bravura performance as Michele is the heart of the film. "I think Robert has always been fascinated by two types of women: Mary Magdalene and Mother Courage," Ms. Ascaride said by telephone from Paris. "But Michele is the most complex and ambiguous character that Robert has ever called upon me to play. She is someone who is constantly fighting for survival."
Ms. Ascaride, who went blond for the role, was afraid when she first read the part. "I said to myself, 'My God, how can I make her sympathetic?' " she recalled. "The only thing I can liken the experience to is bungee-jumping. I had to throw myself into the void."
On the set, Mr. Guediguian works with his actors intuitively. "He doesn't talk much and gives few directions," Ms. Ascaride said. "At the same time, he is very open to whatever ideas we have for the characters."
One of his goals is to make his characters human, whether they be heroes or villains. "Rather than just dismissing people who are racist, I wanted to show why they get the ideas that they do," he said. His concern with the working class stems from his own background. "I try to speak for my father, for the world that I grew up in," he said.
Mr. Guediguian's father, who worked on the docks in Marseille, is of Armenian heritage; his mother is German. He grew up in the mixed neighborhood of L'Estaque. "It was a communal atmosphere because it was the Mediterranean and we were always outside," he said. "And it was a Communist neighborhood, so I was militant from a young age."
He went to the University of Aix-en-Provence to study sociology. There he met Ms. Ascaride, a fellow student, when she came to one of his classes to speak on behalf of the student union. They married in 1975, and Mr. Guediguian followed Ms. Ascaride to Paris, where she studied at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts. Then, in 1979, an acquaintance asked him to collaborate on a screenplay.
Mr. Guediguian found that he liked to write and so, with another friend, Frank Le Wita, he wrote his own film, "Last Summer" ("Dernier Ete"), a melancholy look at a group of young Marseillais friends. Mr. Guediguian scraped together enough money to direct it and was stunned when the film was chosen to play out of competition at the Cannes International Film Festival.
Encouraged, he directed a second film, "Rouge Midi" (1983), a historical saga of a working-class family in Marseille. But he found it hard to find financing for his next two films, "Ki Lo Sa?" (1985) and "Dieu Vomit Les Tiedes" (1989), neither of which was released in the United States. These films, which deal with lost illusions, mirrored his own spiritual crisis at the time. "I had lost faith in the French Communist party," he said, "and I didn't see what I could do in order to fight any more."
HE found an answer with his first comedy, "Money Makes Happiness" ("L'Argent Fait le Bonheur," 1992), a wry tale of inner-city youngsters who try to combat injustice by stealing from the rich. "I realized in my own life that little victories could count," he said, "and I wanted to start making films that would hearten people."
In 1996, after shooting another drama, he decided to make an informal comedy, "Marius and Jeannette," set partly in a friend's courtyard in Marseille. The film, which is about a middle-aged security guard who falls in love with a feisty mother of two, and which stars Mr. Meylan and Ms. Ascaride, became one of the most successful French films of 1997.
"Marius and Jeannette's" charm includes the occasional sly tribute to Marcel Pagnol, the great playwright-director who glorified Marseille before the Second World War. "Pagnol is an unavoidable, if overpowering, father figure," Mr. Guediguian said. "For my first films, I tried to stay far away from him. With my comedies, however, I thought it would be amusing to do certain sequences in the manner of Pagnol, very colorful, but have my characters talking about thoroughly modern political issues."
Since his success with "Marius and Jeannette," Mr. Guediguian has directed and released three more films in rapid succession. But "The Town Is Quiet" is his most ambitious film, and one that seems to indicate a new direction for him. "I've always dealt with the idea of community in my films, but here I deal for the first time with solitude, with the absence of community," he said.
He has taken this concern with solitude even further in a film he finished shooting this summer, "Marie-Jo and Her Two Loves" ("Marie-Jo et ses Deux Amours"). It is the tragic tale of a woman who loves two men and cannot choose between them. "I think for the first time I've left political and social issues aside to concentrate more on my characters' private lives," Mr. Guediguian said.
When asked whether doing something different makes him nervous, he laughed. "Yes, it does," he replied. "But I think fear is part of the satisfaction of taking risks. If I didn't find things to do that frightened me, I would stop making films."

HEADLINE: Near the Big Dig, New Homes and Offices 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
New commercial and residential developments are nearing completion in the first area of this city to be cleared of elevated roadways and other remnants of an industrial past after 10 years of construction on the Big Dig and related infrastructure improvements. As the developments bring new life to the long-languishing City Square district in the historic Charlestown neighborhood, planners and city officials are pointing to the changes as examples of what might be done in the wake of the enormous physical changes being made by the $14.5 billion Central Artery Project, which is to be completed in 2005. 
 The four City Square projects -- two office buildings, a hotel and a condominium -- are reviving a waterfront district that was once lined by industrial buildings and crisscrossed by freight trains, all in the shadows cast by elevated roads and bridges. 
 In 1990, as part of the gigantic state and federally funded infrastructure rebuilding project, city planners started to draw up zoning rules for this 12-acre district. By 1995, the completed plan included five development parcels, a one acre public park and five additional acres of landscaped space. In 1997 the elevated structures were demolished. 
Once the elevated steel structures came down and new links to Interstate 93 and Route 1 were completed at a cost of $200 million, the potential of the area, which extends to the harbor, became clear. In 2000, when the state requested bids on leases, four of the five parcels were soon leased to developers. That was no accident, according to Linda M. Haar, chief of staff for the Boston Redevelopment Authority. Planning for the area, designated as Central Artery North, "was done not only to serve highway construction but to allow a major infrastructure project to create a livable and attractive urban neighborhood," she said.
Three years ago, the first hint of City Square's fresh-faced incarnation surfaced with the completion of its new park, replete with red brick sidewalks, period lighting and wrought iron benches. Now, construction on the $50 million, 8-building, 117-unit Nautica condominium project across the street is two months from completion, with 35 households already in residence.
"City Square used to be a little dirt pile surrounded by empty lots where people walked dogs," said Courtney T. Kagan, 32, a 10-year Charlestown resident who with her husband and two young children just moved into a $900,000 four-bedroom town house at the Nautica. "Now we have a beautifully manicured park and great new buildings." 
Construction is also under way on the $50 million Gateway Center: two office buildings that total 210,000 square feet and have ground-floor retail and cultural amenities. The first building, covering 170,000 square feet, which features an archway showcasing the harbor, is to be completed in November. The second office building, with 40,000 square feet, is to be done in one year. 
Next month construction is scheduled to start on a $40 million, 168-room extended-stay hotel on a waterfront pier. National Development of Newton, Mass., purchased the 1.25-acre parcel last year for $3.25 million. Earlier this fall, after receiving city and state approvals, the developer started site work for the 50,000-square-foot hotel project on Tudor Wharf, which is to include a public harbor-front walkway. 
The City Square developments will extend a revitalized slice of the Charlestown neighborhood to the water's edge.
Charlestown is one of several Boston neighborhoods whose geographic isolation and decades of economic decline had sowed the seeds of a somewhat insular identity. After World War II, the once buzzing industrial enclave gradually became a neighborhood of low-cost housing, abandoned wharves, warehouses, factories and the vast but eerily quiet Charlestown Naval Shipyard.
Then, in the late 1980's, with the aid of the state and federal governments and private developers, the city transformed the Navy yard into a mix of mostly upscale residences, offices, shops and the tourist-friendly U.S.S. Constitution museum. Sitting on the northern shore of Boston Harbor, spruced-up Charlestown with its spectacular skyline views and an easy walk to the Financial District lured new residents, office tenants and fine restaurants.
In the 1990's, Big Dig construction got under way. It includes rebuilding downtown Boston's roads, bridges and underlying infrastructure, including utility and telecommunications lines. Replacing the elevated artery in City Square with a tunnel was one vital link in the massive effort. The most visible part of the Big Dig is the work to place the few miles of elevated highway that run through the Central Business District along the harbor below street level. That will create about 27 acres of open space and development parcels.
"Within a year, we expect to start choosing designers to draw up a master plan for housing, commercial projects and parks from the North End to just south of Chinatown," said Ms. Haar, the city planner. "It's a great opportunity." 
City Square, the first section of the city to be freed of the old and filled with the new infrastructure, has certainly been opportune for the developers working here. About 100,000 square feet of the 170,000-square-foot office building under construction at Gateway Center was preleased to Keane Inc., a Charlestown-based information technology company and a partner in the development project being managed by the Cornerstone Corporation. 
The developer expects another 50,000 square feet to be put under agreement soon for about $30 to $40 a square foot, the annual rental rate anticipated when the project was started three years ago. Construction has just begun on the second office building, which is to be completed in November 2002. Leasing is to start in the first quarter of 2002.
"We plan to manage and hold on to them for the long term," said Timothy P. Doherty, the project manager for Cornerstone, which is based in Needham. The red brick and copper-topped building with 400 spaces of underground parking was designed by ADD Inc. of Cambridge for the developer, which acquired a 99-year ground lease from the state in a public bid process. 
Nearby, site preparation recently started for the hotel on Tudor wharf as well as underground parking spaces; the identity the hotel company has not yet been announced. Construction of the building, designed by the Boston-based architect DiMella & Schaeffer, is scheduled to start next month and be completed in 2003.
" Many of the business travelers that are the hotel's marketing targets will be working with pharmaceutical and health science companies in the nearby Charlestown Navy yard.
"We're excited about the long-term appreciation potential of City Square, which is now a terrific business environment and residential community," said Thomas M. Alperin, president of National Development. 
Ms. Kagan, whose family recently moved into a 2,300-square-foot, four-bedroom town house condominium at the Nautica agrees. "Charlestown is in the city but feels like a family community; we have a mother's group with 100 members," she said.
The Nautica is on a two-and-a-half-acre site that once sat under an elevated roadway to downtown Boston. The land was leased from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority for 99 years by Constitution Development Associates of Boston. The 117 one- to four-bedroom condominiums are in eight buildings clustered around an acre and a half of open space that leads to the waterfront, explained Daniel R. Hart, the project manager. It was designed by Neshamkin/French Architects of Charlestown. All but eight of the units have been sold or are under contract, at prices of $145,000 to $1.3 million. 
Ms. Kagan, one of the early buyers, can easily envision the finished product. "A year from now," she said, "the Nautica with all its landscaping and bandstand will feel like living in a park."

HEADLINE: Art/Architecture; 
An Elegant Marriage Of Inside and Outside

BYLINE:  By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
AGGRESSION is a particle, desire is a wave. They represent two different ways of experiencing life. But nowadays it matters to go with the waves. To get through this crisis in our collective and interconnected civic, national and global life, we must all become beach bums and ride our desires. 
 Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio have designed a blue and white wave of a building for Eyebeam Atelier, the advanced electronic media workshop in Chelsea. The project is one of three finalists in a competition organized earlier this year for a new headquarters Eyebeam hopes to build. All 13 of the conceptual designs submitted by other firms invited to participate, as well as the finalists, are on display through Oct. 27 at the future site of the building, 540 West 21st Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. (Entries can be viewed on line at www.eyebeam.org.) The winner will be chosen in the next few weeks. 
 Whatever the outcome, Diller and Scofidio's project is Olympic class. The most fully developed piece of architecture their office has produced thus far, the design extends into durably built form the conceptual elegance of the "alternative" architecture for which Diller and Scofidio are best known. For a while, it seemed as if the team were treading water. Brilliant divertissements like the Brasserie restaurant, the performance piece "Jet Lag," and "Suitcase Studies," a traveling museum show on the subject of tourism, increased our impatience for something less alternative.
Their situation changed earlier this year, when Diller and Scofidio were awarded the commission to design a new building for Boston's Museum of Contemporary Art. But Manhattan needs their talent now. With the convergence of developer-architects on Lower Manhattan, New York is likely to see more particle buildings than it can handle. The city is ready for new waves.
This is one of three terrific New York projects I saw last week. A report on Jean Nouvel's proposal for a three-building complex in Chelsea appeared in last Sunday's Real Estate section in The Times. Rem Koolhaas is getting his design for the Whitney Museum expansion ready for its close-up in the next weeks. These projects helped dispel the gloomy prospect I had formed since Sept. 11: an emergency reconstruction authority; sweeping powers to condemn property and award development rights; theme park versions of "New York's architectural traditions." The Tyranny of the Appropriate, in perpetuity this time.
The display of Eyebeam's competition entries is a museum-quality show. Jeffrey Kipnis, architecture and design curator at the Wexner Art Center in Columbus, Ohio, calls it the first serious survey of work by the circa 40 generation. There are striking commonalities in the work. Waves and ribbons abound. To my eye, these motifs look like crossbreeds. Computerized blob design has been morphed together with the boxes the computers came in. 
Founded in 1997 by John Johnson, its executive director, Eyebeam is a hybrid nonprofit institution that combines educational programs and media production facilities with publicly accessible galleries and performance spaces. "Access to Tools," the subtitle Stewart Brand chose for the Whole Earth Catalog, the legendary bible for the counterculture in the late 1960's and early 70's, could define Johnson's mission as well. An heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Eyebeam's director projects the benign air of youthful noblesse oblige. His overarching ambition is to train city youngsters in the techniques required to tell stories in the digital age.
It's not a stretch to say that schools have become the city's bandages. Without them, there's little hope that the urban core can sustain its historic role as a center of cultural production. Museums matter to the extent that they pursue a pedagogical role in civic life. But our larger museums and performing arts spaces are primarily centers for cultural consumption. Schools are the key to training productive minds.
Diller and Scofidio get it. Their design is rooted in the differentiation between production and consumption and in their symbiotic relationship. It is a study in interwoven space, where the makers and consumers of media spectacles are presented as two parts of a group performance.
The interior is loosely organized into separate areas for production and presentation that occupy alternating floors in the 12-story building. The production areas (classrooms, audio-visual workshops) are enclosed within the folds of a curving, two-ply ribbon of metal and reinforced concrete that uncoils from the ground floor lobby to an outdoor rooftop theater. Presentation areas (galleries, theaters, a cafe) occupy spaces outside the horizontal enclosures. These cascade downward, like a kind of liquefied, discontinuous atrium that flows in and around the spaces dedicated to production.
As the ribbon unfolds from side to side, floors, ceilings and interior walls are fashioned from its variously flat and curving surfaces. The building's guts (wiring, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning ducts) are sandwiched between the ribbon's concrete and metal plies. On the street facade, the concrete ribbon projects beyond the glazed building envelope. Alternating bands of transparent and blue tinted glass indicate the position of production and presentation areas. The facade itself is folded vertically, down the center, giving it a faceted, crystalline complexity. From the street, people can take in the logic of the interwoven space.
This is the first piece of architecture to deal seriously with the idea of blue. Jean Nouvel has some great blues going on in his design for the Broadway Hotel in SoHo. But Nouvel's colors have more to do with cinematography than digital process. For Eyebeam, blue unmistakably evokes the blue screen used to create special effects. It is an emblem for placelessness, for a weightless, infinite and provisional void waiting to be filled with synthesized locations. As a pop cultural device, the blue screen also carries connotations of Miles Davis, Polynesian cocktails and television ads for Caribbean resorts. The cascading flow of interior space recreates water, the universal solvent. It's an artificial, electronic view of the primordial world before differentiation set in. Then the waters part, and a holographic Julie London emerges in a cloud of foam, someone hands her a mike and she sings "Voice in the Mirror."
New York has seen no new interiors of comparable allure since the decade that produced the Guggenheim Museum, the TWA Terminal, the Ford Foundation, the Seagram Building and the Hall of Science at the New York World's Fair. Sad, but true. Tacky, impoverished space: that's a legacy bequeathed to us by architecture's glorious antimodern moment.
The relationship of inside and outside is the heart of Diller and Scofidio's design. Its significance rests substantially on the sophistication with which it explores the overlap (or ecotone) between objective and subjective space. From a conceptual point of view, the difference between the industrial and informational economies rests on a blurring of the boundaries between our inner and outer worlds. The industrial age systematized our access to things. The information age, as Jeremy Rifkin observes, organizes access to experiences. Experience belongs as much to the mental landscape as to the realm of material reality.
The issue, with regard to media, is the extent to which the consumer of experience becomes the consumed. Can we project our experience out into the world? Or has it become our fate to be restricted to the receiving end? Diller and Scofidio have rendered Eyebeam's Utopian outlook into concise urban form. No architects today can match their elegance in translating social analysis into space.

If Only It Hadn't Been His Only One

BYLINE:  By SIMON CALLOW; The British actor and director Simon Callow is the author of "Charles Laughton: A Difficult Actor," "Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu" and other books.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
CHARLES LAUGHTON'S "Night of the Hunter" is at the very top of that curious list of only films directed by actors. Below it are Marlon Brando's "One-Eyed Jacks," Peter Lorre's "Der Verlorene" and this writer's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," to name a few. Laughton's is a haunting and highly personal work, which, despite flaws, is clearly the work of a master. It should have been the high point of his creative life so far, and the harbinger of many more remarkable films. Instead, it slipped almost unnoticed into the stream of 1955's new releases, and he never made another.
 Now the film -- and Laughton's great promise as a filmmaker -- can be seen again in a newly restored print at Film Forum in Manhattan starting on Friday. It tells the story of a murderous preacher, played by Robert Mitchum, who terrorizes two small children in pursuit of their father's stolen fortune. They finally escape into the protective embrace of a good-hearted, gun-toting spinster (Lillian Gish). 
 At the time Laughton took on "Night of the Hunter," when he was 55, his career had become multi-stranded. After a late start -- he only finally gave up running the family hotel in Scarborough to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts at the age of 26 -- he experienced immediate success on the London stage. By 1930, after only three years on the professional stage and despite unconventional looks (he described himself as resembling a "departing pachyderm") and a lack of glamour in the accepted sense of the word, he had established himself as the most original actor in England, playing an Al Capone-style gangster in "On the Spot."
The following year he went to Broadway with "Payment Deferred," repeating his harrowing performance as the bank clerk who murders his wife, causing a sensation there too. He went on to Hollywood, where he made a number of striking films, then returned to Britain to star in "The Private Life of Henry VIII" (1933), which earned him his only Academy Award and made him world-famous. His Henry VIII was impersonated in bars, on playgrounds and in living rooms everywhere, which is one of the more inarguable forms that fame takes.
Returning to Hollywood after a rather disappointing season at the Old Vic in 1933 -- bitterly disappointing to him, if rather less so to the public and press -- he gave a sequence of indelible performances of uncommon pressure and intensity: Captain Bligh in "Mutiny on the Bounty," Javer in "Les Miserables" and Edward Moulton-Barrett in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street." The pressure derived partly from his anguished struggle with his homosexuality; his marriage to the actress Elsa Lanchester soon became one of convenience. His genius was to use his inner tensions in the service of art.
His work takes the art of acting to heights of imagination and poetry, perhaps to a degree rivalled in the 20th century only by Marlon Brando. Art mattered to Laughton. He was a deeply informed, largely self-educated aesthete, an authority on painting and sculpture, a connoisseur of the broadest range of literature. With high hopes for the development of the art of film, he returned to Britain again in 1938, to found Mayflower Productions with Erich Pommer, former boss of the great German studio UFA. But despite the intelligence and ambition of those involved, the three films they produced were oddly unsatisfactory, including Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn" (1939), a dubious if commercially successful farrago. Disappointed, Laughton returned once again to America, where he was soon to adopt citizenship. Although a Yorkshireman to his fingertips, he was in full flight from everything that he found oppressive about England: the class distinctions, the rigid sexual morality, the weather.
His first film when he came back to Hollywood was "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1939), in which he gives the peak performance of his career as Quasimodo. Whether he had burnt himself out with the demands he made of himself to create that image of suffering humanity, or whether his life was changing anyway, he never again invested a part with the same degree of imaginative fervor. While before he had seemed to be living out his life in acting, now he became a supreme craftsman of acting. His creative genius shifted into other areas.
Around this time, in the early 1940's, he found for the first time relaxed sexual fulfillment with a man, a young actor, and this long-delayed resolution seemed to free him up for more communicative, less self-involved forms of activity. He started a series of successful public readings -- of Shakespeare, the Bible, Dickens, Jack Kerouac -- primarily directed at young people; he taught acting in small groups at his house in Los Angeles; and he started directing for the stage. First there was a "Cherry Orchard" staged in a small theater in Los Angeles and cast partly with students. Then, on a grander scale, on Broadway and on tour, the Don Juan in Hell scenes from Shaw's "Man and Superman; "John Brown's Body," a dramatization of Stephen Vincent Benet's epic poem, starring Tyrone Power, and "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial," with Henry Fonda. By this last production, a huge commercial success, it was evident that he had become an exceptional theater director, and his manager, the vigorous, abrasive young agent Paul Gregory, determined that the time was ripe for Laughton to direct on film.
Apart from anything else, Gregory was convinced that Laughton was killing himself with the reading tours (which Gregory had set up in the first place), so at the first opportunity he snapped up what seemed to him a highly promising property, "The Night of the Hunter," a first novel by Davis Grubb that had not yet been published. His instinct was sound; on publication in 1953 the book went straight onto the best-seller list.
Laughton had fallen in love with the novel the moment he read it. Its hypnotic and incantatory tone was deeply appealing to him, as was its essentially American feel; his devotion to his adopted country and its literature was passionate. The novel's depiction of a struggle between good and evil -- the attraction of evil, the healing power of goodness and the ultimate triumph of innocence -- was something to which he could respond. He immersed himself in Grubb's work to such a degree that when the screenwriter, the esteemed James Agee, in his alcoholic befuddlement delivered an unfilmable screenplay, Laughton swiftly adapted the novel himself in a week.
His other collaborators proved more amenable; indeed, he created a singularly harmonious creative team, his chief partners being the cinematographer Stanley Cortez and the composer Walter Schumann. The time pressure exerted by United Artists (which betrayed scant enthusiasm from the beginning; his agent, Gregory, called the studio United Against Artists) meant that every day had to be planned in minute detail. Laughton gathered his team around him at the end of each day's shooting for intense discussions, which the participants remember as inspiring, with Laughton eloquently imparting to them his sense of the charged visual poetry he sought. Mr. Cortez, especially, felt profound sympathy with Laughton's objectives. His earlier encounter, in 1942, with Orson Welles on "The Magnificent Ambersons" had been tense and fraught (though equally productive). Here, shooting mostly on United's lot, he and Laughton worked to create, through the most economic means, some of the most potent imagery to come out of the American cinema.
The river journey of the fleeing children is told in a sequence of ravishing nature shots; while the haunting and ominous presence of the hymn-singing preacher ("Leaning! Leaning on the arm of the Lord!") on the horizon was achieved by a pony and a dwarf. Laughton, Mr. Cortez and his composer, Schumann, used every means at their disposal for expressive intensification, but all within a homespun, wholly American idiom, one that owed much to D. W. Griffith but that paid its borrowings back threefold.
Nor did Laughton's cast let him down. As the mother, the young Shelley Winters (a graduate of Laughton's acting classes) contributed a potent sexual presence if no great histrionic subtlety; Lillian Gish, Laughton's idol as a young man, purveyed the love without condition, the strength without threat, that the story demands; and Robert Mitchum, full of dark silky charm -- Love and Hate written across his face just as surely as they are across his knuckles -- gives the performance of his life, as he always acknowledged.
Almost as important as the adults are the children: Laughton tells the story through their eyes "as a kind of fairy story," he said. Billy Chapin as Billy distills the film's sturdy celebration of innocence in his big-eyed, single-minded performance. Laughton, sure of what he wanted and open to his fellow-artists in trying to realize it, created a rare focus. The second unit director, Terry Sanders, recalled Laughton's simplicity on the set.
"He spoke very quietly, but you sure listened," Mr. Sanders said. "He made you feel you were important, and this was important."
Gish wrote: "I have to go back as far as D. W. Griffith to find a set so infused with purpose and harmony.There was not ever a moment's doubt as to what we were doing or how we were doing it. To please Charles Laughton was our aim." 
Alas, America was not ready for his film. The previews were unfavorably received, and United Artists, never convinced of the film's viability, promoted it half-heartedly, preferring to concentrate on selling their next vehicle for Mitchum, "Not as a Stranger," which he had started shooting even before "The Night of the Hunter" was completed. The reviews were respectful and on the whole positive, though no one was quite able to understand what kind of film it was. Francois Truffaut, reviewing it in Cahiers du Cinema ("it makes one fall in love with an experimental cinema that really experiments and a cinema of discovery that actually discovers"), presciently observed that it would be unlikely if Laughton made another film. He never did.
The failure of "The Night of the Hunter" had broken Laughton's heart. He had found his metier: everything in his career and life so far had been preparing him for filmmaking, but it came too late for him to withstand the rough indifference of the commercial cinema. In the six more years left to him (he died in 1962), he gave a few more performances (including his magisterial Southern senator in "Advise and Consent," his last role); he played King Lear and Bottom at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater in Stratford-Upon-Avon; he continued the reading tours; and he found real love with a charming and handsome young man. But he never found it in himself again to lavish all of his genius on anything so personal and poetic as his lonely masterpiece.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 21 about the film "Night of the Hunter" misstated the name of the character played by Billy Chapin. It was John, not Billy. The article also included an erroneous version of a line from a hymn sung by the preacher played by Robert Mitchum. He sang, "Leaning on the everlasting arms," not "Leaning on the arm of the Lord."

HEADLINE: Music; 
Classical Recording: Spinning Into Oblivion?

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
ON May 1, George Scarlett, the vice president for product and vendor management of Tower Records, issued a directive to all 113 of the company's stores in the United States that rattled the already shaky classical music recording industry. His stark memorandum ordered an immediate buying hold on three independent distributors that have issued recordings highly valued by classical collectors: Allegro, Qualiton and Harmonia Mundi U.S.A. In addition, Tower asked all labels, large and small, for extended terms to pay for products it was ordering, an arrangement that amounted to ordering records on consignment.
 In any other industry such a move would be seen as typical maneuvering in economically strapped times. Classical recording, though, has always been an atypical industry. With rare exceptions, the labels produce specialty items for comparatively small numbers of informed buyers. But getting these products into the hands of those buyers is not easy, and the one retailer that all recording companies, especially the smaller ones, had long counted on was Tower Records, which used to pride itself on stocking virtually everything. 
 The classical recording industry seems to be collapsing, and aggrieved music lovers are looking for someone to blame. During the summer Tower was an easy villain. By fall, the retail chain, though grappling with its own deficit, had reached a tentative agreement with the independents. How long it will last is another matter. 
To be fair, Tower Records received an undue amount of criticism. True, the company has done its share to undermine the industry. A Tower store was once a serious place where classical music lovers could browse through rows of releases and discuss them with informed staff members. Today, after years of gobbling up the market and shoving aside small, independent retailers, the stores have become mall-like behemoths, featuring snack bars, bookstands and video rental departments.
Yet can any retailer be expected to stock everything when the market is so glutted with products? Mr. Scarlett estimates that in classical music alone, there are now some 60,000 items in the catalogs. "It would be physically impossible to stock all that," he said recently. "We don't have the shelf space." Confused consumers have gone from anger to frustration to apathy. Reportedly, the classical share of the total CD market, which had peaked at 7 percent during the height of CD mania, has slipped to 3 percent.
Several seemingly contradictory factors are causing the crisis in classical recording. While recording costs, especially for symphonic and operatic fare have skyrocketed, the cost of producing a CD -- actually making the thing -- has never been cheaper: roughly $1 per disc. For years retrenchment and lack of vision have characterized the five major companies that account for four-fifths of worldwide sales and are under pressure to make big profits: Universal, EMI, BMG, Sony and Warner. Consequently, scrappy independent labels that just aim to stay afloat and enjoy themselves have cropped up everywhere. The market has been flooded with recordings of neglected and offbeat repertory, and live performances from past decades (often obtained by skirting copyright laws, which are hopelessly outmoded anyway).
Some idealistic directors of independent companies view the situation as messy, yes, but full of promise. The little guys have defeated the big shots, all those capitalist banditos who took over the majors and signed up worthy classical artists only to toss them aside when unrealistic profit goals went unmet. Time is up, the argument goes, for those corporate suits who piled more and more versions of the Beethoven Fifth and "Tosca" onto the CD stockpile. Now the indies can rush into the breach.
But with Tower cutting back its services, how will the smaller labels get their products to consumers? Those troublemakers at Napster, who challenged the pop record producers by introducing computer programs that allowed users to download songs and albums free, may actually have been pointing the entire industry to the inevitable solution: the Internet.
Online shopping sites like Amazon.com and Borders already offer ways for consumers and recording companies to bypass retail stores, and this trend will continue. So far, downloading recordings directly through the Internet has been an issue, and a hassle, only in the pop field. That situation may be about to change.
For the moment, the major labels have won a legal battle against Napster. But other direct downloading services, like FastTrack, iMesh and Aimster, are cropping up. Obviously, few people would condone the theft, in effect, of copyrighted work from creative artists and the companies that record them. But if intellectual property rights lawyers and Internet engineers can find a way to compensate artists and producers properly, some manner of direct downloading may represent the future of the recording industry, classical recording included.
Why else would the five competing major companies and other media outlets have joined forces recently to set up Pressplay and MusicNet, two direct delivery downloading services? It would seem that the major companies and their lawyers are searching for legitimate ways to do what the upstarts at Napster got slapped down for.
Before international conglomerates started acquiring record companies about 20 years ago, the classical recording field was not doing badly. During the glory years of Columbia Records in the 1950's and 60's, Goddard Lieberson, a trained composer and critic, was the head of Columbia Masterworks, the company's classical division. The parent company, CBS, expected Lieberson to keep the company in the black and even make a little money. But not a lot of money. Recording classical music was considered a cultural service, a prestige operation.
Lieberson had top-selling classical artists on his roster: Leonard Bernstein, Glenn Gould, Isaac Stern and Rudolf Serkin, among others. But it was understood that, say, Serkin's recording of Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto would sell many more copies than his version of Max Reger's Piano Concerto. Dividends from Bernstein and Gould releases were used to offset money-losing projects, like the conductor Robert Craft's recordings of the complete works of Schoenberg and Webern, and the monumentally historic series featuring Stravinsky conducting his own works. Albums by artists in the company's popular division, like Bob Dylan, really paid the bills at Columbia, and kept the execs at CBS happy.
Today, the descendant of Columbia Masterworks is Sony Classical, a subsidiary of the Sony Corporation. This once illustrious classical division has been issuing pink slips to its demoralized staff since the summer. Paradoxically, the sensational success of certain crossover artists, like Andrea Bocelli and the Three Tenors on other labels, has had a pernicious influence on classical divisions like Sony's. Suddenly, corporate higher-ups realized that a classical recording could sell in the millions. The classical directors were told, in effect, "Fine, put out your prestige albums of Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting Lutoslawski, and Murray Perahia playing Bach, but find us marketable crossover artists who can pull in some real money."
Sony Classical, like most major companies, devised a two-pronged response. On one hand, they nurtured their top-selling artists like Yo-Yo Ma, signed up new artists like the soprano Jane Eaglen and brought out the Masterworks Heritage line, with reissued important recordings by Bernstein, Fritz Reiner, George Szell and the Budapest String Quartet, smartly packaged and with intelligent liner notes. In 1998, Sony began a highly praised series featuring the music of Gyorgy Ligeti. On the other hand, that same year, the company found its own crossover sensation: a 12-year-old singer from Wales, Charlotte Church.
By 1999 Sony Classical had abandoned the Ligeti project and scaled down the Masterworks Heritage line to almost nothing. Meanwhile, it made millions with the "Titanic" soundtrack album and kept sinking money into Ms. Church. Just the other day, the latest Sony release appeared: "Our Favorite Things," a "Christmas in Vienna" concert featuring Tony Bennett, Placido Domingo, Vanessa Williams and Ms. Church, performing with the Vienna Symphony, no less. Anything for money.
Obviously, executives at Sony Classical, who know how to count, have determined that this album will sell. All you can say is, rest in peace, Goddard Lieberson.
Meanwhile, the Ligeti project was picked up by Teldec, which has begun a sublabel for contemporary music called New Line. But don't count on New Line's longevity. Teldec is owned by Warner Classics, which acquired it a decade ago at great expense, along with Erato, another distinguished classical label. But recently, to cut costs, Warner closed down the headquarters of Teldec in Hamburg and Erato in Paris.
Both are now centralized in Warner's London offices. Among the casualties are Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which has lost its contract with Teldec. Many other artists have fallen by the wayside. For example, no sooner had two superb Erato recordings featuring a young Russian pianist, Nikolai Lugansky, playing the complete Chopin etudes and a Rachmaninoff program been released than the company canceled his contract.
Things are even starker at BMG, the company that owns and operates RCA Victor: the remnants of a once essential classical label. There have been staff cutbacks of more than 25 percent in response to a loss of $100 million during the fiscal year that ended in June. It will be weirdly fascinating to see what happens to the powerful Universal Classics, which includes Deutsche Grammophon, Philips and Decca, now that it has been acquired by the Vivendi company, known for waste management and environmental services, and now branching out into telecommunications and media.
The current market for classical recordings is chaotic and confusing. The smaller companies are turning out all sorts of unusual recordings. From the budget label Naxos you can pick up piano works by Sigismond Thalberg and the "Christmas Oratorio" by Bach's contemporary Gottfried Heinrich Stolzel. Symphonies by Svenden and piano concertos by Alwyn are available from Chandos, which recently brought back into circulation the 1970's recording of Wagner's "Ring" performed in English translation, a probing performance conducted by Reginald Goodall.
Yet the major companies have a repository of important older recordings of the standard repertory that they have let slip from the catalog. So right now, for example, you can buy a new Naxos album of works for male chorus by Janacek but not the remarkable 1961 Decca recording of Verdi's "Otello," conducted by Herbert von Karajan, with Mario del Monaco and Renata Tebaldi. For a critic, it's an exercise in frustration to recommend your favorite recordings of, say, Debussy. Inevitably half of your choices have been withdrawn.
Many small labels are run by dedicated people who do not expect to make much money. The composer Gunther Schuller manages GM Records, which has produced important recordings of contemporary music. When Mr. Schuller decided to bring out a complete survey of the Beethoven piano sonatas, it was because he had recruited a distinctive pianist with fresh insights into the works: Russell Sherman.
As another example, Peter Kermani and Susan Bush run both Albany Records, an independent label with 600 titles in its catalog that notably champions American music, and Albany Music Distributors, which handles some 90 smaller labels.
"The pullback at Tower Records really hurts us," Ms. Bush said recently. "Whatever we sold elsewhere, we could always count on a check from Tower to come in on the nose. That made for some semblance of cash flow." Ms. Bush is skeptical about the potential for the Internet as an alternative sales source. "Our perception is that many classical consumers are browsers, and older, and sometimes not even computer-literate," she said. "We sometimes put out only 200 copies of a recording. But I'm convinced there are 200 people out there who will want it. We as an industry haven't come up with another way of reaching them." Though some traditional collectors may not like it, that way may have to be the Internet.
The entire classical recording field is about to be challenged again by the arrival of new digital recording technologies: SACD (super audio compact disc) and DVD audio, which, adherents assert, represent staggering improvements over existing CD recording technology. These formats can sample the musical signal -- the sound, that is -- 2.8 million times per second, 64 times the rate for existing CD's. Many audiophiles who find the sound of digital recordings too cold and clinical, and even those analog holdouts who prefer the sound of long-playing stereo records, are getting excited over the new technologies.
In the past, a breakthrough like this would quickly have triggered a huge conversion to the new technology among producers and consumers, just as happened 20 years ago when digital recording was introduced: suddenly the major companies had an excuse to rerecord the entire standard repertory in the new format. Consumers responded with a madcap dash to their local CD stores.
My guess is that this time consumers will not leap so quickly. The industry is too much in flux, the economy too worrisome. Besides, a format war is going on between the competing technologies, and discerning classical music lovers may wait to see who wins. And right now, for all the advances, it is hard to imagine any direct downloading technology that could accommodate these super discs, so crammed with data.
So what will happen? Certainly, online shopping sites will proliferate. But what about direct downloading? A similar uncertainty hangs over the world of printed media. Will computer books relegate printed books to the recycling bin? Will printed newspapers disappear, as more and more people get their daily news online?
In a sense, the musical equivalent of the computer book arrived 20 years ago with the CD, which is, after all, nothing but a plastic-coated floppy disk. Leaving aside the legal complications, the problem with downloading recordings at home is that the results in terms of audio fidelity are inadequate for classical music listeners, especially if you listen through high-quality speakers. Downloading a three-minute rock song is one thing; downloading a three-hour Verdi opera is another. It would consume hours of time and use scads of space on your hard drive. Even then, the sound would not be of high quality.
But eventually that will change. Superfast cable lines that replace telephone hookups are vastly improving the audio quality of downloaded music. Given more time, the industry will solve this problem.
There may also be a middle-ground solution: recording companies will be able to list their complete catalogs online, then take a single order for a particular recording and print out ("burning," it's called) a copy for the waiting consumer. Imagine the space saved in warehouses and retail stores.
Still, direct downloading is also coming, as long as ways can be found to protect artists and producers. Napster, in its anarchic way, provoked a crisis by insisting that downloaded music be free.

BUT freedom of a certain kind is an issue here. After all, some artists have no problem with their work's being circulated on the Internet free. They have determined that, for now, the benefits of exposure outweigh the financial sacrifice. Most newspapers and magazines have come to the same conclusion, at least for now, and offer online access to their publications free. Eventually fees will probably be charged. But not while we are still adjusting to the new online world.
If the classical recording business goes online, music lovers will miss collecting albums they can hold in their hands. We love the idea that all nine Mahler symphonies can fit into a little box on our shelves. It's still a kick to see the entire Callas discography on EMI, 30 complete operas and 17 discs of recitals and rarities, all lined up on two shelves in my living room. On the other hand, I hate looking at the stacks of CD's on the floor in my office. All that clutter could be cleared away if more recordings were made available online.
Music lovers will miss browsing, of course. In the 1980's, the Harvard Coop in Cambridge had a thriving classical music section. Everyone's favorite sales clerk was Pamela Dellal, an aspiring mezzo-soprano by night, the czarina of the Coop's classical department by day. Buyers could count on her for trustworthy recommendations. Ask Ms. Dellal which recording of Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas" to get, and she would persuade you to buy two.
Today the Harvard Coop's classical music department is a mere remnant of what it was; Ms. Dellal is a successful singer; and the Internet is here to stay. If we want classical recordings to survive, we may just have to embrace it.

HEADLINE: Sag Harbor Factory's Toxic Legacy Lingers 

BYLINE:  By PETER BOODY

DATELINE: SAG HARBOR 

 BODY:
BUILT in 1881 by the son-in-law of a whaler on the site of a cotton mill built by out-of-work whaling captains, the Bulova Watch Case building once anchored Sag Harbor's industrial economy. The largest factory in a village of factories, it gave Sag Harbor a blue-collar tinge that made it the "unHampton" even into the booming 1980's. 
 No one calls Sag Harbor the "unHampton" anymore. But in a village where lavish renovations have put a polish on scores of 19th-century houses in recent years, the Bulova plant stands an ugly contradiction, its gutters dangling and its windows broken. Lost under a tangled mantle of ivy is a sign that went up more than 20 years ago, proclaiming the building's renaissance as the Watchcase condominium complex. It faded to illegibility even before the ivy took over. 
 Another legacy of Sag Harbor's industrial past is to blame. For a century, workers poured waste water containing heavy metals from cleaning solvents into the building's drainage system. Despite several years of cleanup efforts, the soil and ground water around the building are still saturated with it. Until New York State removes the building and its grounds from its list of Superfund toxic waste sites, it can't be redeveloped. 
But after nearly 20 years of difficulty and delay, there are new hopes the cleanup will be complete soon and that by this time next year work may begin to convert the building into a posh, Tribeca-style condo with high-priced, high-ceilinged apartments accented by exposed brick and beams.
Most villagers are eager for the conversion to take place. "I think the whole thing is terrific," said Arleen Ball, a local real estate broker. "For years, all of us have looked at that sad building. Let's get on with it." She said the market for condos has been taking off in the Hamptons and that the Bulova units would be snatched up quickly.
Hundreds of Sag Harbor men and women used to work at Sag Harbor's factories, including the Grumman plant on Long Wharf, where components of the Apollo lunar lander were manufactured, and Rowe Industries on the Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike, which made small electric motors for toys and toothbrushes.
Patrick E. Malloy, a local entrepreneur, converted the former Grumman property into a retail mall, restaurant and marina in the late 1970's. Rowe Industries, now known as Sag Harbor Industries and owned by Kraft foods, is the only site in the village still devoted to industrial use. It too is a Superfund toxic waste site. A cleanup, paid for by Nabisco -- a subsidiary of Kraft that bought the property -- is just getting under way.
But the Bulova plant, on Washington Street a block east of downtown Main Street, was the biggest of Sag Harbor's factories. Generations of local men and women worked there beginning in 1881, when Joseph Fahys, a German immigrant, married a local woman and moved his watch-making business from Queens to Sag Harbor. He was asked to do so by local business leaders, most of them former whalers or their sons, after the cotton mill they had built on the site burned down. They had begun transporting cotton with their whaling ships in the 1860's after petroleum replaced whale oil as the nation's primary fuel and lubricant.
Bulova bought the factory from the Fahys heirs in 1936 and closed its operation there in 1981. In 1984 the building's next owners made a deal to sell the property to Mr. Malloy.
The deal hit a brick wall when Mr. Malloy's agents discovered that the ground inside the factory's courtyard was saturated with heavy metals, including mercury and arsenic. He reported those findings to the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
It took a year and a half, Mr. Malloy said in a recent interview, for the E.P.A. and D.E.C. to decide which of them would have jurisdiction. It took the state another two years to decide how the cleanup should proceed, he added. And it took a lawsuit, filed by Mr. Malloy and the original developers, before Bulova agreed to pay for the cleanup, which didn't get fully under way until the mid-1990's, according to Ray Cowen, regional director of the D.E.C.
Meanwhile, Watchcase Factory Associates, which bought the building from Bulova for an undisclosed sum, remains the owner. Mr. Malloy remains the contract vendee. He, in turn, has a contract to sell the site and its zoning approvals to a group headed by Robert Gladstone, a New York businessman. Neither will discuss the selling price.
In May, all the interested parties and the state agreed on an outline that makes clear how the property can be "delisted" as a toxic waste site, said Randolph Croxton, the New York architect for the Gladstone partnership. "There are no ambiguous, open-ended things," he said.
The key to the building's restoration remains its delisting. Completing that process soon "is certainly the hope of all the parties, including me," Mr. Cowen said. But he warned that "any time you're dealing with environmental contamination, you're dealing with the unknown." Gases produced by the polluted soil and ground water are still collecting inside the building and remain at unacceptable levels for residential uses, he said.
A soil vapor extraction system was operated on the site for several years in the 1990's at Bulova's expense, and for a brief time it appeared to solve the vapor problem, Mr. Cowen said. But subsequent testing showed that air pollution levels were on the rise again inside the building.
More tainted soil must be removed, a process that should take only a few weeks. Another process, called soil sparging, in which air is forced into ground water to make it bubble and release gases, will take months. It must be conducted until the air quality in the building remains acceptable for full-time habitation, and no one knows for sure how long that will take, Mr. Cowen said.
There is also an emerging question about who will have the right to develop the site. In the 17 years since Mr. Malloy signed a contract to buy the Bulova plant, and the two years since he agreed to sell it to the Gladstone group, real estate prices have skyrocketed.
Mr. Malloy indicated that he and Mr. Gladstone's Madison Equities, which has been building commercial real estate in New York for 40 years, may be headed for a court fight. "There were various time frames and conditions" in their contract, he said, and "we believe they have all passed and they have not closed. It's up in the air whether or not they can close at any time." Now there are "notices going back and forth" between the two sides, he added.
Mr. Gladstone asserted that "there is a contract. All of his people are speaking to my people; they clearly recognize it."
Although Mr. Gladstone thinks the property could be developed successfully as a luxury hotel, which he proposed informally last November only to meet with some local resistance, he sees a loft-style condominium project as a valuable addition to Sag Harbor as well.
"It would probably be the only lofts available on the East End," he said. "Sag Harbor has been the most dramatically changed of all the East End communities in the last 25 years, generally for the better. It has kept its character and somehow you don't feel it's a snobby part of the Hamptons. We're banking on the fact that a lot of people will become permanent residents, young and old, and people in the arts."

Tastes of Istanbul Settle in Glen Cove

BYLINE:  By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM; E-mail: licarte@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ASIDE from a picture or two in the rest rooms there are no figs at the two-month-old Wild Fig Turkish Restaurant in Glen Cove. But there are Turkish waitresses in the dining room, Turkish food and wine on the tables, Turkish music in the air and photographs of old Istanbul and handmade Turkish tiles on the walls.
 The extensive menu (mezzes, salads, kebabs, fish, steak, chops, combination plates, pides, specialties, smoothies, desserts) at this sparkling, spacious new storefront at 167 Glen Street (516-656-5645) features simple, super-fresh food, most of it quite good. 
 A roaring wood-burning pizza oven and a row of benches covered with Turkish prayer rugs are at the entrance to Wild Fig. The high-ceilinged dining room with its colorful tile borders, panels and columns, cylindrical blue candleholders and floor-to-ceiling windows is a bright, sunny, cheerful place. 
Rounds of billowing, blistered Turkish pita bread appear moments after patrons are seated and keep coming until dessert time.
Despite a crass neon arrow pointing to its takeout counter, the Wild Fig is a bit more elaborate and expensive than some modest neighborhood Turkish spots, yet still in the economy class. Entrees are less costly than they seem ($9 to $19). They come with vegetables, rice, tomato, onion and yogurt sauces and a choice of soup or salad. The Greek salad, with its mantle of shredded feta cheese, tangy Kalamata olives, hot pickled peppers and superior olive oil dressing, is a cut above most throw-ins, though the usual canned peas and carrots and nondescript rice are less than exciting.
Most mezzes, or appetizers, can (and should) be ordered as part of a sampler platter (four for $9.95, eight for $19.95). The creamy, mild tarma salad, or Turkish caviar, spicy tomato spread with its welcome zing, soothing roasted eggplant salad and tasty mayonnaise-free cubed potato salad with onions and parsley in a lemon and olive oil marinade were especially noteworthy. Use your flat bread to sop, soak and scoop.
Say yes to the boat-shaped brick-oven pides ($8 to $10), or Turkish oven-baked pizzas. Sufficient for four to six eaters, they are super starters. The kashar cheese version ($8) is an appealingly seasoned, light, cheesy, tomato-flecked delight. Also recommended, though not quite as enthusiastically, is lamajun ($8.95), a crisp, though malleable, paper-thin pizza-like possibility sprinkled with minced meat, onion, parsley and sumac that can be rolled into it. Unfortunately, that minced beef doesn't have the spice kick it should and is but one example of the Wild Fig playing it safe, perhaps concerned that Americans might not appreciate the robust seasonings and heady flavors of authentic Turkish cooking. 
In the same category was pureed, though pallid, yellow lentil soup ($2.25) that was resuscitated by three or four shakes of salt, bland babaganoush ($4.50) and two skewers of adama kebab ($11) that needed more vivid seasoning.
Shrimp and flat fish, delivered sizzling hot on metal platters, suffered no such fate. A delicate, easy-to-overcook flounder ($13) was perfectly prepared and served in a tomato and onion sauce that had a sweet, though not unpleasant underpinning. A fine, flaky, full-of-flavor Chilean sea bass ($14), with its ends just a touch overdone, was close behind, and five truly jumbo shrimp ($14), swimming in an oniony tomato sauce, was a dish I'd order again. So was the tender, medium-rare barbecued Romanian skirt steak ($13.50) and the Mediterranean salad crowned with either firm grilled shrimp ($12), a skewer of moist chicken kebab ($9) or a generous tangle of boldly seasoned gyro ($9).
Desserts ($2 to $3), from a bakery in Brooklyn, are the expected sweet, honey-soaked, nut-studded and stuffed crew. The kadaif, a feathery shredded-wheat pastry wrapped around a honeyed ground walnut filling, is probably the best of the predictable bunch. Instead, drink your dessert by ordering a fresh fruit or vegetable juice or smoothie ($2.50 to $3) served in a tall, slim, graceful Pilsner-like glass. These orange, banana, berry, pineapple, mango, carrot and yogurt combinations taste as good as they look.

Openings
Next month when the four DeNicola brothers (Leo, Douglas, James and Joseph) open Ruvo, a 50-seat Italian restaurant at 63 Broadway in Greenlawn (631-261-7700), their grandmother's recipes will be in the kitchen and their father's art will be on the walls.
Ruvo, named for a town south of Naples that is the family's ancestral home, has been constructed with the beams, floors and walls from an upstate barn owned by the DeNicolas' uncle. Their country-Italian restaurant, featuring Tuscan and Southern Italian dishes, will offer fresh, local produce and game at entree prices in the $12 to $19 range.
James DeNicola will preside in the dining room, while his brother Joseph will be the executive chef. 

Potpourri
Stresa, at 1524 Northern Boulevard, in Manhasset (516-365-6956), is holding a fund-raiser for the victims of the World Trade Center tomorrow from 6 to 10 p.m. The four-course, $80 dinner that includes wine begins with a one-hour cocktail hour.

Contracts Are Hard To Break

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
IF there is one thing a real estate lawyer dreads, it is hearing a client under contract to buy or sell a house or apartment utter the words: "I've changed my mind. Get me out of this deal."
 The reason for the discomfort is not that real estate lawyers are skittish about engaging in legal skirmishes, but that most are not inclined to fight battles they are likely to lose. And trying to get a client out of a well-drafted real estate contract, lawyers say, is often a losing battle. 
 "Whenever a client comes to me and says 'I can't go through with this deal,' " said Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, "the first thing I'll usually say is, 'This is not going to be easy.' " 
Indeed, Mr. Gonchar said, since the primary goal of both buyers and sellers negotiating a real estate contract in good faith is to arrive at an agreement that neither party can break, a well-drafted contract will keep the parties in the deal until the property changes hands for the agreed-upon price. 
"Litigation for breach of a real-estate contract can take years to resolve," Mr. Gonchar said. "And it usually ends up costing both sides lots of money." 
Felix Nihamin, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who also practices in New Jersey, said that in most cases, real estate contracts contain provisions -- typically referred to as "contingencies" -- that allow one party or the other to back out of the deal, usually without penalty, under certain circumstances. For example, he said, most contracts are contingent upon the purchaser's obtaining a commitment for a mortgage within a specific period of time. If the buyer cannot obtain the commitment within that time -- after having made a good faith effort to do so -- then either party generally has the right to cancel the contract. 
Another common contingency found in contracts for the sale of a home in New Jersey, Mr. Nihamin said, permits the buyer to have the house inspected to determine whether it has any serious structural or mechanical defects. (In New York and Connecticut, such issues are often addressed before the contract is signed.) In most cases, the buyer will then be able to get out of the deal if the inspection reveals serious problems and the seller declines to either remedy them or adjust the price.
Yet another contingency -- one commonly found in sales contracts for co-op apartments -- is a provision that conditions the sale upon approval by the co-op's board. If the board does not give the approval, Mr. Nihamin said, both parties are relieved of their obligations under the contract. 
"In most cases, the only way out of a contract is if a contingency has not been met," Mr. Nihamin said, adding, however, that it may be possible for a party to get out of a contract if circumstances change significantly after a contingency has been met.
For example, he said, if a buyer loses a job -- or a substantial portion of his or her income -- after a mortgage commitment has been issued, the lender is likely to withdraw the commitment. And while the seller's lawyer could claim that once the commitment had been accepted by the buyer, the contingency had been satisfied, Mr. Nihamin said he believes the change in circumstances may provide a sufficient basis for the buyer to get out of the contract. 
"Within the past month alone, I've gotten three clients out of contracts because of a change in financial circumstances," Mr. Nihamin said, referring to clients who lost all or much of their income as a result of the World Trade Center disaster.
It might also be possible for a buyer to get out of a contract or at least renegotiate its terms if the amount the property is appraised for is reduced after the commitment has been issued and the commitment is conditioned on the original appraisal. 
"I had one deal where the appraisal on a property was reduced by 10 percent," he said, adding that in this case, rather than attempt to cancel the deal, the buyer requested a reduced purchase price, and the seller agreed to it. 
In most cases, however, buyers or sellers who try to wriggle their way out of a real estate sales contract want to do so for more practical reasons: the buyer has found a better house at a better price; the seller has found a buyer willing to pay more money; or one or the other has simply changed his or her mind. 
Scott Konner, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that when a buyer or seller decides to back out of a contract for no legitimate reason, the terms of the contract itself generally dictate what happens next. And most real estate contracts used in New York usually treat defaulting buyers differently than defaulting sellers. 
"In my opinion, Rule No. 1 is that every real estate contract should provide that the total liability of the buyer in the event of a default is the amount of the buyer's deposit," he said, referring to the 10 percent deposit typically paid at the time a contract is signed. Such a provision, also known as a "liquidated damages clause," basically specifies the amount of money that the seller is entitled to if the buyer defaults.
Mr. Konner explained that some contracts -- particularly those used by developers marketing new properties -- may contain a provision giving the seller the right to demand what is known as "specific performance" on the part of the buyer. This means that instead of keeping the buyer's deposit, the seller can instead insist the buyer "specifically perform" the contract by going through with the sale. Generally speaking, Mr. Konner said, if a buyer's lawyer insists that the specific performance provision be taken out of the contract, the seller will usually comply because the courts are quite reluctant to hold a buyer to specific performance. 
On the other hand, Mr. Konner said, buyers generally want the right to demand specific performance from the seller and courts are typically inclined to grant it.
"When you're a seller, you can't just walk away from the deal," he said, explaining that under New York law a buyer is usually entitled to specific performance from the seller even if the contract does not explicitly provide for it. There are certain circumstances, however, where the seller may be able to get out of a contract. For example, Mr. Konner said, when there is a problem with the title to a property that the seller cannot resolve, most contracts allow him to back out of the deal.
Just being legally entitled to demand a defaulting buyer's deposit if you're a seller -- or a defaulting seller's specific performance if you're a buyer -- does not provide any guarantee that either will be easy to get. 
Dennis Greenstein, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller who is in breach of the contract, -- it is generally a court that will end up as the final arbiter of the dispute. And that, he said, often makes it more economical for the parties to work out their differences themselves. 
"The time involved, the cost involved and the uncertainty of the outcome make settling a dispute in court a risky proposition for both parties," Mr. Greenstein said. "So if there is a way for the parties to come to an agreement both sides can live with, that's probably going to be the best possible outcome."

Business Seeks Youth. The Young Seek Housing.

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH; E-mail: libiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BRIAN POTTS, 25, lives with his parents in East Islip, in the bedroom where he grew up. It's not his ideal living situation, said Mr. Potts, a video technician who works for Hofstra University. "I could move into a fraternity house near Hofstra," he said. "But I know how the guys live there, and it isn't for me."
 Mr. Potts also does after-hours video work in Manhattan, but his income still falls short of what he needs to rent his own place. As for finding a roommate through a newspaper ad, that's something he rejects as too risky. Meanwhile, the daily commute from East Islip to Hempstead is wearing him out. 
 "I would love to live in a nice, quiet community near where I work, where I wouldn't have to worry about my car being broken into," he said. "But I look at ads and I can't afford it."
Amy Shipman, 22, is preparing to graduate in December from St Joseph's College in Patchogue, where she majors in mathematics and computer science. An intern with Symbol Technologies, she hopes the Holtsville wireless technology giant makes her an employment offer soon. She too lives with her parents, in Ronkonkoma, and expects that's where she'll stay for at least another two years.
"I'd love to move out the day I graduate, but I have to save money," Ms. Shipman said. "Eventually, I'd like to buy a condo." 
Meanwhile she scouts the apartment ads in places like Phoenix.
"The difference in price is phenomenal," she said, comparing housing markets. "In Suffolk, I'm looking at paying $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom. In Phoenix, I get a two-bedroom for $600. That includes swimming pool and gym."
The availability of housing for young people is a perennial problem here. Housing experts say that slandwide the average one-bedroom apartment rents for $1,003, two-bedrooms for $1,230 -- more than most entry-level workers can afford. While some 20- and 30-somethings accept cramped lodgings in undesirable neighborhoods, most chose to continue living under the parental roof, or move somewhere else entirely.
"Living at home is what I'd call the Long Island young adult syndrome," Mr. Potts mused.
That problem is attracting increasing attention these days from Long Island's business and community leaders, who fear that the housing crunch faced by young workers may hurt the region's economic vibrancy and competitiveness. Long Island lost 6 percent of its 20- to 44-year-old population during the 1990's, according to census data, and business and civic leaders -- many of them parents whose own children are priced out of the market -- are stepping up efforts to broaden the region's housing supply.
While many concentrate their efforts mainly on price, others are focused on expanding the range of housing options. Their efforts are encouraging renovation of over-the-store apartments in downtown areas, lobbying local governments to ease up on restrictions against rental units within private homes, and pushing for development of low- and moderately-priced housing in the form of condominiums, rental units and mixed-use communities.
Housing advocates say that more business leaders are joining their coalitions. Developers say that there is slowly growing acceptance of projects calling for mixed-use, denser housing. Some of the projects, including a Long Island Housing Partnership project underway in downtown Bay Shore, are putting up the kind of multidweller rental units close to downtown that many single young professionals find appealing and that Long Island civic groups often find appalling.
Earlier this year, the housing partnership knocked down about eight acres of blighted housing in downtown Bay Shore and is constructing 78 units, about a third of which will be rentals, said James Morgo, the group's president. He said the project exemplified the kind of mixed-use development Long Island needs.
"We're mixing owners with renters, we're rehabilitating a downtown area, and the housing is near public transportation," Mr. Morgo said. "It's already attracting a broad range of younger workers."
Businesspeople are increasingly joining established coalitions of social advocates, clergy, government agency representatives and labor leaders in promoting mixed-use housing developments encompassing lower-priced residences, stores and work sites. Most try to blend owner-occupied with rental units.
"It's not just an issue about the homeless anymore," said Edward Hernandez, a housing advocate and chairman of the board of directors of the Nassau-Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless. Several weeks ago, Mr. Hernandez organized a strategic planning session around affordable housing that drew notables from private industry, banking, health care, public schools, construction and government.
"Everybody has a story where the kids go away to college and when they graduate, they can't find a place on Long Island to rent," Mr. Hernandez said. "The lack of affordable housing hits home in every community."
During the summer, the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., research center, released a report naming Long Island the most expensive housing market in the country. A study released recently by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, also in Washington, ranks Long Island among the nation's five most expensive rental markets.
Last month in Farmingdale, at a discussion on high-tech business issues hosted by Polytechnic University's Wireless Innovation Program, executives from three companies listed employee recruitment and retention as the major growth impediment they faced, and linked those concerns directly to housing.
High-tech companies find it difficult to recruit graduates of schools from other areas, the executives agreed, and put the blame largely on housing costs. Most recruiting is done among local graduates, said Phil McLaughlin, one of the panelists. The executives on the panel acknowledged that the practice narrows the region's talent and knowledge pool, and undermines Long Island's ambitions as a center of high-tech innovation.
"There's a real fear that when you hire someone and train him, he is going to leave after a few years, perhaps relocating to another region where there's a higher concentration of high-tech businesses," said Mr. McLaughlin, the vice president and a general manager at EEG Enterprises, a video technology company in Farmingdale. "As a result, we've staffed up with somewhat older people, in their 30's and 40's, who are perhaps less likely to relocate. But that means we're not getting the younger engineers who are enormously productive and who work at lower salaries."
And, he might have added, have the most up-to-date training in emerging technologies.
Long Island's housing stock is about 80 percent single homes, one of the highest percentages in the country, said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association. Most of that housing excludes younger workers not only financially, but in terms of lifestyle.
"Few young people, if any, leave college and buy a single-family house," Mr. Crosson said. "Our region's most pressing need is for rental apartments for young people. In order for us to have the work force we need in the future, we must keep younger people here. That will not happen unless they have attractive places to live."

HEADLINE: How's Business? Terrorist Acts Deal a Blow To the Economy 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
ON the surface, little has changed in Westchester since Sept. 11.
 Talk on the street has largely returned to the weather, the traffic and the Yankees. If it weren't for the headlines and the flapping flags on car windows, one might not know the nation is at war. 
 But the county's economic landscape has been scarred. The impact of the terrorist attacks can be seen on the merchandise racks and ledger sheets of chain stores, in the pockets of the sidewalk merchant and in the the county treasury. 
News of the attacks initially paralyzed an already declining economy. Some businesses have since rebounded, but many remain weak, from those in the travel-related industry to those that supply Manhattan restaurants.
Some companies have found ways to increase business by tapping into new national currents, including patriotism, fear and sympathy.
Real estate brokers are getting calls from Manhattanites seeking to flee Ground Zero. Niche businesses, like those that sell gas masks and security systems, are prospering.
And there are others, including a man in a wheelchair who for years has sold lollipops on Main Street in White Plains. Now he hawks miniature American flags and key chains. He buys them in bulk in his hometown, Yorktown Heights, and sells them for $2 apiece on the sidewalks of the busy cities down county. 
At the B. Dalton bookstore in The Westchester mall, the display racks near the checkout counter are lined with books on germ warfare, Osama bin Laden and the New York City skyline. Next to a "Halloween Hits" CD is the paperback version of "The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook."
Nearby in the mall, a store called The Game Keeper has been briskly selling war games and any other board games vaguely related to the war on terrorism. Old classics, like Axis & Allies, Risk and Stratego are hot, as is New York Chase, which pits a fugitive against New York police detectives and whose box features the World Trade Center.
"This is going to be a big year for us," said James Stone, the store manager. "People want something to keep their mind off all this mess."
But some people cannot manage that. Alex Philippidis, editor in chief of The Westchester County Business Journal, said he has seen a malaise among business leaders.
"We're physically the same, at least until they say 'Ration this and ration that,' but emotionally something has changed," he said. "There is fear in the business world. People are emotionally frayed and that spills over into their business."
Paul Rutkowski, a massage therapist from White Plains, has canceled many appointments. At the counter of the Corner Nook coffee shop recently, while many customers sat reading war headlines, Mr. Rutkowski, who is blind, patted his guide dog and made cell phone calls to customers telling them he had to cancel because his "energy is really down these days."
The sharp drop-off in business in New York City, whether in dining, entertainment or tourism, has had a ripple effect that hurts business in Westchester, said Salvatore J. Carrera, the county's director of economic development and real estate.
"Everybody's hurting," he said. "This touches every industry in the county, from the freelance photographer who could always rely on steady work in the city, to the baker delivering bread to city restaurants that are no longer getting business."
The disaster will ultimately cost the county government many millions of dollars, he said, from the expense of sending assistance teams to the city after the attacks to the $7.25 million the county plans to spend outfitting many of its buildings with new security systems.
But, Mr. Carrera vowed: "We're already coming back. We're trying to make small business owners aware of small business loans and other incentive plans, like sales tax abatements for upgrading your office equipment."
Certain niche industries, he added, have been faring better than usual, including answering the demand for gas masks and other military paraphernalia.
"Army surplus supply stores are doing bang-up business, more than they ever anticipated," he said, adding that security companies are also benefiting from fear of further terrorist attacks.
Since Sept 11, the demand for security systems for commercial and residential properties has "increased on a daily basis," said Howard L. Shapiro, a sales manager for ADT Security in Elmsford, a branch of the national company.
The branch handles residential and commercial alarm systems, including closed circuit television.
"It's unfortunate because of the human tragedy that we have gotten some more business from the disaster," he said, adding that "security has been escalated to a major concern at small businesses, everything from jewelry stores to restaurants.
"With all the talk about what may occur, people are more aware of who's next to them or around them," Mr. Shapiro said. He would not name his clients, but he said that ADT has provided security for "some of the core commercial buildings and banks and department stores in the county."
"Department stores and malls here are frightened that something is going to happen," he said. "They're more aware of the importance of security and they're looking toward systems of one type or another to secure their premises."
Similarly, there is general insecurity in many business circles, said Mr. Philippidis. The week of the collapse, he had scheduled about six business networking events to cover, he said. All were canceled.
"As insensitive an observation as it is, the collapse in the business world was bad timing," he said. "The economy was slipping already. Usually by the second week in September, business begins to take off around here. Children are back in school and the business community is back in full swing.
"We had a lot of national chains coming into Westchester, but now you got to wonder."
But Mr. Carrera said the county was optimistic about getting back on its path to "an economic renaissance." The disaster, he said, has caused an apprehension about living and working in Manhattan, which could wind up bringing business and new residents to Westchester.
"You hate to think of benefiting from a disaster like this, but we'll see an increased activity here in residential and commercial property, and it will happen naturally."
He did admit that the county missed one opportunity after the collapse. County officials were hoping that some companies displaced from the World Trade Center would rent office space in Westchester. The county immediately set up a clearinghouse, offering to companies the large blocks of office space available here, some as big as 700,000 square feet. But county officials were disappointed: there were virtually no takers.
"There were no major signed deals Westchester could beat its breast about," said Mr. Carrera, who still holds out hope.
Because of convenience, many companies moved to New Jersey and to space in Midtown Manhattan recently vacated by failed dot-com companies, Mr. Carrera said.
But other companies did look to the suburbs for offices. American Express and Citicorp, for example, took offices in the Stamford area. Mr. Carrera attributed this to the fact that many of the top executives live there.
He called many of these decisions snap judgments and short-term arrangements. Once the companies eventually "come to their senses," he said, they could well choose to set up offices in Westchester.
Robert T. Guerra, manager of The Westchester mall said that "sales are very strong" at the mall, which closed for the day on Sept. 11 and suffered for days afterward.
"It was a tough week," he said. "People were glued to their TV's. But we've seen an increase, and sales are picking up." The cooler weather has brought customers back school shopping, he said.
"We had a good Columbus Day and the weekends have been strong," he said. Retailers are optimistic about the holiday season, which the mall ushers in by mid-November with holiday decorations and a live Santa Claus.
Many mall merchants, however, said that customer traffic has declined, and there are more items on sale.
Mr. Guerra insisted that business is as strong as ever. Three major companies, he said, are planning to open stores before the holidays: an Elizabeth Arden spa, an Aveda store and a Victorinox store.
Mitchell C. Hochberg, president and chief executive officer of Spectrum Skanska, the largest home builder in Westchester, said that the number of people looking to buy homes dipped the first couple of weeks after Sept. 11, but has since rebounded.
"It's not the way it used to be," he said, "but over the last five years we had a market that was unusually intoxicated." His company has shown homes to a handful of New York City residents.
"They were visibly upset and felt they needed to get out of Manhattan," he said. "They were couples who were very panicked and said, 'We need to move out of New York.' "
Spectrum Skanska has recently completed two residential communities -- the BelleFair in Rye Brook and the Legends at Purchase -- and sold all the units there.
Melissa L. Cohn, who owns Manhattan Mortgage, a large New York-based company with a branch in Purchase, said that because interest rates are so low, "the Westchester market has been on fire" for the past month. Neither war nor rumors of war stop people from house hunting, she said.
"It's business as usual," she said. "People are still marrying, still having kids. What do you expect? You can't put your child in the bathtub."
Nancy Kennedy, a real estate broker who handles northern Westchester, said that even a slowing economy cannot seriously weaken the Westchester real estate market because there are always plenty of prospective buyers vying for a limited inventory of properties.
But when the stock market drops, she added, so do sales of high-end homes, because buyers no longer rolling high choose more modest homes.
"People may be nervous about the market, or they may not have the down payment they had six months to a year ago," said Ms. Kennedy, who works at the Coldwell Banker Perry Kennedy firm in Croton-on-Hudson. Also, she said, people are delaying plans to "trade up," or sell their homes to buy more expensive ones.
"Right after the collapse, things were paralyzed, but over the past two weeks, we're seeing more listings," she said. "People are deciding they have to get on with their lives, and they know that interest rates are phenomenally low right now."
Since Sept. 11, she said, many of her prospective buyers are Manhattan residents seeking to move to Westchester.
"We had a lot of people calling saying things like, 'I want to get out of the city now,' " she recounted. "They were saying, 'I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I want it to happen.' "
Bruce J. Gold, co-owner of Gold Service Movers in White Plains, tells a story about meeting with a customer near Canal Street the morning of the attack. When the planes struck, Mr. Gold fled north and watched the towers burn in his rear-view mirror while driving along the West Side Highway.
"I'll never forget that sight," said Mr. Gold, who has had less luck escaping the aftermath of the disaster.
He has a 20-truck fleet and a steady base of customers. He does not lack for work, he said. But much of his business involves moving clients to or from the city. With the police inspecting trucks at most bridges, his trucks are facing delays. It often takes twice as long to do a given job now, he said.
"It takes four hours to go from Queens to White Plains," he said. "The customer doesn't want to pay for the delay, and my workers get paid by the hour, so it hurts."
Also hurting is Westchester County Airport. After Sept. 11, commercial airlines there could barely sell tickets. Now, business is rebounding slowly, but airport businesses are still suffering. 
For example, you often have your choice of tables at the Skytop Restaurant, which overlooks the runways. The snack bar and newspaper stands get little traffic and there are rarely lines at car rental counters.
The county's airport limousine industry is also suffering. There are roughly 200 licensed companies operating car services in Westchester, with 4,000 cars and 4,000 chauffeurs, said Rich J. Guberti, vice chairman of the Westchester Taxi and Limousine Commission. 
Mr. Guberti said that many companies are ready to declare bankruptcy and others are applying for emergency business loans.
"The first three weeks, business was down 90 percent," Mr. Guberti said. He recently laid off half his staff at Excel Transportation, the large limousine service he owns in New Rochelle. "We are completely dependent upon air travel," he explained. "We're basically airlines on wheels.
"For the past 20 years, we've been taking in $5 million," he said. "Even being optimistic, we'd be lucky if we break $2 million this year."
Referring to the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, he said: "It's not only us. All business in Westchester is hostage to this situation."
A lingering fear of flying plagues travel agencies also. Many smaller companies are finding it harder to keep their offices open and have merged with other agencies. For example, many have joined Rich Worldwide Travel, one of the largest agencies in the county with branches in Harrison and Somers.
"After the attacks, business totally dropped off; no one would go anywhere," said Nathan Devore, co-president of Rich Worldwide. "Even now, most customers will only take domestic flights, not overseas.
"They don't want to be so far away from home," Mr. Devore said, adding that customers will only book a trip "as long as they can get in a car and drive home" if they have to.
To offset slumping business, the company is using promotions and bargains for local trips, including theme weekends in the Poconos, rafting trips in Vermont and overnight visits to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. There are half-price specials at the Canyon Ranch in Lenox, Mass.
With fewer corporate employees willing to fly, the agency has begun arranging local hotel rentals that offer teleconferencing.
"Let's just say we're looking forward to ski season," Mr. Devore said, adding that terrorism has reduced prices on certain trips.
"You want a room in Manhattan? I can get it cheap."

HEADLINE: Eager To Seize The Power 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
AS autumn leaves litter walkways and mild breezes give way to brisk dawns, there is another unmistakable sign that a change of seasons is upon the State House: the steady buzz of resumes grinding through fax machines.
 For the first time since the 1989, an incumbent governor in New Jersey is not waging a campaign to remain in office, leaving a power vacuum that will quickly begin to fill up after the November election. It will signal a clear change in the way business is conducted -- who is important, who is not and who will get the lucrative state contracts. 
 The shift in power, through a reshuffling of the governor and his cabinet, will also prompt a change in priorities and in the personalities who will pursue them during an unenviable time when tax revenue is dropping and budget deficits appear on the horizon.
Aside from the usual duties the governor's commissioners will face, those serving in a new administration will also be confronted by the daunting task of dealing with homeland security, terrorist threats and the rapid response to possible attacks while at the same time maintaining the public confidence and keeping the state's economy on a stable course. 
Some fear that a cabinet under Bret D. Schundler, the former mayor of Jersey City, will be stacked with conservative Republicans who are not very reflective of the moderate base of the party in the state. Others say the cabinet of James E. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, will be controlled not only by Mr. McGreevey but also by the Democratic power brokers who are playing a leading role in his campaign.
Among those who are helping to call the shots are the handful of party apparatchiks who prevented Senator Robert G. Torricelli from wrenching the Democratic nomination from Mr. McGreevey last year.
The top advisors in Mr. McGreevey's campaign include his political mentor, State Senator John Lynch; Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey; George Norcross, the Camden County Democratic chairman; and Mayor Sharpe James of Newark.
"There is going to be a key group of players that will remind McGreevey on a daily basis that if it weren't for them, he wouldn't be sitting in the governor's chair," one political observer noted. "They may demand a bigger hand in how things get done."
Tom Gallagher, the communications director for Mr. Schundler's campaign, said it was likely that Mr. McGreevey would be beholden to the special interests that have been financing his race and to the Democratic Party machine, which has been instrumental to his campaign.
But Richard McGrath, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, said such talk was unfounded.
"Jim McGreevey has always appointed the best and the brightest, and as governor he would do that with a completely open mind," Mr. McGrath said. "The perverse irony is that the Schundler campaign is making those types of predictions when they have two of the co-conspirators on the Parsons scandal ranking as top officials in their campaign."
Mr. McGrath was referring to the deal approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature to hire Parsons Infastructure and Technology Group to operate the state's auto emissions testing program. The arrangement was widely criticized by the State Commission of Investigation, which found that Parsons and its lobbyists manipulated the state's bidding process to win the contract. Dick Kamin, former director of the Division of Motor Vehicles, oversaw the contract, and Frank Holman, a former executive director of the Republican State Committee, was a lobbyist for Parsons. Mr. Kamin was named by Mr. Schundler as co-chairman of the Republican State Committee, and Mr. Holman has been a top adviser to the campaign.
"It's obvious that Mr. Schundler is very selective on his high-level appointments," Mr. McGrath said. "If he gets elected, New Jersey could expect that he would import the archconservatives that he resembles."
But Mr. Gallagher, the Schundler campaign spokesman, scoffed at the suggestion and said: "Bret Schundler is not beholden to any established political power structure, like the Democratic machine in New Jersey. His appointments would not be beholden to the decisions of the other politicians about who to have in his own administration."
Walter Fields, a consultant working for the Republicans and a former political director of the New Jersey chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he had been impressed with the way Mr. Schundler had dealt with the diverse interests in Jersey City while mayor.
"He certainly has more experience governing a diverse community than Jim McGreevey, and no one can deny that," Mr. Fields said. "It could serve him well as governor of one of the most diverse states in the country."
No matter what the outcome, the result of this election will drastically alter the stature and structure of the Republican and Democratic parties in the state.
For the first time in a decade, Democrats are well poised to win one, if not all three, seats of government, paving the way for a few law firms and lobbyists to vault to center stage after sitting on the sidelines during the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman. There is a feeling of buoyant anticipation among the ranks of the Democratic Party, where talk of cabinet posts swirl through cocktail party conversations. 
Republicans are neither so united nor so exuberant. As a sign of the festering political wounds afflicting the party, some see a transition of power from Acting Gov. Donald DiFrancesco to Mr. McGreevey as much more friendly than if Mr. DiFrancesco is forced to turn over his office keys to Mr. Schundler.
That the Republicans currently hold the governor's office is of little help to Mr. Schundler. He has been unable or unwilling to appease Mr. DiFrancesco's anger at being left on the sidelines for the governor's race -- a contest in which Mr. DiFrancesco had envisioned himself as the featured star. Mr. DiFrancesco chose to withdraw from the primary amid a flurry of newspaper articles about his business dealings in the private sector, which he believed were fed to the media by Mr. Schundler.
The two men have not formally met since Mr. Schundler won the primary in June. Some within the Republican Party remain hopeful there will be an eventual endorsement from Mr. DiFrancesco, noting that he and Mr. Schundler were recently seen together at a Republican fund-raising event in Philadelphia and appeared friendly. But even if an endorsement does come, it may well be seen as almost meaningless at this late stage in the race. 
"What's weird is that a McGreevey election would not be a hostile takeover, but a Schundler victory almost would be a hostile takeover," said Jon J. Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspectives and once a spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio. "There's no doubt there would be more tension in that transition."
Mr. DiFrancesco denies such assertions, saying he will treat each candidate with the same respect, regardless of who wins the governor's race.
"A transition is really an institutional function; it's not about personalities," said Tom Wilson, a spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco. "This office will be nothing but 100 percent helpful and supportive of whoever wins. They will be given the same level of help and assistance."
To be sure, a smooth transition is crucial, and to a large extent determines how effectively the new governor can operate early in his term.
"If McGreevey wins, I envision a transition to be the same as Byrne and Kean, which is friendly and which leads to early appointments and early information being exchanged," said Harold Hodes, a Democratic lobbyist who was chief of staff to Gov. Brendan Byrne.
Mr. Hodes explained that when the Republican Tom Kean took office, he had a strong relationship with his Democratic predecessor, Gov. Brendan Byrne. For example, Mr. Kean told Mr. Byrne what his preferences were on appointments and policies and that Mr. Byrne helped facilitate them during his final months in office.
With the arriving and departing governors at odds, however, all sorts of wild scenarios can be envisioned about what may happen and who may be appointed to various posts.
As a conservative, Mr. Schundler has rankled the more moderate wing of the Republican Party, causing some legislative candidates to distance themselves from his campaign. The lack of party cohesion, along with a newly drawn legislative district map favorable to Democrats, leaves the state Republican Party splintered and hoping to hang on to its thin majority in the Legislature. 
While Mr. McGreevey is fielding advice from all quarters of his party, Mr. Schundler's kitchen cabinet is somewhat small, reflective of the fact that he sees himself as an outsider with few ties to those in Republican power circles. He has not been particularly active in wooing any of the party stalwarts, preferring instead the renegade approach. Many say Mr. Schundler's wife, Lynne, plays a major advisory role at "Brettquarters" in West Orange along with two political veterans, Lawrence Bathgate II, a leading Republican fund-raiser in the state, and Mr. Kamin, the former head of the Department of Motor Vehicles.
What is certain is that either candidate will bring loyal aides along, those staff members who served them well during their years as mayors.
In Mr. McGreevey's case, it is virtually certain that Gary Taffet, his campaign manager and chief of staff during his first term as mayor of Woodbridge, will be named chief of staff.
"Their relationship is so close, it's like if you talk to Gary, you're talking to Jim," said one Democrat. 
As for Mr. Schundler, it is expected that Mr. Gallagher, a former chief of staff and currently communications director of his campaign, will join the staff at the governor's office should there be a Schundler victory. Mr. Gallagher, also served as communications director in Jersey City and was later named director of the Jersey City Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce.
Also being mentioned as a possible chief of staff to Mr. Schundler is Assemblyman Guy Gregg of Morris County, a longtime supporter who may seriously consider the job if Republicans lose their majority in the Assembly. Mr. Gregg is believed to prefer becoming majority leader of the Assembly should the Republicans maintain control of the lower chamber.
The chief of staff and chief counsel are two of the most important jobs in a new administration because they largely determine how friendly the relationship will be between the new governor and the Legislature. Mrs. Whitman's administration was sharply criticized -- particularly from those in her own party -- for not building a close relationship with lawmakers. Peter G. Verniero, whom she later named to the State Suprme Court, was chief counsel and later chief of staff to Mrs. Whitman, but he never cultivated a friendly relationship with the Legislature. That lack of warmth proved crucial when Mr. Verniero later came under fire for the way he handled the investigation into racial profiling as attorney general.
Names being tossed about as possible choices in a McGreevey cabinet include a variety of professionals and party stalwarts. Jeanne Fox, former regional head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton and wife of Mr. McGreevey's political consultant Steve DeMicco, is considered a likely candidate for commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. She served as acting commissioner in that post under Mr. Florio.
In addition, Tom Giblin, the former state Democratic chairman, is being talked about as a possible labor commissioner. It was Mr. Giblin who remained loyal to Mr. McGreevey during Senator Torricelli's short-lived challenge. 
Mr. McGrath and Jo Astrid Glading, who is Mr. McGreevey's rapid response guru and who worked on Mr. Florio's campaign, are likely to be offered jobs. Ms. Glading, a lawyer who works with Senate Demcrats, could be named as public advocate, a post dismantled by Mrs. Whitman but is to be re-established in a McGreevey administration. 
Joe Vas, the mayor of Perth Amboy, is being talked about as possible commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs in a McGreevey administration. Mr. Vas is the first Hispanic to serve as mayor of Perth Amboy and is prominent in the business community as the owner of a local travel agency and the chief executive of an insurance agency, R&J Associates.
Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, an assemblywoman from Mercer County, is considered a serious contender for the post of secretary of state under Mr. McGreevey. Ms. Watson Coleman previously served as chief of staff to Mayor Doug Palmer of Trenton.
Others believe that the community affairs appointment may go to state Senator Wayne Byrant of Camden. Under that scenario, Assemblyman Joe Roberts would move over to the Senate to take Mr. Bryant's seat and Mrs. Watson Coleman would be considered a front-runner as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.
Sharon Harrington, a partner in the lobbying firm Public Strategies Impact and a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Florio, is also being considered for a senior post. And Zulima Farber, a former public advocate and public defender for Mr. Florio and assistant counsel to Mr. Byrne, is considered a contender for the job of attorney general or chief counsel. 
One power couple likely to emerge in a McGreevey administration is Marianne Espinosa Murphy, a former Superior Court judge, and her husband, Michael Murphy, a former Morris County prosecutor who ran for governor in the Democratic primary in 1997. There are whispers that Mr. Murphy may be considered for the post of chief counsel or possibly for commerce commissioner. Mrs. Murphy is being suggested for a number of positions, including health commissioner.
There are at least three major law firms that are expected to do well in a McGreevey administration. Some of the lucrative contracts that an administration can dole out include legal work for the various state agencies like the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
Partners from the firm of Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer, founded in 1919 by David Wilentz, the famed prosecutor in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial, have been long been associated with Democratic campaigns, and Mr. McGreevey's would be no exception. Indeed, campaign finance records show the firm is a top contributor to Mr. McGreevey's campaign, with its lawyers having donated $199,400 so far. Barry Albin, a partner in the firm and a prominent attorney in Woodbridge, is considered a top contender for attorney general. 
Another law firm topping the list of favorites in a McGreevey administration is Scarinci & Hollenbeck. Donald Scarinci, managing partner of the firm and a Democratic fund-raiser, is close to Representative Bob Menendez and was a key figure in repelling Mr. Torricelli's bid to enter the governor's race. Co-counsel to the Democrats on the redistricting commission that yielded a map favorable to their party, he is also considered a candidate for attorney general.
A third law firm that will have close ties to a McGreevey administration is Sills, Cummis, Radin, Tischman, Epstein & Gross. Paul Josephson, a partner in the firm, has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general. Mr. Josephson was chief counsel to Mr. McGreevey in his 1997 gubernatorial bid, and he also was chief counsel to Mr. Torricelli in his 1996 Senate campaign. 
Mitch Ostrer, who until recently was of counsel to the firm of Sills, Cummis, Radin, Tischman, Epstein & Gross, is now working for the McGreevey campaign and has been mentioned as a possible chief of policy and planning.
As for Mr. Schundler, the law firm that stands to become the most influential is Bathgate, Wegener & Wolf, which has done work for Jersey City. Mr. Bathgate, a partner, is a close adviser to Mr. Schundler and has been a leading Republican fund-raiser in the state. He is a friend of President Bush and was one of the few in the party to back Mr. Schundler over former Congressman Bob Franks in the primary. Members of Mr. Bathgate's firm have given at least $61,000 to Mr. Schundler's campaign.
Others mentioned as potential powers in a Schundler administration include Brian McAlindin, the attorney for the campaign, as attorney general or chief counsel to Mr. Schundler. Bea Sena, a councilwoman from Fair Haven in Monmouth County, whom Mr. Schundler appointed co-chairwoman of the state committee, is also expected to be considered for a top post in a Schundler administration. Evan Kozlow, executive director of the state committee, and Joe Farren, its communications director, are also likely to be on a short list of those being considered to serve Mr. Schundler.
Having spent several years on Wall Street, Mr. Schundler has extensive contacts in the private sector and is expected to turn to the financial community to fill some cabinet positions.
Longtime political observers say that regardless of who is elected, any new administration will have to get up to speed quickly because of the rocky period just ahead.
"It's going to a difficult time for whoever the next governor is, from a financial standpoint," said Roger Bodman, a Republican lobbyist who was Governor Kean's commissioner of transportation.
For one thing, neither man has served in a statewide office.
As David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, put it: "Schundler, who doesn't have a tremendous amount of support among his own party, might bring in newcomers to the state political scene, but there might be some anxiety about their knowledge and experience of state problems and the ability of cabinet-level officers to work with the legislators.
"With McGreevey," he added, "the problem will be to bring about a balance between the old Democratic guard coming to Trenton and the various groups that constitute his broad coalition. On the campaign, McGreevey has not felt the need to explain yet how those competing interests will get along, but in his administration he would have to explain to his cabinet that it has to be done, bruised egos and all."

HEADLINE: Preserving Data, and Businesses 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE massive business disruptions caused by the attack on the World Trade Center have produced a surge of interest in backup power systems and redundant data centers, and may increase the appeal of suburban buildings that had been equipped or envisioned as telecommunications hubs before the "telco hotel" business grew bleaker.
 Large parts of lower Manhattan lost electrical power and telephone service as a result of the attacks, forcing companies to scramble to find places with functioning utilities to keep businesses in operation. Now that most have found emergency locations, they are seeking longer-term answers on how to cope with disasters, which by their nature are unpredictable. 
 Putting a backup data center or trading floor in New Jersey, which has the advantage of being on a different power grid than Manhattan, is not foolproof. As some real estate executives noted, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels were closed after the attack, which meant that banks and trading companies would have had a hard time getting computer tapes recording their most recent transactions to backup sites across the Hudson River. 
Operations that were heavily dependent on paper records, like insurance companies and law firms, may completely rethink how they store information, said Snezana Anderson, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, a big brokerage and services company based in New York.
"Law firms and insurance companies stored their records on the lower floors of the Trade Center," Ms. Anderson said. "That's where a lot of the paper you saw flying around came from."
She said it appeared that some companies and firms are likely to keep "some presence in New York, with a backup in New Jersey and another in some place like New Mexico where it won't draw the attention it would in a metropolitan area."
Convinced all along that many companies will need to keep at least their headquarters and substantial parts of their key operations in Manhattan, some landlords have invested heavily in systems that can keep their customers operating even if basic services fail. One such building is at 75 Broad Street, where two floors are dedicated to 25 diesel-engine powered generators (with room for 15 more) that can supply power independent of Consolidated Edison.
The windows of the 17th and 18th floors of the 33-story building have been replaced with louvers to draw in the air needed for combustion and to exhaust fumes. An 18-inch diameter pipe runs around the perimeter of one floor and delivers fuel to each engine. Since the pipe holds 8,000 gallons of fuel, the engines can be started immediately, without waiting for oil to be pumped up from the 32,000 gallons of reserves in the subbasement.
Although the building was completed in 1928, in some sense it was always a "telco hotel," since it was the headquarters of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Today it has multiple telecommunication and data center tenants, although the cutbacks in the industry have left some spaces in the building vacant.
The building is far enough from the Trade Center that it was not immediately affected by the collapse of the buildings. "We are on the same electrical grid as the New York Stock Exchange, which is very carefully monitored by Con Ed," said Daniel M. Blanco, who is managing director for the building and other telecommunications centers owned by JEMB Realty.
"We were fine for the first 24 hours" after the attack, Mr. Blanco said. But he said that about 7 p.m. on Sept 12 he got a call from Con Ed executives, asking if the building could be disconnected from the grid so the power could be routed to areas of greatest need. "They said, 'You do not have to do this, but it would help a lot,' " Mr. Blanco said.
The request came at a time when Con Ed was taking the desperate step of running power cables along surface streets to bypass a substation damaged by the collapse of the Trade Center buildings.
He said that four 800-kilowatt Caterpillar generators were started to maintain basic building services uninterrupted once the links to Con Ed were switched off. In addition, some tenants, including AT&T, started their own generators to keep their communications networks operating.
AT&T, which had a lot of fiber connections destroyed by the collapse of the Trade Center buildings, quickly installed a microwave antenna on the roof of the building, shifting telecommunications traffic from wires in the ground to signals in the air. The antenna helped customers in the Wall Street area to keep operating after the cables were cut, an AT&T official said.
Staff members were in the building to help with the start-up, because, as a practical matter, if they had left the area they probably would not have been able to get back in, Mr. Blanco said. Even finding a place to eat was difficult. "We were going to Brooklyn to get food for people in the building," he said.
HAVING people in the building who could answer phones and provide answers was an important customer service, Mr. Blanco said, because many of the tenants' data-center and telecommunications operations are monitored remotely. "The calls started coming in right away" after the attack, said William G. Cohen, an executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, which represents JEMB Realty's multiple technology buildings. "Some guy in the Midwest saw the needles on his gauges jump. They were happy that there was a voice on the other end of the line who had answers."
Not all the calls were from far away. Lava Trading, a securities company, whose executive offices were on the 83rd floor of 1 World Trade Center, has an unmanned data center at 75 Broad. After the collapse of the buildings, executives of the company were assured that their system was still in operation as they scrambled to find a new place to conduct business.
The generators ran until the evening of Sept. 22, when normal electrical service was restored. The successful operation of 75 Broad during the disruption caused by the attack demonstrated the value of the $30 million the current ownership invested in it to become a technology center, Mr. Cohen said.
The generator farm and fuel tank are the most obvious part of this conversion, Mr. Cohen said, but planning where cables will be routed in the vertical shafts, known as risers, is important as well. "Most leases have provisions for installing cables, but most don't say anything about taking them out," Mr. Cohen said.
The result is a tangle of wires and cables in many buildings, some of them connected and some not. At 75 Broad, the location and use of each cable is planned in advance and recorded when installed, he said.
The changes amount to an "adaptive reuse" of an older building, taking advantage of its sturdy construction and its location, which is near many major fiber-optic cable lines. "Just about every major fiber provider passes by the front door," he said.
For others with operations downtown, plans made to deal with a problem that turned out not to be one -- the Y2K situation -- were ultimately quite useful after the Sept. 11 attack. Although the offices of CapitalThinking, a software company, are at 52 Vanderbilt Avenue in Midtown, its operation center was downtown at 25 Broadway.
Because of fears about problems with computers on Jan 1, 2000, Heather Shively, the chairwoman of the company, arranged for a backup site at a building operated by a disaster recovery company, Comdisco, in New Jersey. The Y2K problems were minimal, but the system was in place when the buildings fell and power was disrupted in lower Manhattan.
On Sept. 11, Ms. Shively said, "We started migrating our clients to Comdisco, and the impact on them was minimal even when power was lost." She said the company had invested more than $1 million at Comdisco "although we never anticipated anything like this." She added, "Our Y2K investment really paid off."
She said the continued operation of her business and many others like it "speaks to the importance of the digitization of information" and the ability to move information needed to run a business away from the site of the business. "That is why the economy and New York City did not shut down," she said.
Ms. Shively said she was in Connecticut the day of the attack, but the interruptions in telephone service did not prevent her from communicating with people in Manhattan and elsewhere. "We connected by BlackBerry and instant messaging," she said. "The Internet worked."
Interest in telecommunications space in New Jersey jumped immediately after the Trade Center attack, after languishing for almost a year, said Sean Brady, a senior director with Cushman & Wakefield. "The market for this space was dead, but after Sept. 11 interest in it increased, particularly for space that is well equipped," he said.
As originally planned, most buildings that were to be telco hotels would have housed mostly machines and very few people. The properties varied from old factories in urban locations, like 50 Dey Street in Jersey City, to newer construction in the suburbs, like 4 Gatehall Road in Parsippany. But if they are to be reused as "mirror" or "parallel" sites, duplicating the operations of, say, a trading floor in Manhattan, the buildings will have to accommodate people as well. This means carving out space for offices and amenities and, in the suburbs, providing for parking, brokers say.
"Telcos were designed to house inanimate objects," said Lee Miller, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield in New Jersey, the state that has much of the available telecommunications space. "When you add in people, you have different requirements for offices, parking and heating and air-conditioning."
He said that after a scramble to find temporary space in the wake of the Trade Center attack, many companies are examining their options further in the future. "They are operational now, and they are rethinking their paradigm," he said. They are asking questions like 'Do we really need 3,000 people within one block in New York City?' "
"There is a lot of internal debate going on right now," said James L. Somoza, a director of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company. "There is one camp that says, 'We have to be in Manhattan,' and another that says, 'We can't be in Manhattan.' " He said it appeared that some companies want operations on both sides of the Hudson River just to be safe.
One of the buildings he is marketing in Manhattan is 85 Tenth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. The building is owned by Level 3 Communications, which purchased the structure for its own use. But now about half the building, about 300,000 square feet, is available for lease to third parties, Mr. Somoza said.
In addition to location, many companies are re-examining their technical operations to determine what needs to be done in-house and what is better contracted out, said Jeffrey Hipschman, an executive vice president of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage that represents tenants.
"A lot of companies are finding this to be a good time to look at their data operations," he said. "They are saying things like "Do I really want to run an e-mail server?' " He said many American corporations had traditionally been reluctant to entrust internal communications to outsiders, known as application service providers, or A.S.P.'s in computer industry jargon. 
"Companies today seem more open to A.S.P.'s," he said, noting the providers include some of the best known companies in the industry. "I.B.M. is the classic A.S.P.," he said.
In addition, he said, companies looking to back up trading or clearing operations in Manhattan have several choices that can be used singly or in some combination.
One is co-location. A company can lease a cage in a data center operated by I.B.M. or SunGard Data Systems. The company installs its own equipment, while the building operator supplies such services as security, air-conditioning and fire suppression.
There are also disaster recovery centers, which Mr. Hipschman, the tenant broker, describes as a form of insurance policy. A company sends tapes containing its data to a site with servers in another city, where they can be loaded on servers and processed if the primary site goes down. These are typically batch operations, with 24 hours of data physically transferred to the recovery site daily.
A third option is a mirror, or parallel, site. Transactions recorded on servers at one location are automatically transmitted to servers at another, remote, location. Users have to decide how timely they need the data at the remote location to be; up to the minute is more expensive than hourly, Mr. Hipschman said. He said the Studley company had opted for a mirror site for its own operations. "A site in New Jersey mirrors the data that's in New York," he said.
Some brokers say some companies are seeking to take advantage of space prepared at great expense by telecommunications tenants that is now available at a steep discount because demand had been overestimated. According to Mr. Cohen of Newmark, it costs $300 to $500 a square foot to prepare telecommunications space, compared with about $70 a square foot for office installations.
"Nobody is going out and building new space like this," said Jeff A. Kolodkin, a vice president of Grubb & Ellis, a brokerage and services company. "People are trying to take advantage of what happened in the marketplace and sublease this space cheaply." He said that landlords who were late coming to the telecommunications market are in a particularly poor bargaining position.
The vacancy rate for telecom space in the New York region is about 38 percent, according to Ms. Anderson of Insignia/ESG. 
There may be excess space available now, but it could gradually go away as the need to transfer large amounts of data -- for people who prefer to use teleconferences rather then get on airplanes, for example -- grows, Mr. Kolodkin said. "The world is not going back to the Pony Express," he said. "People still want to move information at the speed of light." 
But, he said, advances in technology may decrease the need for real estate, even if the amount of data flowing through the system increases greatly. "It could be that technology will reduce the amount of space needed for equipment," he said. In the future, "you may only need 5,000 square feet where you need 50,000 square feet now."
ALTHOUGH many companies are looking to geographic diversification to safeguard their operations, at least one developer said there is a technological alternative in Manhattan and said he is prepared to move ahead with it.
Douglas Durst, chief executive of the Durst Organization, which owns more than 7 million square feet of skyscrapers in Midtown, is planning to proceed with the New York CyberCenter on a site between 11th and 12th Avenues and 57th and 58th Streets. The center, intended as the home of technical operations and data centers for financial companies, will have its own generating equipment, which will provide power and air-conditioning to the building, making it independent of the Con Ed power grid all the time, not just in emergencies.
He said he hoped to proceed with demolition of existing buildings on the site as soon as he could get Con Ed to turn off existing power to the site. The attack on the Trade Center had an impact on the project, because Mr. Durst lent the buildings to the Red Cross to store supplies immediately after the disaster.
"We were planning to open in the summer of 2003, but we lost two months," he said. "Now we expect to open in the fall."

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
The Ship Of State Arrives

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
IT may no longer clip along the high seas at 33 knots, or fire shells the size of cars with precision accuracy, but the battleship New Jersey is serving the latest war effort in a very real way: as a testament to the country's military might.
 For politicians, the ship offered the chance to wax eloquent in support of the war on terrorism during last week's rededication ceremony aboard the deck of the new battleship museum on the waterfront here. 
 "If you doubt America's will or question our ability or willingness to defend ourselves, look at this ship," said Senator Robert Torrecelli at last Sunday's ceremony attended by about 1,500 dignitaries, former shipmates and guests.
For many of the 400 people who rushed out on opening day to tour the world's longest, most decorated and most widely traveled battleship, the New Jersey provided something tangible to hang on to during an intangible time. 
"When I heard it was opening, I couldn't wait to get here," said Jim Curley of Bellmawr, who took his 11-year-old son, Ryan, out of school on Monday so they could be on board the first day. "With everything that's going on in the world right now, you never know what might happen."
Along with feeding the patriotic fever that has swept the country since Sept. 11, the warship museum is expected to provide an added boost to this ailing city's revitalization, largely focused on the waterfront.
"Camden is right for this ship, and the Big J is right for Camden," said Acting Governor Donald DiFrancesco just before tossing a ceremonial wreath laden with red, white and blue carnations overboard into the Delaware River.
Berthing the New Jersey just a mile upriver from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where it was built in 1940, was not always a given. The Camden-based Home Port Alliance aggressively lobbied the Navy and beat out the state battleship commission's bid to bring the ship to Bayonne, where it had berthed twice when it was decommissioned after World War II and the Korean War. In addition, the New Jersey served in the Vietnam War and during the attacks in Beirut in 1984. 
During the 90-minute guided tours of the battleship, tourists were given a taste of what it must have been like to be aboard the New Jersey during one of those tours. Knowledgeable docents, many of whom served in the military or worked on ships, took visitors to areas not normally accessible even to shipmates and explained in detail the workings of the ship.
Inside the blue-lighted strategic combat engagement center, visitors could view the radar and tracking systems for some of the ship's tactical weaponry, all except those for the Tomahawk systems, which were removed for security reasons since the Navy still uses Tomahawk cruise missiles. In the navigation bridge, one docent, Bob Locke, pointed out the 18-inch-thick walls meant to protect the captain as he directed the ship from a bank-vault conning tower.
The parts of the ship that elicited the most interest, however, were the nine 67-foot-long, 16-inch turrets, capable of launching 2,700-pound shells a distance of 23 miles, and the very tight sleeping quarters. Triple-tiered bunk beds and three-foot-tall lockers represented all the personal space a crewmember was given. 
Jim Zubert spent three years aboard the New Jersey on its first commission during World War II, at a time when the ship held 3,200. A first-class boatswain, Mr. Zubert, a Brooklyn native who now lives in Pittman, was responsible for firing one of the 16-inch turrets. He slept in the top bunk, where he wrote letters to his new bride, whom he had married during a 14-day leave.
"We had good times and bad times," said Mr. Zubert, 79. "But you only remember the good times."
That World War II tour, part of the South Pacific fleet under the command of Adm. William F. Halsey Jr., earned the New Jersey nine battle stars. In total, the ship was awarded 19 battle and campaign stars and numerous citations, awards and ribbons, making it the most decorated ship in the Navy. One of four Iowa class battleships designed for armament power and speed, the battleship New Jersey measures 887 feet 7 inches long -- exceeding its sister ships, the Iowa, the Missouri and the Wisconsin, by seven inches and making it the longest battleship in the world.
Launched in 1942 on the one-year anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the 45,000-ton ship made its last voyage in 1999 when it was towed from Washington State to Philadelphia and later across the river to Camden. Building the pier and turning the working battleship into a living museum has been a $20 million endeavor. Since it arrived in Camden, almost 1,000 volunteers have logged a total of 90,000 hours helping restore the battleship.
While the public tour covers a good portion of 5 of the ship's 11 levels, volunteers are still hard at work getting more areas ready for public viewing. Dan Farrell, a volunteer coordinator who served in the Navy's air squadron in the late 1960's, has spent nearly every day over the last 10 months crawling around the bowels of the ship tracing leaks, ripping out duct work and painting bulkheads.
"When we got here in December this mess hall was under eight inches of water," said Mr. Farrell, whose crews are also cleaning up sleeping quarters below deck, where they hope to host sleep-over camporees this winter. "There was no heating, no electricity, no running water. The ceilings were falling down."
Dozens of former crewmen who were invited to participate in the rededication ceremony stood on the forecastle of the ship last week comparing impressions of how the ship looked during their time at sea with today. Several veterans commented that the teak floors were not as shiny as they were in their day and that many of the guns were missing.
"She was a great lady and they did a beautiful job on her," said Roger Oosterink, 74, who drove 12 hours from Hudsonville, Mich., to see the ship he served on in 1946 and 1947. "This was one trip I had to make."

HEADLINE: Making Money, At Whose Expense? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "It's Time to Terror-Proof Markets" (On the Contrary, Oct. 7), in which Daniel Akst said the nation should never again let its enemies paralyze its business life:
 Mr. 
Akst said that no one should be ashamed of making money, which he described as "at the core of our civilization." But many people also believe that civilization's core includes good schools, affordable health care, decent housing and a measure of economic security and opportunity for everyone. 
 Wall Street's dominance not only coexists with increases in poverty and inequality, stagnant or falling real wages and housing costs that are out of reach for working families, it also helps to explain them.
The Street has claimed a disproportionate share of the income and wealth of New York City but has remained indifferent to the spectacle of rising social distress during unprecedented prosperity. In times of economic trouble, its instability shrinks the economy and the tax base, jeopardizing the fiscal stability of the city and the security of millions. 
Among the dead and missing from Sept. 11 were immigrant workers who earned a pittance and for whom the basic needs of people in modern society were distant dreams. While we can take pride in our financial prowess and work to preserve it, the city's political leaders need to achieve economic recovery not by paying economic tribute to the financial industry but by reconnecting with the entire city's social fabric and well-being.

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING; 
The 'Me, Too' Mind-Set of Disaster Aid

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Good, the Bad, and Your Business" (John Wiley & Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
"IN a disaster, it's never fair," said Pat Owens, the former mayor of Grand Forks, N.D., a city of 47,000 that was ravaged by floods in April 1997. "You have to make the best choices you can with the dollars you have to work with."
 Ms. Owens, who was mayor from 1996 to 2000, was talking about decisions she had helped to make about which businesses would receive federal disaster money. Regardless of the criteria set forth, Ms. Owens said, ineligible businesses sought relief funds because they felt entitled to the same financial help received by others. "There was nothing we could do," Ms. Owens said. "We just had to tell them they had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps." 
 In many ways, the devastation caused by the Grand Forks flood pales in comparison with that of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But soon after the attacks, amid heroic rescue attempts, community support for displaced residents and workers, and myriad fund-raising efforts, it was not long before faraway cries of "Me too!" began to be heard.
Tom Kershaw, founder of the Bull and Finch Pub in Boston, the bar depicted on "Cheers" on television, says he believes he is entitled to low-interest loans and other economic support because the tourism business, upon which his business relies, has softened. Mr. Kershaw said that before Sept. 11, his business was off 11 percent from the same time the previous year. "Now, it's about 50 percent," he said. He attributes the dropoff directly to the attack.
"It doesn't matter in this case whether it's physical or not," Mr. Kershaw said of the damage. "The effect is the same. It's just a matter of intensity."
As the airlines were "jumping on Day 2" to cry for help, he said, "the rest of us were just standing behind them." In other words, if the airlines got theirs, Mr. Kershaw wanted his.
Perhaps a positive spin on that message, said Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., a business ethics professor at Harvard Business School, "is that it's an issue of fairness rather than entitlement."
But deeming that a pub 215 miles away from ground zero deserves similar treatment as the airlines whose planes were hijacked and used as missiles, just because its revenue is off, is a stretch. Even if a compelling case can be made, where do you draw the line? Many companies, while not affected physically, might say their customers stopped coming since Sept. 11. "As a practical matter," Professor Badaracco said, "I'm not sure we could sort out 20,000 companies and how badly they were affected and how much was caused by this problem or just bad management."
Asked why he feels entitled to the same relief from public money as, say, someone whose business was physically destroyed at the World Trade Center, Mr. Kershaw said: "It's my money. I can tell you about years when I gave the government a hell of a lot of money in taxes, and I'd like it back now, thank you very much."
Mr. Kershaw, who is also chairman of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau, contended that all business owners who could make an argument that their revenue declines were connected to Sept. 11 should be eligible for some sort of relief. "My big concern," he said, "is that there's probably not enough money to do this."
Perhaps his commitment to protecting the financial health of his constituency of tourism-related businesses is obscuring the larger issue of deciding the right thing to do with limited resources. Such determination, however, rings hollow when others are more obviously in need.
"We had this horrible, unthinkable tragedy," Professor Badaracco said. "And here we have a guy with a successful bar that's going to have a couple of bad months. You know, what's he whining about?"
Mr. Kershaw also owns 75 Chestnut, a Boston restaurant that caters to a local clientele. "It's holding its own," he said. "My local restaurant is not affected in a major way because people in fact are staying home." He said he had already converted one of the rooms above the original Cheers into another bar catering to the local business as well. "I'm proactively working on initiatives to build the business," he said.
That's a smart management strategy. To people in New York who are still busy picking through the rubble of what were once their businesses, it must seem a luxury.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
Hysteria Can Be Hazardous

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE federal government has said it will spend billions of dollars to combat bioterrorism in our midst. But how much money will Americans waste first?
 There is no question that news reports of a baby and others being exposed to anthrax in the middle of Manhattan are terrifying. In some cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people who have no symptoms and have not tested positive for anthrax exposure take antibiotics as a precaution. 
 But according to health care officials and doctors themselves, hundreds of prescriptions for ciprofloxican, or Cipro -- the drug that is believed to be most effective in treating anthrax -- are being doled out to people who have no reason to believe that they have ever been exposed to the deadly disease. And New Yorkers are running to the city's emergency rooms in droves -- in many cases bypassing their own private doctors -- to see if that cough, sniffle or blemish is actually evidence of anthrax exposure.
These hospital runs "are overtaxing very valuable resources," Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the New York City health commissioner, said at a news conference at City Hall last week. "It doesn't make sense economically," he added, "and it doesn't make sense medically."
That is especially true because the city's health and emergency management workers are already busy gearing up for other possible attacks, training workers and checking their own pharmaceutical supplies. 
William Grice, vice president for operations at Saint Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan, said its already busy emergency room has been filled with people anxious about anthrax. Doctors have had to be diverted from patient care to lead impromptu educational groups.
"People who really do not fit the protocol for needing treatment are demanding it," he said. And the hospital's costs are already mounting: about $250,000 to build up stockpiles of drugs, $50,000 for decontamination supplies and training for the emergency department and $30,000 to upgrade equipment on ambulances for paramedics.
"Those are the short-term things we have done," Mr. Grice said. "We feel we have to do more long-term planning."
Misuse of antibiotics is not new. The C.D.C. has even devoted a division to combat this problem, which can lead to resistant strains of illnesses and undesirable side effects. Cipro and similar drugs can cause nausea and diarrhea and, in rare cases, seizures and convulsions or worse. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who took it for urinary tract infections, said he found it to be unpleasant and would not take it now unless he had to.
Doctors are often pressured by nervous patients to prescribe antibiotics that they do not need. But that does not mean that doctors should do it. "It is slightly irresponsible," said Dr. Kevin M. Cahill, a tropical-medicine specialist in Manhattan. "We're drawing down a finite reserve for reasons that are not warranted. And there are real dangers in taking Cipro."
As it stands, the federal government and the pharmaceutical industry have already taken steps to increase the production of Cipro and approve a broader range of drugs that might be used for anthrax illness. Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said the government would approve two generic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, doxycycline and penicillin, for those who have inhaled anthrax.
All of this has caused Bayer, the German company that holds the patent for Cipro, to consider whether it should, in effect, abandon its patent by permitting generic drug makers to produce Cipro for sale in the United States, as some have said they are prepared to do. This also raises questions of whether the drug industry will again be pressed to rethink sticky patent and pricing issues.
There is no question that these are scary times. Anyone with a child cannot help but be gripped by at least momentary fear. Flu and cold symptoms, so common this time of year, can instill the same worry in any American these days.
But there are some cost-benefit decisions that have to be weighed. Do you really want to take up the time of an emergency room -- and in some cases, foot at least some of the bill for the visit -- when workers there may need to care for others who are critically ill, perhaps, someday, someone in your own family? Should the public health dollar be stretched away from education and prevention efforts to responding to questions that can be answered online at www.cdc.gov, the Web site of the disease control centers? 
PERSONAL doctors, who are often too busy to come to the phone, might be better used as resources when true symptoms are present. "It is amazing how much time it takes to answer calls from patients all day long wondering about anthrax," Dr. Cahill said. "I tell them I will fax the C.D.C. Web site page to them."
The government, of course, does not always tell the public everything it knows. In an age when we have come to expect instant answers, its method of distributing information can seem maddeningly incomplete and snail-like. But the facts about the anthrax threat and appropriate responses seem to evolve by the day. This illness, and this war, are new to the government. Public hysteria has its own health risks, including financial ones, and this may not be the best time to take them.

If It Feels Significant, Do It

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a year can make. Twelve months ago, most of young America was mired in the material world, obsessed with stock options and where it would luxuriate after retiring at 40. Whiz kids controlled multimillion-dollar companies, the offices were often college dormitory rooms, and the money flowed like merlot. Thank goodness we all had therapists to help us cope with our newfound wealth. 
 Such arrogance! Such solipsism! Such naivete! 
 Twelve months later, the entire world is altered and those of us in our 20's and 30's may have been hit the hardest. And why wouldn't we be? In less than a year we have gone from the kings and queens of a high-technology, high-speed universe to a bunch of scared kids living in chaos. We've never been through a real crisis; we're not equipped to handle one. The Depression, after all, was some mythical event that our grandparents droned on about. Pearl Harbor was a star vehicle for Ben Affleck; Vietnam allowed Tom Cruise, among others, to show off his acting range; and the Persian Gulf war was a made-for-television movie courtesy of CNN. 
The good news is that Sept. 11 has caused people of all ages to re-evaluate their friendships, romantic entanglements and work lives. But reflection can be painful, especially when you think that your job is hardly giving you a raison d'etre. 
"How do you care about ratings or opening-night parties when you see police officers, firefighters or the military putting their lives on the line every day?" asked Sonda Lewis, 31, a publicist at a cable television station in Manhattan. "I'm assembling press kits for some television show that ultimately has no intrinsic value, and these people are risking their lives to save others. Not only am I not saving the world, I don't feel like I'm contributing to it in any significant way."
Of course, people have battled existential angst for centuries. I, for one, have spent the bulk of my existence trying to find a point; I have always envied those -- and there are many -- who manage to live unexamined lives. But this recent spate of personal accounting seems different, more urgent. Maybe it is because everything feels uncertain, from our economy to our safety to our country. Or maybe it is because young people are finally realizing just how fragile and random life is. We spend so much of our lives at our jobs -- and, perhaps more important, derive so much of our identity from them -- that we should try to do something that at least feels marginally significant, right?
So is it possible to find meaning in work when, whether by choice or necessity, you are making blenders or assembling press kits? I'm not sure. I certainly couldn't find value writing about eyebrows and hair defrizzers, which, sadly, I have done. Yes, frizzy hair is unfortunate, but there are worse things than resembling Roseanne Roseannadanna. 
Some people have managed to strike balances between their work life and their sense of self. Ms. Lewis, for instance, treats her day job as just that. Her first loves are theater and her new husband, David, though not necessarily in that order. "I find meaning in love, friendship and acting," she said. "Everything else takes a back seat."
Six years ago, Steven C. Rosenthal, now 34, quit his engineering job at AT&T to start a nonprofit humanitarian organization, Cross-Cultural Solutions, in White Plains. The group sends volunteers to places like India, Ghana and Cuba, and was most recently working with the American Red Cross at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. 
"I understand how people are going through this re-evaluation process -- that was me six years ago," Mr. Rosenthal said. "For years I felt that not only didn't I have as much meaning in my career as I knew I could have, but that I could also add value to other people's lives. That's why I started CCS."
ACROSS the country, volunteerism has skyrocketed, and people are signing up in droves to go into the C.I.A. or the military. 
Ultimately, of course, we all find importance in our own ways; one person's holy grail is another's hair defrizzer. And in the wake of disaster, many people seem to have reached the conclusion that personal relationships should take precedence above all else.
Still, some people honestly believe that the world would be a better place if only we annihilated frizzy hair.
If only it were that simple.

HEADLINE: On Edge, Again 

BYLINE:  By MAX PAGE; Max Page, a former New Yorker, is an assistant professor of architecture and history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, and the author of "The Creative Destruction of Manhattan" (University of Chicago Press).

 BODY:
NEW YORK is still the city that never sleeps. Fear will do that.
 Fear of death borne in the air: a jet, a microbe. In Lower Manhattan, the dust has been scrubbed away. Night and day trucks rumble off with more rubble. But the fear persists: there are letters to open, cross-country trips to take. The fear is a psychic anthrax, an almost invisible powder creeping under the windowsills of thought, sifting into the corners of each mind. 
 Fear and this city are no strangers. History reminds us that New York has burned and been occupied by soldiers. It has been besieged by epidemics and riots. Our popular culture has been in dress rehearsal for the city's destruction for decades: in books, at the movies, in computer games, although no amount of history, no number of rehearsals, could prepare New Yorkers for Sept. 11 and the days of grief and worry that followed. 
It was the most perfect and horrific demolition job. Two quarter-mile-tall towers exploding, then imploding, one-acre floors falling through the next one, 200 times over. 
The survivors, blanketed in the gray mist of urban disaster, headed north and east. The attacks' human spores bearing their stories, their fear, throughout the city. 
That unleashed energy was finally absorbed by each resident here, metastasizing into a malaise that has lingered as the country has gone to war and the specter of bioterrorism has grown.
Virginia Woolf wrote in "A Room of One's Own" that after World War I, it was not possible to hum poetry. On the surface, lively lunches at Oxbridge proceeded as before the war. But the "humming noise, not articulate, but musical, exciting" was gone. The war had "destroyed illusion and put truth in its place." 
Many suggest that such is the case with Sept. 11: our world has changed. A controlled fear -- a constant hum of worry, rather than poetry -- seems part of this new world, this new New York. But, after the initial silence, then the muted tones, the city is still somehow humming. Perhaps, Sept. 11 has not created a new city, but in many respects ferried us back to an older, more visceral New York, where it was understood that the city was at risk. And while today the rest of the country is on edge, New York is even more so. New Yorkers understand again that their city is a target.
To 19th-century New Yorkers, who may have been told stories of the city's burning during the seven-year British occupation in the Revolutionary War, or who lost family members to the cholera epidemics of the 1830's, who perhaps watched the burning of much of Lower Manhattan in 1835, or who later saw rioting mobs rage through the city in 1863, the notion that the city was forever was absurd.
Even the city of the 1940's and 1950's was not immune to fears of sudden catastrophe, the distinct possibility of nuclear attack. Sept. 11 bombed us back to the atomic age, when a roar in the sky could instantly evict daydreams from New Yorkers' minds and substitute apocalyptic visions.
Fear and New York are words that have often gone together. Usually, it has been the rest of the country fearing New York, rather than New Yorkers fearing their city. New York, ascending to dominance by the early 19th century, became the most feared city of all. In New York, Americans saw the poor, the immigrants, people of all races. In New York, crowding, crime, disease and radicalism were not only found but nurtured and propagated.
 AMERICAN movies and television, books and newspapers have projected images of urban fear for more than a century. Urban catastrophe movies and novels, paintings and comic books -- many created by New Yorkers themselves -- have used New York to try to reveal the dangers of the American city.
American popular culture has returned to the theme of New York's destruction time and again, almost as a leitmotif that resonates with some of the most longstanding themes in American history: the ambivalence toward cities, the troubled reaction to immigrants and racial diversity, fear of technology's impact, and the tensions between natural and humanmade disasters.
In a nation as religious as the United States, with a strong apocalyptic strain in its popular culture, it is not surprising to find so many examples of catastrophe. But more regularly than any other, New York -- not only our largest city but "the city" of platonic ideal -- has repeatedly met its death by art.
In moments of social upheaval, visions of how New York would be demolished, blown up, swallowed by the sea, or toppled by monsters have proliferated in films and in science fiction novels, as well as in photography, painting and the graphic arts.
In Joaquin Miller's 1886 novel, "Destruction of Gotham," a great fire engulfs the city as lower-class mobs attack the homes and stores of the wealthy. Only when Manhattan had "burned and burned and burned to the very bed-rock" was the apocalypse complete.
Jacob Riis, the photographic chronicler of the slums of the Lower East Side, encapsulated the fears of many Americans in 1890 with his metaphors of the waves of radical immigrants flooding onto the beaches of Brooklyn in his landmark book, "How the Other Half Lives."
At the nearby immigrants' paradise, Coney Island, tenements were routinely set on fire at Dreamland, giving those same immigrants a chance to witness from afar the tenuous world they inhabited on the Lower East Side.
In paintings by the futuristic artist Chesley Bonestell from the cold war 1950's, in popular magazines like Fortune and Collier's, Manhattan is repeatedly devastated by atomic bombs.
In the SimCity software of the 1990's, users could pick what disaster would strike New York, or just watch past disasters play out before their eyes.
And in movie after movie, as has been noted in the past weeks, Hollywood has found inspiration in destroying New York: through earthquake ("Deluge"), tsunami ("Deep Impact"), asteroid ("When Worlds Collide" and "Armageddon"), and monster ("Godzilla" and "King Kong").
Just this summer, in what had become an almost annual rite, New York was destroyed repeatedly on movie screens. The Japanese animated movie "Final Fantasy" showed a devastated Lower Manhattan beneath a dome, to protect it from the assaults of viruslike aliens. In "A.I.," the child robot finds himself drawn to a forbidden zone, called "Man-Hattan," overflowing with water. The World Trade Center towers stand above the water line, one tipped, leaning against the other.
In the millions, we have read these books, watched these movies, played these games, thrilled to the skyscrapers of Manhattan toppling as if it were somehow culturally cleansing. In other words, despite the repeated statement that the events of Sept. 11 were unimaginable, our culture has been imagining, rehearsing, these events for years.
Of course, New Yorkers themselves have been less concerned with catastrophic visions of the city's end, and more preoccupied with the very real catastrophes they have had to confront. Jose Marti, the Cuban revolutionary who lived in New York in the late 19th century, admired the city's resilience after the crippling Blizzard of 1888. 
New York, "like the victim of an outrage, goes about freeing itself of its shroud," he wrote. The democracy of snowfall, covering aristocratic Fifth Avenue as heavily as Mulberry Bend on the Lower East Side, had brought out a "sense of great humility and a sudden rush of kindness, as though the dread hand had touched the shoulders of all men."
The city's early history is studded with events in which distinctions of wealth and race were swept aside by disaster. In a city where rich and poor coexisted, with pigs and prostitutes living alongside Astors and Lenoxes, natural and human disasters were more likely to include everyone. 
In the 20th century, disasters have tended not to directly affect the whole city, like the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911. Even the anthrax attacks, on the news media and at Gov. George E. Pataki's New York office, have been localized. Right now, strangely enough, it is an office problem, a disease that has been spread through the mail, in the windowless mailrooms of the new economy, and eventually landing on cubicle desks. Yes, some workplaces have been threatened, but so far the city as whole has not been at risk, though it feels as if it is.
It's important to remember that New York has always been better at celebration than fear. New York has always prided itself on humming: ticker tape parades down Broadway, the tall ships at the Bicentennial, that memorable V-J Day kiss (caught by Eisenstaedt) in Times Square: these are New York's emotional landmarks. 
If the "unexpungeable odor of the long past," as E. B. White wrote in 1948 in "Here Is New York," persists in the city, in the endless sediment of New York's people and their histories, it has been overcome by the daily odors of city life. New Yorkers' notoriously short memories have, even so, kept room for celebration.
 ALL this is why we continue to destroy New York in books, on canvas, on movie screens and on computer monitors: because it is so unimaginable for us, in reality, not to have this city. We have played out our worst fears on the screen and in our pulp fiction because, as the city's oracle, Mr. White, wrote in the shadow of the atomic bomb: "If it were to go, all would go -- this city, this mischievous and marvelous monument which not to look upon would be like death." 
Maybe fear is the wrong word for what New Yorkers feel now. There is anxiety, there is uncertainty. New York is no longer an invulnerable porcupine of skyscrapers that can never be attacked. Instead, the city has been rediscovered as a fragile community.
A community built on a delicate mix of people and buildings, the solace of anonymity and the thrill of cosmopolitanism, what Jane Jacobs famously called "organized complexity" in her classic study, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities." Only beyond the five boroughs, in the hinterlands, does the city appear to embody raw chaos.
This new uncertainty has brought New Yorkers together in repeated moments of empathy and concern over the recent weeks. But uncertainty could also lead to a pulling away from public life, New York's enduring justification for being, and a mimicking of the fortress mentality that has rolled across the country.
It might, finally, also remind New Yorkers again of the precariousness of this place, its indispensability to a personal and national identity. It might make New Yorkers want to defend the city even more, by starting an era of unprecedented creativity.
The city that never sleeps because of fear of airplanes, fear of powder, might again become a city that never sleeps because it is too busy creating and telling, building and imagining, eating and singing. Jonathan Larson's words in the musical "Rent" could only have been written in and for New York: "The opposite of war is not peace, it's creation!"
E. B. White wrote: "New York is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village -- the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying the way is up!"
The white plume we saw on Sept. 11 was the cloudy debris of two massive towers collapsing, shrewdly demolished to turn gleaming symbols of the city into burning signs of terror. Our fantasies and nightmares made real, we now wait, almost expectantly, for the next plume, a puff of powder from a No. 10 envelope.
Still, in this time of New York's haunting, I think White was right. New York will remain the way up for us all, the home of our ideals, and the place to which the world looks, for ideas, for success, for art and for a new start.

HEADLINE: When Times Get Tough, Some Go for Plastic Surgery 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago Jody Seiff, a Manhattan nightclub manager, was seized by an indefinable melancholy. "You know how when you feel bad, nothing makes you happy?" she said. "You try shopping, and when that doesn't work, you go to the makeup counter to buy some new colors."
 But last week, when her usual strategies failed, Ms. Seiff, 36, sought balm for her spirits in a plastic surgeon's consulting room. "I had a little bit of collagen done in my lips and in those places where tiny wrinkles were starting to show," she confided. "These things distract you for a time. You feel a little perkier." 
 Americans' consumption of luxury indulgences may have fallen off a cliff since Sept. 11 -- rabbit-fur hats, $100 face creams, platinum charm bracelets. But one unexpected growth area has been outpatient cosmetic surgery, as patients like Ms. Seiff try to salve their unease with a host of skin-deep, but inwardly comforting, remedies. 
It is too early for statistics, but a dozen cosmetic surgeons around the country said that they and their colleagues had found that while major hospital procedures like face-lifts have fallen since mid-September, office procedures like eyelifts and Botox and collagen injections have surged markedly -- by 20 to 30 percent compared with the same weeks a year ago. Some of those procedures can be performed in about an hour and require minimal recovery time.
"Based on what we are hearing, people are beginning to come back around to those procedures that they had planned to do," said Leida Snow, a spokeswoman for the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. "We're also seeing new people coming in. Patients are saying, 'If not now, when?' "
The decision may be an outgrowth of a shift in priorities as a result of the terrorist attacks and the declining economy, one that has many Americans buying fewer big-ticket items and postponing vacations, while indulging instead in mini-luxuries they hope will provide a quick fix for the body and the spirit.
"As people's external lives become more questionable, they look inside themselves," said Sander L. Gilman, a professor of liberal arts and medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is the author of "Creating Beauty to Cure the Soul: Race and Psychology in the Shaping of Aesthetic Surgery" (Duke University Press, 1998). "What they are asking is, 'How can I maximize my personal happiness?' and searching for the easiest and most immediate way to change themselves."
Wendy Lewis, a New York cosmetic surgery consultant who connects patients with appropriate doctors for a fee, notices her clients taking a hard look at their emotional bottom line. "They are examining the balance sheet and recognizing there are some things that they are never going to give up," Ms. Lewis said, least of all their minor vanities. "Some of them are telling me, 'I may not have a face-lift this year, but whether there is a bomb or not, I'm going to be a blonde. And I'm not going to give up my Botox.' "
Another factor in the rise of quick-fix procedures is that at times of economic peril, when many are concerned about job security, the rejuvenating promise of cosmetic surgery can be appealing as an investment in the future. It is not unusual for patients to debate whether they should spend their time and money on a vacation or on surgery, said Dr. Malcolm Paul, the president of the American Society for Plastic Surgery, who practices in Newport Beach, Calif. "In their minds, a vacation has benefits which are short term, compared with certain aesthetic procedures, which last indefinitely," he said.
Plastic surgeons attribute the increase in procedures since the attacks of Sept. 11 to everything that has happened -- an increased sense of vulnerability, anxiety over bioterrorism and the continued slippage in the economy. Minor cosmetic procedures have also supplanted face-lifts as a short-term repair for slackened contours.
For many, all of this means that the "should I or shouldn't I" debates have acquired a new urgency. "Some of my patients seem more interested in surgery when they recognize how fragile life is," said Dr. Alan Matarasso, a prominent New York plastic surgeon. They are responding to "that live-for-today feeling," echoed Jane Larkworthy, the beauty director of W magazine. It is a desire that impels them "to actively pursue what they might have put off," she said, "whether it's that art history course or firming that slack skin that's been bothering them for years."
The debate whether cosmetic surgery is a gross vanity has become easier for many to resolve -- surprisingly, perhaps, in the negative. Dr. James L. Baker Jr., a plastic surgeon in Winter Park, Fla., noted that before Sept. 11 his patients often fretted whether they were being overly vain. "But I don't see that anymore," he said. "Before, there was a concern about what other people would think. Now it's more about Me. My patients come in saying, 'I want to look better, and that's it.' Their attitude is, 'If you don't like it, tough.' "
"Did I feel guilty? Not really," said Ms. Seiff, the nightclub manager. Of course, nothing about surgery is cheap. Ms. Seiff spent about $1,000 on a series of injections. "I did ask myself, Could I have spent my money in a better manner?" she said.
Increasingly, doctors said, patients are in search of quick gratification. "People want to live a bit more in the moment," said Dr. Steven Teitelbaum, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills.
Dr. Richard Palu, a New York ophthalmic surgeon whose patients include lawyers, doctors and financial executives, said they are opting for cosmetic procedures with minimal recovery time -- several days instead of several weeks. "People are looking for a more modest expenditure and a more modest commitment of their time," he said.
Some patients cited fears of an extended hospital stay, which might leave them out of touch and vulnerable in the event of further terror strikes. Gordana Perlof, 58, a retired travel agent in Marina del Rey, Calif., considered postponing the midface-lift she had scheduled for last month. "But I asked myself what would be the benefit," Ms. Perlof recalled. "I would just have been sitting in front of the television all day."
For New Yorkers in particular, a quick cosmetic fix can be a kind of salve for psyches that are still raw. "It's like anything else -- when you feel bad you buy a little lipstick," said Dr. Helen Colen, a Manhattan plastic surgeon. Dr. Colen has performed 30 collagen procedures and 20 Botox injections in the last two weeks, twice as many as in the same period a year ago.
For some people, an eyelift or a collagen injection is a way of coping with adversity. Whether they have lost jobs or are simply feeling the diffuse anxiety that is increasingly common in an unstable environment, many Americans are going under the knife as "a way of taking control, of saying I'm going to beat this thing," said Dr. Peter Fodor, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills and a director of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
Cathy Solomon, a partner in a small New York cosmetics business, decided last month to have a second round of liposuction. "Truthfully, it took my mind off the fact that I was feeling in the dumps," Ms. Solomon, 50, said. The generalized anxiety of recent weeks, coupled with her own personal fears, certainly gave her pause, she said. "But let's put it this way: it wasn't going to stop me."
Like many Americans, Ms. Solomon has developed an oddly fatalistic attitude. "I'm not going to buy a gas mask," she said, "and I'm not going to live in fear. If I'm going down, I'm going to go down looking good."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Your Job Is Safe. So Why That Frown?

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
THERE is a cliche about the economy that suddenly has new resonance. A recession is when your neighbor loses his job, the saying goes, and a depression is when you lose yours. 
 Glibness aside, the joke contains a serious economic idea, namely that the overall health of the economy has only a small bearing on people's well-being. 
 But just as more people are finding themselves out of work these days -- and as far more know someone who is jobless -- a new study has tried to make a different argument. Recessions, it says, cause a big decline in people's happiness, even among those who do not lose a job or take a pay cut. 
"People really hate recessions," said Andrew J. Oswald of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, who wrote a paper based on the study with Rafael Di Tella of Harvard and Robert J. MacCulloch of the London School of Economics.
The three, all economics professors, blame a "fear effect" -- the widespread worries about jobs, salaries, retirement accounts and family members that accompany a recession. Such worries may cause less panic than anthrax, but they are far more likely to materialize.
To some people, the notion of economists studying emotions like happiness seems odd, but the research is part of a growing academic movement known as behavioral economics. Its adherents examine actual human behavior, in addition to the purely rational behavior that Economics 101 textbooks predict.
The new happiness findings matter, the three professors say, because governments are supposed to be in the business of protecting their citizens' well-being and because governments can take steps to avoid recessions, or at least mitigate their effects.
The professors based their findings on polls, over 25 years, of about 300,000 people in the United States and Europe. The surveys asked people to describe their overall state of mind and often gave three possible answers -- "very happy," "pretty happy" and "not too happy." Psychologists say the responses bear a strong correlation to more objective measures of well-being, like blood pressure.
Earlier research found that even as many societies became wealthier in recent decades, they did not become happier. But the story is not as simple as money cannot buy happiness. All other things being equal, money does make people more satisfied. The rise in material living standards, however, has not been enough to overcome the increase in social problems like divorce.
Professors Di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald considered these variables and examined whether recessions -- generally two consecutive quarters of economic contraction -- affected people's happiness in ways beyond lost jobs and wages. Their answer was a clear yes.
During recessions, the study found, the number of people describing themselves as "very happy" fell about 10 percent. A society that booms and busts tends to be less happy than one that grows steadily.
The first implication of the research seems straightforward. When done in moderation, fighting recession by borrowing against tomorrow's growth, through lower interest rates and taxes and higher government spending, is worth the price. 
Of course, no healthy economy can eliminate the business cycle, as Americans have learned in recent months. But in addition to tamping its swings, governments can mitigate a downturn's effects.
DIGGING deeper into the satisfaction surveys, the professors say the countries least affected by recessions pay the highest unemployment benefits. In Denmark, where a typical unemployed worker receives benefits equal to 60 percent of the worker's old salary, people endure a recession better than those in England, where the salary replacement is closer to 20 percent.
The changes that the two countries made in unemployment benefits in recent decades -- Denmark's becoming more generous and Britain's becoming less -- also had the expected effect on well-being, Professor Oswald said. This, he added, argues for a stronger safety net in many countries, for the well-being of both the employed and the unemployed.
The policy prescription will surely be the most contentious part of the paper, which the authors have submitted to an academic journal. Other economists have found that relatively large jobless benefits can make businesses hesitant to add workers, thereby increasing unemployment, because company taxes pay for the benefits. 
The debate is worth having. The three professors have given it an important starting point by making clear that recessions affect more than just the pocketbook.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/John C. Lui; 
BNY Hamilton Small Cap Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
WHILE the stock market remains unsettled in the aftermath of Sept. 11, John C. Lui, who runs the $325 million BNY Hamilton Small Cap Growth fund, sees slow but steady growth ahead.
 "With the Federal Reserve and the government using monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, you have to look past the negative profit projections for 2001," Mr. Lui said from his office in Lower Manhattan, next to the New York Stock Exchange. He expects that declines in consumer confidence will hurt the economy in the short term, he said, but that shoppers will eventually resume spending. "Their largest asset is their home, which hasn't dropped as much as stock prices, and they have a high propensity to spend," he said of consumers. 
 Over a three- to five-year corporate profit cycle, Mr. Lui said he expects a 7 percent earnings growth rate, on average, for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
The fund returned 25 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 9.6 percent for its midcap growth group and 1.5 percent for the S.& P. 500, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, versus a 36.1 percent loss for its group and a 19.4 drop in the S.& P. The fund, like some others with a small-cap focus, has been classified as a midcap fund by Morningstar because the average capitalization of the portfolio companies over three years exceeds Morningstar's cutoff.
Mr. Lui, 44, is vice president for institutional equity management at the Bank of New York, the fund's adviser. Institutional shares require a $100,000 investment minimum, while the minimum for individuals is $2,000. 
To pick the fund's stocks, he screens approximately 7,000 United States companies with market capitalizations of $100 million to $2 billion. He looks for businesses in which earnings growth over the next two to three years may be underestimated by Wall Street and will exceed that of the S.& P. 500.
About 150 companies meet his tests. To whittle the list -- the fund now has about 100 stocks -- he further reviews the earnings projections. "You kick the tires," Mr. Lui said. "You say: 'These are crystal-ball projections. Do these estimates make sense?' "
He receives help from two analysts of small-cap stocks but also works with seven industry analysts who focus on bigger stocks. "Our companies sell to their companies," he explained, "so we get a lot of useful information from them."
To find growth companies, he says he looks for businesses with dominant market positions and proprietary products or services. "We ask ourselves: 'What is the advantage of the widget that this company makes? What kind of growth rate can we expect? How long can the growth rate be sustained?' "
He also wants companies to have experienced management, preferably compensated with stock and able to communicate well with analysts, to prevent unrealistically high earnings estimates.
"With many small companies, the founders work from their garage and employ family members," he said. "They think the initial offering is the end of the story. But you need Wall Street money to plan for widget No. 2."
IN financial services, Mr. Lui said, "we've seen niche companies that have developed a growth model." One of them, he said, is UCBH Holdings of San Francisco, owner of United Commercial Bank. The company focuses on serving Chinese-American customers by hiring bilingual employees and offering bilingual cash machines and Internet sites. "This community is growing explosively," he said, "but the rest of the major money center banks don't know how to cater to them." 
He originally bought shares in January 2000 at $10.31; the stock now trades at $28.80.
He also likes Too Inc., a retailer based in Columbus, Ohio, that focuses on girls in the 7-to-14 age group in its Limited Too stores. The company was spun off from the Limited in 1999. "These are customers that are in between Gap Kids and Abercrombie & Fitch," he said. "There's plenty of opportunity to grow and expand. It's growing faster than the average company but sells at a discount to the S.& P. 500 companies." Shares sell for 16 times 2002 earnings estimates, versus a multiple of 21 for the S.& P. 500, he said, because "people think that no one will go shopping again because of the recent events."
He bought shares in August at $24.95; they now trade at $26.12.
Mr. Lui also likes Province Healthcare, a company in Brentwood, Tenn., that owns and operates acute-care hospitals, mostly outside of urban areas. Wall Street analysts say Province's earnings are likely to grow at 25 percent a year for two or three years. He bought the stock at $28.61 in August 2000; it now trades at $32.25.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital, Withering And Dying 

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
RICHARD THOMPSON and Larry Braitman made a fortune on Flycast Communications, an Internet advertising services company they founded in San Francisco in 1996 and sold about three years later to CMGI for $689 million.
 It was a classic tale of success in the Internet age, and the two men decided -- in the peculiar vernacular of the Web -- to leverage their success at starting Flycast by creating a venture capital firm to finance other new technology businesses. 
 Just as the 20th century gave way to the 21st, they opened Signia Ventures on the fifth floor of a midrise office building in San Mateo, Calif. Mr. Thompson, 47, and Mr. Braitman, 43, put up $50 million of the money they received for Flycast and started to pour it into new companies. 
Now, less than two years after opening, Signia Ventures' office is closed, its Web site blank and its phones unanswered. Mr. Thompson said he and Mr. Braitman had decided not to raise money from outside investors or invest in new deals until the market comes back, maybe next year.
As Mr. Thompson and Mr. Braitman symbolized the Internet boom of the 1990's, so they also came to illustrate the venture-capital bust that has rattled investors from the Bay Area to Boston -- a bust that is hurting even venerable firms like Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Beyer.
During the Internet bubble, dozens of speculators started to compete with established venture capitalists, using cash raised from rich people and big institutions to finance Internet start-ups or small biotechnology companies -- then hitting jackpot after jackpot by selling stock in those companies to insatiable investors.
Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at Charles River Ventures, a 30-year-old firm in Waltham, Mass., compared it to a baseball game where "suddenly they moved the fences in to 125 feet" from 330 or more. "There were a lot of pop-ups that suddenly were home runs," he said.
Today, the fences that venture capitalists are swinging for might as well be 550 feet away. With some market indexes off 50 percent or more and with uncertainty growing after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, investors have become much more discriminating. That has made it nearly impossible for venture capitalists to use the stock market to cash out of their speculative investments. So far this year, 29 venture-backed companies have tried initial offerings, compared with 252 in 2000. There are also fewer mergers and acquisitions.
As a result, many venture-capital newcomers have sharply reduced their investments, closed offices or shut down. Even Kleiner, Perkins, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and other established firms have slowed the pace of their investments after watching an unusual number of their companies go bust in the last two years. "There's not a lot of good news today in the venture business," said James W. Breyer, managing partner at Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif.
VENTURE capitalists, once the celebrated rainmakers of the new economy, now seem adrift. Elbow deep in troubled deals, they are pruning their portfolios, closing companies whose prospects are dim and concentrating instead on the handful that they think can survive a long downturn. The few investments they are making are usually in traditional software and health care.
In turn, the innovative technology sector, which had been the engine of growth, has been throttled back, and many promising but risky companies are either dying from lack of cash or hibernating until the market recovers. That is not good news for the economy. Last year, companies financed with venture capital since the 1970's accounted for 5.9 percent of the jobs in the United States and 13.1 percent of economic output, according to a study to be released tomorrow by the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group.
Venture capitalists point out that their business is cyclical and that they have been through down cycles before, as when a boom fueled by personal computer makers and suppliers limped to a halt in the late 1980's. But at the peak of the PC boom in mid-1983, venture capital under management was just $10.8 billion. Now, more than $200 billion is under management, so a downturn's magnitude is much greater -- and the reverberations felt more widely.
Venture capital investors themselves -- entrepreneurs like Jim Clark and Michael Dell and athletes like Wayne Gretzky and Andre Agassi, not to mention pension funds and endowments -- are seeing their capital shrink and their profit distributions dry up. Cash and stock payouts from these funds fell more than 80 percent in the first six months of the year, compared with the same period of 2000, according to Venture Economics, a firm that tracks venture capital.
As their returns shrivel, limited partners are growing disenchanted with what some call excessive management fees. Ominously, they are sometimes balking at their commitments to put more money into funds.
Venture capital funds lost 18.2 percent, on average, for the 12 months ended June 30, according to Venture Economics, while Internet-specific funds were down 27.7 percent. The triple-digit returns, on paper at least, that venture capitalists were promoting as recently as last year have melted away. "Everyone in this industry is hurting big time," said Tom Crotty, a partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.
That is especially true of the newcomers -- the investment bankers, corporations and entrepreneurs who jumped into the venture business when it was hot. Signia Ventures was hardly alone in closing: Octane Capital Management, a venture firm in San Francisco started in 1999, decided in April to close and to give back to investors what was left of the $265 million they had entrusted to the firm -- about half their initial stakes. Primedia, a magazine publisher based in New York, shut down its venture arm in early October. And Veracity Capital Partners -- a firm started in January by professionals at Battery and BCI Partners, a private-equity firm in Teaneck, N.J. -- disbanded after a few months when the founders realized that they would never raise $250 million.
"We were sick of banging our heads against the wall," said Mark Hastings, a co-founder of Veracity, who remains a partner at BCI.
Even the established firms have not been spared.
"Everyone has bad deals," said Bud Colligan, who founded the software maker Macromedia and is now a partner at Accel Partners, an 18-year-old venture firm. "The question is: Do you have 50 percent bad deals or 90 percent?" Mr. Colligan and Mitch Kapor, another Accel partner, recently decided to stop investing in new companies and to focus on their existing portfolio.
Most vulnerable are funds that were raised and invested at the height of the bubble, in 1999 and 2000, when 70 percent of all high-technology venture capital for the last two decades was invested. The competition for deals was so fierce that venture capitalists virtually threw money at start-ups, many of which had no clear plan for making money. Some venture capitalists also invested large amounts in companies that were about to sell stock, in hopes of quick profits when the stocks started trading; that aggressive strategy cost them dearly when investors turned their backs on such shares.
That is not to say that all venture investments made in the last few years were bad. It is still too early to calculate performance in such young funds, and one big hit could more than compensate for many duds. But the sheer volume of deals and the high valuations at which they were made all but assure that the crop of venture capital funds invested in the last few years will be among the worst-performing ever.
"Money invested in 1999 and 2000 is not going to do very well," said Clint Harris, a managing partner at Grove Street Advisors, which makes venture capital investments for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, called Calpers.
Funds started at that time are not all that are at risk. So are the firms created in those years to ride the momentum. One firm that epitomizes bubble investing is Technology Crossover Ventures, created in 1995 to capitalize on the investment opportunities of the Internet. A news release dated April 4, 2000, just days before the bubble burst, announced TCV IV, a $1.6 billion fund that, the release said, was "the largest-ever fund for Internet investing."
The firm's investment model called for it to invest in public and private companies at various stages of development. The model relied heavily on a thriving stock market to let the fund cash out quickly; as the markets turned sour, so did the firm's performance. TCV IV has invested only half of the money it raised and could still do well. But TCV's $380 million Fund III, raised in late 1998, worries at least one investor, who said "it will be a struggle" for it to return any cash.
THE Softbank Corporation is also paying the price of promiscuous investing. The company, which made a name as an early investor in Yahoo, created the $606 million Softbank Technology Ventures V fund in 1999 and invested quickly, only to have nine Internet companies in the fund go bust. Among the losers were DoDots Inc., which ate up $7.5 million of the fund's cash; and Urban Media Communications, which burned through $30 million. As of the end of last year, the fund had lost 29.8 percent of its value, said Steve Lisson, the editor of InsiderVC.com, a Web site that tracks venture capital. As of March 31, the fund was near the bottom of 136 funds ranked in a report for the State Universities Retirement System of Illinois.
Other Softbank funds were heavily invested in prominent duds like Webvan, the grocery-delivery company that closed in July; Kozmo.com, a home-delivery service that burned through $280 million before closing in April; and AllAdvantage, a site that paid members to surf the Web and shut down in early February. In September, Softbank Europe Ventures said it would close some offices and abandon plans for a new $600 million fund. It returned $200 million it had raised for that fund.
Another loser in the State Universities ranking was the Summit Accelerator Fund, started in 1999 by the private equity investor Summit Partners in Boston. That fund was down almost 19 percent on March 31.
Few firms escaped unscathed, regardless of experience. Benchmark Capital Management rewarded investors in its earlier funds with winners like eBay, the auction site, and Ariba, which lets businesses buy supplies online. But it also backed some bombs, including Webvan, an online furniture seller called Living.com and an online sporting goods retailer, MVP.com, that was also backed by Michael Jordan, John Elway and other professional athletes. All three businesses have closed.
Benchmark has wiped any trace of Webvan off of its Web site, but that deal and others are memorialized in "eBoys," by Randall E. Stross (Crown, 2000). The book glorified the firm's six towering partners, who averaged 6 feet, 6 inches tall and included the venture newcomers David Beirne, who joined from the recruiter Ramsey Beirne, and Bill Gurley, a former Wall Street analyst. At least Benchmark got off relatively easy: it invested $3 million for 12 percent of Webvan, while later investors, including Sequoia Capital, paid $53.5 million for roughly the same stake.
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Beyer, among the most renowned venture capital firms, has had a string of start-ups go awry. One was Kibu, a Web site for teenagers started in 1999 with $22 million from Kleiner and Mr. Clark, a founder of Netscape; Kibu closed last fall. Another was Coreon Inc., which sold broadband services; it laid off its remaining staff and is returning some of the $73 million it raised from investors in February. A third, BroadBand Office, which provided high-speed Internet access to buildings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May and has since merged with Yipes Communications.
"They have a lot of dead wood like everyone else," said an executive at a pension fund that invests with Kleiner, Perkins. The executive, who like others with money in venture funds agreed to be interviewed only if not identified, added that he would not be surprised if Kleiner funds raised in 1999 and 2000 had single-digit returns this year. In the recent past, some Kleiner funds have doubled or even tripled investors' money -- on paper -- in a single year.
Vinod Khosla, a partner at Kleiner, Perkins who spotted winners like Juniper Networks, which returned 5,000 times investors' capital, said venture capitalists assume that some decisions will not work out. "If things don't fail," he said, "it means we are not taking enough risk."
Indeed, venture capitalists like Mr. Khosla contend that now is an excellent time to invest in start-ups. And venture capital firms have about $75 billion in cash that they have raised but not yet invested.
Mr. Khosla, for his part, favors technologies that can help companies reduce costs or increase productivity. With the threat of terrorism, security software and hardware are popular with venture funds, as are life-sciences companies.
Money is also available to companies with new ideas. One is Groove Networks, a maker of software that helps a company's employees converse electronically and share documents instantly with suppliers and customers. Partly on the reputation of its founder, Ray Ozzie, the creator of the Lotus Notes program, Groove raised $54 million earlier this month from Microsoft and Accel.
But many venture firms need to clean up their mistakes. While a lot of investments have already been written down -- some to zero -- people in the industry say a number of firms are still carrying deals on their books at older, inflated values.
"There was so much activity and so much excess in the last two years it will take several years for the system to work through the excesses," Mr. Breyer of Accel said. "We'll see a decrease in the number of V.C. firms as well as the number of venture capitalists."
That is already apparent on the fringes of the business, which swelled to more than 1,000 firms at the end of last year, more than twice as many as in 1995. Fewer corporations invest through venture capital arms started just a few years ago, and "incubator" firms that invested in, advised and sometimes gave office space to start-ups are less accommodating.
Despite a handful of closings, like those of Signia and Veracity, many venture firms are unlikely to start boarding up their airy offices on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, the Park Avenue of venture capitalists. Venture funds are set up as limited partnerships to last at least 10 years. So even if there is no new activity at a firm, venture capitalists can linger for years on management fees -- typically 2 percent annually -- without generating a dime in profits.
Instead of closing quickly, venture firms in trouble are likely to become unable or unwilling to raise funds, and to have their star performers leave for better opportunities.
For now, the law of the venture jungle may be survival of the fattest. Venture capitalists who have raised $1 billion or more in recent months will have a better chance of surviving the slump. This year alone, nine firms -- including New Enterprise Associates, Battery Ventures and Greylock in Boston -- raised at least that amount. That should see them through the next couple of years; most do not expect to try to raise more money until 2002 or 2003. Stewart Alsop, a New Enterprises partner, said his firm might not even ask investors for all of the $2.2 billion they pledged to its latest fund.
Despite the capital raised in the last few years, some firms burned through cash like reckless start-ups, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of months. New Enterprises was the bubble's most prolific investor, backing a total of 122 deals in 1999 and 136 in 2000, according to VentureOne. As a result, New Enterprises and others are going back to investors to raise annex funds -- also called bailout funds -- to keep their investments afloat.
Firms seeking to raise more money may find a less-than-enthusiastic reception. The downturn and the undisciplined investing of the past are testing the ties between venture capitalists and their investors. Some venture capitalists have sued limited partners who threatened to default on capital commitments, which they promise up front and pay over several years. Although that is rare, Jonathan Axelrad, a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, said the rate of limited-partner defaults was "unprecedented." The firm, he said, is handling several such cases.
SOME investors, meanwhile, complain privately about the fees charged by venture capitalists. In a 10-year, billion-dollar fund, operating costs alone can be $200 million. On top of that is the "carry," the portion of profits that venture capitalists receive -- as much as 30 or even 35 percent. More than a few limited partners have concluded that their interests may be at odds with those of the fund managers.
Low returns and high fees are leading many big pension funds and endowments to consider reducing their investments in risky businesses like venture capital. "The fund-raising market is extremely difficult right now and getting worse," said Mr. Harris, the Grove Street partner.
As one endowment manager explained: "So many of our firms raised a lot of money ending a year ago and have not come back since the world changed. Some we are worried about. When they do come back, we will give it a hard look and may choose to end the relationship."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the problems of venture capital funds referred imprecisely to an investor's concern about the future performance of Technology Crossover Ventures' Fund III. The investor worried that the fund would have to struggle to return profits, not to return the investors' initial capital. Technology Crossover Ventures says the fund has returned $429.7 million on the $417.3 million in committed capital.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Wrestle With World's New Rules; 
A Delicate Balance: Patriotism vs. Business

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK; Reed Abelson and Milt Freudenheim also did reporting for this article.

 BODY:
WITH fears of bioterrorism growing by the day, the nation's pharmaceutical companies are facing a quandary -- trying to show that they are patriots, not profiteers, even as they protect their way of doing business.
 In the last two weeks, as consumers and public health officials have scrambled to procure enough antibiotics to treat anthrax, the drug industry -- especially Bayer of Germany, which makes Cipro, the antibiotic most in demand to fight the disease -- has had its ethics questioned. 
 It has watched as the patent system, the bedrock of its business, has come under renewed attack, not as something that merely causes higher drug prices but as a threat to national security itself. On Thursday, Canada said it would ignore Bayer's patent on Cipro and buy one million tablets of a generic version from another company, saying it could not be assured of getting enough from Bayer. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has urged the American government to follow Canada's lead. 
The drug industry has experienced renewed concerns about the pricing practices that have tarnished its image in the past, and which could deepen if the industry is perceived as unduly profiting from the nation's misfortune.
And as the need for new vaccines and treatments for protection against biological agents increases, it may well have to review and revise its research and development priorities.
"Recent events have been quite tumultuous in the drug industry," said David F. Saks, founder of the Saks Mediscience fund, an investment fund in New York. "The drug industry is now right at the top of the food chain of what's important to America."
Last week, in an attempt to rally to the nation's defense, the big drug companies formed a task force to work with the government to provide vaccines and drugs needed to protect against bioterrorism.
Coming all at once, these developments may lead to fundamental change in an industry that has enjoyed phenomenal success. Hugely profitable, the major drug companies have enjoyed double-digit growth in recent years and their business has held up better than virtually any other industry since the economy began to cool last year. So have their stocks, many of which have risen even since Sept. 11.
Pharmaceutical companies, often called defensive investments because spending on drugs tends to hold up even in recessions, are now literally becoming defense contractors, like the aerospace companies.
This could change the relationship between the government and the industry, which has typically been one of regulator and regulated. "I'd say the pharmaceutical industry up till now has taken a very defensive posture toward the government," said Peter A. Tollman, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group who advises pharmaceutical companies. But in bioterrorism defense, the government becomes a partner and customer. "That's a marketing job, not a regulatory one," he said. 
Congress is likely to pump millions or possibly even billions of dollars into the pharmaceutical industry for research and development of drugs that could be used for protection against biological agents, and perhaps lower regulatory hurdles for those drugs as well. That could mean more work going to two areas -- vaccines and antibiotics -- that the companies have paid little attention to in recent decades as they have raced to develop more lucrative drugs to lower cholesterol, treat ulcers and fight baldness.
But the money will not come without strings. Military contracting typically carries lower profit margins than the drug industry is accustomed to, and the government may well demand below-market prices for drugs. That is one reason the drug companies until now have been reluctant to make vaccines for the Pentagon. New security restrictions might impede the free flow of information that can speed research. And while it is good publicity now that the tools of biotechnology are being pressed into service in the nation's defense, in the long run the link between biotechnology and the military could be one more reason beyond cloning and genetically modified food that some people mistrust the new technology.
YET for the big drug companies, defense work is likely to be a small part of their business.
None of those companies that were asked for interviews were willing to make an executive available to discuss the impacts of the bioterrorism issue on their business, saying it is too early to know. Even the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group that typically handles queries about issues the companies do not care to deal with themselves, would not comment.
But if the long-term changes are fuzzy, the immediate threat to patents is very real. There have been serious challenges to patents before. Critics and some foreign health officials have contended that patents preserve high prices that have made drugs unaffordable for millions in Africa who are dying from AIDS. Some consumer groups have blamed patents in part for high American drug prices that send busloads of older Americans streaming into Canada in search of cheaper pills.
The anthrax scare has brought the issue home to the average American, in what seems more like a potential life-and-death situation. Worried consumers are desperately trying to obtain Cipro, until last week the only drug specifically approved for inhaled anthrax, the deadliest kind. And the government plans to stockpile millions more doses. There is concern that Bayer cannot meet demand quickly enough, putting pressure on the government to break the patent, or find ways around it, and buy generic versions.
"The other pressures on the industry have been heavily about price," said John C. Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, the advocacy group for middle-aged and older Americans. This time, he said, it is a matter of procuring enough. "This is a situation where the national interest is so clear that I think it will outweigh the normal business process." 
What the industry has feared most is so-called compulsory licensing -- a government basically allowing a patented drug to be copied. Even during the AIDS crisis, the industry managed to stave off that action, with several companies agreeing to supply a particular drug at a deep discount rather than see the sanctity of patents undermined. 
That is why the action of Canada is so worrisome to Bayer and the industry. And if the United States were to do something similar, as Senator Schumer urges, it would set a precedent that would make it easier for other countries to follow suit with other drugs for various other medical emergencies. 
In true crises, the rules may well change. "Extraordinary events sometimes call for extraordinary corporate compassion," said Thomas Donaldson, a business ethics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "The company cannot just look at profits but must look at the face of the victims."
So far, the Bush administration has insisted it is not necessary to break Bayer's patent, in part because there are other antibiotics that can also be used against anthrax.
BUT some ethics professors say Bayer should allow others to produce the drug. The panic about a possible shortage may itself constitute a public emergency, said John W. Dienhart, a business ethics professor at Seattle University. "We're dealing with life and death itself, not Post-it Notes," he said.
Bayer, for its part, said there is no ethical quandary because it can meet the demand. It is working night and day and reopening a German factory to triple output.
The industry also argues that allowing generic versions of Cipro is unnecessary. "We think this is a solution for a problem that does not exist," said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. "We don't have a supply problem with our medicines."
Some ethicists agreed. "If they can make enough, that solves the problem," said John R. Boatright, a business ethics professor at Loyola University of Chicago. 
But others said Bayer was taking a big risk even if it truly could make enough Cipro. It could be perceived as a poor corporate citizen if it does not allow others to produce the drug. "Companies are often required to see the psychology as well as the objective facts," Mr. Donaldson said. 
And Gerald C. Meyers, a former chairman of American Motors who is now a business professor at the University of Michigan, said: "They can't do anything other than license. They'll take such a hit if they refuse."
In fact, Bayer is exploring steps to prevent its patent from being broken by government decree. It can decide, for example, to license other companies to produce Cipro.
Still, even if Bayer escapes the immediate threat, pressure on patents may well continue -- even the industry insists that they are essential to encourage innovation. On Thursday, reacting in part to concerns about anthrax, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a bill that would make it harder for drug companies to stave off generic competition.
Moreover, the government, anxious to keep developing countries in its fragile political coalition against terrorism, might be less aggressive in protecting the interests of the American pharmaceutical industry in other countries through trade pressures. "The U.S. government is likely to feel embarrassed at a time when coalition members or countries with big refugee problems are perhaps going to join the list of countries looking for a break on pharmaceutical products," said Ken LaPensee, senior vice president of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy, an industry consulting firm.
Anxious to show they are rising to the cause, the large pharmaceutical companies formed an emergency preparedness task force of seven top executives to assist the government in meeting health needs and responding to bioterrorism. Drug companies like Merck, the Aventis Pasteur unit of Aventis of France, American Home Products and Baxter International have talked to the government about making vaccines for smallpox.
Announcing the task force, the industry's trade association said the industry had always responded in times of national emergency, pointing to its role in developing penicillin and malaria drugs in World War II.
BUT that was more than a half-century ago, and in recent years the industry has been far less willing to respond to government needs. A report last year by a Pentagon advisory panel, made up mostly of pharmaceutical executives, noted that drug companies had "a decades-long trend of relatively inconsequential support of D.O.D. vaccine production requirements." 
It was, after all, the Defense Department, not Bayer, that did the animal studies needed to have Cipro approved for use as an anthrax treatment -- the very approval that will now yield a windfall for the company worth possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Vaccines in general have not been a good business, especially compared with drugs for heart disease, cancer or high cholesterol. Many vaccines are taken once in a lifetime rather than over and over, and prices have tended to be low because governments are often the buyers. Those problems, plus liability concerns, have cut the number of big drug companies making vaccines from more than a dozen to four -- Merck, American Home Products, Aventis Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline of Britain, plus several smaller ones. There have been shortages of some vaccines even for childhood diseases.
Legislation in 1986, however, alleviated some liability problems and better technology has started to make the business more attractive again.
Making vaccines against biowarfare agents has been considered even a worse business because there was a chance such vaccines would not be used. The job is also a big one. The Pentagon needs about 15 vaccines for different biowarfare agents, the advisory panel found. Yet the entire vaccine industry now produces vaccines for only about 20 diseases. To top it off, the defense contracting procedures are bureaucratic and needs are subject to change.
Antibiotics, as a category of drugs, have not received much emphasis in the last two decades because so many germs seemed to have been conquered. But even before the terrorist attacks, some companies had begun new research, largely because many bacteria are becoming resistant to existing drugs. Both start-ups and big companies are using new knowledge about the genomes of pathogens to design new ways to attack them. New funding in the wake of a national bioterrorism effort could give those efforts a boost.
The industry has asked Congress for reforms to make the production more attractive, like greater relief from liability, a long-term financial commitment by the government and quicker review of new vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration. Such measures could offer incentives not only for military vaccines but other vaccines and drugs as well.
This sudden need for treatments, vaccines and detection systems for biological agents may be a boon to start-up companies, for which a government contract can supply significant financing in the early stages. Just as spending on space and military projects helped nurture early semiconductor companies, a defense biotechnology buildup promises more biotechnology start-ups incubated by government grants.
But a closer relationship to the military also carries risks. Aerospace companies that became too dependent on government contracts had trouble adjusting to the faster pace of commercial markets. 
There is also the danger that the same techniques and laboratory machinery that can be used to design defenses against biowarfare agents might be used to create more potent such weapons. A few years ago, the government began restricting the free flow of samples of pathogens used in research, and those restrictions might now grow tighter. If fears spread, there could be further government monitoring of sales of laboratory equipment or possibly even limits on the open publication of pathogen genome sequences.
"Certainly people in the industry are beginning to talk about how should or how could information flow like this be controlled," said Robert L. Erwin, chairman and chief executive of the Large Scale Biology Corporation, a biotechnology company in Vacaville, Calif. 
Any association with bioweapons could also raise another public fear about the implications of biotechnology at a time when the industry is already facing controversies over genetically modified food, cloning and stem cells. 
"There's a concern that undue attention to biological weaponry may have a chilling effect on all of biotechnology," said Steven M. Block, a biology professor at Stanford. He said those worries helped explain why biologists and industry executives generally did not take active positions in trying to control biological weapons, unlike physicists who got active in nuclear arms control. 
INDEED, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies opposed recently proposed revisions to strengthen global controls on biological warfare, saying the proposed inspections of their factories and laboratories would provide an opportunity for industrial espionage. That was one reason President Bush said the United States would not sign the new treaty. 
Still, Carl B. Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents biotechnology companies, and a former Pentagon official himself, seems pleased about the new relationship between the government and his industry.
"Defense contracting is pretty arduous and red-tape-heavy and many of the companies have shied away from it, frankly, as not really entrepreneurial," he said. "But I think a lot of that feeling might have been overcome by the events of Sept. 11."

More Than Earnings on Traders' Minds

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
More than one-third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reported quarterly earnings last week, an event that in usual circumstances would dominate the news affecting the stock market. But investors seemed more concerned with the United States military action in Afghanistan and a fresh wave of anthrax scares, creating a nervous mood on Wall Street that left major indexes lower for the week. 
 Although some big influential technology companies like Intel and I.B.M. reported quarterly results that met or exceeded expectations, they failed to incite much buying. And the market was jolted by an announcement that more than 30 people in Senator Tom Daschle's Washington offices had tested positive for anthrax exposure. Investors were also worried after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the timing of an economic recovery was unclear. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 140.05 points, or 1.5 percent, to 9,204.11. The Nasdaq composite dropped 32.09 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,671.31. The S.& P. 500 index fell 18.17 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,073.48. SHERRI DAY

Public Health Or Public Relations

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was rough going for the Bush administration last week, and not just because an anthrax panic shut down Capitol Hill. Once again, a series of decisions by federal officials fueled suspicions over what critics have called the snug relationship between the Bush White House and big business -- this time the giant pharmaceutical industry, which lavishes twice as much in political contributions on the Republican party as on the Democrats.
 What left critics taken aback was that the White House seemed so avidly to be siding with the rights of drug companies to make profits rather than with consumers worried about their access to the antibiotic Cipro, the treatment of choice against anthrax. For its part, the Bush administration maintained that overriding Bayer's patent on the antibiotic Cipro, as Canada did last week, wasn't legal or necessary. 
 In the middle of the confusion, a key question remained unanswered. Was this a bigger public relations blunder by the administration than it was a failure in public health?
"Bayer can probably produce enough Cipro for anthrax exposure," said Bruce C. Vladeck, a professor at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the head of Medicare in the first Clinton administration. "Can they produce enough Cipro for everybody in the United States? No."
"For that reason," he added, "the administration is in a difficult position, because they're probably doing the right thing from a public health standpoint. But they're framing the issue in terms of the economics of the pharmaceutical industry."
In a week of conflicting messages -- including a statement by Tommy G. Thompson, the health and human services secretary, that the Food and Drug Administration had just approved two additional antibiotics against anthrax when in fact those antibiotics had been approved for decades -- the facts were these:
Bush administration officials said it would be illegal to break Bayer's patent and to authorize five other companies to produce generic versions of the drug, thereby greatly increasing supply. Some patent lawyers and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, countered that there was clear authority under federal law for the government to act. 
Canada in essence agreed. Citing "extraordinary and unusual times," Health Canada announced it was overriding Bayer's patent on Cipro and ordering a million tablets of a generic version from a Canadian company. Bayer condemned the action, saying it could meet the demand on its own. 
"We don't feel there's a need to lift the patent at this time," said Anthony T. Jewell, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "Multiple drugs can be used to treat anthrax, and Bayer has assured us that it can meet our demand for Cipro."
To skeptics, such assurances were not persuasive. The German-based Bayer A.G. may have said it was tripling production, but it was not clear how much would come to the United States, or when, or how much the government would need. Mr. Thompson said the government would increase its emergency stockpile of antibiotics to have enough for 12 million people for 60 days, 6 times the current amount, but he did not specify how much would be Cipro.
Meanwhile, Common Cause, a nonpartisan monitoring group, wasted no time in reporting that Bayer's American subsidiary gave Republicans and Republican committees in the 2000 election cycle more than $93,000 in soft money contributions. The company's contributions to Democrats in the same period was $500. Overall, the drug industry gave Republicans $10.3 million in the 2000 election cycle and Democrats $5.6 million.
Critics viewed the administration's endorsement of the efficacy of other drugs as a way to avoid moving aggressively against Bayer, as Canada did. If penicillin and doxycycline are effective against anthrax, as Mr. Thompson said last week, then there would be no need to break Bayer's patent -- a huge blow to a troubled company that was struggling only two months ago to just stay in the drug business. Overriding the patent would also undercut the administration's opposition to breaking other patents to provide cheaper generic drugs for AIDS patients in Africa, an action the Clinton administration initially resisted, too.
Hovering over the political debate was a larger scientific question. Are penicillin and doxycycline as effective against anthrax as Cipro? Although the first two have been approved by the F.D.A. since the 1950's to treat all forms of anthrax, Cipro was approved last year specifically for treating "inhalation anthrax," the deadliest form of the disease. The reason, agency officials said, was that they wanted a weapon against anthrax should they come up against a strain resistant to drugs in the penicillin and tetracycline families of antibiotics. The thinking, they said, was that a terrorist might have been able to engineer a form of anthrax resistant to the older drugs. Cipro was put on the market in 1987.
To date, all the anthrax bacteria isolated in Florida, New York and Washington have responded to penicillin and doxycycline as well as Cipro. The older drugs were also shown to be as effective as Cipro in a 1997 Pentagon study of anthrax in rhesus monkeys. But the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, said in a White House briefing on Friday that a typical course of treatment against anthrax is to start with Cipro, determine if the anthrax strain is resistant to penicillin and doxycyline, then switch if indicated to the other drugs. Dr. Satcher also said Cipro is not recommended over the long term in children.
The F.D.A. announced midweek that it would ask the makers of penicillin and doxycycline to change their labeling to say the medicines treat "inhalation anthrax" as well as just "anthrax." (That narrow F.D.A. announcement appeared to be the basis for Mr. Thompson's erroneous statement to a Senate panel the same day that the agency was approving the use of the two older antibiotics against anthrax.) 
Nonetheless, Cipro ended the week as it started -- the gold standard, rightly or wrongly, scientifically or psychologically -- against both inhalation anthrax and the less serious cutaneous anthrax. 
Some public health care experts said Mr. Thompson's promotion of the cheaper antibiotics raised questions about elites versus everyone else. "What's in his medicine cabinet?" asked James P. Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a part of Ralph Nader's organization that pushes for lower drug prices. "When prices ration access to life-saving technologies, you have morally unacceptable outcomes. If there's a big attack, do you think the Cipro will be delivered to the South Bronx before it's delivered to Wall Street?"
By week's end, Mr. Thompson said he was negotiating with Bayer and other drug companies to buy plentiful antibiotics to fight anthrax. "I can assure you taxpayers will get a very good deal from my negotiations with Bayer," he declared Friday. 
But the political damage may have already been done.

HEADLINE: Shelters Have Empty Beds; Abused Women Stay Home 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Refuge House, the battered women's shelter in Tallahassee, Fla., is usually full -- so full that there are plans to replace the 28-bed facility with a 70-bed shelter. 
 But since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, most of the beds at Refuge House have been empty. The day after the attacks, it was less than half full; by Sept. 24, it was less than a quarter full. 
 "Women just stopped calling our hot line after the attacks," said Kelly Otte, the executive director. "One day, there were only two women in the whole shelter. Just as other people in relationships are pulled together in a tragedy, feeling that family's the most important thing, battered women feel that same pull. They're already very vulnerable, and they may feel they need to be with somebody, no matter what, so maybe the violence of the relationship is not such a big deal compared with a huge national crisis." 
After the terror attacks, many people are reviewing their priorities and clinging tighter to loved ones, psychologists say. More people are interested in writing wills: ARAG Group, which provides group legal insurance plans, has been getting 20 percent more calls about will preparation than usual since Sept. 11 -- and its Web site offering legal forms has had a fiftyfold increase in the number of will documents purchased. Concerns about protecting family members have contributed to surging sales of life insurance, cellphones, gas masks and guns. 
But for some of the nation's most vulnerable people, including battered women and those who are chronically depressed or isolated, the crisis has had quite a different impact. 
In Cleveland, Paula Koos said that of 69 women at the Domestic Violence Center, at least eight left the shelter in the week after the attacks. 
"Women went back to their abusers, precipitated by a feeling that a bad home is better than no home at all," Ms. Koos said. "These are women who often feel overwhelmed, and not in control of their lives. So some of them feel that even if they're not returning to the best situation, at least they won't be solely responsible for taking care of themselves and their children." 
At Tallahassee's Refuge House, women were beginning to come back last week. But the attacks were still affecting victims of domestic violence, Ms. Otte said. 
"Some batterers have made the terrorism part of their repertoire of pain-invoking techniques," Ms. Otte said. "One woman got an e-mail from her abuser, saying that it was a shame with all these buildings getting hit, that no one had hit her building."
She continued: "Our occupancy rate is still way down, but the staff tells me that they're again getting calls from women who want help. Last week, they held beds for three women and seven kids who had called, but they never came in. It's not normal for so many to call and not show up." 
While not all shelters reported so many empty beds -- a few said they had more clients than ever, because of increasing domestic violence they linked to the declining economy -- many, across the country, said the women they served had come under increased pressure to return to abusive relationships. 
"The batterers will say this is a time when we need to be together as a family, you need to be here where I can protect you," said Kristina Matkins, the director of community relations at Safehouse Denver Inc. "We had at least two women whose perpetrators used the terror attacks as an excuse to coerce them back into the relationships. The problem is that what we know about domestic violence is that it will happen again." 
At crisis hot lines, too, the terrorism, at least initially, brought an eerie lull. The usual calls from depressed people contemplating suicide all but ceased in those first few days, when much of the nation was watching television. 
"There was a huge silence on crisis hot lines right after Sept. 11," said Reese Butler of the National Hopeline Network, which connects 73 hot lines nationwide in its 1-800-SUICIDE line. "Calls dropped in half. Most people who call hot lines don't have anyone in their regular lives they can call and say, 'I hate my life.' But after a tragedy, things are different. People take care of each other more, check in, hug. So the chronic callers, the typical depressions, are less isolated, and they're not calling. Now, our callers are people trying to deal with the anxieties and the grief left in the aftermath of the tragedy." 
In Arlington, Va., Arlene Krohmal said that after an initial period of "deathly quiet," the call volume at the CrisisLink hot line had picked up, but more than a quarter of the calls were still about the Sept. 11 attacks.
"We're hearing from a lot of the first responders, people who had to deal with the initial trauma," she said. "We know that after man-made disasters, suicide rates go up and stay up for several years. In Oklahoma City, it was still up five years later. So we're expecting that, but none of this is immediate. After a huge trauma, it can be a long time before you see all the effects."

HEADLINE: San Francisco Adds Adults but Loses Children 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Despite its famous parks and postcard neighborhoods, San Francisco was the nation's only major city to add population but lose children in the last decade, as cost-of-living pressures forced out middle- and working-class families.
 While San Francisco boomed, it ended the decade with 4,100 fewer children under 18 than it had in 1990, passing Seattle to become the major American city least likely to have households with children, according to census data. 
 "It's just crazy that I can't live where I'm from," said Laurie Alessandra, 35, who left to find an affordable two-bedroom apartment for her partner and the twin girls she was adopting. "It breaks my heart. It's a cool city for kids." 
Elsewhere around the country, the lure of bigger backyards, cheaper housing and better schools in the suburbs continued to draw families away from otherwise desirable cities.
Three of the major cities with the fewest children -- Portland, Ore., Seattle and San Francisco -- were rated among the top five "kid-friendly" big cities this year by Zero Population Growth, a Washington-based group that factored in education, crime and parks.
"You would think that people with kids would gravitate toward these cities," said Tim Cline, a spokesman for the group.
San Francisco has at least two strikes against it: troubled public schools and high housing prices. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a full-time worker needs to make nearly $70,000 a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment in the metropolitan area. Last spring, the school system's new superintendent described it as broken when the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating millions in missing money.
The under-18 share of San Francisco's population dropped to 14.5 percent in the last decade from 16.1 percent in 1990, or 112,800 of the 777,000 residents, according to census data. 
One reason is that families are moving to the suburbs. No age group in San Francisco measured by the Census Bureau lost people faster than the 0-to-4 bracket.
As families with newborns moved out, they were replaced in part by people in their 20's trying to make their fortune in the dot-com world. Nearly a quarter of San Francisco residents are between 25 and 34.
"Cities actually serve as marriage markets," said Edward Glaeser, aHarvard professor of urban economy. "They're attractive places for young singles to be."
San Francisco's 45-to-54 population also spiked, as an older set of people without children gentrified the city.
Other cities, notably industrial metropolises like Detroit, Baltimore and Milwaukee, also lost under-18 population in the 1990's. But those cities shrank over all, too. San Francisco was unique in that it grew by 53,000 people in the 1990's, and still lost children.
San Francisco's is the only one of California's 10 largest school districts with a shrinking enrollment. Children live in fewer than one in five San Francisco households, compared with more than one in three households nationally, according to census data.
Those with the means to leave must choose between their nesting instincts and the attractions of city life that drew them in the first place.
"We wanted to be able to afford a place with a yard," said Holly Schick, 32, who moved with her husband, Robin, from San Francisco in 1999, when their son, Isaac, was 2.

HEADLINE: Washington May Face A Shortfall Next Year 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
City officials say the District of Columbia could face a budget shortage of up to $245 million next year because of declining revenues and unexpected health, labor and education costs.
 Natwar M. Gandhi, the city's chief financial officer, told the City Council on Friday that Washington faced "a long-term structural imbalance" between its revenues and its spending. Mr. Gandhi said the city needed help from the federal government. 
 "The economic good times the District has experienced for the last five years, a period in which each year's growth of revenues has significantly exceeded inflation, have masked this imbalance," he said. "In an economic downturn, the imbalance will become glaringly apparent."
The announcement raised the possibility of budget cuts because the mayor has vowed to avoid a deficit.
Three weeks ago the federal financial control board shut down, giving full responsibility for fiscal matters to city officials. Those officials say they will fix financial problems through better management.
Mr. Gandhi said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath have had a dire effect on the city's economy.
Local revenues could be reduced by nearly $100 million, Mr. Gandhi said, because of the attack on the Pentagon, the closing of Ronald Reagan National Airport and the discovery of anthrax on Capitol Hill.
The city also faces about $145 million in unforeseen expenses, he said. It has had trouble estimating Medicaid revenue, and revenue for the budgets of the Department of Health and the public schools could fall short of projections. The city's labor agreements also cost $12 million more than expected.
Mayor Anthony A. Williams has said there will be no budget deficits in Washington. He said he would ensure that the city balanced its budget. 
"The general consensus is that we could have a budget problem," said Tony Bullock, a spokesman for Mr. Williams. "Revenues have not been as robust as planned earlier this year. But we are in a strong position to handle the problem."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: GROUND WAR; 
G.I. Raid Struck Taliban Leader's Compound

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
The airborne commando raid into southern Afghanistan overnight Friday attacked a military airfield and a headquarters compound of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's leader, in a daring strike to uncover information about the location and activities of Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders, the Pentagon said today. 
 Meeting only light resistance, the predawn assault was conducted in at least two locations about 60 miles apart by more than 100 Army Ranger paratroopers and other helicopter-borne Special Forces troops. 
 Privately, military officials strongly suggested that covert action aimed at the Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership was still under way. Other missions could be launched, spurred by intelligence gathered from the overnight raid or in anticipation of movement or other responses by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, these officials said. 
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Special Operation forces "accomplished our objectives," although neither Mullah Omar nor other Taliban or Al Qaeda leaders were present during the attack on a Taliban compound near the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual center. 
Military officials said the fast-paced mission had two primary objectives. First, helicopters from the carrier Kitty Hawk off Pakistan whisked Special Operations forces to Mullah Omar's compound in Kandahar, which included a residence and several other buildings. 
The site had not been bombed, unlike many other leadership compounds, and elite commandos seized papers and other intelligence information that might reveal clues about Taliban operations and the whereabouts of Taliban leaders. 
"I'll characterize the one target as one of the locations where Omar lives. And it's a fairly large complex," General Myers said. "It's a command and control compound for the Taliban leadership." 
At the same time about 60 miles to the southwest, Army Rangers who had loaded onto transport planes in nearby Oman parachuted into the second main target, a remote airfield. The soldiers destroyed a small arms cache, including rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.
Military officers said seizing the airport gave the military a good look at the runway and facilities for future operations, both military and humanitarian. 
It also enabled the military to secure the airfield in case the operation at Mullah Omar's compound ran into trouble, and reinforcements or medical supplies needed to be rushed in. 
Moreover, it showed the Taliban and Al Qaeda that the United States military could land and carry out operations on the ground in Afghanistan. Indeed, at a Pentagon news conference today, officials showed grainy, greenish footage filmed by night-vision cameras showing paratroopers jumping out the door of the plane, and then their chutes opening.
Finally, seizing the airfield was meant to be a confidence-building mission for the military and the American people. The Rangers left behind a calling card: 8 1/2- by 11-inch sheets that said "Freedom Endures," with a picture of firemen raising the American flag at what appeared to be the World Trade Center, a defense official said.
At the news conference, General Myers, gave an upbeat assessment of the mission, which signaled a new and dangerous phase in America's war on terrorism. "The mission over all was successful," said General Myers, who was a fighter pilot in Vietnam and who became chairman less than a month ago. 
Even so, military commanders had held out the slim hope that they might be able to capture Mullah Omar or one of his top lieutenants.
"We did not expect to find significant Taliban leadership at these locations," General Myers said. "We, of course, were hoping we would, but we did not expect it, and we did not find senior Taliban or Al Qaeda leadership." 
General Myers said that American forces killed and injured some Taliban fighters, but he did not give a number.
Pentagon officials said today that the mission had been ready since midweek, and that Gen. Tommy R. Franks, head of the United States Central Command, had given the green light on Friday when he thought conditions were "optimal."
Military officials said Special Forces from more than one service were involved in the overnight attack, the first major American commando raid since Somalia nearly a decade ago. Army Rangers, Green Berets, Navy Seals, Air Force Special Operations forces and the elite Army Delta Force unit are believed to be on board the Kitty Hawk or operating elsewhere in the region. 
Army Rangers have in the past operated in tandem with the Army's secret counterterrorist unit, Delta Force. For example, the Rangers, the service's elite infantry, can create a flashy diversion so small Delta teams can carry out their mission. Or they can execute a more forceful entry than the Delta commandos could make themselves. 
General Myers and other military officials refused to discuss tactics, techniques and the kinds of weapons and weapons systems used in the raid, citing the unconventional nature of the conflict. 
"This was done in very unique ways," one Defense Department official said. "We hope to use some of these tactics again." 
President Bush, speaking from an economic summit meeting in Shanghai, hinted at the true aim of the mission. "We are destroying terrorist hideaways," he said. "We are slowly but surely encircling the terrorists so that we can bring them to justice." 
Mr. Bush said that he mourned the loss of two servicemen killed in a Black Hawk helicopter accident related to the mission.
"There will be moments of sacrifice," the president said today just before a meeting with the Japanese prime minister. "We've seen two such examples today." 
The president held a video-teleconference this morning with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was at his ranch in Taos, N.M., and with General Myers and Gen. Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the joint chiefs, who were in Washington. 
Congressional leaders who were briefed by administration officials on the operation expressed support for the mission. "The military campaign has proceeded just as it should," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said through a spokesman. "It's not an assault on Islam or the Afghan people, but on terrorists and those who harbor them." 
Airstrikes continued over Afghanistan today, as B-1 and B-52 bombers and carrier-based FA-18's and F-14's dropped laser-guided and satellite-guided bombs during daytime raids over Kabul, the capital, and Kandahar and Herat. "It's the same level as it's been the past few days -- robust," said Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman. 
The Pentagon said the two American servicemen killed in a supporting rescue mission had not crossed into Afghanistan. Defense officials said today that at least one person aboard the helicopter was injured in the accident. General Myers said that three other soldiers suffered minor injuries in the helicopter accident, and that two Army Rangers were injured slightly in the parachute drops.
The officials declined to say whether there were any American casualties in the commando raid, although all helicopters involved in the raid reported safely back to the carrier Kitty Hawk in the Arabian Sea.
Although it was never declared how the Rangers returned to base, it is very likely they were picked up by airplanes at the airfield they secured. 
General Myers denied Taliban reports that the helicopter involved in the accident had been shot down. Military and Pakistani officials said the aircraft was standing by in Pakistani air space to assist in a search-and-rescue mission, but crashed while landing at the Dalbandin air base in Pakistan, about 60 miles from the Afghan border. 
The crash was caused by "a brown-out," the Defense Department official said, describing a huge cloud of dust kicked up by the wash of the rotor blades upon landing, which apparently disoriented the pilot or interfered with the equipment.
The Black Hawk is the main, heavily armed troop carrier for all Army forces. The Special Forces use a specially equipped version that provides better capabilities at night and can be refueled in the air.
The accident brings to three the number of American troops killed since the United States-led military campaign began two weeks ago with airstrikes aimed at Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, and the government that is protecting him. A master sergeant was killed last week in a forklift accident while building an air strip in Qatar, on the Persian Gulf.
Pakistan agreed today to allow American forces to use a fourth base, Shamsi, near the convergence of the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. The base was built for wealthy Saudi sheiks who indulged in world-class falconry there. 
The United States is already using bases in Pasni, Jacobabad and Dalbandin for search-and-rescue missions and as staging areas for Special Forces. 
The leader of the opposition Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, Burhanuddin Rabbani, said today that he hoped for new assistance from the United States both along Afghanistan's northern borders and near Kabul. 
The United States has troops and aircraft stationed in Uzbekistan, and resistance forces have said that a few Special Forces troops are working with the rebel armies in the area.
"Now our commanders need to prepare and decide whether to take action in Kabul," Mr. Rabbani said. North of Kabul, the resistance faces dug-in Taliban troops whose front lines so far have been largely spared from American bombing.
At a briefing here today, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, discussed the future of Afghanistan in the event the Taliban are deposed. He spoke out against the idea of sending a United Nations peacekeeping force or any other armed foreign force to govern Afghanistan once the current military campaign ends.
Instead, he said, he reiterated in talks with American officials here on Friday that the best solution would be for the United Nations to assist in negotiations with the warring parties to put together a council of national unity to govern the country.

B2) Chart: "Two Weeks Of Airstrikes"The selection of targets in Afghanistan this past week reflected an ongoing shift in emphasis from air defenses and aircraft to troop positions. The targets shown here indicate planned attacks and do not fully represent the degree that the military has been engaged in striking targets that emerge as airstrikes continue. Troop Garrisons and Military InstallationsTaliban military targets around Kandahar and Kabul were hit particularly hard this past week. Troops in the field and those in garrisons were included, as well as maintenance and storage sites. Airfields and Air DefensesThe military seemed confident enough in its diminution of Taliban air defenses to establish specific zones of aerial attack, where pilots may strike against certain types of targets they see with only the approval of an air controller in the area. Al Qaeda CampsThe operation's ultimate target is Al Qaeda itself, but Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld noted this past week that aircraft "can't crawl on the ground and find people," explaining the need for better intelligence from the ground on possible targets. Food and Leaflet DropsIn addition to the food air drops, military cargo planes began to drop leaflets. Also, radio broadcasts from an EC-130, called Commando Solo, began this past week, warning Afghan civilians to stay out of the way of American forces. Communications, Command and ControlThis past week, Pentagon officials asserted their confidence that Taliban communications had been severed, but did not offer details. And a Start On the GroundMore than 100 American Army Rangers and other Special Forces executed a hit-and-run strike, raiding an airbase and a command center in and around the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ISLAM; 
Moderate Muslims Fear Their Message Is Being Ignored

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Since the September attacks, Al Azhar the revered mosque, the distinguished university, the leading voice of the Sunni Muslim establishment -- has renewed with accustomed grace the roles it has played in the world of Islam for more than 1,000 years.
 It has sought to advise Muslims around the world that those who kill in the name of Islam are nothing more than heretics. It has sought to guide, to reassure Westerners against any clash of civilizations. 
 But throughout an Islamic world full of anger and despair, political rulers and those like Al Azhar who support them have perhaps never been so unpopular. So despite the mosque's best efforts, the banners raised last week at the mosque to protest the American airstrikes expressed a very different voice: "Jihad is the solution!" 
This is Islam as the language of dissent, and over the past quarter century, its words have become increasingly loud. In places like Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, frustrated people -- choked by booms in population, disoriented by the uneasy mix of imported American culture and old traditions, blocked by failing economies and squelched by curbs on political expression -- have found a single vehicle to express their rage: political Islam.
Until 30 years ago, in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, the language of politics was cast in terms of nationalism or the demands of the cold war. Now it is tinged almost everywhere with slogans like "Islam is the answer."
If there is one constant amid the many faces of this religion, experts say, it is that Islam is growing as a force. Sometimes financed by Saudi oil, Islam is the dominant vehicle for the hospitals and charitable foundations that increasingly fill voids left by secular governments.
In recent decades new Islamic republics have emerged in Sudan, Iran and Afghanistan. Islamists have been elected to parliament, served in cabinets or held high office in countries from Algeria to Jordan to Pakistan to Malaysia and Indonesia.
None of these countries is a true democracy, and while Islamists cast themselves as pluralizers in authoritarian states, few go so far as to advocate a Western-style democracy. The traditions of Islam emphasize submission to religious law, leading many scholars to question whether Islam is even compatible with democracy.
The United States has allied itself with many Arab governments that have no interest in democracy, among them Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the United States is widely seen in the globalized, post-cold-war world as the voice and exporter of the message that democracy, free markets and technology are the answer for everybody.
Both these facets of American policy -- what is perceived as hypocrisy in backing autocratic Arab states, and the democracy-fits-all message -- have caused unease or anger among Muslims.
So, too, have American support for Israel and for sanctions on Iraq, and the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. As a result, the message of the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has gained a broad resonance.
The attempt to control and if possible reverse this growing antagonism is clearly one of the major diplomatic challenges facing the Bush administration. The elimination of Mr. bin Laden's network has given America an immediate military focus, but the sentiments among Muslims who have helped that network grow present a far deeper problem.
Islam is a faith of many faces: from its stern Wahhabi visage in Saudi Arabia to the more flexible versions that prevail in Egypt or Indonesia, where clerics have long scoffed at rigid rules like the Saudis' ban on women's driving, and have argued that Islam is eternally adaptable to modern life.
Islam's 1.3 billion followers include Shiites, the minority sect that is dominant in Iran, and Sunnis, the majority in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and most other Islamic countries. There are also the mostly secular, as in Syria, whose government has crushed a religious challenge to its authority, and the militant, exhorted by extremist clerics in places like Lebanon, Gaza and now Afghanistan. Some extremists have condoned the Sept. 11 attacks and routinely use religion to justify violence in the name of a holy struggle, or jihad.
The category of militants is growing. It is a development that saddens men like Sheik Fawzi al-Zafzaf, an Islamic scholar who has spent 40 years at Al Azhar. He acknowledges that its authority has been cast in doubt in some quarters by Al Azhar's very ties to an Egyptian government that also needs the center's support.
"They call us the clerics of the authorities," Sheik Zafzaf said with clear regret, speaking of Muslims who have taken more militant voices as their religious guides.
It is a conundrum not only for Egypt, but perhaps for all of the Islamic world. 
Since the time of Muhammad (A.D. 570-632), the teachings of Islam have always linked political rules with spiritual rules, so governments like Egypt's need the mantle of institutions like Al Azhar as a seal of legitimacy.
But the more that governments like Egypt's harness themselves to mainstream clerics, the more those unhappy with their leaders have disdained the clerics as well. 
"Our role is to correct the misperceptions," Sheik Zafzaf said of Al Azhar, whose leader, or grand imam, is appointed to a lifetime term by Egypt's president, a partnership that is spelled out in the Constitution. But, he said, "if people do not listen to our views, that is not our fault."
Outside the mosque, beneath its soaring minarets, a young graduate student at Al Azhar was among those quick to identify himself as one who no longer pays much heed to the official message or its messenger.
"I accept that it is un-Islamic to kill civilians," said the student, Muhammad al-Kordy, 25, echoing the message that the grand imam, Sheik Muhammad Sayed al-Tantawi, has articulated in nearly every speech since Sept. 11. "But Sheik Tantawi is a puppet."
Anger at the perceived "puppets" -- Arab governments unready to stand up to Israel, pliant to American demands, unable to give their young populations a sense of opportunity -- grows continually.
Opposition movements and radical extremist organizations have sought to destabilize Muslim countries and attacked government officials and institutions in the West. Chief among them has been Al Qaeda, the network led by Mr. bin Laden.
In the years after the Iranian revolution in 1979, it was Shiite Islam that was widely regarded in the West as a particularly dangerous force. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini derided what he called "American Islam," and efforts were made to export violence and establish Islamic states.
But as John L. Esposito, a scholar at Georgetown University, wrote earlier this year, the Iranian revolution is showing signs of exhaustion.
Today the louder voices of religious-inspired opposition to the status quo are those of Sunni Muslims like those of the anti-Israeli group Hamas and the violence embraced by Sunnis like Mr. bin Laden. "The fruits of decades of investment in Sunni militancy now stand ready to take over where Iran is leaving off," Dr. Esposito wrote. 
The investment seems to have come largely from Saudi Arabia, which financed the American-backed mujahedeen, or holy warriors, in their fight against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's and later -- until Sept. 11 -- embraced the Taliban.
That flow of funds from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states has come not only from public coffers, but in millions of dollars of private money as well, which was contributed to charities and other groups that serve as another way to promote a specific vision of Islam.
In Pakistan in particular, they helped to establish the madrassas, schools that inculcated vast numbers of young people in the stern, unforgiving Wahhabi strain of Islam, which has taken root in its harshest form among the Taliban. This strain is also found Central Asia, where Russia and some new nations confront radicals inspired by Islam.
All over the Islamic world, charities have helped to win both admiration and obligation for particular Islamic views. 
From its base in Beirut's southern suburbs, the Iranian-backed Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, which is Shiite Muslim in orientation, is also the country's largest nongovernmental organization. It schools young men like Ali Isa, 19, cares for them in its clinics and -- not least -- preaches to them in its mosques.
"My loyalty is to Hezbollah and Sheik Fadlallah," Mr. Isa, an auto mechanic with a closely trimmed black beard, said recently. "Lebanon does nothing for me."
He was referring to Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual adviser, a gentle-looking and extraordinarily popular 62-year-old cleric who remains on American lists of suspected terrorists for his links to Hezbollah's more radical past.
Mr. Isa said he agreed with Sheik Fadlallah that the attacks on the United States were wrong. But he also said he agreed that if Mr. bin Laden is caught, he should be tried in a Muslim court rather than by "a court of infidels," and he took exception when asked if he recognized that not all Muslims shared that view.
"Who else besides Fadlallah has any business telling us what Muslims should believe?" he asked. 
In its most extreme forms, of course, militant Islam has thrived most where state power is least, in places like Afghanistan, Lebanon and Sudan, and so it is not surprising that stronger states like Egypt would use what power they can to promote religious moderation.
Across the Islamic world, this is most often done in the form of partnership between religious and secular authorities, like the one between Al Azhar and the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
With financing from the government, Al Azhar, for example, not only educates Muslims from more than 50 countries, giving it a global reach, but is the dominant voice in shaping the sermons delivered in Egypt's mosques, most of which are controlled by the government as a barrier to dissent.
In conversations at the graceful Al Azhar structure known as the House of the Sheik, clerics sitting behind Arabic-style windows and elegant carvings have cast themselves again and again as the guides to a gentle Islam.
Wearing clerical robes and a red fez-like hat wrapped in a white turban, and bearing a callus on his forehead that marks a man of prayerful piety, Sheik Zafzaf recalled how quickly Al Azhar sprang to action on the Friday after Sept. 11.
"We circulated the guidance to clerics around the world, in Egypt and abroad, in relaying the message of condemnation for these terrorist attacks, because God prohibited the killing of civilians," he said. "We are holding daily contacts with our clerics via the embassies abroad and our offices in Egypt, spreading the word to all the imams to denounce the terrorist attacks."
But other recent rulings by Al Azhar's grand imam had a more mixed tone. He has ruled that organ transplants are permitted in Islam, to the satisfaction of Egyptian modernizers, but he has also insisted that Al Azhar be given the last word on what books are published in Egypt, to guard against those that are un-Islamic.
During Egypt's own internal war in the mid-1990's on the Islamic militants who were trying to overthrow the government, Al Azhar was uniformly critical of the bombings, assassinations and other attacks against the government. Among Egyptian militants, within the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood (the main arm of political dissent) and even among young Al Azhar scholars like Mr. Kordy, the rulings now bring little respect.
"I don't believe anything he says," Mr. Kordy said of Al Azhar's grand imam, whose pronouncements are supposed to articulate religious law.
It is a conflict of which clerics like Sheik Zafzaf, who is 52 years old and began his studies at Al Azhar when he was just 12, have become painfully aware.
"Al Azhar is the only institution in the world that has learned the moderate Islam and taught it in a moderate way without fanaticism, and without abiding by the teachings of a school that promotes rigidity or violence," he said.
Referring to Sept. 11, he added: "It breaks my heart that a Muslim in the name of Islam would commit such crimes, when Islam has nothing to do with it."

HEADLINE: A Two-Decade Spiral Into Suspicion; 
Long After Wife Disappears, Heir Vanishes After Texas Murder

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
When Robert A. Durst returned to South Salem in Westchester County last spring, a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought on a dock at Lake Truesdale, behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife, Kathleen.
 It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary, though she had vanished 19 years earlier. A small man with a wiry frame, he had been moving restlessly through California, Connecticut, Texas and Manhattan since he broke with his wealthy New York real estate family a decade ago. His friends regarded him as a brilliant man with an eccentric sense of humor, while others who knew him described a darker figure, given to fits of rage. 
 The state police and the Westchester district attorney had been seeking him for a year to go over his account of his last night with his wife, the night she vanished. Investigators had also wanted to interview one of his closest friends and confidantes, Susan Berman. But she had been found murdered in her Benedict Canyon home in Los Angeles last Christmas Eve, shot in the back of the head. 
Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront. He quickly jumped into his blue Saab and drove away. He soon after told his sister, Wendy, the only family member he really spoke with, that he was going to disappear for a while; he would not be picking up phone messages or his mail.
Disappear he did, until last week when he surfaced in Galveston, Tex., at the center of a murder case more gruesome than anything the most vehement accusers from his past could have imagined. It soon became apparent that Mr. Durst had adopted a series of disguises and false identities in that brawny port city before, the Galveston Police Department said, he killed a 71-year-old neighbor, carving up the body and dropping it into Galveston Bay.
Having failed to show up for a bail hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Durst is now a fugitive from the law, and with it a tortured life that was collapsing around him. The Galveston police have begun a nationwide manhunt, but Mr. Durst may still have access to bank accounts containing millions of dollars. 
Even many of those in the close circle of friends who had long defended the enigmatic Mr. Durst were stunned, wondering whether all the accusations about their friend were true. A few have held fast.
Emily Altman was one of Mr. Durst's longtime friends, and asked him to be her son's godfather. Her husband, Stewart Altman, grew up with Mr. Durst in Scarsdale. She said that Mr. Durst was incapable of committing a heinous act.
"He's the most kindhearted person I've ever met in my life," Ms. Altman said. "He's a sweet person."
But there is little doubt that the questions and accusations that have swirled about Mr. Durst for two decades have gained a sudden and disturbing momentum.
Detectives from New York and Los Angeles flew to Galveston to interview him and examine a gun found in his car. The gun was the same caliber as the weapon used to kill Ms. Berman.
Mr. Durst, 58, is the oldest child of Seymour B. Durst, patriarch of a family real estate empire worth billions. The elder Durst, who died in 1995, built a half-dozen office buildings on Third Avenue after World War II. As the family prospered, Seymour moved his family, which now included Robert, his brothers Douglas and Thomas and his sister, Wendy, to the wealthy Westchester suburb of Scarsdale. But Robert's comfortable childhood was punctuated by sadness.
In 1950, his mother, Bernice, fell from a rain-slick roof of the family's home and died. Newspaper accounts at the time stated that Bernice, 32, had become disoriented by an overdose of medication for asthma. Privately, family members acknowledged that Bernice had committed suicide.
Kathleen Durst confided to several friends that Robert was deeply disturbed by his mother's death and may have witnessed her fall. In any event, Robert's childhood battles with Douglas prompted their father to send both boys to a counselor. Robert, said a family member, friends and classmates, was a loner. The 1961 Scarsdale High School yearbook has a single photograph of Mr. Durst and no mention of extracurricular activities.
Four years later, Mr. Durst graduated from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania with a degree in economics and headed off to California, where he enrolled in a doctoral program at the University of California in Los Angeles. It was there that he met Susan Berman, an aspiring writer who was the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster.
Mr. Durst also met John Lennon, the Beatle, while they both underwent primal therapy, according to his friends and a family member. More than a decade later, Mr. Durst was dating Prudence Farrow, the subject of the Beatles song "Dear Prudence," when his wife disappeared. Ms. Farrow, the actress Mia Farrow's sister, would not comment.
Mr. Durst ultimately withdrew from U.C.L.A. in 1969 and returned to New York, where in the fall of 1971 he met a young dental hygienist, Kathleen McCormack, who lived in a building owned by the Durst family. He had opened a health food store called All Good Things in Vermont, and after the two had gone on two dates, he asked her to live with him. In January 1972, she did. 
"They went through their hippie years in the early 1970's," said Eleanor Joy Schwank, a friend of Mrs. Durst.
Seymour Durst disapproved of his son's life as a shopkeeper and in 1973 the couple returned to Manhattan, where they married. Robert joined his father and brother Douglas in developing some of the most successful skyscrapers on the Avenue of the Americas.
At Robert's insistence, the couple lived frugally. He drove a Volkswagen Beetle and never wore the stereotypical gold jewelry and expensive suits of a real estate baron. She, however, drove a Mercedes and sought a career, first as a nurse, and later as a doctor. Mr. Durst did enjoy using his connections to get his friends into the best restaurants, Broadway plays and nightclubs, although they often expected him to pick up the tab.
"They were earthy, downright regular people," Gilberta Najamy said. "I thought he was a caring, loving husband. I know Kathy was in love with him."
But by 1980, Robert had grown increasingly possessive of Kathleen's time, many of her friends said, while she complained "that they were living below their means."
She hired a divorce lawyer and confided to friends and family members that Robert had physically abused her, according to court records at a subsequent proceeding over control of her estate.
In 1982, Mrs. Durst disappeared. Mr. Durst told the police that he had put her on a train in Katonah, N.Y., after they spent a weekend together at their nearby cottage. He said he spoke to her by telephone later that night in Manhattan but had not heard from her since. Investigators traced leads, developed suspicions and questioned Mr. Durst, but nothing solid developed. Years later, the New York City police continued to list the disappearance as a missing persons case, not a murder.
During the clamor over Kathleen's disappearance, Mr. Durst stopped going to work, and had his loyal confidante, Ms. Berman, tell his friends that he was distraught and would not be returning calls for a while. "Bobby was like that," said Doug Oliver, when interviewed last February. "He retreated into himself."
By the end of 1983, Mr. Durst was back working at the Durst Organization. He sought real estate deals for the company, as well as for himself. In 1989, he and his siblings sold a property at Broadway and 55th Street for $30 million. He used his quarter-share to buy several buildings and a storage center in the Dallas area.
Mr. Durst's problems with his family culminated two years later when it became clear that Douglas would succeed his father at the head of the family empire. Family members said Mr. Durst abruptly stopped going into work and cut his ties to his close friends like Mr. Oliver, who is bewildered by the turn of events.
"He separated from everyone in New York," said another close friend of both Mr. Durst and Ms. Berman. "It was a loss of face in his mind."
For much of the 1990's, Mr. Durst was out of touch with his family as he drifted between Northern California, Connecticut, Dallas and Lower Manhattan. He appeared briefly at his father's deathbed in 1995, after his brother and sister agreed to leave the hospital, but he did not attend the funeral.
Except for an errant tip, Mr. Durst never would have aroused the suspicions of investigators. In 1999, a Westchester man provided them with bad information about the disappearance, but it was enough to intrigue a state police investigator, Joseph Beccera, about the case. Officials began to review apparent discrepancies in Mr. Durst's account of his whereabouts.
For example, Mr. Durst said he had spoken to his wife from Westchester that night after she arrived home in Manhattan. He said he called from a pay phone while walking the dog. But the nearest pay phone was several miles away, they found, and the night was rainy and cold.
As part of the investigation, the Westchester County district attorney and the state police made plans to interview Susan Berman. But just days before they were scheduled to speak to her, Ms. Berman was found shot to death with a 9-millimeter handgun in her Los Angeles home.
But Ms. Berman's friends and relatives said at the time that Mr. Durst, the man who gave her away at her 1984 wedding and periodically gave her tens of thousands of dollars when she needed it, would never have hurt her. Detectives, who never identified Mr. Durst as a suspect, were far more interested in another figure in Ms. Berman's life. But the case was going nowhere when word came that Mr. Durst had been arrested in Galveston.
The police in Texas charged Mr. Durst with murdering Morris Black, a cantankerous tenant who lived in an efficiency apartment across from Mr. Durst's in a gray wood-frame house, not far from downtown. Neighbors said Mr. Durst and Mr. Black often engaged in long arguments, punctuated by much slamming of doors. Investigators said they found bloody evidence that tied Mr. Durst to the crime. They also found evidence of a life that appeared to have unraveled.
In Dallas, where Mr. Durst had kept a luxury apartment for several years, they found lease documents in which Mr. Durst said he was once a botanist for a California lumber company, not a New York real estate man. He was divorced, he said in the paperwork, when actually his wife had disappeared.
What Mr. Durst did in Dallas is unclear, but by April he had moved to Galveston, to an apartment he found through a newspaper advertisement. He told the landlord he was renting it on behalf of his mute sister-in-law, Dorothy Ciner. Actually, Ms. Ciner had been a high school classmate years ago in Scarsdale. She had no knowledge of the ruse, according to investigators, who say they believed it was Mr. Durst who wore a wig to play the role of Dorothy. He visited the local library in the wig, according to a librarian at the Rosenberg Library who remembered him, dressed as a woman, sitting occasionally in the computer room.
At times, he traveled back to New York where he kept an apartment on Rector Place. Kenny Shane, who manages the building where Mr. Durst owns an apartment, said he was there last summer. "He goes out running," he said. "He is very cordial to everyone."
Life in Galveston was spartan in comparison. His apartment on Avenue K had no phone, just a bed, a table and a television. The range seems to have never been used, Klaus Dillman, the landlord, said. Neighbors remembered seeing him taking meals at a local pancake house and at the Saltwater Grill.
Investigators are now trying to retrace Mr. Durst's life. They have frozen his bank accounts and looked for him in New Orleans, where he is known to have traveled after the murder. But few people in Galveston seem to remember Mr. Durst.
One who does, Becky Faris, said he was an occasional customer at Bob's, the liquor store that she and and her husband run. She recalled one incident about five months ago. On that occasion, she said, Mr. Durst came in to buy a few bottles. On his way out, a dog barked at him, she said, and Mr. Durst bent over and barked back, for several minutes.
"He was nice enough," she said, "but there was something scary about him."

Bad Times, Good Polls For Gov. Ventura

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

 BODY:
These are not the best of times for Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota. Or are they?
 State employees have been on strike. 
A state revenue shortage looms because of the recession. And Mr. Ventura is at odds, again, with the Capitol press corps, this time over how much notice, if any, reporters should get about his next public appearance. 
 So Mr. Ventura's poll numbers are cratering, right?
Wrong.
The latest Mason-Dixon survey, conducted for The St. Paul Pioneer-Press and several broadcast outlets, indicates that most Minnesotans still have a big soft spot for their irrepressible, irascible governor, who is -- what else? -- a political independent.
More than half give him a favorable job performance rating. More Minnesotans want him to seek re-election than want him to retire. And more consider him a "breath of fresh air" than an "embarrassment."
"He's sitting pretty," Craig Grau, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, told The Pioneer-Press.
The governor says he has not decided whether to seek a second term next year.

HEADLINE: A Fitting Tribute: Memorial Stadium 

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
As a New York resident and avid sports fan in my mid-20's, the tragedy downtown has sparked an idea that must be considered. Although an argument can be made that no stronger message can be sent to the terrorists than to rebuild the World Trade Center as it stood on Sept. 10, I have an alternative plan. 
Build the stadium that New Yorkers have been fighting about for the past decade. 
 Building a stadium would ensure that the downtown economy would not be depleted in the years to come. Local revenue from a stadium, new restaurants, rebuilt hotels and shopping would prevent an exodus from Lower Manhattan by residents, office tenants and financial giants, including the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The new stadium there would be more practical than the long-debated West Side stadium, whose opponents fear unbearable gridlock in Midtown. A downtown stadium would have unparalleled access from all existing subway lines and ferries from Brooklyn, Staten Island and New Jersey. 
A stadium, a la Camden Yards in Baltimore, blending into the cityscape -- complemented by the appropriate memorial for the victims and the heroes of this tragedy -- would be the perfect use of the land. Another thing -- no selling the naming rights for the stadium: World Trade Center Memorial Stadium or Giuliani Stadium.

Darien Voters Give Apartment Developer a Victory

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DARIEN voters confounded their elected officials in a referendum on Sept. 25 when they repudiated an appropriation of $26.7 million that the Board of Selectmen, the Board of Finance and the Representative Town Meeting had favored and assumed was generally popular.
 The money was to have been used for the condemnation and purchase of 32 acres to thwart the development there of 189 luxury rental apartments, 25 percent of which would have been offered at below-market rates to moderate-income tenants. The developer, AvalonBay Communities, contracted for the land in 1992; subsequently bought it for $4.6 million; spent another $12 million on environmental remediation, road improvements, a traffic light and architectural, engineering and legal fees; and finally obtained the requisite town approvals to proceed. Then, however, the selectmen decided that the town needed the site for future public recreation facilities. 
 The vote of 3,209 to 2,515, representing almost one-third of the population of 19,600, probably does not portend a groundswell of affection for AvalonBay or multifamily housing in Darien. 
Nevertheless, for AvalonBay it was a bright spot in a seemingly endless series of battles with wealthy towns that try to derail its developments. In two similar cases in New Canaan and Orange, courts have ruled that the grounds on which the towns rejected AvalonBay -- impact on traffic and the environment, the size of the complex, the need for municipal recreation or open space -- were veiled efforts to circumvent the state's 1989 Affordable Housing Appeals law. Referendums in those towns approving appropriations to pay for taking AvalonBay's land were overturned by the courts. 
"Darien was different in that the magnitude of dollars was enormous," said Samuel B. Fuller, regional vice president for AvalonBay's Connecticut operations. In Orange the purchase amount was $1.2 million, and in New Canaan it would have been between $6 million and $12 million, depending on which appraisal the judge favored.
"I don't presume to know what people's reasons were for voting for or against condemnation," Mr. Fuller said, "but from an economic standpoint the town is significantly better off in terms of not having to pay an extraordinary amount for the land, but also in terms of net tax revenues." 
An appraisal of $32.1 million was done for AvalonBay. Included in the $26.7 million sought in the referendum was a town appraisal of $19 million, with the residual amount for a variety of municipal purposes. Once it became municipal property, the site would have been tax exempt. 
"We're appreciative of the number of people who came out to vote in a difficult time," Mr. Fuller said, "and we're looking forward to working with the town in its use of the 12 acres we offered to give back, free of charge, for whatever they want." The town has not accepted the offer, but according to Wayne Fox, Darien's lawyer, discussions on conveying the parcel are positive. "I'm hopeful the matter will be settled in the next couple of weeks," he said.
MEANWHILE, construction on the complex, called Avalon Hollow, will start as soon as permits from the Department of Environmental Protection have cleared. 
James F. Davis, a member of the Darien Representative Town Meeting for 18 years and head of the 22-year-old Darien Taxpayers' Association, said: "When we became aware that Orange had gone to the State Supreme Court and lost and New Canaan spent $7 million before they threw in the towel, this seemed like a huge waste of taxpayers' money."
"The town waited until Avalon had its building permit to condemn it," he continued, "then rushed it through the R.T.M. in July. We had 10 days to get 2,000 signatures on a petition and obtain a guarantee not to have the referendum in August, when most people are away." He was skeptical of the selectmen's claim that this was the only property in town for a pool, senior center, ball fields, community center and other uses, when there are three country clubs, two beaches, a hunt club, swim and tennis club, and acres of nature center land and parkland. "I suspect they were just afraid of who might come to live there," he said.
Robert Harrel, Darien's first selectman, did not respond to requests for comment, but Peter Curry, the administrative officer, said, "The deteriorating economy played a role in defeating the condemnation, and what would take place on the property over 8 or 10 years was left open-ended and that disturbed some people." 
Customers at the Sugar Bowl, a popular coffee shop, were surprised at the outcome, said the manager, Bob Mazza. "They didn't expect it to win by such a large margin," he said. "I think the reasons have to do with putting up a $73 million high school and people thinking taxes would go way up." Besides, he added, "the apartments will not attract the wrong kind of people -- AvalonBay's prices are too high." They start around $3,000 for a two-bedroom apartment. 
Construction on 104 apartments, including 21 moderate-income units, has finally begun in New Canaan, but Orange has taken AvalonBay to appellate court over a laundry list of conditions. According to Bryan Stone, the town attorney, it wants the developer to widen Prindle Hill Road along the entire frontage of the complex, install a traffic light and a right-turn lane into a neighboring street and contribute to a sinking fund for other road improvements. Oral arguments are expected to be heard by next spring.
Wrangling over a proposal in Wilton involves two court rulings. Maureen Cox, Wilton's lawyer, has asked the court to reconsider its decision that Wilton's Inland Wetlands Commission overstepped its authority over the impact on wetlands of activity outside the wetland and buffer zone. And AvalonBay filed an appeal on Oct. 5 requesting that the judge, who had ruled against the company on the issue of safety, re-examine a geo-technical engineer's report that building some of the 85 market-rate and 28 affordable units on a slope is not a safety matter. 
Density, slopes, wetlands, impact on wildlife and traffic are the subjects of public hearings in Stratford on AvalonBay's application there to build 146 apartments with 36 affordables on 10 acres. "There were no specific objections to affordables," said Gary Lorentsen, the planning and zoning administrator. "It's in a neighborhood with mostly one-acre zoning." 
In Milford, seven nights of public hearings over rezoning the largest chunk of office-zoned property in town to make way for an AvalonBay complex of 250 units will continue into November. "It's bigger than anything proposed here in the last 15 years," said Marilyn Lipton, the town attorney. 
And so it goes -- more so in Connecticut than elsewhere, say AvalonBay's executives. The state has strong traditions of preserving what remains of the New England landscape and of fostering development of the single-family home on an acre or more.
But elsewhere in the country, the AvalonBay model of gated enclaves with pools, gymnasiums, clubrooms and indoor squash courts is accepted with relatively little controversy. In the New York metropolitan area this has been the case in towns as diverse as middle-income New Rochelle and affluent Bronxville in Westchester County, the New Jersey suburbs, Manhattan, Queens and even Stamford, where a state goal of at least 10 percent "affordable" housing was exceeded years ago. 
Over its 12-year existence, the affordable legislation that Avalon depends on to gain entry to some Connecticut towns has not been a raging success. Created to stimulate development of lower-cost housing by giving developers the right to build more units than zoning would otherwise permit -- and permission to take a town to court when a project is rejected -- it has produced a state-mandated 10 percent affordable housing rate in only 30 of the state's 169 towns. 
THE concept was dealt its first serious blow in 1999 when various developers lost cases against Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater. Two Superior Courts and the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the towns on issues of environment, potable water supplies and open space. 
In spite of difficulties, AvalonBay has created a niche market in elite towns near large cities and emerged as the third largest Real Estate Investment Trust in the country. It is also the richest residential REIT, capitalized at $5.5 billion, and maintains eight regional offices from Boston to San Francisco. It has built or acquired 42,232 apartments in 128 communities in 12 states and the District of Columbia. 
From its headquarters in Alexandria, Va., Bryce Blair, chief executive, said about the events of Sept. 11: "What happened hasn't changed in any way our long-term commitment or interest in our Northeast markets. Certainly, given the events of the last month and the overall economic environment, we are exercising caution in terms of the amount of development business we do or begin."

A Return to Cuba, A Search for Himself

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO; Mireya Navarro, a reporter on the Metropolitan staff of The New York Times, covers Latin culture.

 BODY:
ON Oct. 30, 1961, at the age of 8, Eduardo Machado left Cuba with his younger brother in the exodus known as Operation Pedro Pan, an airlift that brought to the United States some 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children whose parents feared Communist indoctrination, or worse, under the new revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.
 It was a decision that Mr. Machado, the head of the graduate playwriting program at Columbia University's School of the Arts, has questioned and resented all his life. "They were teaching us Marxism in school," he said. "But my parents treated it like they were gassing us." 
 Mr. Machado did not return to Cuba until 38 years later, in December 1999, and while he still cannot understand his parents, he said, he came back to the United States with a better understanding of himself. Now 48, he remembers growing up pained by a sense of loss, of not belonging, but his visit accomplished what years of therapy never did. 
"I felt sometimes at home and sometimes a total alien," he said of his time in Cuba. "I realized I was really American and I couldn't survive there."
Many exiles have journeyed back to Cuba as the American economic embargo of the island softened enough in the 1990's to allow such travel, but in the case of Mr. Machado, the experience led to a semi-autobiographical play, "Havana Is Waiting," which opens on Wednesday at the Cherry Lane Theater. Performed at the Actors Theater of Louisville last April during the Humana Festival of New American Plays (with the title "When the Sea Drowns in Sand"), the work delves into the playwright's exploration of identity and his anger at the cold war politics that shaped his life.
Over coffee at the Cherry Lane on a recent morning before rehearsals, Mr. Machado said he thought the United States sponsored the Cuban children's flights in the early 1960's "to make things chaotic in Cuba" and that Mr. Castro allowed them because "he thought he'd have real panic if he didn't do it."
"I wish you would have fought to get me back," the play's main character, Federico, says as he encounters a rally for the return of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who prompted a custody dispute between the two countries last year.
"Havana Is Waiting" is Mr. Machado's most political work, and he said he finds it ironic that it is opening against the backdrop of the United States' new offensive after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The play makes a plea for getting past the thirst for revenge, of transcending politics, and its themes now have a special resonance.
"I've been at the mercy of politics my entire life," Mr. Machado said, "and there has to be a way to step beyond it, to have human interaction."
In his review of the Louisville production in The New York Times, Bruce Weber wrote that the play's three characters "embody a variety of conflicts that Mr. Machado perceives as parallel and potentially self-dividing: between capitalism and Communism, between hetero- and homosexuality; between the Cuban and Cuban-American character."
Set in New York and Havana, the play, directed by Michael John Garces, depicts an anxious Federico (portrayed by Bruce MacVittie), who travels to Cuba with his best friend, Fred (Ed Vassallo), where they hire a taxi driver (Felix Solis) to take them to Federico's childhood home. A fourth performer, Richard Marquez, provides percussion. Federico, like Mr. Machado, is gay, and the play grapples with questions of sexual identity and self-understanding.
Although Mr. Machado and his brother, Jesus, now 43, were eventually reunited with their parents, their culture shock in the United States included becoming instantly poor after an upper-middle-class existence in Cuba. They initially went to live with an uncle and aunt in Hialeah, Fla., who had two children of their own and who had taken in two other relatives.
The day after they arrived, Mr. Machado still vividly remembers, his uncle gave them costumes and sent them out into the neighborhood to ask for candy. It was Halloween, and the boys were clueless.
"I thought we had become beggars," Mr. Machado said. "I hated that holiday ever since."
The next year, the family was reunited and ultimately moved to California, where his father worked as an accountant. By the time Mr. Machado was 16, the family had succeeded economically (although his parents later divorced), but the initial poverty, uprooting, language barrier and fear of abandonment carved lasting scars.
Had he been given the choice, Mr. Machado said, he would not have boarded that plane in 1961. "I think giving up your culture is a big deal," he said. "The alienation we experienced when we got here was so extreme and colored so much of the rest of my life. Caribbean people are Caribbean people, and it's a whole other way of life. You have to become someone else to navigate life here. It's a big price one pays."
Yet, Mr. Machado's self-acknowledged "obsession" with Cuba has ruled his body of work: of 27 plays, all but 7 deal with his family or Cuba in some way. They include the four-play cycle "Floating Islands," which follows four generations of a Cuban family from the 1920's to their exile in California.
Mr. Machado thought he had exhausted the subject, he said, but his three visits to Cuba (he has been back twice since the 1999 trip) have opened up a whole new artistic phase. In addition to "Havana Is Waiting," he just finished writing "The Cook," about a cook who has maintained a Havana mansion intact for its owners in exile. The play was inspired by a woman who runs a paladar, as Cuba's private home restaurants are known.
Mr. Machado, who all these years was never emotionally ready to become a United States citizen, said he is ready now. But his ideal world is a binational one -- he would like to be able to live part of the year in Cuba and part in New York. He has no relatives left in Cuba, but he noted that some of the friends he has made on his trips "were the first people to e-mail me when the towers went down."
"I want to have a dialogue with them," he said. "Everybody gets to go home but Cubans."
The day the World Trade Center collapsed had been scheduled as the first day of rehearsals for "Havana Is Waiting." Mr. Machado refused to cancel the rehearsal, moving it instead to an apartment after no one could get below 14th Street to the Cherry Lane.
"I said, 'You must go on, it can't stop you,' " he recalled, reminded of the Cuba he knew as a boy when bombs were going off in Havana and people were scared of being killed as the revolution was about to topple the government.
When someone asked him whether he would alter his play to remove any material that could be deemed unpatriotic, like his anti-embargo stance, he also said no.
"The United States has been an imperialist power and I have the right to say that," he said. "We can't, at this point, make ourselves victims and blind ourselves. It's important to see how other people feel about you and try to understand why they feel that way about you."
Risky words these days, but spoken like a true American.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; 
A Long-Awaited Rebirth Hits a Sudden Slowdown

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MATLOFF

 BODY:
Just six weeks ago, Harlem was abloom with hope. Crime was down, tourism up. New bistros were opening, and a former president, Bill Clinton, had set up an office. People who had never been above 96th Street before scouted for abandoned brownstones to fix up. 
 But the economic fallout from ground zero has reached uptown, and the much-vaunted new Harlem Renaissance seems to be stalled, or at least slowed. Gone are crucial ingredients of its revival: a booming economy, public confidence and extra public money for new ventures. 
 The setback is painful. 
"We understand that the affected area must be rebuilt," said Yuien Chin, executive director of the Hamilton Heights Community Preservation Organization, an umbrella group of nonprofit organizations. "But we're concerned that all the gains we made over the past years will be lost." 
The business improvement district on 125th Street, Harlem's center of shopping and tourism, conducted a survey whose early results showed that business had turned sluggish for many merchants. For Jim Elliot, who owns the Long Life Vitamins shop on 125th Street, business is down 25 percent from a month ago.
"The whole city is hurting, not just business downtown," Mr. Elliot said. "We sympathize, but we're struggling, too."
But Assemblyman Keith L. Wright, who represents Harlem, said he could do little, given that billions of dollars were being diverted to relief in Lower Manhattan. He doubted he could soon find money for centers for the elderly or cultural attractions like the Apollo Theater. 
Private investment is also drying up, though housing construction already under way should continue, said Karen Phillips, chief executive of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a large nonprofit group.
Tourism services, linchpins of the revival, are highly vulnerable. "If tourists don't go to New York, they're not going to Harlem," she said. "We're much less likely to attract a major new hotel to Harlem with low occupancy rates downtown." 
Rents have shrunk 15 percent since Sept. 11, and queries from home buyers have halved, said Robin Prescod, a broker with Harlem Homes Realty. While she used to stay late at the office to answer a deluge of e-mail messages about $500,000 homes, she now lingers just to canvass the listings. 
Community leaders had hoped that businesses dislodged from downtown would relocate in Harlem, but that has not happened. "The phone isn't ringing from people from Battery Park City," Ms. Prescod said. JUDITH MATLOFF

HEADLINE: Investing; 
In 401(k)'s, Whose Advice Is Best?

BYLINE:  By BETH KOBLINER

 BODY:
LIKE many other workers, Frances Purser, 51, has been watching as the balance in her 401(k) plan fluctuates with the jittery stock market. Ms. Purser, an administrator in human resources at Mohawk Industries, a carpet maker based in Calhoun, Ga., often wonders if she has made the right choices. "At my age I don't want to be too risky," she said, "but I also don't want to put it all in stable funds."
 During volatile times, many investors turn to their brokers or financial planners for guidance. But for most 401(k) participants, such advice is hard to come by. "There's no one to say, 'Put it in this fund or that,' " Ms. Purser said. 
 Federal law places restrictions and safeguards on how investment advice is given to 401(k) participants. As a result, most employers do not make specific investment advice available to employees. 
But if Representative John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has his way, many of those restrictions may soon be gone. His bill was approved on Oct. 3 by the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, and he hopes to bring it to a vote on the House floor this year. While the bill's future is far from certain, there is bipartisan agreement that some change is desirable, and other bills are in the works even if it fails.
Supporters of the Boehner bill say changing the rules governing 401(k) advice will free investment companies' hands to serve the needs of investors. Opponents say those hands may end up in investors' pockets.
Some 42 million people participate in 401(k)'s and similar plans, with total assets reaching $2.6 trillion last year, according to the Investment Company Institute. 
Under current law, the investment firms that manage 401(k)'s are generally prohibited from offering advice to plan participants about their own products. Mr. Boehner's bill would lift that restriction. That prospect appeals to these firms, represented by lobbying groups like the Investment Company Institute and the American Council of Life Insurance.
"This legislation will be very helpful for individual investors and employers who are looking to get more information to their employees about how to invest the money in their retirement plans," said Elizabeth Varley, vice president and director for retirement policy at the Securities Industry Association. Last year, when Bill Clinton was president, the Labor Department opposed the bill. But in June of this year, under President Bush, department officials testified in its favor. 
Opponents, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and AARP, worry that money management firms would promote investments that are most profitable for them. "You want advice from a company that doesn't have a conflict of interest," said David Certner, director of economic issues at AARP. 
Current restrictions prevent a company that manages investment options in a 401(k) from increasing the fees it would collect by recommending its own products. If Fidelity Investments manages a 401(k) plan, for example, Fidelity advisers are not permitted to advise employees to invest in Fidelity mutual funds. Vincent LoPorchio, a spokesman for Fidelity, said the firm favored lifting such restrictions. "We feel the issue isn't whether an adviser has a perceived conflict or not," he said. "The real issue is whether an adviser is giving prudent advice." He added that the bill adequately protects investors because advisers would still be liable for imprudent advice.
Though exemptions may be granted by the Labor Department, they often come with restrictions that firms may find unattractive. According to the department, a dozen or so firms have received exemptions, including the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup. Salomon agreed to a fee-leveling arrangement that ensures that no recommendation results in greater fees for the firm than any other. The firm said it would not comment on specifics of its exemption.
Mr. Boehner's bill would allow investment firms to give guidance about specific investments, including their own, though they would be obliged to make clear disclosures about conflicts of interest. Proponents of the bill say investment firms would be held liable if they offered advice that was not in the best interest of plan participants.
Those who support the existing restrictions say disclosure requirements would not provide enough protection for investors. "Employees would be left with a choice of conflicted advice or no advice," said Michele Farmer, general counsel for mPower, which is based in San Francisco and is among several independent, Internet-based companies that offer recommendations about retirement plan choices.
Another such company is Financial Engines, founded by William Sharpe, a Nobel laureate in economics. The company, which agreed recently to offer advice to plans connected to the Vanguard Group , says it uses the same method regardless of the client. Financial Engines, which said it had no formal position on the bill, advises 600 employer plans, up from 100 in January. 
Employees, of course, can also obtain advice privately from financial advisers if they pay for the services themselves.
Financial services firms that manage 401(k) plans are eager to offer advice that could lead to increased investment in their products. "Investment firms make a lot more money from the products they sell than from the fees they get for advice," said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Washington, which is neutral on Mr. Boehner's bill. 
The investment firms, Mr. Salisbury added, hope to build relationships with 401(k) investors, and help them manage rollovers into Individual Retirement Accounts when they switch jobs or retire . "A whole lot of this is about asset capture," he said.
Lobbyists for consumer groups worry that allowing firms that manage 401(k) plans to offer advice could mean less independent guidance. "It would be a huge step backward," said Mr. Certner of AARP.
Because of liability concerns, many employers, especially larger ones, have avoided hiring anyone to give advice. Mr. Boehner's bill would remove potential liability as long as employers choose advisers properly.
Nearly all plans offer some form of education. But only 35 percent of 909 plans surveyed by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America offer specific recommendations about where to invest, through individual financial planners or Internet-based advice companies.
Betty Shepard, human resources administrator at Mohawk Industries, said it had not offered advice because rules on liability were unclear. "We want to give employees a way to get easy access to reliable investment advice within the confines of the law," she said. Ms. Shepard, who testified before Congress last summer in favor of the Boehner bill, said she would prefer hiring an impartial adviser to assist employees.
Her concerns may be addressed by coming legislation in the Senate. Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, plans a bill that would relieve employers of any liability for advice given by a properly selected independent adviser but would keep the rules on self-interested advice. 
STILL, not everyone wants advice. "When you're young, you don't have a lot of knowledge, so you'll take whatever advice is given," said Christine Tracy, a pediatric cardiology fellow in New York City, who has seen her retirement plan balance fall to $2,000 from $5,000 in recent years. "It would be better to have more broad education, so I could make my own really informed decision." 
Few people would argue that investment advice would have reversed losses that many investors have had recently. "What people need isn't stock-picking or high-frequency advice about how to time the market," said John Shoven, a Stanford economist. "They need to know what's sensible at various ages, and that's information you can get from a magazine or newspaper."

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
As Starbucks Grows, Japan, Too, Is Awash

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
HOWARD SCHULTZ said he knew Starbucks would be a hit in Japan the day he opened his first store here in 1996.
 When Mr. Schultz, the company's chairman, arrived in the fashionable Ginza district at 6:15 on that humid August morning, 100 people were lined up for the ribbon-cutting, scheduled for 6:30. At the front of the line was a man in his 20's who looked as if he had slept outside the shop the night before. When the doors opened, he rushed in to become customer No. 1 in Japan. Although he otherwise spoke no English, he blurted: "Double short latte!" 
 Since then, Starbucks, based in Seattle, has become a household name in Japan (it is pronounced STAH-buks-zu) and has redefined the way Japanese drink and think about coffee. Like Starbucks shops in the United States, those of Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. feature comfy sofas, American hip-hop and reggae and large servings of a gourmet brew. These are relatively new concepts in Japan, where cafe patrons had been accustomed to sitting in dimly lit shops and sipping from thimble-sized cups. But the stores were an instant hit. 
Unlike most Japanese kisaten, or coffee shops, Starbucks does not allow smoking. The policy has attracted young women, who do not smoke nearly as much as Japanese men. Given the choice between smoking or chatting up potential girlfriends, many young men have become regulars at Starbucks, too.
Starbucks Coffee Japan has proved so popular that it opened its 300th store this month and is planning to add 180 in the next three years. It turned its first profit last year, earning 1.4 billion yen, or about $11.7 million. Its sales of 29 billion yen, or $242 million, were more than double those of the previous year. 
Investors have noticed, too. The stock of Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. made its debut on the Nasdaq Japan exchange on Oct. 10, two years ahead of the original plan. The shares rose 9.4 percent on the first day of trading, to 70,000 yen -- an achievement, given the beating that Japanese stocks have taken in recent months. The stock now trades at 73,300 yen.
"Any way you measure it, we've exceeded our wildest expectations," said Mr. Schultz, who was in Tokyo for the initial public offering.
The success of Starbucks here -- sales volume per store in Japan is twice as high as in the United States -- is all the more remarkable because this nation of tea drinkers has been mired in recession for most of the past decade. But the Japanese, always eager for the next trend, have taken to gourmet coffee as ravenously as they have embraced McDonald's hamburgers and fine French wine. Among Japanese in the 18-to-59 age group, more than 80 percent like coffee, according to the All Japan Coffee Association, a trade group of importers and retailers.
Other companies, foreign and domestic, are trying to succeed with coffee here, too. Two other brands from the West Coast of the United States, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's Best, run dozens of shops in Tokyo and enjoy strong sales. Local franchise chains like Doutor Coffee (pronounced DOE-tour), which operates more than 1,000 shops across Japan with smaller, less expensive servings, are recording record profits.
THE domestic coffee market is now worth $10 billion in annual sales, and the typical Japanese coffee drinker downs 11 cups a week, about a cup more than six years ago. Japan is now the third-largest importer of coffee beans behind the United States and Germany. Total volume has risen 28 percent in the last decade. 
On a per-capita basis, though, Japanese consume about 3 kilograms of coffee beans annually, on average, compared with 4.24 kilograms in the United States and 5.58 in the European Union. That disparity encourages Japanese coffee purveyors.
"There's lots of room for the market to grow," said Masao Yamashita, executive director of the All Japan Coffee Association.
Although coffee is a deeper part of the social fabric in the West, Japan is no stranger to the coffee bean. Dutch traders first brought coffee to Japan in the 17th century, but the shogun prohibited them from traveling beyond Nagasaki, their southern port of entry, so coffee was tasted by relatively few Japanese. Coffee made deeper inroads in 1853 with the arrival of American ships led by Commodore Matthew C. Perry. Soon thereafter, breaking three centuries of isolation, Japanese started to travel overseas. They brought back elements of the Parisian, Viennese and German coffee culture. The first coffee shop opened in 1888 in Tokyo's Ueno district, and drinking the brew became associated with the leisure class who had time and money.
Coffee's image changed again when American G.I.'s arrived after World War II, instant powder in tow. "American blend" became synonymous with weak, bland coffee. But the newly liberated Japanese, living in tiny homes and working in cramped offices, flocked to coffee shops. Many of those shops played jazz or classical music and reflected the quirky individual tastes of the owners, who often charged exorbitant prices for the privilege of sitting in a cool, quiet room away from family or a boss. 
Despite prolonged deflation, the price of an average cup of coffee in Japan has risen to 419 yen, about $3.50, from 370 yen a decade ago.
COFFEE really went national in 1961 when the government removed import duties on the instant variety. The number of coffee shops hit a peak of 154,090 in 1981, when the industry employed almost 600,000 people. But like a caffeine high, the fervor wore off, and tastes changed. During Japan's bubble economy in the 1980's, speed and convenience became buzzwords. Doutor started offering coffee at about $1, as well as a limited menu that included hot dogs, and only a few seats, mimicking European cafes, where patrons often stand.
Doutor ditched the counter space when people refused to stand while eating, but the overall concept stuck. Another chain, Pronto, introduced a "coffee bar." By day, the shop operates like a cafe, but at 5 p.m., the staff changes uniforms and slides the wall behind the counter to one side to reveal racks of liquor and wine. The success of these franchise shops has contributed to the slow decline of the neighborhood kisaten. There are now just 94,000 coffee shops in Japan, down 40 percent in the last two decades, even accounting for the rapid rise of the big chains. But Doutor and similar chains alienated many Japanese who were turned off by the cigarette smoke and the packs of snoozing commuters. 
Starbucks, almost by accident, provided an alternative. Record numbers of Japanese traveled to the United States in the 1990's, and Seattle was one of their most popular destinations. By the time Starbucks opened here, many Japanese had already visited its American stores.
Starbucks has still not advertised in Japan, but it has a loyal clientele. Nikkei Restaurants, a monthly magazine that tracks eating and drinking establishments, has rated Starbucks the No. 1 franchise chain.
"The stores have cushions and that cozy feel I get at home," said Yuki Ibuchi, 28, a Tokyo office worker who has a collection of 20 Starbucks mugs with logos of American cities she has visited.
Not only are Japanese drinking more coffee, they are anxious to serve it. Just as the number of sommeliers surged after the wine boom in the mid-1990's, many Japanese are now studying to become barristers, or those trained to make espresso. At Maccinesti, a cafe that pipes in Seattle radio stations over the Internet, Miho Kanai, 24, makes lattes with steamed milk on top, shaped like a swirling leaf. Ms. Kanai, who studied with David Schomer, the Seattle-based author of "Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques," discards two cups of espresso before getting the flavor and color she wants. "Only once have I made a perfect cup of coffee," she said.
Maccinesti doubles as the Tokyo offices of Seattle Espresso Systems, which imports $50,000 Italian-style espresso makers from Washington state. Junichi Tsuji, 53, the owner of Maccinesti, has spent about $200,000 since December 2000 to set up the business and has sold six machines so far. "I know it doesn't make good business sense to import such expensive machines, but coffee is something I love and want to share it with people," Mr. Tsuji said.
With so much specialty coffee streaming into Japan, consumers may tire of high-priced caffeine. "After another year of great growth, coffee shops will be like convenience stores and we'll see a shakeout," said Debbie Howard, president of Japan Market Resource Network, which tracks consumer trends for foreign companies here.
Still, Starbucks is expected to remain popular because it is viewed as the original gourmet coffee shop. "Japanese companies don't want to do anything needed to create a new market," Ms. Howard said. "They let the Americans come over and then they imitate them, but everyone can see they are copying."

HEADLINE: The World: A Nuclear Question Mark; 
India and Pakistan Face New Pressures for War, and Peace

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
THE winds that have blown across India and Pakistan since the terrorist attacks on America have borne the seeds of both war and peace, and no one can be sure which will come to fruition.
 The heightened risk of a devastating war -- both countries have nuclear weapons -- is easy to see. A fundamentalist group based in Pakistan was implicated in an Oct. 1 terrorist attack that killed 38 people in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, and many Indians have asked why India should not go after Pakistan the way America has gone after Afghanistan. 
 At the same time, the United States has turned to Pakistan as a crucial ally in its campaign against the Taliban. That strengthens Pakistan's hand internationally and could eventually embolden it to strike harder against India in Kashmir, the land that India and Pakistan have fought over for more than a half century. 
Improved chances for peace are harder to see, but there are some hopeful -- if not definitive -- signs.
Pakistan, after discarding the Taliban, could also move away from its reliance on radical Islamic groups, fired by dreams of martyrdom, to fight its proxy war with India in Kashmir.
As part of Pakistan's separation from the Taliban, the country's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, recently sidelined some of the military commanders most closely associated with the Taliban and replaced them with more moderate men, defense analysts say.
At least for now, General Musharraf could use some quiet on the Kashmir front. He is trying to cope with discontent in his own country about the American bombing campaign in neighboring Afghanistan.
And the United States, which had lost much of its influence in Pakistan in recent years, is now promising $600 million in economic assistance as a reward for Pakistan's help in the global coalition to fight terrorism. 
General Musharraf wants even more help, in the form of debt relief. Giving it could mean that the Bush administration would have more power to pressure Pakistan to rein in the anti-India militants it shelters.
So far, the Bush administration has been unwilling to say anything publicly about Pakistan's links to such militants -- and it will undoubtedly continue to be silent as long as the United States must depend on Pakistan's help.
But administration officials, as well as some South Asia policy experts, say President Bush wants to improve relations with India, the world's largest democracy, and understands that India expects the United States to use its influence with Pakistan to stop attacks on civilians in Kashmir.
"The relationship with India is a strategic priority," said George Perkovich, author of "India's Nuclear Bomb" (University of California Press, 1999). "The president wants it. They're not going to trade an important relationship with a reliable India for a Pakistan that's a teetering mess."
The administration's decision last week to add Jaish-i-Muhammad, the group implicated in the Oct. 1 attack, to the list of organizations whose financial assets would be frozen was a signal of its shrinking tolerance for terrorism in Kashmir, said Michael Krepon. He is the founding president of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, which studies security issues. 
And if other groups with sanctuary in Pakistan attack Kashmiri civilians, they may also find themselves listed -- and that will be a switch, he said.
"IN the past, the United States always looked the other way," Mr. Krepon said. "We knew these groups had safe harbor in Pakistan and received logistical, communications, intelligence and material support from the Pakistan Army. It was no secret. But we didn't make an issue of it except in the most private way."
Still, General Musharraf could be toppled or overtaken by events, short-circuiting efforts to reverse the country's drift towards extremism. Or, as Indian officials and analysts suspect, America's interest in helping fight terrorism in Kashmir will wane once its own battles are won or, worse still, that it will be so indebted to Pakistan that it will look the other way.
People here recall the 1980's, when the United States poured billions of dollars of military aid into Pakistan after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. What if the United States again develops a military relationship with Pakistan that is turned against India? 
"General Musharraf could fall off into the abyss," said Kanti Bajpai, a political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University here in New Delhi, "but if he comes out of this nicely he'll be much stronger than ever before. And the United States will have created another monster that is not terribly bashful about what it does in Kashmir."
LOOKING down the road, if the United States ignores terrorism in Kashmir after the Afghan phase of its global campaign ends, it may leave India feeling it has to wage the battle alone. 
If so, India would be more likely to take unilateral military action against Pakistan, perhaps launching commando raids across the cease-fire line into the part of Kashmir held by Pakistan.
While Indian officials say they have no plans to take such action now, there is a growing chorus of voices here -- among commentators at research institutes and in letters to the editor columns -- demanding that India strike back forcefully, as America is doing. Privately, a senior Indian official said a week before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited New Delhi that public pressure to act could be politically difficult to resist if there were more terrorist attacks and the United States was seen as not having done enough to help. 
The American response to the Sept. 11 attacks has changed the dynamic on Kashmir, the most dangerous flash point in South Asia, if not the world. And the way the United States handles India and Pakistan in the coming weeks and months will play a pivotal role in whether those changes are for good or ill. For now, it is America's own rationale for bombing Afghanistan that is most often cited in justifying a similar Indian strategy at some future date.
"On what grounds," asked Bharat Karnad, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, "would the Americans protest the Indians doing to Pakistan precisely what Americans are doing in Afghanistan to root out terrorism?"

HEADLINE: War on Terror Influences Australian Election 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Australia, the first American ally to offer military support for a global coalition against terrorism, will also be the first to pass judgment on that strategy through the ballot box.
 About 12 million people are expected to vote on Nov. 10 in a national election as Australian troops prepare for action in Afghanistan, under American command. 
 Australia has committed 150 Special Forces soldiers, six combat and patrol aircraft and five naval vessels to the campaign. The first of the 1,500 troops are to reach the operations areas around Election Day. 
Prime Minister John Howard, who was in Washington during the Sept. 11 attacks, is in Shanghai for the summit meeting of Asian and Pacific Rim leaders, at which terrorism is a major topic. Mr. Howard said that although his campaign was under way, it was his duty to be at the meeting with President Bush and 20 government leaders from the region.
With polls here indicating about 80 percent approval for Mr. Howard's pledge of troops, ships and aircraft to the American-led coalition, international security issues have dominated the first two weeks of the five-week campaign. The opposition Labor Party is finding it difficult so far to get voters' attention for the modest reforms it proposes for health, education and taxation programs.
Voting, which is compulsory here, will be for all 150 seats in the House of Representatives and half the 76 Senate seats.
Mr. Howard, 62, a conservative who was narrowly re-elected in 1998 and who is seeking a third three-year term, trailed in the polls for much of the year. Then the Sept. 11 attacks and his decision to turn away about 900 boat people, most seeking asylum after fleeing Muslim countries, altered the political landscape.
His standing in opinion polls surged with his quick decisions to offer support to the United States and to turn away the illegal immigrants, whom he ordered shipped to detention camps on Pacific islands to await United Nations screening.
Australia, which has a population of 19 million in an area almost as large as the United States, accepts about 12,000 United Nations-registered refugees each year, as well as about 70,000 other immigrants, but immigration by members of some minority groups has long been a sensitive issue here.
The most recent polls show Mr. Howard's governing coalition of parties representing middle-class suburbanites and farming regions leading the Labor Party by as much as 10 percentage points. Previously, Labor had been ahead, aided by the promises of its leader, Kim Beazley, to revise social and economic policies.
Mr. Beazley, 52, a former defense minister, agrees with the decision to provide military support for American actions against terrorism, and discourages illegal immigration. He is faced with the task of trying to win votes on the basis of local issues in a period of growing international insecurity and economic uncertainty.
Mr. Howard's coalition holds a six-seat majority in the House of Representatives, where the parliamentary-style governments are formed. It expects to increase its advantage next month by emphasizing security through stability.
The prime minister was in Washington on Sept. 11 for celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the defense and security treaty between the United States and Australia.
Australia has two major electronic intelligence bases, one run by the C.I.A., which monitor communications in Asia and contribute to American military information gathering.
Invoking the 1951 treaty, Mr. Howard said: "We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Americans. Australia is a 100 percent ally." 
Twenty Australians are missing, and presumed dead, in the ruins of the World Trade Center.

HEADLINE: Chinese Rights Cases, Once Near Resolution, Now Languish 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
As President Bush met for the first time with President Jiang Zemin of China this week, emphasizing their new cooperation, several high-profile human rights cases sat in a strange kind of limbo in Chinese courts, unresolved despite intense foreign interest and pressure.
 There had been signs in previous months that each of the longstanding cases was moving toward resolution. International human rights advocates even predicted that some prisoners might soon be released as a good-will gesture. They noted, too, that a meeting between Chinese and American officials concerning human rights, held early this month in Washington, was strikingly "friendly and cooperative." 
 Instead, as Mr. Bush prepared to come to the Asian summit meeting in Shanghai this week to rally support for his war on terrorism, human rights issues faded into the background and the high-profile cases seemed once again stalled, family members and their lawyers said.
Yang Zili, a Chinese Internet entrepreneur who helped start a small political discussion group that favored liberalization in China, was tried several weeks ago on the very serious charge of trying to subvert state power. But the court has delayed handing down its verdict, and family members said they did not expect a decision until after the Shanghai meeting closes. 
Liu Yaping, the holder of an American green card who was detained in a military prison for six months on minor economic charges having to do with a company he was trying to start, is now a virtual prisoner in a hospital in Inner Mongolia. Six weeks ago, supposedly in preparation for his release, Mr. Liu was moved from the prison to a hospital for treatment of a brain aneurysm discovered while he was in jail. But he has since been under police guard in a hospital bed, unable to leave or speak freely to his family, a relative said.
This week, after 18 months of detention, Fong Fuming, a naturalized United States citizen charged with bribery and stealing state secrets, was suddenly scheduled for a trial that is to start shortly after the delegates leave Shanghai. 
"The trial for Mr. Fong has been set for just after Bush leaves," said Jerome Cohen, a New York lawyer who is advising the Fong family. "We hope there is nothing untoward in the timing. But we're unsure."
All three cases have received extensive coverage in the foreign press and involve highly irregular judicial practices at a time when China is making great efforts to improve its legal system in preparation for its entry into the World Trade Organization, expected later this year. 
Lu Kun, the wife of Yang Zili, said family members had not received official notice of the charges against her husband and three of his colleagues and were not told when his case was scheduled to be heard. She managed to attend the hearing, alerted by his former employer, but she and others in the courtroom were distressed with what they saw.
Witnesses who had planned to speak in defense of Mr. Yang and the other defendants were not allowed to talk freely, for instance. 
To prove that the discussion group had planned to overthrow the state, prosecutors produced the defendants' old e-mail messages, diaries and essays -- private material that generally looked forward to a more democratic China, she said, but was mostly academic in tone. Such discussions are common among intellectuals as well as government officials these days. 
Ms. Lu ridiculed the notion that the discussion group did anything to threaten the Chinese government. "To bring this charge, they have to show actions, not just the mental state of the defendants," Ms. Lu said. "The facts and the evidence show they are innocent." 
Mr. Fong's family is similarly distressed. An engineer in China working for an American company, Mr. Fong was detained in early 2000, but was not formally charged until Sept. 29 of this year. 
It is unclear why security officials took so long to level formal charges, and lawyers on the case have been kept in the dark, Mr. Cohen said. They have been denied access to evidence against Mr. Fong, and have been told to keep his files secret. 
Although as an American citizen, he has been visited by representatives of the United States Embassy here, he has been denied medicines sent by his family as well as the use of his hearing aid and glasses for long periods of time, leaving him confused and isolated, family members said.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 10-21-01; 
Feds Up

BYLINE:  By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
Back in the era that ended on Sept. 11, life in Washington was burdened by a curious form of self-loathing. A good many of the capital's residents habitually deplored it as an irredeemably sinful place -- though as missionaries from the heartland they took no blame for its corruptions. You can trace the evolution of this attitude from Ronald Reagan's first Inaugural Address, when he said that government was not the solution but the problem, through Newt Gingrich's railings against the "corrupt" bureaucracy to the rather poignant attempt by that quintessential Washington figure, Bob Dole, to cast himself as an outsider when he ran for president. 
 Even after the Oklahoma City bombing muted the harshest anti-Washington rhetoric, there remained an entire lexicon for deriding the seat of national power. "Inside the Beltway" was a place where "career politicians" squandered "hard-earned tax dollars" on "one-size-fits-all" solutions," or what George W. Bush until recently called, with a kind of leer, "Washington solutions." A friend of mine liked to joke that the word "Washington" had become simply a synonym for "bad," to the extent that someone might well say, "I got sick from eating a Washington oyster." 
 As politically effective as this demagogy may have been, it took a toll on the city's psyche. Someone who constantly runs down the place where he lives and works ultimately diminishes his own power and place in the world. He develops a stake in failure. In Washington itself, two decades of government-hating bred a sour, ridiculous feeling. Meanwhile, the stars of America's two other capitals -- New York and Los Angeles -- were ascendant. These cities knew their problems, but suffered from no comparable level of corrosive self-disgust.
Now, in a flash, the whole mind-set has vanished. Since Sept. 11, Washington's sense of itself has changed utterly. "Washington solutions" have gone from inherently suspect to indubitably essential. The federal government is now seen not just as capable but also as uniquely capable of performing a great variety of urgent tasks: fighting our enemies abroad, stimulating our flagging economy, rescuing bankrupt airlines, rebuilding the ruins in New York City, protecting us from bioterror and making the skies feel safe again. Reagan's old joke about the 10 scariest words in the English language -- Hello, I'm from the government, and I'm here to help" -- isn't a joke anymore. It's the literal attitude of Reagan-revering Republicans who toured the devastation at ground zero.
With this can-do attitude has arrived a renewed feeling of self-esteem. To be in a city under attack, a city now fortified by concrete barricades, checkpoints and armed National Guard troops, confers a sense of centrality and importance to all those whose work is somehow connected with the government. The new mood of vital improvisation recalls descriptions of Washington in F.D.R.'s day and again in J.F.K.'s. Bush's cabinet is now a Churchillian war cabinet, in which dull posts like secretary of transportation have taken on critical significance. Journalists who previously felt unlucky to have to cover a buttoned-down White House in a somnolent era are suddenly imbued with the elan that comes with proximity to a national emergency. All the old forms of political clownishness are out. Even on the Fox News Channel, the food-fight arguments have turned heavy and serious. 
Among the paradoxes of this transformation is that Washington's resurgent self-confidence is a direct result of its own conspicuous failure. We as a nation have turned to the federal government for help precisely because the federal government failed at the one task so basic that it commands assent even from libertarians: defending the physical security of the country from foreign attack. What's more, we are relying most heavily on the very agencies and in some cases the individuals who bear the greatest responsibility for not protecting us more effectively: the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the N.S.A., N.S.C., the State Department and the Pentagon. 
Of course, attitudes toward Washington have always had a strong nonrational dimension. Public confidence in government started to decline in the 1960's for a variety of valid reasons, including Vietnam, rising crime rates and a seemingly irresistible expansion of the size of the federal government. But during the peace, prosperity and shrinking government of the 1990's, the distrust continued to grow. The only thing that consistently makes the public feel more positively about Washington is war. When the war ends, so does the heightened warmth toward government. 
This war may follow that pattern or it may not. But the new mood, both toward Washington and in Washington, tells us something in either case. It indicates that government-hating is a rather superficial and artificial sentiment, a luxury of secure times. When terrorists knock down buildings, when drought wipes out farmers, when the economy threatens to come to a halt, even those who are ideologically hostile to the government turn to it, both logically and reflexively, for help. We suddenly trust Washington not because it has done something new to earn our trust but because the alternative of not trusting it has suddenly become too terrifying to contemplate. 

GRAPHIC: Photo (Wurts Brothers) Chart: "WASHINGTON BEFORE THE WAR""I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. . . . And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. I mean, I want to empower people, I don't -- you know, I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, We do it this way, so should you. . . . I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course." George W. Bush, during the second presidential debate, Oct. 11, 2000

HEADLINE: Can Peace Finally Come to Kashmir? 

BYLINE:  By Anatol Lieven; Anatol Lieven is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan 

 BODY:
If the United States is serious about removing the sources of anti-American terrorism, then at some stage Washington will have to tackle the conflict in Kashmir. At present this is the last thing American officials want to do. They have enough on their plate in Afghanistan. But as Secretary of State Colin Powell's experiences in Islamabad and New Delhi illustrated, the Kashmir dispute has the potential both to infuriate India and to weaken the regime of our Pakistani ally, President Pervez Musharraf.
 A strong behind-the-scenes American diplomatic initiative needs to begin now, because the context created by the campaign in Afghanistan offers unique opportunities, as well as great dangers, in India and Pakistan. One of the chief dangers is presented by the Jaish-e-Muhammad, the leading Islamist force active in Kashmir. It has been labeled a terrorist organization by Washington and faces a probable sharp reduction in Pakistani support. This means it has little to lose -- and the Jaish-e-Muhammad has indeed threatened a terror campaign not just in Kashmir but across India. 
 This could incite both communal strife within India and even harsher Indian repression in Kashmir, thereby contributing to radical Islamist unrest in Pakistan. It could also lead to renewed fighting between India and Pakistan across the line of control that divides their respective Kashmirs, as shown in recent days by heavy Indian bombardments. 
The opportunities are provided by the sea change that has taken place in Pakistani policies as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks and President Musharraf's decision to support the American campaign in Afghanistan. For the first time, there is a real willingness among leaders of the Pakistani state and army to cut back or end support for the Islamist elements based in Pakistan who fight in Kashmir; and for the first time, in private at least, some are willing to concede that Pakistan's entire Kashmir strategy of the past 54 years has proved fruitless, damaging to Pakistan and in need of radical revision. This is really striking, because support for Kashmiri independence from India has been at the core of the Pakistani army's ideology since the army was founded. It presents a chance that we must encourage India and Pakistan to seize. 
The struggle against Islamist terrorism makes finding a settlement in Kashmir very important to America's national interest. As long as the conflict there continues, it will suck in terrorist elements from elsewhere in the Muslim world, and these will find sympathy and protection from the Pakistani population and some in the armed forces.
Besides, while the rivalry between India and Pakistan is very damaging to both countries, it is increasingly ruinous to Pakistan. The effort to maintain adequate defenses against a country with seven times Pakistan's population has led to military spending averaging around 30 percent of the budget in recent years, dwarfing the amounts spent on education, health, welfare or infrastructure and severely reducing economic growth. Lack of education also contributes to a level of population growth that is among the highest in Asia and continually nullifies improvements in living standards.
These factors create a real danger that Pakistan could follow Afghanistan into collapse -- but on a much larger scale, and with nuclear weapons. Few more menacing scenarios for the growth of Islamist terrorism could be imagined.
If a settlement is to be found to Kashmir, the greatest initial concession has to come from Pakistan. Islamabad must publicly recognize that the greater part of Kashmir will remain under Indian sovereignty, and must drop its demand for the implementation of United Nations resolutions calling for a Kashmiri plebiscite on national status. These resolutions may be justified in principle, but there is simply no way India will accept them. It cannot be forced by Pakistan or anyone else to do so.
In return, New Delhi must drop its pretense that the Kashmir problem is not central to Indo-Pakistani relations and is a purely internal Indian matter in which the world community has no legitimate role. The international terrorist threat, and the possession of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan, have rendered these propositions obviously absurd.
If both countries could get over these initial hurdles, then the way might open for a settlement involving partial demilitarization, open borders, new administrative units and internationally supervised regional elections on both sides of the Indo-Pakistani frontier.
Unfortunately, past experience suggests that the parties are unlikely to get over these hurdles without a lot of help from their friends, and above all from the United States.

The High, Hidden Cost of Saudi Arabian Oil

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
DURING his presidential campaign, George W. Bush warned that the nation faced an oil crisis. He was right, but not in the way he foresaw. The crisis that came has nothing to do with prices at the gas pump, or environmental obstacles to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. 
 Rather, it has to do with the political and military price the United States must pay for its dependence on oil from the Persian Gulf. 
 The terms of that dependence have been glaringly obvious since the attacks on New York and Washington. Immediately after Sept. 11, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, assured the United States that it would keep oil supplies stable. 
In turn, the Bush administration has refrained from criticizing Saudi silence over the American-led counterattacks against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, nor has it spoken out about evidence that Saudi citizens finance Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and other radical Islamic organizations.
Moreover, although the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified most of the hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks as Saudis, Saudi Arabia has refused to provide passenger lists of flights to the United States, an act the Bush administration has been unwilling to criticize. 
"The stark truth is that we're dependent on this country that directly or indirectly finances people who are a direct threat to you and me as individuals," said Edward L. Morse, former deputy assistant secretary of state for international energy policy under President Ronald Reagan. 
"They won't give us information, won't help track people down, and won't let us use our bases that are there to protect them," Mr. Morse added.
A major reason for that reticence is oil. Five percent of the world's population lives in the United States, but it burns about 19 million barrels of oil a day, or 25 percent of the global daily consumption of 76 million barrels. American cars and sport-utility vehicles alone consume 10 percent of that.
The United States has been angling for influence in the Arabian peninsula since oil was discovered there 70 years ago. American oil companies helped create Saudi Aramco, the state oil company. They were kicked out during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, but the United States and Saudi Arabia quickly reconciled. Several groups of Western oil companies, led by ExxonMobil, will soon develop Saudi Arabia's huge natural gas fields.
Saudi Arabia has all along made certain it was the largest supplier of oil to the United States, oil traders, diplomats and economists said. Saudi Arabia could make more money selling oil to east Asia, but has preferred to sell oil to the United States at lower prices in order to retain its coveted role. 
Over the decades, the Saudis' pursuit of American money and military protection melded perfectly with America's ever-growing oil appetite to turn the two nations into reflexive allies. Saudi Arabia and the United States worked together for years to shape the balance of power in the Middle East and Central Asia. 
From 1980 to 1988, the United States and Saudi Arabia armed Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran. In 1979 , after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the Saudis were part of an alliance formed by the United States to drive them out. 
"We collaborated in the war in Afghanistan: the Saudis, the U.S. and Pakistan," said Gregory Gause, director of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Vermont. "The Saudis had the money, the Pakistanis had the bases and we had the political oomph to get it together."
Because its interests were so densely intertwined with Saudi Arabia, the United States turned a blind eye to its ally's unsavory foreign liaisons and brewing domestic trouble. 
THE United States looked the other way, for instance, as the Saudi government and individuals sent money to the Taliban. Starting in 1999 and extending at least into mid-2000, Saudi Arabia exported 150,000 barrels of oil a day, gratis, to Pakistan and Afghanistan as foreign aid, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a trade publication. Among oil traders, it is widely believed that the shipments exceeded war-ravaged Afghanistan's needs, and that oil may have been resold to arm the Taliban. 
Saudi Arabia's aid to the Taliban points up the balancing act the ruling al-Saud family has to perform between its foreign and domestic interests. The Saudis consider themselves allies of the United States. But the glue that holds their kingdom together is a puritanical strain of Islam called Wahhabism. By supporting the Taliban and other Muslim groups, the al-Saud dynasty is able to retain the goodwill of the country's clerics. Already, in response to the tacit Saudi backing of the American antiterrorism campaign, a powerful mainstream mullah in Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa excommunicating the royal family. Fearful of protests, the Saudis have not tried to arrest him. 
In fact, fear of losing power has led the Saudis to pay off just about everyone, which makes oil revenues so crucial. There is the welfare state to coddle the citizenry; the toleration of extremist clerics so that they do not stir up the masses; and the payoffs to other regimes, including a Pakistan with nuclear capability, to keep them friendly.
But that protection money has not stemmed a growing domestic restiveness, as many Saudis have become fed up with a sprawling ruling family they believe is insatiably corrupt. 
"For many of the princes," said one former cabinet secretary in Washington, "the advantages of getting money exceed the advantages of keeping internal unrest down."
Many people in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East loathe the United States because they see it as the protector of a degraded regime in Riyadh. This has put pressure on the Bush administration, intent upon preserving the stability of its largest oil supplier and the appearance of Middle Eastern approval for its fight against terrorism, to toughen its stance on Israel. Prior to the assassination of an Israeli cabinet minister, some kind of shift had been expected by many, including the Israelis. 
"To a certain extent," said Philip K. Verleger, an independent economist and a senior adviser in the Carter administration, "we let U.S. foreign policy be dictated to us by the house of Saud."
IT is unclear what the United States can do to loosen its ties to the Saudi regime, so long as it remains reliant on its oil. Mr. Bush urged the Senate last week to get to work on a comprehensive energy policy. But the White House and most Republicans want to focus on developing domestic oil supplies. Given the fact that the United States has only 3 percent of the world's known reserves, increased drilling will do little in the long run to decrease dependence on the Middle East.
"Sept. 11 should be an alarm bell that we need a balanced, comprehensive energy policy that addresses things we don't like to do: mandating more fuel-efficient vehicles, more domestic oil and gas drilling, becoming more energy efficient as a nation, " said Bill Richardson, energy secretary under President Bill Clinton. 
That, in turn, could give Washington a bit more leeway in its relations with Saudi Arabia, freeing it to press for a reduction in official corruption or for reining in radical Islamic groups. 
Some people, like Dan W. Reicher, former assistant secretary of energy under Mr. Clinton, think that changes that reduce American dependence on petroleum are possible without Americans having to sacrifice the kinds of cars they drive or how they live. 
The question now, Mr. Reicher said, is whether Washington can find the political will to act before an oil crisis explodes. 
"Will patriotism mean more than raising the flag?" he said. "Will it mean raising fuel economy?"

HEADLINE: Bush Calls World Economy Goal of Attacks on U.S. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush declared today that the two American soldiers killed in an accident on Friday -- the first major American casualties in South Asia -- "died in a cause that was just and was right." He also told leaders of the 21 nations assembled here for an annual summit meeting that the terrorists who struck the World Trade Center were trying to bring about a collapse of world markets.
 It is the first time he has suggested that the terrorist network Al Qaeda was seeking to "shatter confidence in the world economic system." He called on businesses around the world to join the fight against terrorism, while acknowledging that new security measures and limits on border crossings ran the risk of undermining world commerce. 
 "Terrorists want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself," he said today in a speech to chief executives, who hold their own meetings in parallel with those of the government leaders. "We must not let them."
The news of the accident in Pakistan that killed two soldiers came just hours before the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here, and it underscored how Mr. Bush was mixing coalition building with long-distance management of the war. 
He slid past questions about the exact mission of the Special Forces units that were sent in and then taken out of Afghanistan on Friday. The deaths occurred in a search and rescue team on call in case the mission ran into trouble. "There will be moments of sacrifice," Mr. Bush said late this morning, as he was about to meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. "We've seen two such examples today."
The White House announced today that Mr. Bush would leave Shanghai about half a day earlier than scheduled, after a meeting with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, ends on Sunday. That meeting is intended to focus on creating a new strategic relationship with Russia, which the war has elevated to a new level of cooperation and intelligence sharing.
Though he got no specific endorsement for military strikes in Afghanistan, including none from Mr. Putin, Mr. Bush could claim a measure of diplomatic success here simply because he prevented any major defections from his informal coalition.
But there were several close calls, as country after country in the region repeated that they wanted to keep civilian casualties to a minimum and the military action in Afghanistan as short as possible. After a meeting today between President Jiang Zemin of China and Mr. Putin, the Russian president's spokesman, Aleksei Gromov, said, "The leaders want an end to the military phase and to move to a political settlement as soon as possible." 
As several leaders express their reservations over civilian casualties, Mr. Bush and his advisers have steadily escalated their verbal attacks on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban. Today Mr. Bush said that "this conflict is a fight to save the civilized world" from an evil regime that starves its people and supports terrorists who live "on the hunted margin of mankind." He added:
"By their hatred they have divorced themselves from the values that define civilization itself," 
While Mr. Bush talked almost exclusively about terrorism and its state sponsors, the national leaders here had other matters in mind. Several focused on the region's fast-declining economy, a subject Mr. Bush touched upon briefly today but without offering any strategy to reverse the downturn. In an interview on Friday, the president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, said that in many ways Asia was in worse shape now than it was in 1997 and 1998, at the height of the Asian economic crisis. 
Mr. Bush's aides say he came wanting to hear about economic concerns, but it is clear that it is not his priority. None of his most influential economic aides are here. Nor did he speak in any detail about economics. 
As to terrorism, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, and perhaps others, are willing to share intelligence and help identify terrorist cells, Mrs. Arroyo said in the interview. But the proposal appears intended in part to create a group not under American domination. That would allow the leaders of Malaysia and Indonesia to have an antiterror organization of their own at a time each is fighting extremist groups.
Today, Malaysia's prickly, outspoken president, Mahathir bin Mohamad, met with Mr. Bush at his hotel in the center of Shanghai, and the Malaysian leader used the occasion to complain that the war in Afghanistan was taking innocent Afghan lives. Interestingly, the White House allowed photographers to record the meeting, but banned the reporters who usually ask a few questions at the outset of such of a meeting. 
When Mr. Mahathir emerged to speak to business executives, the same group Mr. Bush addressed earlier in the day, he did not mention terrorism. But he did level a strong blast at the forces of economic globalization that Mr. Bush had just hailed. 
"If I had a billion U.S. dollars, I suspect I too would be very committed to a fully globalized world without any barriers and without any constraints on what I can do with my money and how I can make even more money," he said, mocking the group's commitment to free trade. 
Mr. Bush argued the opposite point -- that more globalization, more openness, will help fight terrorism. "I'm here in Shanghai to assure our friends and to inform our our foes that the progress of trade and freedom will continue," he said. "The ties of culture and commerce will grow stronger."

HEADLINE: Do All Airlines Deserve A Taxpayer Rescue? 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
AFTER the terrorist attacks forced the nation's airlines to beg Washington for life support last month, America West Airlines, based here, was named repeatedly by industry executives and analysts as the carrier most in danger of failing. 
 In fact, testifying on Capitol Hill on Sept. 19, W. Douglas Parker, America West's young new chief executive, told lawmakers that the airline was losing $5 million a day and would be forced to file for bankruptcy within days if the government did not intervene. 
 Now, in the wake of an emergency cash grant of $60 million from Washington and rising passenger traffic, things are much improved, Mr. Parker said in an interview. But the airline is still preparing to apply for federally guaranteed loans of as much as $300 million under the $10 billion program extended to the industry by emergency legislation. 
Should it get it?
The case illustrates the tricky challenge facing a panel -- led by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman -- that has been given broad powers by Congress to decide which airlines will receive the loan guarantees. 
Lawmakers insisted that taxpayers should not prop up airlines already destined to fail. But that is extremely difficult to determine in an industry where airlines can fly through multiple bankruptcies and still find success. In addition, the pressure from state and national politicians to make sure that their home airlines survive is so enormous that it may be difficult for the panel, known as the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, to deny a guarantee to any applicant. 
Earlier this month, after an intensive round of lobbying, the Office of Management and Budget gave the board, which also includes Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and Comptroller General David M. Walker, wide leeway to extend loans even to airlines that were operating in bankruptcy before Sept. 11. 
One of those, Midway Airlines, which suspended operations immediately after the attacks, is planning to apply for a loan guarantee, Robert Ferguson, its chief executive, said on Friday. 
The only limitations placed on the board are that loans cannot extend more than seven years and cannot be 100 percent guaranteed by the government. Preference is to go to airlines with the strongest business plans and those willing to compensate the government for the guarantees in the form of fees or stock.
WITH this broad mandate and little precedent for such a wide-ranging loan program, the airlines, their suppliers and their lenders are waiting eagerly to see what the board does. Will it take a hard line and force the industry to consolidate, as some people have advocated? Or, as others have recommended, will it dole out funds more liberally in an effort to preserve competition that will keep fares low?
Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York, said, "The reality is that nobody knows how this process is really going to work."
Phoenix is a fitting home for America West, which has already risen once from the ashes of bankruptcy, in 1994. With $2.3 billion in sales last year, it is the only airline among the scores founded since deregulation that has managed to become a major carrier. 
America West is now the country's eighth-largest airline, carrying about 3 percent of all passengers. But it has always been hobbled by having its biggest hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, two cities dominated by low-fare leisure passengers. 
It also competes directly in both markets against Southwest Airlines, the king of low-fare airlines and the most consistently profitable carrier. 
"If you are competing with an airline that is courteous, clean and reliable and offers low fares, that's a difficult challenge," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive and regulator who now teaches at Harvard Law School.
Despite its efforts over the years to attract high-paying business travelers, America West has the lowest revenue per seat in the industry. It has made up for that by having among the lowest costs. 
That worked well after the airline was founded in the early 1980's. Employees earned less than their counterparts at other airlines, but a strong company culture did much to balance that. Flight attendants also worked as reservation agents and loaded bags. Every employee was required to buy stock. 
But all that changed after the company filed for bankruptcy during the last big industry downturn, in the early 1990's after the Persian Gulf war. The airline emerged under the leadership of William A. Franke, a turnaround specialist who was not particularly friendly to labor. 
America West's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics soon voted to join unions, and the scene was set for traditional airline-labor rancor. 
Since 1996, America West's operations and overall reliability have seesawed from year to year. In 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration fined the airline $2.5 million for maintenance violations. Operations recovered in 1999 but fell apart the next year, when mechanical difficulties forced the airline to cancel 6 percent of its flights during the busy summer travel season. 
Mr. Parker, who took over for Mr. Franke on Sept. 1 after serving as president, now acknowledges that America West grew too rapidly and deferred discretionary maintenance to save money. "We were running a bad airline," he said. 
Mr. Parker and a young management team have tried to turn things around, with some success. But in August, America West was still at the bottom of the industry in terms of passenger complaints and on-time performance.
More important, the airline ended up paying dearly for its recent missteps when the boom of the late 1990's ended abruptly for the industry earlier this year. After eking out a $7.7 million profit last year, while other airlines were posting strong earnings, America West burned through $100 million in cash from Jan. 1 to Sept. 11, leaving it with just $80 million on the day of the attacks. 
ONLY days before, Mr. Parker said, America West had signed tentative agreements to borrow $200 million in connection with a purchase of airplanes. People with knowledge of the transaction said Airbus Industrie had been willing to provide America West with new replacement jets financed by GE Capital and others, plus an unsecured loan of $200 million, as a cushion to carry the airline through the downturn. 
Such arrangements are not unusual in the airline industry, where Boeing and Airbus often take on financial risk to place their airplanes. But the deal, which was to close this month, collapsed after the attacks.
America West, along with the rest of the industry, suddenly found itself hemorrhaging cash as paying customers disappeared but its large expenses remained. The difference was that America West had a smaller kitty to absorb the shock. 
The $60 million grant provided by Washington, which is half of America West's share of the $5 billion emergency bailout, bought the airline some breathing space. Last week, it raised an additional $70 million in a sale-leaseback deal involving eight of its Airbus A319's, three flight simulators and two spare engines. The airline declined to identify the lender, but people with knowledge of the deal said it was GE Capital. 
John Oliver, a spokesman for GE Capital, would say only that it is continuing to work closely with long-term customers like America West. 
Mr. Parker, a candid and affable financial whiz who will turn 40 on Halloween and looks even younger, said the airline now had time to compose a strong application to the loan board by year-end. 
He said America West was well positioned before Sept. 11, adding that its operating margins were the third highest in the industry, behind Southwest and Continental Airlines. "We agree that the loan guarantee process should not be used to sustain airlines that were going out of business," he said. "We weren't one of them." 
But critics complain that government intervention is undermining market forces that otherwise would press an inefficient industry to consolidate. People with knowledge of the recent sale-leaseback deal said GE Capital would never have lent America West the money if there had been no government loan guarantee. But it is in the financial interest of GE Capital, as America West's biggest creditor, to see the airline receive a loan rather than file for bankruptcy.
POLITICIANS also have a strong interest in America West's survival. The airline contributes $5.2 billion to Arizona's economy, according to a study by Arizona State University. It provides relatively high-income jobs for 13,000 people, 9,000 in Arizona alone. 
The airline has a powerful ally in Senator John McCain, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee. Speaking to some of the airline's best customers at its headquarters on Wednesday, C. A. Howlett, America West's top lobbyist, strongly praised the recent support of the state's two senators, its governor and Representative John B. Shadegg. 
"It is hard to describe the absolute fervor with which those four individuals went to bat for America West since Sept. 11," Mr. Howlett said. 
That kind of support, which has been duplicated for other airlines in many other states, is the reason many analysts believe every carrier that applies will receive a guaranteed loan. "Everybody's going to be a winner," said Mr. Buttrick of UBS Warburg. 
But Mr. Levine, who worked at the Civil Aeronautics Board when the industry was deregulated in the late 1970's, says that by giving preference to applicants that offer the government some equity stake, the rules governing the loan board will discourage the bigger airlines from applying for the guarantees as a way to keep support away from weaker carriers. 
"If you know it is going to cost you something on the equity side," he said, "you are not so quick to show up for this money." 
Mr. Parker said the business plan that America West will present to the loan board will not be a break with the past. The airline will stress the growth of its hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, two of the country's fastest-growing cities.
"The formula works," he said, "and I am confident that it has a lot of growth left in it."

John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) may be best known for his virtuosic portraits, but he was also a gifted muralist, particularly in Boston, where the Museum of Fine Arts commissioned him to celebrate the arts in creating decorations for its library entrance, the ceiling above the grand stairway and the dome of the rotunda. Sargent worked on the project for nearly 10 years, constructing a model of the dome and using as his favorite model Thomas McKeller, an African-American hotel worker, who posed for many of the figures. Beginning on Friday, 34 of Sargent's small bas-reliefs and a sculpture that were studies for the museum's dome will go on public view for the first time at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven. "John Singer Sargent: The Painter as Sculptor" continues through April 21; (203) 432-0600.

Summit Meeting
Speakers including Janet Reno, the former United States attorney general, and Acting Gov. Jane M. Swift of Massachusetts are to take part on Saturday in a daylong conference at Barnard College on the impact of the changing role of women on society and the family. "The Barnard Summit: Women, Leadership and the Future" will examine how the participation of women in public life is transforming political, judicial and economic institutions, as well as the family and women themselves; (212) 854-2037.

Honor Bound
The winner is Midori. In ceremonies this evening at Lincoln Center, Midori, the renowned violinist, will be awarded the $50,000 Avery Fisher Prize for outstanding achievement and excellence in music. Inscribed on a marble plaque in Avery Fisher Hall, her name will join those of 16 previous recipients of the prize, among them the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the pianist Emanuel Ax, the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman and the violinists Sarah Chang and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.

During emergencies, officials need access to wireless communications systems. But regular people do, too.

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero 

 BODY:
ONCE again, the federal government has asked the telecommunications industry to find a way to provide public safety officials with priority access on wireless communications systems in times of crisis. And once again, those involved in the effort are discovering the difficulty of carrying out such a mission. 
 Since Sept. 11, no one has disputed the value of devising priority access methods for wireless systems. For several hours after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, cellular phone networks were flooded with calls, making it difficult for almost everyone, including emergency service officials, to use the systems. Networks were so strained in the hours after the attacks that sending and receiving rudimentary text messages on pagers was far easier than completing a call on a mobile phone. 
 And so comes the new urgency for wireless priority access. Earlier this month, the National Communications System, a White House-level umbrella organization of officials from 23 federal departments and agencies, asked the nation's wireless carriers for proposals on how to provide priority access, first in big cities, then nationwide. The carriers have until mid-December to comply with the government's request. 
"In times of severe wireless network congestion, call completion percentages can drop well below 5 percent," Richard Clarke, the president's special adviser on cyberspace security, said in a statement. "It is essential that we work with industry to deploy priority access service for use in crisis situations as soon as possible."
The National Communications System was set up by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, after a snarl in communications during the Cuban missile crisis among the United States, the Soviet Union and NATO months earlier. The system has continued over the years to try to maintain communications among emergency service officials in times of crisis.
It first asked wireless companies in 1995 to devise a priority access system, but so far little headway has been made. Some in the wireless industry say technological difficulties are to blame. They say the commercial wireless systems, built in the last 20 years, are substantially different than the wireline network that was cobbled together over the course of a century.
Priority access on wireline systems is relatively easy because the central command stations of large local or long-distance phone companies can remotely allow or cut off access to whomever they please without much difficulty. The only requirement is an awareness of which copper wires, fiber optic strands and switches are used by emergency officials, and, in some cases, a sufficient supply of backup power.
But the continent-spanning wireless networks built in the United States in recent years present challenges to planners dealing with priority access. First, there is already a shortage of spectrum, or airwaves, used to carry wireless calls. That is evident in current discussions among the Federal Communications Commission and several communications companies to settle a legal dispute over ownership of more than 200 coveted spectrum licenses auctioned off to large carriers last January. Some industry executives have suggested that specific swaths be reserved for emergency services, though it is not clear how this would be accomplished or what reception such a plan would receive from the government.
There is also the issue of the different and sometimes conflicting technical formats used by various wireless carriers. The disparities make streamlined supervision of the networks difficult. 
What is more, because wireless users regularly move about, often going from one transmitter's cell to another in the course of a single call, it is more difficult to determine a caller's location on wireless networks than on wireline systems. It is also harder to provide users with a dedicated circuit if they are moving between cellular stations. 
And when calling volume on wireless networks increases -- the very periods when priority access would be most needed -- it is harder to assign priorities. Some cellular stations can handle only a certain number of calls before becoming so congested that they are effectively useless to all callers for short periods. This is what happened in New York and Washington in the hours and days after Sept. 11.
For now, wireless carriers have agreed to provide an interim system for 500 officials, as requested by the National Communications System. The industry also said it would begin work on a larger system, capable of supporting 50,000 users, to be available by the end of next year.
"We don't think it's impossible to achieve priority access, but we do recognize some of the challenges we face in getting there," said Kimberly Kuo, a spokeswoman at the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, a trade group in Washington for wireless carriers. "One of the things we're concerned about is the effect this could have on regular wireless users."
Certainly, one of the main reasons people buy cellular phones is to use the devices in case of an emergency. But what if giving government officials priority on wireless networks during a crisis made it even more difficult for regular users to place calls? If people could not communicate with their loved ones, might that add to public confusion and panic, making the work of public safety officials even more difficult?
It is hard to predict with certainty the effect wireless priority access would have on the general population until detailed plans are drawn up. Officials from the National Communications System declined repeated requests to comment last week, saying they did not have a "subject matter expert" available to speak on the matter. 
Last year, after four years of discussion on the issue, the F.C.C., acting on suggestions made by the National Communications System, asked wireless carries to provide priority access to emergency officials on a voluntary basis. Since then, no carrier has produced a specific plan for doing so. 
While the industry discusses ways to widen priority access efforts, some intermediate solutions have also been put forward. One of the most practical involves technology from Nextel Communications, a wireless carrier that primarily serves businesses. 
Nextel provides regular cellular phone service. But unlike other carriers' systems, Nextel's phones also provide a two-way radio service that works like the dispatcher systems used by taxi companies or police departments. Even when cellular systems are flooded with calls, Nextel's radio feature generally works without problems. 
John Perry, manager of disaster communications for the American Red Cross, said he and other Red Cross employees had used Nextel phones to communicate with each other in Washington and New York in the days after Sept. 11. "The Nextel system is limited geographically," he said, "but it works like a dream on the local level."
It is clear to almost everyone involved in the debate over priority access that stopgap proposals are not sufficient. But to the potential dismay of people who are counting on their mobile phones to serve them in an emergency, what appears likely is a system that prizes communication among a handful of important officials at the expense of calls made by everyone else.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Magazines closely weigh ad rates for the fourth quarter and early 2002 in a moribund market.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MICHAEL G. EARLS has big plans as he reintroduces Appellation magazine next month: a new name, Wine Country Living; an added editorial focus on homes, cooking, culture and lifestyle, as well as wine and travel; and a drive to double the rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, to 100,000.
 One change, however, is not planned: higher prices for ad pages. Wine Country Living will charge the same rates as its predecessor. 
 "We're moving this forward slowly and making sure we're safe doing it," said Mr. Earls, president and publisher at Appellation L.L.C. in Sonoma, Calif. "We don't want to alienate anyone with aggressive moves at this point." 
Mr. Earls's caution is emblematic of attitudes among executives at media companies as they determine what to charge for ad pages and commercial time in the important fourth quarter and the start of 2002. The economic slowdown that has already diminished demand among marketers is being made worse by the effects of the terrorist attacks.
The result is "what is proving to be the softest advertising market place ever," Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily, an industry newsletter, wrote on Friday.
The big broadcast television networks are in a "scramble to save" the fourth quarter, the trade publication Mediaweek reported last week, trying to avoid steep cuts in commercial prices. In radio, Gary Fries, president of the Radio Advertising Bureau, prescribed steps to reverse ad revenue declines that included enlisting senior managers to "return to the front lines" and sell spots.
The sagging market has emboldened the buyers -- advertisers and the agencies that represent them -- to resist price increases, and even to demand significantly lower rates.
Pricing, particularly for print, "has gotten very much out of whack," said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at MediaCom in New York, the media services division of the Grey Global Group.
"A rising tide raised all the ships and a lowering tide is lowering all the ships," he added. "Unfortunately, some in the print world will find they're stuck in the mud."
Mr. Mandel will discuss the outlook for advertising as a member of a panel at a general session today of the American Magazine Conference. The conference, at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in Midtown Manhattan, is sponsored by the Magazine Publishers of America and the American Society of Magazine Editors.
Several publishers say they realize buyers are behaving like the hard-nosed customer in the Meineke commercials who declares he is "not going to pay a lot for that muffler."
"Costs have gone up dramatically in the last year," said Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive at Conde Nast Publications in New York, the division of Advance Publications that operates magazines like Architectural Digest, GQ, Glamour, Gourmet and Vogue. "On the other hand, if we passed all those costs on to the advertisers, we wouldn't sell much advertising."
That is why Conde Nast is raising ad rates 4 percent for 2002, compared with an 8 percent increase in 2001. The increase is "fair for us as a company," Mr. Florio said, "and fair -- and marketable -- to the advertising community."
One magazine, Forbes, has decided against raising ad rates for 2002 after two years of what James S. Berrien, president at the Forbes Magazine Group in New York, called "very aggressive increases."
"Let's face it, this is a competitive market place," Mr. Berrien said, "and this is the year for us to take an aggressive pricing strategy in the other direction."
"At a meeting with Steve and Tim, I said, 'I'd like to go with a zero,' " he added, "and Steve said, 'It's the capitalistic thing to do: an economic stimulus package.' " His references were to executives at the parent, Forbes Inc., Steve Forbes, president and editor in chief, and Timothy C. Forbes, chief operating officer.
A Forbes competitor, Fortune, plans "a very modest increase" in ad-page rates, in the low single digits, said Mike Federle, publisher in New York, "the most modest we've taken in my six years here."
"We respect the times and everything our advertisers are going through," he added. "Next year is not the year to be bold coming off the blocks." Fortune is part of the Fortune Group division of Time Inc., owned by AOL Time Warner. 
Advertisers are "re-evaluating their media buys," which will make 2002 "very challenging," said Stephanie George, president at InStyle magazine in New York, a Fortune sibling in the Time Inc. stable.
Still, "they'll want to place their dollars where they know the biggest payoff is," she added. "That's when the cream rises to the top."
InStyle will raise ad rates 10 percent, Ms. George said, but will also raise the circulation rate base 6.7 percent, to 1.6 million.
Normally, the circulation gains, coming as many other magazines lose readers, would have led InStyle to try raising ad rates even more, "but not in the year we're heading into," she added.
Another magazine increasing both ad rates and the rate base for 2002 is The New Yorker, another Conde Nast publication. Its ad rates are going up 10.5 percent as the rate base goes up 6.3 percent, to 850,000.
"I don't think anyone can say going they're feeling very bullish," said David Carey, vice president and publisher at The New Yorker. "It's going to be a tough six months."
Heading into Sept. 11, Mr. Carey recalled, his ad pages were down about 3.5 percent from the corresponding period in 2001. But since then, he added, "we've given a fair amount back because travel and retail" -- two ad categories hit particularly hard by recent consumer anxieties -- "are the drivers in the fourth quarter."
As a result, Mr. Carey estimated that The New Yorker would end 2001 with a decline in ad pages of 12 percent to 13 percent from 2000.
Still, "some travel business is coming back," he said. "We've just had some airlines book some branding advertising in December." He is also cheered by the circulation growth -- the rate base increase is the second in five months -- and the subscription renewal rate of 76.5 percent, "the highest in our history."
"We're going to be in business for a long time," Mr. Carey said, "not just for the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002."
That long-term perspective, though, contrasts markedly with the increasingly short-term perspective taken by marketers.
"More clients are choosing to wait until the last minute to make financial commitments to advertising," said Karen Jacobs, senior vice president and director for print investment at Starcom Worldwide in Chicago, a unit of the Starcom MediaVest Group media services division of the Bcom3 Group. "They're not necessarily spending less money, but there's less willingness to let go of the money," she said.
Ms. Jacobs described the current preference as "just-in-time media buying," echoing the term used to describe the cost-saving parts-delivery strategy pursued by makers of products like automobiles.
But will there be more last-minute media buys, made just in time to salvage this year -- and 2002 -- for the media companies? Time, last minute or not, will tell.

News Media Risk Big Losses To Cover War

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL with FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
There is never a good time for a war, but for big media and news companies, the timing of the current crisis is especially poor.
 Even before Sept. 11, advertising sales, which underwrite most news operations, were already taking on water. Since Sept. 11, the advertising business has capsized. 
 But for news companies and the businesses that own them, lower ad revenue is only part of the problem. They are also having to tear up their budgets to give this big story the resources it warrants. 
For major news companies, the question so far is not whether they can afford to cover the crisis, but whether they can afford not to. 
Most say they are trying to look beyond the short-term financial impact to see the long-term value that extensive coverage can bring to their news "brands." They remember that when CNN distinguished itself during the Persian Gulf war, the cable network's halo lasted for years.
"We're going to spend whatever we need to spend to cover the story appropriately," said J. Michael Kelly, chief financial officer of AOL Time Warner, which now owns CNN as well as the news magazine Time. "That's how you build brands in this business, by being renowned for your editorial coverage of these kinds of stories."
Like CNN, the major broadcast television news operations are owned by international conglomerates with deep pockets: ABC News by Walt Disney, CBS News by Viacom and NBC News by General Electric. And because news is just a small -- if highly visible -- part of what each of those companies do, they may eventually become reluctant to let news spending hurt their overall financial results, especially if the crisis drags on. 
By contrast, at businesses like The Washington Post or The New York Times, where news is the main operation, there may be less leeway for trimming costs -- and so less ability to avoid financial pain.
In an electronic video message to employees last Friday, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the Times Company chairman, said the unsettled economic climate would cause the company to fall short of its earnings goal this year and that the company would probably miss its goal for 2002.
Nonetheless, he said, "The quality of our journalism is at the heart of our company's success, and we will do everything we can to continue providing our readers and viewers and listeners and users with world-class news reports."
According to estimates culled from companies and Wall Street analysts, United States news companies may have already spent as much as $100 million beyond their previous budgets to report the conflict. That is in addition to more than $500 million in advertising revenue lost by television networks in the days immediately after the attacks, as they went to 24-hour news.
Were the current level of crisis coverage to persist for a year, the major United States television news units would incur hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs. The networks would potentially lose hundreds of millions of dollars more in lost ad sales if developments warranted a return to round-the-clock coverage.
One Wall Street analyst estimated that each of the three major broadcast networks was now incurring about $1 million a day in extra costs covering the war on terrorism. 
If that estimate is close to accurate, it will roughly double the budget for each of the three major broadcast news divisions and turn them from slightly profitable to severely unprofitable. Analysts and executives estimate that -- not counting the highly profitable prime-time news magazine programs -- each of the three major broadcast news divisions generates $400 million to $450 million in annual revenue and incurs $350 million to $400 million in annual costs.
If each of the broadcast news divisions did have an additional $350 million in annual costs for covering the crisis, it would have a significant impact on the financial results of their parent companies. Such a hit to the corporate income statement could potentially reduce each media giant's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a key financial yardstick for media companies -- by 5 percent or more.
On condition of anonymity, an executive close to one of the major broadcast news divisions said that at current spending levels, his network was incurring no more than about $36 million in additional annual costs, a relatively negligible amount. The executive warned, however, that the figure could balloon should the crisis take a new turn.
As far as newspaper companies are concerned, one analyst, Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch, gave a rough cost estimate, suggesting that Gannett and The New York Times Company had each spent $3 million to $4 million so far for extra newsprint, travel, auxiliary staff and communications. Through spokeswomen, both companies declined to discuss such costs.
"Newspapers are in a very odd spot right now in terms of both serving the public good and trying to serve shareholders," Ms. Fine said. "You wish there were times when investors cut companies slack and appreciated what they were doing."
In an earnings conference call with analysts last week, Knight Ridder's chief executive, P. Anthony Ridder, said the company had lost $9 million in ad revenue because of the Sept. 11 attacks and had spent an extra $2 million "covering the story following the attacks."
Boisfeuillet Jones Jr., publisher of The Washington Post, said, "We're spending more than we were before, and we're saving more where we can, too, to partly offset it."
"It certainly is adding to costs at this point," he added, "but that's expected."
In both print and video, at least some of the additional costs will be recouped. Higher ratings for news are already increasing advertising revenue for some networks, although it may be too soon to get anything more than rough estimates. In the end, an all-news operation like CNN may very well come out ahead on its war coverage.
Mark Harrad, a spokesman in New York for AOL's Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes CNN, said that in the first week of October CNN increased its advertising rates to reflect the network's expected higher viewership. He did not quantify the increase, which will not affect advertisers that had already contracted for time on the network.
"For CNN, I think it's a net gain," said Richard A. Bilotti, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. But he said he thought the crisis would probably result in a net loss for the broadcast networks.
Media executives have to hope that any financial loss will be outweighed by the long-term good will and cachet that their efforts may attract to their brands. But in the heat of the crisis, at least one news executive says that brand-building is not what he is thinking about right now. 
"After we're done, we look back and say, 'Did we help ABC News, or did we make mistakes and hurt ABC News?' " said Alex Wallau, president of the ABC television network. "In this case, I think we've helped the brand, but that's not something we think about when it occurs. I think that that is a mindset that comes after everything is over."
The trouble, from a business standpoint, is that no one knows when everything will be over.

Newsweeklies Run to Keep UpOn Tricky Turf

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
At 11 a.m. Friday, about two dozen Newsweek staff members gathered around a conference room table. The photo department had just been reopened after an anthrax scare that proved to be a false alarm. And word had spread that morning of new activity by United States Special Forces on the ground in Afghanistan, throwing up in the air the contents of the issue closing the next day.
 "I think we should go ahead and work up a special ops cover," began Mark Whitaker, Newsweek's editor, "but I think that for the moment we should stick with 'sleepers,' " a feature called "The Terrorist Next Door," about Al Qaeda cells in the United States and overseas. 
 He added, "We may want some more shots of ground troops moving in because what we had on Capitol Hill yesterday wasn't great." The Capitol photographs showed federal agents in protective suits inspecting for anthrax. 
The news media are confronting a changed world, where surreal pictures of teams in airtight helmets entering the empty Capitol do not automatically rank as a week's most potent images, and coverage is a special challenge for a newsweekly.
Newsmagazines distill complex events into a single digestible package for the broadest possible readership, and they depend more than anything else on the single image on each cover to seize attention. Since Sept. 11, they have faced a host of new questions, like how to cover the public's fears without inflaming them or promoting bias against Arab-Americans.
Newsstand sales of Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report all leaped to more than 10 times their average levels in the week after Sept. 11, setting new records, according to preliminary estimates at the magazines. Since then, sales have remained several times as high as their usual levels.
But newsmagazines have also faced a financial squeeze as advertisers have pulled back from pitching products amid images of terror and war. "The advertising environment was bad and is now worse than bad," said Brian Duffy, editor of U.S. News & World Report.
After weeks of clamoring from Newsweek's advertising sales staff, Mr. Whitaker said, he decided this week to publish a significant feature article unrelated to the attacks for the first time since Sept. 11. That is something the magazine's competitors have not done. The article is a report on technology and education that was originally intended to run on the cover the Monday after the attacks; it will now appear in abbreviated form inside. "Some of the ads have stayed," Mr. Whitaker said. "A lot have gone away."
Each of the magazines has adopted its own strategy. For example, Newsweek has stressed in-depth features as long as 10,000 words, while Time has concentrated on shorter dispatches from many angles.
All the magazines have struggled to keep their distance from the events unfolding around them. "Covering the war in Afghanistan is difficult enough," said Mr. Duffy, of U.S. News, "but those difficulties pale in comparison with the difficulty of covering what is going on here."
On the Monday after the attacks, all three newsmagazines ran covers featuring flags, and Newsweek ran the striking headline "God Bless America." Mr. Whitaker acknowledged that some thought the headline unduly jingoistic but said he saw it differently. "One of the things we do is play back what is happening in the country," he said.
Still, James Kelly, managing editor of Time, said he would not have run it. "That would not be our style," he said. "It is incumbent on any editor to be sure the magazine doesn't become a rah-rah cheering section for the administration." 
Not that Time was much different. On its cover that week the letters of the magazine's name appeared in red, white and blue. "I'm not putting out The Nation magazine here," Mr. Kelly said. (The Nation, a left-leaning magazine, featured on its first cover after the attacks an article arguing for nuclear arms control.)
The next week, the country's attention turned to Osama bin Laden as the suspected terrorist behind the attacks, and the newsmagazines faced the question of how to depict him. The cover of U.S. News featured a photograph of Mr. bin Laden's face in a gun's cross hairs, and Newsweek altered Mr. bin Laden's photo to look like an infrared image.
Time, however, ran an undoctored close-up. "I was very concerned that our image of bin Laden be completely straightforward: this is what he looks like," Mr. Kelly said.
But putting Mr. bin Laden's face on Time's cover had unintended consequences. The next week, anti-American protesters in Pakistan and elsewhere turned Time's cover into posters that were carried at rallies and posted on walls.
As federal officials delicately began to raise the specter of new biological or chemical attacks within the United States, the newsmagazines faced a new question: how to cover the public's fears without aggravating them? Or, to put it another way, how to avoid fomenting more fear, thereby helping the terrorists? The question is especially thorny because journalists' instincts are to spell out the highest stakes and greatest risks for their readers, as Newsweek did in two covers this year about the slowing economy under these headlines: "Laid Off: Is Your Job Safe?" and "How Scared Should You Be?" 
Mr. Whitaker, however, defended the magazines' coverage of even speculative dangers. "One of the reasons that Sept. 11 happened was that no one imagined that the terrorists could do something so evil," he said. "It wasn't just a failure of intelligence -- it was a failure of imagination." In any event, he added, the magazines' first covers about bioterrorism proved to be prescient.
Still, before deciding on each of Newsweek's two biological terrorism covers, Mr. Whitaker said, "we were satisfied that there was enough panic out there that we could be a source of providing a little context and facts." 
The magazine initially considered illustrating a biological and chemical weapons article with a cover featuring a gas mask and a single word in capital letters: "Bioterror." But the headline was scrapped in favor of a less alarming one, returning for the second time this year to the question "How Scared Should You Be?"
All three newsmagazines simultaneously turned their attention to the cultural roots of Mr. bin Laden's attacks, devoting covers to Islamic radicalism. For Newsweek's cover, Mr. Whitaker said, he considered using a close-up photograph of an angry Arab shouting in protest, but rejected it. "I thought it was sort of predictable," he said. Instead, Newsweek ran an image of an Arab child holding a machine gun, while Time used the same image Mr. Whitaker had rejected. 
Asked about the image, Mr. Kelly, of Time, said he had deliberately picked a face that looked ordinary. "I thought this person, when he is not yelling, looks perfectly reasonable," he said.
On Friday, Mr. Whitaker said, he debated similar issues about stereotyping or demonizing Arabs in preparing Newsweek's cover about secret terrorist cells. The magazine prepared two alternative covers under the headline "The Terrorist Next Door," one with a clearly Middle Eastern face and the other with one more ethnically European. Mr. Whitaker noted that not all members of Mr. bin Laden's network were Arabs -- a few are radical European Muslims. In the end, the magazine fudged the question by treating the photograph of the Middle Eastern man to make it look more abstract, like an illustration.
When Mr. Whitaker woke up on Saturday morning and read the papers, he decided to scrap the "sleepers" cover after all to reflect the onset of a ground war in Afghanistan. "We want a news story that has legs for the next week," he said, "and it became clear overnight that this was ongoing, the raids were going to continue." The cover illustration depicts a Green Beret commando with a machine gun and the headline, "Special Ops: Can Our Commandos Finish the Job?" The magazine's answer is a limited yes, Mr. Whitaker said, pointing out that the troops cannot solve the problem of Afghanistan's future.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Schools Closest to Twin Towers Struggle for Continuity" (Education page, Oct. 17): As I looked outside my window on the morning of Sept. 11, watching events unfold and buildings collapse with frightening speed and proximity, I tried not to imagine the worst for my sisters, who are students at the High School for Leadership and Public Service. I later found out that they had lived through things too grim to detail here. 
 That afternoon, they returned like war-torn soldiers, armed with tales of dodging fiery debris and concrete rain as well as praise for all of the ordinary people who helped them along the way. They were lucky to come away unscathed. 
 Reading your article, I felt that they and the other students at Leadership and Public Service and the High School for Economics and Finance finally got some of the recognition that they need to keep going, still displaced and trying to pick up the pieces.

HEADLINE: Subsidies for Poor Proposed To Aid Argentine Economy 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Senior Argentine officials struggled today to avert a default on the nation's debt and to revive President Fernando de la Rua's political fortunes by putting the final touches on a new economic policy. 
 The new plan is intended to cut government spending sharply while increasing consumer spending and subsidies to the poor. It represents a fine-tuning, rather than a break with the government's previous policy to cut government deficits in an effort to bring down interest rates and to spur an economy that has been in recession for 40 months. 
 Since legislative elections last Sunday, in which the opposition Justicialist Party took control of both houses of Congress, Mr. de la Rua has been negotiating on several tracks simultaneously. He is trying to keep his Alianza coalition of center-left parties from breaking apart, to avert a direct collision with the opposition and to convince investors that the country will not default on debt or devalue its currency. 
The new economic plan is to be announced early this week, along with a reshuffling of the cabinet and an agreement with opposition governors on how to apportion more than $1 billion in disputed federal revenues to the provinces.
Officials say they hope that the combined weight of the changes will strengthen Mr. de la Rua's flagging presidency. During his two years in office, he has been buffeted by a Senate bribery scandal, the resignation of his vice president and his own frequent cabinet changes. His public approval ratings have dropped to single digits.
By cutting more than $600 million in government spending, officials said, the new economic program is devised to convince investors that the government is committed to balancing its budget next year and not to adding to the $132 billion public debt. But the plan also offers critics several new social initiatives for the poor and help for a shrinking middle class.
Poor families are expected to become eligible for subsidies ranging from $20 to $40 per month per child, and to receive $150 debit cards to increase their spending power. Consumers will pay 3 percent less in value added taxes when they pay by credit card, a measure intended to increase spending and to combat tax evasion. And rather than cut year-end bonuses for government employees, the government will pay them in installments over 12 months.
Another measure would allow the government to accept dollars as tax payments and to pay employees with dollars. Leaks of this policy in the local press were interpreted as a sign that Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, was studying the option of dropping the peso in favor of making the United States dollar Argentina's currency in case of a future financial emergency.
Fears of a debt default and devaluation here and on Wall Street have grown in recent days after reports that the government is pressuring local pension funds and banks to swap as much as $16 billion in government bonds for securities that pay lower interest rates. As consumption and manufacturing continued to slide, tax receipts were 14 percent lower last month than in the previous September.
In recent weeks, several prominent Wall Street analysts have argued that Argentina should convert its economy to dollars in order to reduce the perception that the country will eventually devalue its currency, thereby reducing interest rates as confidence increases.
In public statements in recent days, Mr. de la Rua has repeated his pledge never to devalue the peso but he has left the door open to a possible dollar conversion.
The economic plan has already been criticized by several prominent political leaders, who argue that the government needs to stimulate the economy by pumping up public spending and restructuring its foreign debt to reduce interest payments.
"I think we are on the brink of a nationwide social outburst," Gov. Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, a Justicialist leader from San Luis Province, said Saturday.
Several leaders of Mr. de la Rua's own Radical Party, which governs in alliance with the Frepaso social democratic party, have sharply criticized Mr. de la Rua and called on the president to fire Mr. Cavallo, the economy minister.
"We cannot keep giving the government blank checks," said Federico Storani, the Radical Party leader in Buenos Aires.
Former President Raul Alfonsin, who is a senator-elect and president of the Radical Party, said, "Cavallo's cycle is over," at a staged meeting last week with national labor leaders, who have already carried out six national strikes against Mr. de la Rua's policies and are threatening more general strikes.
The Radical Party caucus in the Chamber of Deputies has threatened to oppose any new austerity measures, while Justicialist members have warned that they may vote to rescind the special emergency powers the Congress gave to Mr. Cavallo this year.
Juan Pablo Cafiero, the social welfare minister, the last remaining member of Frepaso in the cabinet, resigned Saturday night in protest of budget cuts.
The virtual rebellion by the Radical and Frepaso Parties against the president they elected in 1999 has forced Mr. de la Rua to rely heavily on the opposition Justicialists to go along with his program in Congress.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Site in India Bombed In a Protest Over Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
A banned, far-left rebel group bombed a Coca-Cola plant in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh today. Its members left behind a note in the local Telugu language saying the attack was to protest the American bombing of Afghanistan and threatening more such actions. 
 The early morning attack heavily damaged the plant, but did not kill or injure anyone. A dozen or so members of the rebel group, the People's War Group, rode up to the plant by jeep and motorcycle and locked the night security guards in a room before entering the factory, according to a statement from Coca-Cola. 
 The bombing is likely to be a setback to efforts by the state's chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, to attract foreign investment to Andhra Pradesh, whose capital, Hyderabad, has become a center for India's high-technology business. 
The People's War Group had earlier issued a news release denouncing what it described as American terrorism and imperialism in Afghanistan and holding the United States responsible for capitalism in the world, J. Puranachandra Rao, the superintendent of police in Guntur district, said in a telephone interview tonight.
The People's War Group, which says that it is fighting to help poor peasants, has been making violent guerrilla attacks on the state government for years.
In its statement, Coca-Cola said it had called on the government to protect its plants and offices. It noted that all its 5,500 employees are Indian and that its operations "are all Indianized."
Irfan Khan, vice president for Coca-Cola India's corporate affairs, said the company had repeatedly been subjected to extortionate demands and threatened with attacks. "In the past, we never succumbed to these pressures," he said, but added, "We are worried about the security and safety of our staff and plants."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HEALTH; 
Officials Fear Tuberculosis Epidemic in Camps

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Even as aid workers struggle to provide enough food to countless Afghans displaced by war, drought and Taliban repression, health officials say they are increasingly concerned that both Afghanistan and Pakistan face another threat: a potential epidemic of tuberculosis.
 Pakistan and Afghanistan already have high incidence of tuberculosis, with more than 350,000 people developing the disease each year. Now, the crowded refugee camps threaten to become a mass incubator of the disease, creating a health crisis that could last for years after the fighting stops, World Health Organization officials said last week. 
 "You put people in compressed spaces in a time of great stress -- that kind of situation we fear can lead to a major epidemic," said Mario Raviglione, who supervises tuberculosis programs for the health organization. "We're going to be dealing with this for a long time unless we do something about it now."
The health organization, the World Bank, several United Nations agencies and more than a dozen nations seeking to fight tuberculosis outbreaks plan to meet in Washington this week to discuss a strategy to fight the disease around the world. The crisis in Afghanistan will be high on the agenda, Mr. Raviglione said.
Twenty-two nations, including the world's two most populous, China and India, are considered to have serious problems with tuberculosis, even though the disease is both preventable and highly treatable with proper medical care.
Worldwide, cases have soared in recent years, with some 8.7 million people developing the disease last year. About two million people died of tuberculosis last year, almost all of them in poor nations, where most people do not receive vaccinations and the sanitary conditions are not good. 
A grouping of some 120 public and private groups devoted to fighting the disease has raised about half of the $9.3 billion that its members say would be required to wipe out the disease over the next five years. Aside from official sources, some private charities and individuals, including George Soros, the financier, have made tuberculosis a major focus of their philanthropy.
The problem had become so acute in Afghanistan that the health organization raised money to treat victims there despite the difficulty of administering aid under the Taliban, Mr. Raviglione said. The program had been expected to begin last month, but was disrupted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and the allied response.
That effort is now focused on refugee camps, but health officials said the money they had raised -- just over $1 million -- is proving inadequate.
"To say that are resources are short in this area is a great understatement," Mr. Raviglione said.

HEADLINE: Dust Settles And Retailer Is Set to Face The Crisis; 
30-Year-Old J&R Music Fears for Future Sales

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Here comes Jason Friedman, flying in from Southern California with just one-eighth of a master's degree. The family business needs him early, he has decided.
 The six storefronts of J&R Music and Computer World, the company his parents built into an economic anchor and landmark on Park Row in Lower Manhattan, have been shut since Sept. 11. On the day of the World Trade Center attack, a thick cloud of hot, black soot blew through the doors and settled inside the DVD players and computer hard drives. Rescue workers also smashed some doors, to set up a triage center that got little use. 
 So Mr. Friedman left the University of Southern California and moved right back into the TriBeCa building where he lived before. (There were lots of suddenly open apartments there.) 
His immediate mission is to help his parents in the reopening, scheduled for today, of J&R's only substantial retail location -- just a few blocks from ground zero.
"The whole reason I went for an M.B.A. in the first place was to better this business," Mr. Friedman said. "It seems silly to be out there when this business is facing the worst crisis ever."
Since he was a child, Mr. Friedman, 27, has planned to work for, and then inherit, the business that his parents, Joe and Rachelle Friedman, started with their wedding money in 1971.
Once upon a time, the biggest threat to this plan was the arrival of that crazy guy, Crazy Eddie, right in the neighborhood. Now all of downtown Manhattan is in bad shape, and J&R's problems are not the worst. But the strength of dominance on this block has become the weakness of being tethered to this block, and the survival of this outsized mom-and-pop shop in view of the World Trade Center wreckage will offer one gauge of Manhattan's ability to recover.
Among downtown business owners, Jason's mother and father have been pretty lucky. None of their 650 employees were killed. The buildings, which they own, are standing. The sealed compact discs and software packages seem in good shape.
And today, after throwing out electronics worth tens of millions of dollars, replacing about 3,000 square feet of carpet, slathering new paint on most walls, sucking the ash out of five escalators, cleaning credit card terminals and cash registers, revamping the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, and screwing in dozens of new light bulbs, the Friedmans have accomplished several things. While the air outside smells like Coke cans on fire, the record store smells like a record store. And as of today, all of J&R is open for business.
Inside, a bright new old-style swamp-green adding machine sits on a counter. The futuristic signs for Apple and Hewlett-Packard shine. The Jennifer Lopez poster is on the wall where it belongs. And not a single worker has been laid off, not in 30 years and not in the last six weeks.
"We had a reputation that we never fired anybody unless they got caught stealing," Mrs. Friedman said. Now, looking forward with a little apprehension, she said, "We're going to look at it once we do open and see how much business does come back."
The family has run this business in the same spot all this time, growing by seeping down the block rather than by opening stores in new locations. All 300,000 square feet of retailing space are less than a quarter- mile from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. There is also a small satellite store at Columbia University, but catalog and Internet sales from a warehouse in Queens have helped keep the business running since the attack.
Mrs. Friedman, president of the privately held company, says total annual revenues are a little more than $300 million, and that the business has been profitable, but she will not say what portion of the money comes from Internet and catalog sales. 
Among electronics retailers, J&R generates the largest amount of revenues in New York City, according to Aaron Neretin, president of Neretin Associates, a retail industry research firm in Maplewood, N.J. The company probably ranks 10th or 12th in revenues among consumer electronics retailers nationwide, including companies like Best Buy, which generated more than $17 billion in revenues last year, he said. 
Mr. Neretin said he estimated J&R's catalog and Internet sales generated about 20 percent of revenues last year. The stores generate the most business because "people like to go there, because they can get advice," he said.
Mrs. Friedman said that if the customers do not come back quickly, the company could be helped by its ownership of the buildings, because some can be sold, rented or used as collateral for borrowing.
The building at 23 Park Row was appraised at $7.3 million, according to public records, but that was before the attack.
The family could get some help from its close ties to the music business, said Mrs. Friedman, whose unflinchingly Barbie-pink office is littered with the framed compact discs that record companies now hand out to acknowledge what they once called gold records. Lenders and vendors have been lenient, and some insurance payments still are expected, she said.
Still, the employees in Queens seem to know that their jobs could vanish if the Manhattan stores do.
"We won't know until we open those stores and see how many people come through the door," said David Jeter, a telephone sales associate who worked in the retail stores until last year. He has recently taken orders from customers who said they were buying stuff from J&R as an act of charity.
Even the competition sympathizes. "They're coming back to a neighborhood that's not there," said Gary H. Richard, president of P. C. Richard & Son, the big chain with two Manhattan locations, at Union Square and on 86th Street. "The location was a prime spot. I don't know if it's a prime spot right now."
So the Friedmans hope the customers will return for the service. They will remember, Mrs. Friedman said, that when John Lennon was killed 23 days after the release of "Double Fantasy," his first album in five years, she had 3,000 copies in stock. They will recall, Mrs. Friedman believes, that she did not raise the price to $5.99; she sold them all at the original new-release sale price of $2.99. "Our customers remember that, and they keep coming back," she said.
But Jason Friedman does not expect a crowd of shoppers today, at least not right away. For one thing, there is the smell. For another thing, there are traffic and transit restrictions. Beyond that, the retail climate in New York has been shaky since the attack, with locations closer to ground zero suffering more. 
On the positive side, there are people in the streets, especially near J&R, where sightseers gather for a sobering look at the nearby wreckage. On the down side, many people outside are wearing face masks, or they are police officers, or they are both.
"Specials and good prices will hopefully make people forget that they're a block and a half away from a terrorist site," Jason Friedman said. After all, people decide every day which places feel safe, which risks are worth taking. Mr. Friedman, who lives and works downtown, has his own rationalizations to get him through the day.
"I wouldn't shop next to the Empire State Building, personally," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about J&R Music and Computer World, which has reopened after cleaning up damage caused by the attack on the nearby World Trade Center, included an outdated reference to the company's layoff policy. On Oct. 18, after an owner discussed the business in an interview but before the article appeared, 48 people were indeed laid off, J&R's first such action.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Displays at J&R Music and Computer World were restocked and office systems were cleaned in anticipation of reopening today on Park Row, six weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center shattered the neighborhood. The business has never had a layoff, said Rachelle Friedman, left, who began it 30 years ago with her husband, Joe. Now she worries whether sales will recover.

HEADLINE: Kuala Lumpur Journal; 
On Muslim Soil, a Lesser Fear of Great Heights

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Jan Schouten peered down from the sky-bridge at the Petronas Towers, 557 feet above the street. The view from part-way up the world's tallest buildings was dazzling -- a magic-carpet ride over the Moorish domes and minarets of this Southeast Asian city.
 But Mr. Schouten's thoughts were on the other twin towers. 
 "I was going to take my wife to New York next year to see the World Trade Center," he said, riding an elevator back down. "I was booking the tickets a week before it happened. I still can't believe they're gone."
Mr. Schouten, a forklift operator from Delft, in the Netherlands, adores tall buildings. He seeks them out in every city he visits, recites obscure facts about their design and holds forth on their engineering marvels.
On this morning, Mr. Schouten mused about the fragility of these late-20th-century monuments. Surely, he said, the Petronas Towers, built 24 years after the World Trade Center with the latest in high-performance steel and concrete, could withstand the impact of a commercial airplane.
A knot of tourists stood awkwardly in the elevator, waiting to reach the ground floor. Nobody answered.
At 1,483 feet, the Petronas Towers have been recognized as the world's tallest since 1998, when they squeaked past the Sears Tower by 33 feet. Their completion represented a coming of age for Malaysia, a little country that loves superlatives (Kuala Lumpur also has the world's tallest flagpole).
These days, though, tallest is not a superlative to be coveted.
"We're not giving any interviews because we don't want to turn the towers into a target," said Yasmin Abdullah, a spokeswoman for Kuala Lumpur City Center Holdings, which owns the $1.6 billion complex.
Twelve hours after the World Trade Center attack, the Petronas Towers were evacuated for the first time, because of a bomb threat. While it turned out to be a hoax, the buildings' owners have not taken any chances, installing X-ray machines and metal detectors at every entrance.
The fact that a Muslim country is home to the world's tallest buildings is not lost on the people who work here. Many believe religion will prevent the towers from becoming a target.
"We have to be ready for anything, of course," said Abdullah Ali, 46, who works on the 25th floor for Petronas, the state oil company and the building's namesake tenant. "But our relationship with other countries is pretty good. We don't have much of a problem with terrorism in Malaysia."
Michael Teague, a British consultant who advises a subsidiary of Petronas, said: "I thought about this a lot after Sept. 11. This is an Islamic country; the people who are doing these acts are Islamic. I think there's absolutely no chance of anything like that happening here."
Still, Mr. Teague said several of his American colleagues had qualms about coming to work the week after the attacks. "I kept telling them I feel more safe here than I would in London," he said.
Among the handful of American tourists who visited the sky-bridge, there was a quiet defiance. "You can't allow your life to be dictated by fanatics," said Len Salamon, 59, a civil engineer from Los Angeles.
While skyscrapers were pioneered in the United States, Malaysia was determined to put an Islamic imprint on the form. Cesar Pelli, the American architect chosen by the government to design the towers, said he based them on an eight-point star, a basic motif in Islamic art.
It did not hurt that the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sent him a sketch of an eight-point star as a suggestion. Mr. Pelli softened the design by adding scalloped facades between the points. The slender shape and arabesque style of the towers is meant to echo Kuala Lumpur's mosques.
Critics say the project has not conveyed the message its creators intended. It opened just as the Asian financial crisis devastated Malaysia's economy, making the country's high ambitions look a bit like hubris.
Yet the fetish for tall buildings persists in Asia. Half a dozen projects on the scale of the Petronas Towers are under construction or in blueprints here. Shanghai is building a 94-story tower in its Pudong financial district, while Taiwan plans two towers of more than 100 floors.
In Hong Kong, an 88-floor monolith is rising on one side of Victoria Harbor, while a 102-story counterpart is planned for the other side. The project's champions say the towers will form a gateway to Asia's most famous harbor; critics envision Scylla and Charybdis in steel and concrete.
"Building a tall skyscraper is one of the best ways for an emerging society to prove it has arrived, because not everybody can do it," Mr. Pelli said from his office in New Haven, Conn. "It takes money, political stability, and an economy big enough to fill the building when it's finished.
"Bangladesh could not build a Petronas Towers. They may someday if they get their act together. But not today," he said.
Malaysia has its act together. But it has been unsettled lately by a debate over how to respond to the American-led military strikes on Afghanistan. Islamic militant groups have called for a holy war against the United States, while the secular government contends that Muslim militants are a threat here.
Prime Minister Mahathir, a moderate, has endorsed the campaign against terrorism. In a gesture to his Muslim majority, however, he has condemned the war as a futile exercise that is killing innocent civilians.
The tug of war between moderation and extremism is evident in the Petronas Towers themselves. Someone has scribbled "long live Osama bin Laden" on the wall of the one of its gleaming elevators.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES; 
Job Seekers Flood Spy Agencies

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The nation's intelligence agencies have experienced a surge in job seekers since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, a boom born of lofty patriotism and cold economic realities, recruiters say. 
 Resumes are pouring in to the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency at a rate four to six times as high as before the attacks. 
 The applicants range from freshly minted Ph.D.'s in chemical engineering to retired military personnel with foreign-language skills to laid-off high-tech workers eager to join the war on terrorism. 
Agency officials say applicants are expressing a desire to help the nation at a time of need. But in the weakening economy, many applicants are also seeking refuge in government jobs. 
The overall quality of applicants is good, officials say, and some may fill shortages in the badly depleted ranks of Middle Eastern and Central Asian regional and linguistic experts, as well as technical areas like satellite reconnaissance analysis. 
"A lot of patriotic citizens are coming forward wanting to serve, but the economy has also had a bearing on the number of applicants," said Frederick G. Wong, a retired one-star Army general who is chief of human resources for the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
Congress has already pressed to lift restrictions on the hiring of unsavory foreign agents. But most job seekers sending resumes over the transom are not budding spies. And they appear unswayed by criticisms that the terrorist attacks amount to the worst intelligence lapse since Pearl Harbor. 
Before the attacks, the C.I.A. received 500 to 600 job applications a week. The agency is now receiving that many each day, with a peak of nearly 1,100 on Sept. 17, officials said. About 20 percent of the applicants are strong enough on paper to warrant a follow-up phone call, the officials said. Of that 20 percent, about half will probably get a face-to-face interview.
These percentages are roughly the same as before Sept. 11.
"There are always wackos who apply, but we're definitely seeing qualified candidates," said Anya Guilsher, a C.I.A. spokeswoman. 
The intelligence agencies are receiving most cover letters and resumes online, like this one that the C.I.A. shared on the condition that the applicant's name not be revealed: 
"The recent tragedies of Sept. 11 could be prevented if America had stronger intelligence," wrote an Iraqi-born New Yorker who recently applied, listing his fluency in Arabic and English, and his proficiency in computer science and information technology, as qualifications. 
Last Tuesday, the agency posted on its Web site (www.cia.gov) new job listings for linguists fluent in Arabic, Dari and Pashto, languages spoken in and around Afghanistan. Starting salaries for these and other entry-level positions range from $35,000 to $50,000. 
At a career fair on Oct. 12 at Yale University, students stood 10 deep at the C.I.A.'s booth, Ms. Guilsher said. Hundreds of candidates with doctorates in physics, biochemistry and public health, as well as master's degrees in engineering and various foreign languages, left their resumes with recruiters. 
At the Defense Intelligence Agency, which employs 7,000 people and provides intelligence to the military, applications have nearly quadrupled from the pre-Sept. 11 rate of 125 to 200 a month.
About 30 percent of the applicants are fresh out of college and the remainder are from both the public and private sectors, General Wong said. 
Many applicants are former military personnel, including defense attaches at United States embassies in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries.
More than two dozen retired D.I.A. specialists are being recalled. In a sign of the urgent need to bring new experts on board, the defense agency has been able to reduce the time needed to conduct security clearances and background checks on candidates to 55 days from four to six months. 
Even the National Security Agency, once so secretive that officials jokingly said its initials stood for No Such Agency, has benefited from the outpouring of people interested in shoring up the nation's security and securing a challenging job. 
Since Sept. 11, the N.S.A. has received more than 12,000 resumes. In the same period a year ago, agency officials said, it received about 2,200 applications. The agency, which has 15,000 employees, last year hired about 600 people. 
"There are still some students who don't know about us, who confuse us with NASA, but interest is very high," Ken Acosta, the N.S.A.'s college relations manager, said at a recruiting session at Howard University here last week. 
The N.S.A., which is the nation's premier maker and breaker of codes, expects to bring back as many as 100 retired employees, including analysts, linguists and security officials. The agency, which has its headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., is offering $10,000 signing bonuses to qualified computer scientists and engineers. 
Applicants to all the intelligence agencies must be American citizens at least 18 years old. 
The upswing in applications coincides with revamped recruiting efforts at the intelligence agencies. Three years ago, the C.I.A. beefed up its Internet site and rolled out a new advertising slogan appearing in newspapers and magazines: "Quite possibly, the most demanding job in the world." 
The Defense Intelligence Agency, under its new director, Vice Adm. Thomas Wilson, increased its advertising budget for recruiting to nearly $400,000 this year from $86,000 a year ago.
"If I go to John Doe in Manhattan, Kan., they have no clue about the D.I.A.," General Wong said. "We don't have that name recognition." 
Resumes are not the only encouraging missives arriving in the mail. The C.I.A. has received a handful of checks, said an agency spokesman, Bill Harlow.
One anonymous benefactor sent his $600 tax rebate check with a simple message: "Put it toward the cause."

 Hammering the Taliban

MORE STRIKES -- American warplanes carried out their first substantial attack on the Taliban's front-line troops north of Kabul as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell indicated that the United States would like the opposition Northern Alliance to advance toward Kabul, the Afghan capital. The raids and Secretary Powell's virtual invitation to the Northern Alliance to surround Kabul suggest a growing urgency in Washington about the military operation. A1

WITH THE REBELS -- The Northern Alliance exulted in the United States raid on the Taliban's front-lines, celebrating that they were now free to advance toward the Afghan capital and decide their own fate. But their jubilation may be short-lived. Even with the American bombing, there are serious questions about what headway the alliance can make. A1

Other Viewpoints

FORMER ALLIES -- Uzbek men who fought alongside Afghan guerrillas when Uzbekistan was part of the Soviet Union have dark memories of savagery and betrayal. While most predict that the American campaign will eventually prevail, they also expressed powerful misgivings. B1

THE BALKANS -- American military commanders in Europe do not want the Pentagon to reduce its peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, though many officials expect the Bush administration to do so. B3

IN KASHMIR -- Tensions between India and Pakistan are heating up at the worst possible time for the United States and its war on terror. A10

PROTEST ATTACK -- A rebel group that is banned in India bombed a Coca-Cola plant in protest of the American bombing of Afghanistan. A10

THE PETRONAS TOWERS -- Many people in Malaysia, a Muslim country, believe that religion will prevent the world's tallest buildings from becoming a target. A4

THE NEWS MEDIA -- Severely restricted in their ability to cover American military action in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, reporters and editors have been both frustrated and careful about expressing that frustration publicly in recent days. B3

SHARING RESOURCES -- CNN has entered an agreement with Al Jazeera, the Arab-language news network, to share a satellite dish that promises to deliver the first clear pictures from Kandahar, the Afghan city. C2

The Longer Perspective

THE REFUGEES -- The stories of the lucky few who escape Afghanistan provide a vivid human counterpoint to the grainy Pentagon videotapes of bomb blasts and paratroopers. B1

ANALYZING THE MOVEMENT -- Across the Islamic world, a litany of historical grievances against the West is being aired. But what has not emerged, experts say, is any clear vision of the world these militants want to create. B4

AFTER THE TALIBAN -- The American bombing of Taliban front-line defenses appeared designed not only to put pressure on the Islamic extremists who rule most of Afghanistan but also on their traditional backers in Pakistan, diplomats said. B3

The Pulse of Pakistan

A DIFFERENT VIEW -- The American campaign to capture or kill Osama bin Laden has elevated his stature among many Pakistanis, who now regard him as a hero. B5

TUBERCULOSIS FEARS -- Health officials are increasingly concerned that both Afghanistan and Pakistan face another threat beyond war, drought and Taliban repression: a potential epidemic of tuberculosis. B5

INTELLIGENCE FINDING -- President Bush has issued new orders to the C.I.A. spelling out a wider and more intense effort to eliminate Osama bin Laden as the leader of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, administration officials said. B5

BIN LADEN -- Lawyers are beginning to ask the next question: What do we do if we catch him? B5

Fields of Poppies

BANNING OPIUM -- A successful government ban on the growing of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which had been by far the biggest source of opium in the world, has begun to unravel, officials say. B1

LONDON FIGHTS HOAXES -- Saying its police, medical and post office services were being overwhelmed by anthrax hoaxes, Britain adopted an emergency law that punishes violators with jail terms of up to seven years. B6

Insurers and Investigators

ON CAPITOL HILL -- After a month of consensus that Congress should do nothing to demoralize the nation's intelligence agencies or distract them from preventing terror attacks, crucial lawmakers now say that an investigation into why the Sept. 11 attacks were not forecast or prevented is inevitable. A1

NEW RULES -- In response to the hijackings, the Federal Aviation Administration has overhauled the way air traffic controllers respond when planes change course or lose communications with the ground. A16

TIGHTENING SECURITY -- Much has changed at one California airport since the terror attacks, says a man who screens passengers there. A16

APPLICANTS LINE UP -- The nation's intelligence agencies have experienced a surge in job seekers since the terror attacks, a boom recruiters say is borne out of lofty patriotism and cold economic realities. B7

INSURERS SEEK HELP -- The insurance industry is lobbying the administration for a promise of assistance should there be more terror attacks. If successful, it could be one of the costliest bailouts in United States history. B7

The Anthrax Threat

ANOTHER CASE -- A worker at the Washington post office that handles all mail delivered to the capital was infected with a dangerous form of anthrax, health officials said. The diagnosis comes a day after anthrax bacteria was also detected in a building that processes mail for the House of Representatives. A1

SENDING HELP -- With New York City's ability to test for anthrax stretched to its limit, the United States Department of Defense has dispatched a team of specialists to assist city health officials. B8

UNDER SIEGE -- A mix of anxiety and sadness has overcome West Trenton, the New Jersey community at the center of the nation's anthrax scare, after a letter carrier tested positive for the infection. B8

The Specter of Smallpox

PREPARATIONS -- The Bush administration's decision to expand the stockpile of smallpox vaccine illustrates just how concerned officials have become about the nation's preparedness for a bioterrorism attack. A1

SIDE EFFECTS -- As the government negotiates to procure enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every American, officials say a separate effort is under way to obtain large quantities of the scarce medicine to treat people with adverse reactions to the vaccine. B9

HEALTH RISKS -- Health experts are warning that steps being taken in response to bioterrorism threats carry health risks that may far exceed their benefits. B9

Questions of Faith

MUSLIM-JEWISH RELATIONS -- A bitter gulf has opened between many Jewish and Muslim leaders in the United States over the nature of terrorism and the role played by Israeli policies in fomenting Muslim anger against America. B10

CONVERTS TO ISLAM -- Thousands of Muslim converts are struggling with challenges to their newfound faith amid anti-Muslim fervor and declarations of an Islamic holy war. B10

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HISTORY; 
Feverish Protests Against the West Trace to Grievances Ancient and Modern

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
From the eerily passionless voice of Osama bin Laden to the fevered chants on the streets of the Middle East and across the Islamic world, a litany of historical grievances against the West is being aired.
 What has not emerged over the weeks since the attacks on the United States or in the years before Sept. 11, experts say, is any clear vision of the world these militants want to create -- and exactly for whose interests. Western scholars of Muslim societies from the Mediterranean to Asia have begun analyzing the aims and claims of the movement. They find some of the historic grievances hollow, and aims carrying prescriptions that would be destructive. 
 Changes in Western policy, though not to be ruled out completely, would not necessarily resolve the disputes, they conclude, also pointing out that the complaints come without calls for political reform, and with no hint of how to make life economically better. 
Still, the scholars acknowledge, extremism in the name of Islam clearly touches a deep chord with large numbers of people in Islamic countries disenchanted with the way their nations are developing. 
At the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan, congressionally financed research organization in Washington, Jon Alterman, an expert on the Middle East and the impact of the media there, calls the bin Laden message nihilistic. Mr. Alterman has studied the recruiting tape made by Mr. bin Laden that began circulating widely in the summer, and was struck by its arid austerity.
"There's no greenery anywhere," he says of the harsh Afghan setting. "The only women are covered by moving black dots across the screen, so you can't see their faces. There's lots of condemnation of Saudi Arabia being lost to materialism and turning away from the word of God. There's criticism of colluding with the enemies of Islam." 
Egypt and the Palestinians and even Iraq come in for attack for not being sufficiently fervent in the campaign against materialism and Western values. 
"So what do you do with that?" Mr. Alterman asked in an interview. "The image that's presented is of 18-year-olds in masks running around some low-rent training camp with guns. I don't find that a vision."
"What are they going to do to change the politics in their own countries?" he said. "It's easy to sit back and say it's the Americans' fault. I watched it and I found it a deeply depressing image of what life should be like."
Experts also find Mr. bin Laden's Afghan backdrop incongruous. His grievances and his causes are not those of the Afghans, on whose crippled country he has brought the further destruction of a high-tech war.
Ted Eliot, who was American ambassador to Afghanistan from 1973 to 1978 -- between the overthrow of the monarchy under Mohammad Zahir Shah and a pro-Communist coup -- says that Mr. bin Laden's appeal seems ill-suited to Afghans.
"First of all, Afghans are not Arabs," Mr. Eliot said in an interview. "The Afghans were also never anybody's colony. They fought off the British quite successfully in the 19th century, and they fought off the Russians in the 20th century. They've always been very proud of their independence and very proud of their culture. They've never harbored this kind of grievance against the Western world that Osama bin Laden is playing on."
Nor is his anti-Western message likely to mean much to Muslims across Asia, Mr. Eliot said. "If you go into northwest China, into Xinjiang and the Uighur country, you'll find tremendous resentment against what is considered Han Chinese imperialism. If you go up into the former Soviet states of Central Asia, you'll find a lot of resentment is against Russian overlordship." 
John Bresnan, a scholar of Indonesia at Columbia University's East Asia Institute and the author of the "Managing Indonesia," published by Columbia University Press, said in an interview, "The ordinary Muslim in Southeast Asia is as far away from the events of Sept. 11 as you and I." 
In Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country by population but one that has never adopted Islam as a national religion, a history of Hindu and Buddhist influences and strong local cultures have sometimes fed resentment against those who would want to "Arabize" their religion or even the architecture of their unique mosques.
Indonesians, Mr. Bresnan said, did not begin to go on pilgrimages to Mecca until the 19th century. Some came back convinced that they had to cleanse Indonesian Islam of outside influences, but they remain only one school. Other traditions still rich in pan-Asian elements are strong.
"Against the movements of people like bin Laden, all of these people are moderates," Mr. Bresnan said. 
The danger he sees is that the latest hostilities will reactivate "a layer of anti-Americanism just below the surface," one that has nothing intrinsic to do with religion. Large protests have already begun. Anger at the West is deep-seated in Indonesia, where a long economic crisis and political instability have cut into livelihoods, and many people blame the United States for disastrous advice they believe Indonesia received from the International Monetary Fund.
Supporters of Mr. bin Laden and some neutral experts trying to explain his appeal have rooted it to Muslim grievances in history. Some reach back a millennium into Christian crusades into Arab homelands. Others look to the 20th century meddling by Europeans in the Middle East that began with the collapse of the Ottoman Turkish empire after World War I, when the British installed pliant kings on regional thrones.
The creation of Israel, the British-French seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956 -- against American opposition -- and the fruitless battle for a Palestinian state added to discontent. Then came the war to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait in 1991, and the punishing sanctions that followed over the next decade.
Some experts minimize this historical sweep as meaningless to Mr. bin Laden's goals. Mr. Alterman called it "window dressing."
"What has he done for the Palestinians?" he asked. "Nothing. What has he done for the children of Iraq? Nothing."
Phebe Marr, a leading expert on Iraq, also discounts too much attention to the distant past. "Most people are shaped not by the long sweep of history but by what they are taught in school, their own experiences in life and intellectual influences such as the media," she said in an exchange of e-mail messages from Qatar, where she is working on a book. "Most activists are shaped by the immediate past."
"I would be careful to separate long-term historical trends or events which presumably create a clash of civilizations -- just the impression bin Laden wants to foster -- from short-term events which we can all remember and which can be addressed through policy," she said. "This would include the Arab-Israeli issue and sanctions on Iraq. Bin Laden has been careful to concentrate on grievances."
At Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, Lisa Anderson, the dean and an expert on Algeria, agrees that American policies play a role in public opinion. Echoing Mr. Bresnan on Indonesia, she said that in Islamic societies, including in North Africa, there are conflicting attitudes toward the United States. 
On one hand, people are attracted to American life -- anathema to Mr. bin Laden's brand of rejectionist Islam -- but they are also anxious about their own futures. "What happens," she said, "is that specific missteps by the United States end up being the hooks on which you can hang this profound ambivalence." 
In that environment, Mr. Alterman said, Mr. bin Laden's message can sound reasonable. "It's a very defensive message and it's delivered with a remarkably soft voice," he said. In contrast to the strident voices of others also on the tape, "he speaks with a sort of resignation in his voice: 'We have to defend ourselves; this is only what our Scriptures tell us.' "
"There's some power in the understated delivery," he said, "which in a way makes the outrageousness of much of his message easier to take because you don't feel you are listening to the rantings of a lunatic."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MOOD; 
Support for bin Laden Is Still High in Pakistan

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Glossy posters of Osama bin Laden atop a white stallion or brandishing a Kalashnikov are selling as fast as they are printed in Quetta's chaotic bazaar. Osama T-shirts and chocolates wrapped in his bearded face are popular, too.
 Support for Mr. bin Laden and sympathy for ordinary Afghans being subjected to withering American bombing remain high in Pakistan, particularly here in the border region, which is dominated by tribal loyalties and religious firebrands. 
 Many people who knew little or nothing of the most wanted man in the world before Sept. 11 now regard him as a hero, not because of the attacks on the United States, but because the huge campaign to capture or kill him has elevated his stature. 
"My 9-year-old niece asked me the other day, 'Who is Osama that he is so important?' " said Farkanda Mir, a literature professor and human rights advocate in Quetta. "This has given him a greater importance than he could have gained in 50 years."
After two weeks of American bombing of Afghanistan, with raids by Special Operations commandos into the Taliban heartland grabbing headlines nationwide, Pakistan is a country on the edge -- with the forces that could push it over rapidly accumulating. 
Outwardly, the country seems relatively calm. Protests in the last week have been smaller and less violent than before. At a forum of business and political leaders here in Quetta on Thursday, there was strong support for the alliance with the United States and the effort to oust the Taliban. The reports of American Special Forces raids in Afghanistan did not inspire any immediate fury, because they were understood as unlikely to add to civilian deaths.
Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, continues to say there is popular support for his pact with the United States. But the police and paramilitary forces remain on high alert, and nerves are frayed.
The discovery of a bomb in a passenger lounge at Islamabad's airport today sent a shudder of fear around the country that the Qaeda network had exported its terrorism next door.
People from all walks of life share a deep anxiety about what the war will mean to them in the coming days and in the more distant future. They are worried that floods of Afghan refugees will overwhelm Pakistan's weak economy. They also are concerned that the rising toll of civilian casualties in Afghanistan will make it hard to contain the anger of Afghan refugees and fundamentalist Muslims on this side of the border. 
"Only the criminals should be punished, not the innocent people," Yaqoob Shah, an official with the government tourism agency, said in his office, a bank burned and looted by anti-American protesters on Oct. 8, the day after the start of bombing. "History cannot forgive us for this killing of innocent people, and people here may not accept it much longer."
During the first week of American airstrikes, Quetta was a stick of dynamite with the fuse burning. Thousands of protesters rampaged through the streets, shouting anti-American slogans, smashing windows and torching shops and cinemas. Five people were killed by the police here and in a nearby village, and businesses were closed for days. 
But the protest after Friday Prayers this week drew fewer than 1,000 people, and the volume of the shouts was many decibels lower, as it was at protests elsewhere across Pakistan. 
The bazaar in Quetta seems to have returned to normal. On Saturday, women ventured into the streets for the first time in days to buy vegetables and bread, and men chatted about weather and sports.
Mr. bin Laden has even been good for business in some shops. Muhammad Akram, who runs a magazine stand, said he was selling 500 posters a day of Mr. bin Laden and could sell more if he could get them.
Behind the sale of such trinkets and the facade of normalcy, there are fears. "It is O.K. now, but I am sure there will be more demonstrations, and most people are still afraid to come out and buy things," said Bismillah Khilji, 18, a clerk in a blanket shop, in a view echoed by several other shopkeepers.
A more significant economic threat is the possible influx of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees. The United Nations said that 3,500 Afghans crossed the border at Chaman, 60 miles from Quetta, on Friday and that more were fleeing heavy attacks on Kandahar.
Pakistan is already home to three million Afghan refugees. More will mean new strains on the economy, so the government has resisted allowing the United Nations to provide food and shelter for new arrivals.
Mr. Shah, the tourism official, said a woman and her three young children came to his door in the village where he lives two days ago. They had come from Afghanistan and had not eaten for three days.
"This is a big problem, and not too long from now, the snow will fall and the roads will be blocked," he said. "These are innocent people who do not know even where America is."
It is hard for Pakistanis to envision a positive outcome to this war. They worry that a new government in Afghanistan might be hostile to Pakistan, leaving the country facing enemies on two borders. And they fear that Mr. bin Laden, dead or alive, will represent a continuing threat to stability in the region and the world.
"If he is killed, he becomes Osama bin Martyr, and if he is put in jail, it will create a thousand new followers to carry out acts on his behalf," Ramazan Khan, a currency trader, said as he counted a stack of $100 bills two inches high. "Either way he wins."

HEADLINE: Bush and Putin: Accord on Terrorism 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the joint news conference in Shanghai yesterday by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as provided by the White House:

PRESIDENT PUTIN
 The consequences of the tragic events of Sept. 11 -- political, economic, psychological consequences -- today are acutely felt in many countries and in all the continents. I think nobody has doubts the unprecedented carnage of the terrorists requires our united efforts, unification of the efforts of international community to fight terrorism. And we prepared and we issued a joint statement in this regard. 
 We analyzed in detail the developments of the Russia-U.S. dialogue on strategic stability issue. As you remember, during Genoa meeting, there was an agreement to reach about joint work on strategic offensive and defensive weapons, which are interrelated. And in our assessment, we made progress here.
First of all, it relates to Start issue. We reaffirmed our mutual intention to reduce strategic offensive weapons. And now our task is to develop parameters of such reductions and to design a reliable and verifiable method to reduce nuclear arsenals of Russia and United States.
As for the ABM-related issues, we also made some progress -- at least, I believe we do have understanding that we can reach agreements, taking into account national interests of Russia, United States, and taking into account the necessity to strengthen international stability in this very important area. . . .

PRESIDENT BUSH
It is clear that President Putin understands the magnitude of the terrorist threat. It is clear there's a lot the United States and Russia can do together to defeat terrorism. The challenges and goals we share provide an opportunity to rethink and renew a broader relationship.
Both our nations are working to prevent proliferation and to reduce the threat from cold war weapon stockpiles throughout the former Soviet Union.
We also see progress in our efforts to build a new strategic framework. Today we discussed significantly lowering offensive nuclear weapon arsenals, within a framework that includes limited defenses, defenses that are able to protect both our lands from political blackmail, from potential terrorist attack. Both our nations must be able to defend ourselves against the new threats of the 21st century, including long-range ballistic missiles.
The events of September the 11th make it clearer than ever that a cold war ABM treaty that prevents us from defending our people is outdated, and I believe dangerous. Economic cooperation and progress will be an important part of our new relationship. With the right incentives and a firm commitment to rule of law, there is no question in my mind a new class of entrepreneurs can grow and flourish in Russia. And there's no question in my mind that American businesses and American investment can foster that trend. . . .

Q. Sir, your communique did not mention the war in Afghanistan, and several leaders at this meeting have urged America to end the conflict quickly. What do you intend to do to cure this queasiness about your military initiative? And to President Putin, do you agree with President Bush that the ABM, post-Sept. 11, is dangerous to the world? . . .

MR. BUSH -- I think I listened to probably three or four hours of discussions about our campaign against terrorism. And there was a very strong support for our activities -- strong support for sharing intelligence, strong support for the diplomatic front we're waging, strong support to disrupt the financial operations of the terrorists, and strong support for our military operations in Afghanistan.
The people who came to this conference came because they wanted to show the world that they were not afraid of terrorists. They weren't going to let terrorists disrupt an important meeting. They also came to stand with solidarity with the United States. . . . 

MR. PUTIN -- I would like to tell a couple of words about the first question. First of all, I fully agree with the position of President Bush, and I believe that his action was measured and adequate to the threat that the United States was confronted with.
It's first. Second, and it is very important for everybody to know, if we started fighting terrorism, it should be completed, because otherwise, terrorists might have an impression that they are not vulnerable. And in that case, their actions would be more dangerous, more insolent, and would result in worse consequences.
As for the ABM Treaty of 1972, our position is well known, and I can reproduce it once again. We believe it is an important element of stability in the world. But we agree, and I said it several times, that we should think about the future. . . . 

Q. Did you tell Mr. Putin that you would begin the process of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty by the end of the year? And did you give him a figure on missile cuts?

MR. BUSH -- Let's see -- no, to the second. Let me be a little more expansive. I told Mr. Putin that we are in the process of analyzing our nuclear arsenal, and that I intended to fulfill a campaign process, which was that we were going to reduce our nuclear arsenal to a level that would help maintain the peace, on the one hand; on the other hand, that would also represent the realities of the 21st century.
Secondly, I reiterated exactly what I told Vladimir in Slovenia -- that I felt like the ABM Treaty was outmoded and outdated, and it was time for us to see if we couldn't work together to move beyond the ABM Treaty.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LOBBYING; 
Insurers Push for Cap on Future Payouts

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Late last month a senior executive from Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurance company, paid an unheralded visit to the White House. He told top economic advisers to President Bush that his company planned to quit providing coverage to the property and casualty insurers for losses from future terrorist attacks.
 The news from the executive, Jacques E. DuBois, was jolting, officials recalled. Only a few days earlier, they had completed work on a $15 billion bailout of the airline industry, and they were busy rebuffing desperate pleas for similar rescues from a host of other industries. The news from Swiss Re raised fears of a new economic crisis, they said, because insurance is crucial for industries like real estate, construction and manufacturing. 
 Mr. DuBois's visit was part of a broad lobbying campaign for what could prove to be one of the costliest bailouts in American history should there be more attacks like those on the World Trade Center. While other industries and labor groups have failed to gain any promises of assistance, the administration and some leading lawmakers have moved with unusual alacrity to help the insurers. 
To advance their case, the insurance companies have relied on some executives with strong ties to the Bush administration and forged a broad coalition with other businesses. The insurers have combined forces with banks, real estate companies and investment houses, three of Washington's most powerful lobbying interests. They recreated the coalition that succeeded two years ago in achieving the most important banking legislation in 66 years, winning a decades-long quest to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which had kept commercial and investment banking separate.
What has made the insurers' effort especially unusual is that the federal government has historically played virtually no role in regulating them. Moreover, the heavy losses from last month's attack, which could exceed $40 billion, are barely a dent in an industry that has assets in the United States alone of more than $3 trillion. The problem, insurers say, is not that they are in financial trouble now, but that future attacks could overwhelm them.
The industry still has some major political obstacles to overcome, most notably the skepticism of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who say they will make the point in hearings this week that the insurers are still financially healthy and have failed to prove that they need federal assistance. 
Under a proposal made by the White House last week, the government would pay the vast majority of any losses next year from terrorist attacks, and the industry's liability would be limited to $12 billion. Similar but higher caps would limit the insurers' liability in 2003 and 2004.
In recent days, lawmakers generally supportive of government assistance have said that the White House plan cannot be passed in its current form because the government would have to pay 80 percent of the first $20 billion in claims. 
About 70 percent of the commercial insurance contracts come up for renewal at year's end, and lenders require such insurance to finance real estate and manufacturing equipment. Administration officials feared that banks would refuse to make new loans and that the $300 billion market would dry up for construction and real estate loans packaged as securities.
Shortly before the visit by Mr. DuBois, 15 insurance executives held a private meeting with President Bush and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans at the White House to inform them of the looming insurance problems and seek broad federal assistance for future attacks. The group included two executives who were hardly strangers to Mr. Bush: Maurice R. Greenberg of the American International Group and Robert J. O'Connell of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.
In 2000, the two executives were on Mr. Bush's elite list of fund-raisers, a group known as the Pioneers. Members of the group have long had strong relationships with various senior administration officials, including Mr. Evans, who oversaw the campaign's fund-raising. Each Pioneer had to raise at least $100,000.
The insurers have gained valuable lobbying assistance from other financial institutions in trying to make the case that the issue has broader economic implications. "This is not an issue only for insurers and insurance company shareholders," said a group of leading financial services executives in a letter to President Bush on Oct. 10. "Rather, it is an economic issue. The U.S. economy cannot possibly recover without the full availability of insurance."
Although the insurance industry is largely regulated by the states, its lobbying force in Washington is formidable. All told, the industry was the 10th-largest contributor to Mr. Bush, providing more than $1.6 million, according to the Federal Election Commission and the Center for Responsive Politics, which researches the role of money in politics. 
The industry also provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to underwrite inaugural festivities earlier this year. In the last election cycle, industry executives contributed more than $40 million to political races, and about two-thirds of those contributions went to Republicans. So far this year, the industry has given nearly $7 million, most of it to Republicans.
Mr. Greenberg has been working the telephones to lobby the administration and Congress and rally other insurers. He has also been one of a handful of executives in what the insurers refer to as C.E.O. fly-ins, face-to-face meetings with members of Congress. 
"We schedule a bunch of appointments with House and Senate leaders," one executive said. 
One of the industry's most prominent figures, Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, has mostly stayed on the sidelines, leaving most of the work in Washington to Ron Ferguson, the president of General Re, Berkshire Hathaway's biggest insurance unit.
Mr. Buffett's strategy is to seek government help without promoting any one plan or seeming to overreach. Government help is vital, he says, but he is not opposed to the insurance industry's paying a significant amount in any terrorist attack.
"I think there is nothing wrong with having the industry lose a lot of money if something like this happens," he said. "We just have to keep it within the ability of the industry to pay. The industry can pay for a $10 billion loss. It can't price for a $500 billion loss."
When it comes to the question of a bailout, Mr. Buffett would like to redefine it as what he calls a government bail-in. 
"We won't write coverage where we can't fulfill our policy," he said. "So the industry won't bail-in. There's nobody that can bail-in except the government because nobody else has the resources."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CONGRESS; 
Lawmakers Seek Inquiry Into Intelligence Failures

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL and TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
After a month of consensus that Congress should do nothing to demoralize the nation's intelligence agencies or distract them from preventing terrorist attacks, crucial lawmakers now say that an unflinching investigation into why the Sept. 11 attacks were not forecast or prevented is inevitable.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, proposed today that the inquiry be the job of a special commission. "I absolutely believe that we have to go back and see what happened," Mr. McCain said on NBC's "Meet the Press," adding, "not in order to hang somebody at the yardarm or to disgrace anyone, but so that we will not make the mistakes again that we made before and can reorganize our intelligence services." 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, reached back to Franklin D. Roosevelt's appointment of a commission headed by a Supreme Court justice to investigate the attack on Pearl Harbor. "I hope the president will do something just like that real soon," he said. 
Questions of how thorough an inquiry is needed, who should do it and, most of all, when it should be done, have simmered for weeks inside the House and Senate committees that oversee the nation's intelligence agencies.
The House committee initially proposed a special commission with subpoena power, the right to hold hearings and to grant immunity. But the full House, after some senior committee members had second thoughts, backed away from giving an outside group such wide powers.
Still, interviews in recent weeks with leading members of the intelligence panels in both houses revealed growing sentiment for a major inquiry to take place -- sooner rather than later, depending on whether the terrorist threat intensifies. Such an inquiry is bound to be politically volatile as it digs into now-familiar questions of whether the C.I.A. and F.B.I. sufficiently shared information, what harm was done by a shortage of covert agents and translators, and whether restrictions on the Central Intelligence Agency's methods had kept it from waging an effective war against terrorists.
It is still not clear who will conduct any inquiry or what form it will take. But Representative Porter J. Goss, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said that an inquiry was coming, but that even when it was done, historians would argue for decades over how the Sept. 11 attacks occurred.
"It will be a little bit like the Kennedy assassination, I'm sure," said Mr. Goss, himself a former C.I.A. clandestine case officer. "It'll go on forever and ever because we are never going to be totally certain, I think, about who did what to whom. You have to get into the minds of the perpetrators, and obviously there was more than one and those who have been incinerated are obviously unavailable."
In the Senate, the ranking Republican on the intelligence panel, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, has been pressing not just for an inquiry, but for the removal of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence. The Bush administration has strongly rallied around Mr. Tenet, a Clinton administration holdover.
"I think that George Tenet has done some good things, a lot of them that I'm not at liberty to talk about," Mr. Shelby said in an interview. "But," he added referring to past terrorist attacks on United States facilities overseas, "I also believe that there have been two too many failures on his watch."
Congress's reluctance to jump in instantly with oversight hearings stood in contrast to its determination over the last decade to investigate such issues as China's efforts to learn America's nuclear secrets, former President Clinton's efforts to hide a relationship with an intern, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's deadly standoffs at Ruby Ridge and Waco.
The initial reluctance reflected a bipartisan wariness to haul intelligence and law enforcement officials before Congress for a backward look at a time when the country seems to be facing new perils every day, from anthrax sent by letter to general threats that have been passed along by the Justice Department.
"Protecting against the next waves is job No. 1, job No. 2 and job No. 3," said Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, a member of the House intelligence panel. 
Senator John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat who serves on the Senate panel, said, "It's a balance between needing to fix anything that's wrong and making sure that we have as much in the way of resources out there doing the job against terrorism as you can have."
Any inquiry will doubtless cast blame widely and could cause tensions between the two parties and between rival intelligence bureaucracies at a time when leaders are trying to rally and unite the nation. 
Representative Doug Bereuter, Republican of Nebraska, says the F.B.I. will have to face questions about how it shared intelligence about suspected terrorists with other domestic agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the immigration service.
Lawmakers of both parties say some of today's problems trace back through numerous administrations to the mind-set created in the 1970's when the revelation that former C.I.A. employees were involved in the Watergate break-in helped fuel Congressional hearings into dubious C.I.A. activities including assassination plots. And they criticize an overreliance on electronic reconnaissance instead of covert agents.
But in a sign of the political shoals, Republicans also say much of the responsibility for diminished intelligence capacities rests with former President Bill Clinton.
"This is going to sound partisan, and I try not to be partisan on this matter," Mr. Goss said. "But the fact is that the Clinton administration was not very interested in our intelligence community, did not spend very much time worrying about, or using it, or investing in it." He added, "It's impossible not to go there if you really do an anatomy of why we are where we are today."
Similarly, Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, recalled former President Clinton's 1992 campaign mantra about the economy, saying, "For a decade or so we've had peace and prosperity -- 'it's the economy stupid' -- and matters of military and intelligence have become secondary considerations."
Former members of the Clinton administration have insisted recently that they determinedly waged a broad campaign against Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, and that a cruise missile attack against his Afghan camps after the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa missed him by only an hour or so.
Tensions also exist inside the Congress, even among members of the same party. Mr. Shelby has shown little patience for Mr. Goss's strong support for Mr. Tenet and has suggested that Mr. Goss is too close to the agency he once worked in, a charge that Mr. Goss waves off.
"A part of our job," Mr. Shelby said, speaking of the intelligence committees, "is to rigorously examine what our agencies do, what they need in resources, where are they lacking, and not to get too cozy with them."
Mr. Lieberman said today that members of Congress should not be the ones to carry out any inquiry. "It ought to be citizens," he said. "A lot of their meetings ought to be in private. But then they ought to tell the president and us to the best of their ability what went wrong, so we can make sure it never happens again."
Mr. McCain proposed that former Senators Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, and Gary Hart, a Colorado Democrat, could run an inquiry. The two headed an earlier commission on national security that had warned that the nation was ill-prepared to face the terrorist threat of the new century.
Many lawmakers on the intelligence committee argue just as vociferously that this is precisely their role. "Farming this out to other groups, I think, is inappropriate," Ms. Harman said. "I think we should do it in private and public." 
Aware of how explosive the subject could become, she added, "We don't need a witch hunt now, or certainly not next year in an election year."

HEADLINE: Where Guests Used to Visit, Anxiety Sets In 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
At the SoHo Grand and the Tribeca Grand, two chic hotels in Lower Manhattan, the lounges and bars are beginning to fill up, along with the guest rooms. At the Bryant Park Hotel in Midtown, more than half of the 129 luxury rooms are occupied. At the Plaza Hotel, a Fifth Avenue landmark, fears that the famed Oak Room and Oyster Bar will close have dissipated.
 There has been an increase in the number of occupied rooms in Manhattan hotels since right after the World Trade Center attack, when occupancy rates hovered around 30 percent. But many hotels have had to cut room rates so deeply to induce people to come that the extra guests are barely making up for the drop in revenue. 
 There may be more people on the streets, but the tourism and business travel industries in New York are still reeling more than a month after the attack. To date, about 6,000 employees, or about a quarter of the hotel union membership in the city, have been laid off, according to the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees local. 
At least 30 restaurants in the city have closed and 40 more have temporarily shuttered their operations. Ticket sales for Broadway shows, still down a quarter from industry projections made earlier this year, are rising.
But the rise comes in part because of corporate packages being bought by many of the same displaced companies that have relocated their offices to hotels, therefore making the occupancy rate and ticket sales less reliable measures of the health of the tourism industry.
Hotels, restaurants and much of the city's $25 billion tourism industry were already in a slump before the attack because of the softening economy. But the current situation suggests that the road ahead will be even more difficult. Experts say that many of the improvements suggest that New Yorkers have heeded Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's call to come out and spend. But they said the numbers mask the fact that people from out of town on business and pleasure -- who are among the real big spenders -- have not returned.
"New Yorkers are doing business with New Yorkers again, but the planes are flying into New York half-empty, which means that New York is not doing business with others," said Emanuel Stern, the president of Grand Hospitality, which owns the Tribeca and SoHo hotels. "Until the planes start coming in full, the New York hospitality industry is not going to be O.K."
The same effect is evident at tourist destinations across the country. 
Officials at Walt Disney World, just southwest of Orlando, say attendance has dropped at its resorts and theme parks both because of the anthrax scare and because the complex has been mentioned as a possible target for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. 
In Las Vegas, local officials say that occupancy rates on the famed Strip rose to 60 percent in recent weeks, but room rates have dropped enough that nearly 15,000 casino jobs and thousands more hotel jobs have been lost since Sept. 11.
Officials said reports of anthrax spores at New York locations have made a bad situation worse.
While the tourism industry in New York City is often not mentioned as prominently as Wall Street as a driver of the local economy, NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, estimates that the industry employs 280,000 people, when museums, Broadway theaters and other cultural institutions are included. 
Already, 15,000 restaurant workers have been laid off since Sept. 11, said Tim Zagat, the chairman of NYC & Company and the co-chairman of Zagat Survey, which follows the restaurant industry, and thousands more layoffs are expected. The New York State Restaurant Association said sales among its members in the city have declined 47 percent compared with last year. And Mr. Zagat said his research has shown that the slight increases in sales over the last few weeks are because of New Yorkers, not the out-of-town guests who spend more money.
"You have a situation that is horrible downtown," Mr. Zagat said. "In Midtown, restaurants are not doing as well as they would like, but they are doing better. But if you look in the suburbs, the restaurants are doing better than they ever have done. We still have the same number of stomachs, but it is just a relocation of where they are eating."
At Bloomingdale's and Macy's, where shoppers from outside the five boroughs make up 35 to 40 percent of credit card receipts, sales are down sharply. This suggests that tourists -- who are likely to spend more on trips into the city -- are not returning as quickly as it may seem from walking the streets around Broadway theaters, which are once again crowded.
In fact, to increase tourism business while travelers stay away, NYC & Company has pushed dozens of businesses -- including New York University, Fleet Bank and BMW -- to buy large blocks of full-priced tickets for their employees or students as a good-will gesture. Similar deals are being worked out with restaurants and hotels.
"Some of the business that we are having now, for lack of a better word, is sympathy business," said John A. Fox, a hotel industry analyst at PKF Consulting. "But it masks how bad things are going to be because that type of business helps you overcome the short-term problem, meaning fear of travel. But we have a longer-term problem, recession."
The recession may very well be masked by the belief that these losses are due to a fear of travel, Mr. Fox said.
Joseph E. Spinnato, the president of the Hotel Association of New York City, said that hotel occupancy rates are all over the map right now. Hotels that are housing businesses and residents displaced in the trade center attack have occupancy rates from 80 to 90 percent, while occupancy rates at other hotels may be half that.
Mr. Spinnato said he expected the overall occupancy rate for October to be about 65 percent, or about 10 percentage points lower than analysts had expected before Sept. 11 and 20 percentage points lower than this time last year.
"Some people would say that this is terrible, but I think that 65 percent is much better than 35 percent, what we were seeing right after the tragedy struck," Mr. Spinnato said. "But we are not going to get over this hurdle until people start getting on airplanes."
Room rates in Manhattan have been so high in recent years that the hotel industry has had to maintain only a 60 percent average occupancy rate to remain profitable, industry experts said.
But with room rates dropping, experts say that 60 percent is not going to be enough to keep a number of hotels in business without making further cuts in spending. 
"The balance of the year will be especially challenging for hoteliers, as demand will decline despite even greater discounting," said Sean L. Hennessey, director of the hospitality and leisure consulting practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., which estimates that revenue per room in Manhattan will drop 30 to 35 percent compared with last year, the largest single-year drop in history.
At the SoHo Grand, on West Broadway, for example, rooms that went for $374 a night before Sept. 11 now go for $289 a night. The hotel is also housing displaced Lower Manhattan residents for $99 a night. A night at the Plaza starts at $289 -- the same as before. But now guests can receive a $100 rebate on a two-day hotel bill if they show a receipt for at least $100 from a New York restaurant.
Mr. Zagat said that discounts and other promotions might bring New Yorkers and other people from the region into the city for a night, but that they would not bring back tourists. 
"The president has been terrific on the international side," Mr. Zagat said. "But we need somebody who is going to take a domestic role, someone focused on tourism side, or else the economy is going head into a tailspin."
To help address the short-term problems, Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, flew to Washington last week to testify before Congress and lobby for a bill that would provide tax reductions for some travelers. Tourism officials hope the measure, which would require air travel, will stimulate the industry. 
The bill, introduced in the House by Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Thomas M. Reynolds, both of New York, would provide up to $2,000 in tax deductions for certain trips and an additional $1,000 for those who come to New York State. The bill would also immediately raise the deduction for business meals and entertainment to 80 percent from 50 percent. 
Zell Miller of Georgia and Jon Kyl of Arizona have introduced a similar bill in the Senate.
Echoing the concerns of many in the New York tourism industry, Ms. Maloney noted, "air travel is the cornerstone of American business and tourism."

HEADLINE: Enlightenment on Energy 

 BODY:
The events of Sept. 11 have inspired some sErious rethinking of a whole range of issues, from airline safety to intelligence gathering. On the face of it, this should also be the perfect time for a measured reassessment of the nation's energy strategy. Turmoil in the Persian Gulf and Middle East has again raised fears about disruptions in the oil supply while providing yet another reminder of the country's increasingly precarious dependence on imported oil. Regrettably, Congress and President Bush, transfixed by the notion that America can drill its way to energy independence, are in danger of letting this opportunity for enlightened policy-making slip away. 
 Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, has actually been forced to go to great lengths to prevent his colleagues from making the country's energy policies worse than they already are. Fearful that a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats on the Energy Committee would approve a bill authorizing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Mr. Daschle took the bill away from the committee with the promise that he would write a more balanced measure and present it to the Senate in the coming months. 
 Congress's basic problem is that it tends to look at only one side of the energy equation -- the supply side -- while giving short shrift to the demand side. That means giving the oil and gas industries more money and broader license to punch holes in the ground, while shortchanging investments in energy efficiency. Lawmakers have also shown little interest in the development of alternative energy sources. In August, for example, the House approved an alarmingly one-sided bill that contained $27 billion in subsidies for traditional energy producers and only $6 billion for conservation. 
That is neither a sensible energy policy nor the right strategy for reducing our reliance on imported oil. Since the first oil crunch of 1974, America's dependence on overseas oil has grown. Imports account for 60 percent of daily oil consumption today compared with 47 percent 10 years ago. A bit less than one-quarter of that imported oil comes from the Persian Gulf, and the volume is growing. In 1974 America imported 1 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf; now the figure is more than 2.5 million. 
Proponents of Arctic drilling say that the wildlife refuge alone could make up a good part of this deficit -- 1.5 million barrels a day at peak production in, say, 2020. That is a significant amount of oil. It also assumes the discovery of 15 billion barrels under the refuge's coastal plain, which the United States Geological Survey regards as an extremely remote possibility. Official estimates of "economically recoverable" oil are in fact much lower than 15 billion barrels. Yet even if the most optimistic estimates prove to be right, the Arctic reserves -- or any other major domestic discoveries, for that matter -- would not guarantee anything approaching energy independence. The reason is simple: the United States, which accounts for about 25 percent of global oil consumption, has about 3 percent of proven global oil reserves.
Plainly, the road to reduced dependence leads in a different direction -- toward conservation (meaning increased efficiency) and development of non-oil energy sources. Increasing fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles to 40 miles per gallon -- a reasonable expectation, even with existing technology -- would save about 2.5 million barrels a day by 2020. That is considerably more than the refuge can be expected to yield in the same time frame. As it happens, 2.5 million barrels is just about what we are now importing every day from the Persian Gulf.
In addition to making conventional cars and trucks more efficient, there is much more we can do to reduce our dependence on imports -- including a serious national effort to develop hybrid cars or cars powered by fuel cells. The House bill pays no attention to ideas like these. It is to be hoped that Mr. Daschle will include them in his. What is needed here is a sense of history. The oil shocks of 1974 led not only to the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but also to the first set of fuel economy standards. This crisis should lead to equally enlightened results.

HEADLINE: Edging Toward a Deal With Moscow 

 BODY:
President Bush came away from the Shanghai summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders with broad backing for diplomatic and financial moves against terrorism but shallow support for American military action in Afghanistan. The most important development, though, may have been Mr. Bush's talks with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, which brought the two leaders closer to outlining a new strategic relationship. 
 The two sides need to keep working on a package deal that would include offensive nuclear weapons cuts, changes in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and more cordial ties between NATO and Russia. Washington should be more realistic about a missile shield. The Pentagon remains far from having perfected a workable defensive system and the most immediate threat to the nation comes from terrorists, not nations with intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
 Russia, with about 6,000 decaying and expensive warheads, would like to drop down to 1,500 or lower. The Pentagon, with about 7,000 warheads, may now be willing to bring the American arsenal down close to that level. Russia would prefer to see offensive reductions carried out in the context of a formal arms control agreement, while Washington does not want to bind itself to a new treaty so it can build additional warheads later if the need arises. Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin need to converge on a middle ground that packages offensive cuts and understandings about missile defense in an official communique or other written agreement that leaves both sides feeling secure. The new arrangements should include provisions that would make future expansions of NATO more palatable to Moscow and leave open the possibility of Russia's joining the alliance at some future date. 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin were clearly not on the same page yesterday when they discussed missile defenses at a joint news conference. Mr. Bush called the ABM treaty "outdated" and "dangerous" while Mr. Putin described it as essential to maintaining nuclear stability. Nevertheless, both men left open the possibility of narrowing their differences, and Mr. Putin seemed hopeful that agreement could be reached on altering the treaty in ways that would permit more ambitious American testing of missile defense systems. Mr. Bush should resist pressure from within his administration to move toward withdrawing from the treaty by the end of the year. Much of the testing needed to develop a workable missile shield can be carried out within the ABM treaty, and surely the treaty can be amended to permit a more expansive testing program in the future. 
One of the pleasant surprises of the Bush presidency has been the rapid development of a productive relationship with Russia. It has already paid clear dividends in Moscow's contributions since Sept. 11 to the campaign against terrorism. The next step is to produce a new framework for managing American and Russian nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Putin Sees Pact With U.S. On Revising ABM Treaty 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia emerged from more than an hour of talks with President Bush today saying they could reach agreements that would alter the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. If so, that would free the United States to test a proposed antimissile system while meeting Moscow's demand not to abandon the treaty altogether.
 Both men were elusive in their comments, but Mr. Putin's remarks made clear that the two nations were racing to try to reach the outlines of an accord before Mr. Putin travels to Washington and to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., from Nov. 12 to 14. 
 "I believe we do have understanding that we can reach agreements," Mr. Putin told reporters, "taking into account national interests of Russia, the United States, and taking into account the necessity to strengthen international security." Excerpts from news conference, Page A8. 
An administration official said before the meeting that Mr. Bush would deliver a written outline of the American position that included a strong caution to Mr. Putin. 
If an accord can not be reached by the end of this year, the official quoted the caution as saying, the United States will give formal notice that it intends to withdraw from the treaty, after the required six-month waiting period.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, skirted the question of whether Mr. Bush delivered that warning. But she said that while past tests of a missile defense have complied with the ABM treaty, "we don't intend to do that in the future."
For his part, Mr. Bush was lavish in his public praise of Mr. Putin and their relationship, which is obviously far warmer than the one he tried to develop this week with President Jiang Zemin of China.
Twice during a joint news conference, Mr. Bush referred to his counterpart as Vladimir, and recounted several ways that Russia had helped Washington in the battle against terrorism. 
The meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin came on the last day of a summit meeting of 21 leaders of Asian and Pacific nations, who used their session to issue a strongly worded statement condemning the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States and pledging to help "to bring the perpetrators to justice."
The nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum -- which has rarely spoken out on political issues -- also promised to take a series of steps to carry out United Nations counterterrorism resolutions.
Those include preventing money from reaching terrorists, and developing a worldwide electronic system for customs and for registering movement of people. 
Currently, there is scant connection between the customs systems of most nations, impeding their ability to issue warnings about suspected terrorists or arrest them at borders.
But the statement omitted any mention of the American military operations in Afghanistan, reflecting the fact that some Muslim nations, including Indonesia and Malaysia, are deeply uneasy about the campaign. 
China urged the United States to get its work in Afghanistan done fast and accurately -- a fleeting reminder of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the war over Kosovo in 1999.
Mr. Bush nonetheless went to extraordinary lengths today to argue that he is getting all the backing he needs, and more. "We've got universal support around the world," he said today at the news conference with Mr. Putin, waving away a question about nations that do not agree with the American strategy.
Mr. Putin gave Mr. Bush a public vote of confidence in the American military actions, saying, "I believe that his action was measured and adequate to the threat the United States was confronted with."
This was the ninth annual meeting of the Asian and Pacific leaders, since President Clinton initiated the summit meeting in 1993. The organization was created to press for free trade in a region long home to enormous trade barriers, and it has created deadlines for the opening of markets across the Pacific.
In the last two days, Mr. Bush has had relatively little to say about the economy, or about any comprehensive strategy for preventing global recession.
"It's not where his head is," said a senior official from another country who sat in on meetings here. "We talk trade, he nods, then steers things back to terrorism."
Mr. Bush clearly had second thoughts about leaving the United States at a time of anthrax attacks and fear of further terrorism at home, and tonight, after dinner with Mr. Putin, he headed straight for Air Force One, 12 hours ahead of schedule. He wanted to sleep in the White House, officials said. He plans no other international travel this year.
Mr. Bush conducted morning national security meetings from secure teleconference centers here. It was a sign of his preoccupation that he engaged in no tourism here, and never once stepped from his car to greet ordinary Chinese, a staple of such visits since Richard M. Nixon -- awkward in most crowds -- thrust into Chinese throngs.
If there was nothing else going on, it would be difficult enough to put together in just three weeks the major agreement on the ABM treaty apparently envisioned with Mr. Putin. Now, Mr. Bush will have to prosecute a war and try to rewrite the rules of peace at the same time.
That means that the Pentagon, while running daily operations in Afghanistan, will also have to come up with numbers on how deeply the United States can reduce its fleet of ground, air and sea-based nuclear weapons, under complex scenarios that would allow for full protection of the United States.
Tonight, Ms. Rice suggested that even the Crawford meeting may not be definitive. "In terms of the numbers or levels" of missiles to be eliminated, she said, Mr. Bush said he would be getting back to Mr. Putin soon. "The review is not quite finished," she said. 
Mr. Bush cast the envisioned accord with Russia in terms of a potentially historic new partnership, and dissented from Mr. Putin's stated view that the ABM treaty is still useful, even if imperfect and in need of change. "We must truly and finally move beyond the cold war," Mr. Bush said. After today's meeting, he added, "we can report progress toward that goal."
The terrorist attacks, he said, "make it clearer than ever that a cold war ABM treaty that prevents us from defending our people is outdated, and I believe dangerous."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: WAR AND DRUGS; 
Afghan Ban On Growing Of Opium Is Unraveling

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
A highly successful government ban on the growing of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which had been by far the biggest source of opium in the world, has begun to unravel as the United States presses its war against the ruling Taliban, American and United Nations officials say.
 Reports from Afghanistan received last week by the United Nations show that farmers are planting or preparing to plant opium poppies in at least two important growing areas. Recent American intelligence reports also suggest that the year-old ban may be eroding as the military assault continues, United States officials said. 
 "They may have told people they can plant, they may tell people nothing and allow them to plant, or there may be enough chaos with the war that it won't matter what the Taliban says," said the State Department's senior official for international narcotics issues, R. Rand Beers. "We had a situation that showed promise that is now headed in absolutely the wrong direction." 
Even a wholesale collapse of the ban might not have an immediate impact on the availability and price of opium and heroin, one of its derivatives, in illegal drug markets around the world.
A continued flow of opium from stockpiles inside Afghanistan has so far kept the prices of those drugs stable in Europe, and officials expect those reserves to last for perhaps another year.
But after paying relatively little attention to the problem in recent years, American officials are now closely focused on Afghanistan's drug trade, saying that taxes on farmers and traders have become a crucial source of revenue for the Taliban and that drug money may be used to finance terrorist activities. 
"The urgency has increased," the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Asa Hutchinson, said in an interview.
The challenge that Washington now faces is, in some part, of its own making. In the 1980's opium production flourished in Afghanistan with the involvement of some of the mujahedeen, rebels who were supported by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
In the 1990's, as the country's poppy fields expanded, the United States refused to deal with the Taliban government and focused its drug control efforts in other regions that were thought to be supplying greater amounts of drugs to American markets.
"It's something that just wasn't on our radar screen," a senior American official said of Afghanistan's drug trade. "That heroin wasn't coming this way -- it was mostly going to Europe. We were worried about other things going on in Afghanistan, and we didn't want to deal with the Taliban."
While some officials suggest that American military forces might now try to target caches of opium stored around Afghanistan, others acknowledge privately that they have scant information about where those caches might be. 
More broadly, American officials admit that they have poor intelligence about the makeup and operations of Afghanistan's drug trafficking organizations and know even less about how those groups might be linked to Osama bin Laden or other suspected terrorists.
Although opium has been produced in Afghanistan for centuries, it began to boom after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Often, officials said, the convoys of donkeys and trucks that smuggled arms to the mujahedeen returned to Pakistan with raw opium, sometimes with the assent of the Pakistani or American intelligence officers who supported the resistance.
From there the drug was usually converted to morphine base or smuggled to Turkey to be refined into heroin.
When the Pakistani government began cracking down on the trade in the 1990's, some opium farmers and traffickers whose tribes straddled the border simply moved their operations into Afghanistan. 
By the early 1990's Afghanistan was starting to approach the opium output of Myanmar, the world's largest producer. As the Taliban swept across Afghanistan in the mid-1990's, American officials hoped initially that they would be allies in the drug fight because intoxicants are condemned by Islam. But that did not happen, in part because opium was such a good cash crop.
"At first we though they would be good for our purposes because they were so strict," said a drug enforcement official who dealt with Afghanistan during the first years of the Taliban's Islamic rule and spoke on condition of anonymity. "But the problem just grew, because it was such a good cash crop and they were in such dire straits economically."
For its own part, the Drug Enforcement Administration was shifting some of its resources away from the region. In 1997 a study by the agency found that although Afghanistan and Pakistan were still the source of about 20 percent of the heroin seized in East Coast cities, nearly three-fourths of the market there was being supplied by Colombia and Mexico. The next year, with the dangers to American drug agents rising, the agency decided to close two of its four offices in Pakistan.
"We decided we didn't care about Afghanistan, because it didn't affect the shores of the United States," a senior American official said. "We were wrong."
In 1997 the Taliban pledged a one-third reduction in poppy cultivation and pleaded for development aid to the affected farmers. But the ban was not enforced, and very little foreign aid was forthcoming. 
The United States and European governments were appalled by the Taliban's human rights record, and drugs were a second-tier interest.
The United Nations drug control program used modest development projects to reduce poppy cultivation in a few small areas of Afghanistan, and the United States contributed $3.2 million to the effort over five years. By comparison, it spent $4.2 million this year in Laos, the world's third-largest opium producer, and will spend $399 million next year to fight drug trafficking in Colombia.
American officials had ample reason to be skeptical. In 1997 the poppy fields stretched over 144,345 acres, a United Nations survey found.
Two years later the figure was 224,819 acres.
The trade was a vital source of revenue for the impoverished Taliban government. Local Taliban officials took a 10 percent tax from poppy growers, as they did from other farmers, and an Islamic tax of as much as 20 percent on opium traders and transporters. Some warlords aligned with the opposition Northern Alliance were also deeply involved in the trade, United States officials said.
In 1998 and 1999, United States intelligence data also revealed that larger laboratories for refining opium into morphine base and heroin were popping up in areas where they could exist only with the Taliban's assent, several American officials said. As the opium output rose, Afghanistan was processing more of its own heroin to supply newer markets in Eastern Europe and Russia, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia.
When the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, decreed a complete ban on poppy growing in July 2000, few foreign drug officials expected any results. That year, according to C.I.A. estimates, the country's opium output surged to 4,042 tons, accounting for about 70 percent of the opium produced in the world. United Nations figures were slightly lower.
But within two months, officials discovered that the poppy ban had been astonishingly effective, cutting Afghanistan's production to 81.6 tons, most of it from poppies grown in the roughly 10 percent of the country under Northern Alliance control.
Although opium prices soared inside Afghanistan -- leading some foreign officials to suspect a Taliban ploy to increase their revenues -- a steady flow of opium from stockpiles that are largely controlled by autonomous traffickers along the country's borders kept the availability of heroin high and the price low in Europe. 
Since last month there have been conflicting reports about whether the ban would stand. But on Friday, the head of the United Nations drug control program for the region, Bernard Frahi, said he had just received reports from Afghanistan that poppy fields had been prepared for planting in the southwestern province of Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold, and that planting had already begun in some parts of Nangarhar, another important poppy growing province. 
United States officials said intelligence reports indicated that Taliban officials in some areas had signaled an end to the ban.
"In a period of uncertainty, when farmers have lost two-thirds of their income by switching to wheat, when there are no alternative development programs, the farmers will grow opium," Mr. Frahi said in a telephone interview from Islamabad.
