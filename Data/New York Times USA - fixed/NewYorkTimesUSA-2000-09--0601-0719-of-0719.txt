HEADLINE: Development for New York City;
The West Side Jets

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal to build a football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, perhaps for the New York Jets, has suddenly taken on new life. It has also generated understandable skepticism from New Yorkers. Nevertheless, the idea is more promising than it might seem at first. The Jets are said to be extremely interested. The earlier idea of moving Yankee Stadium to the West Side is effectively dead, especially now that Gov. George Pataki has come out against it. More important, City Hall and the governor's office are mulling some financial arrangements that might work and also speed the redevelopment of a poorly served and underutilized area of Manhattan.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki are both clearly thinking about their legacies, but that is no reason not to look searchingly at the stadium proposal being studied by their staffs. Three criteria should be applied in making a judgment about its worthiness. First, a stadium should have multiple uses and serve as an available annex to the Javits Convention Center, which needs to expand and construct a large meeting space if it is to lure the big meetings that increasingly are going elsewhere. Second, to avoid traffic congestion and air pollution, the project has to be served primarily by mass transit rather than automobiles. Third, it must pay for itself without large public subsidies beyond valid infrastructure projects. The surprise is that it may be possible to meet all three of these criteria. 
 George Steinbrenner is said to retain his dream of moving to the West Side. But the time has come for everyone to recognize that this idea no longer makes sense, if it ever did. A few years ago, the Yankees' owner said box-office receipts in the Bronx were lagging. Today they are breaking records. If Yankee Stadium is rebuilt at its current site, the fans will come. The Yankees can have their luxury skyboxes, and the city and state can upgrade the subway, car, train and even water links in an economical fashion that would improve the surrounding area. The same can be done for the Mets in Queens.
 The West Side stadium idea is being pushed most aggressively by the organization that hopes to lure the Olympics to New York City in 2012. Obviously, a stadium south of the Javits Center has to rise and fall on its own merits, irrespective of what might happen with the Olympics. Enter the New York Jets, who currently play in Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands, the only professional football team that has to share a stadium with another professional team. The Jets' new owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV, evidently wants to move. The team ought to pay for the West Side stadium itself if the city and state help finance the cost of a platform over the railroad yards next to the Hudson River.
What is most intriguing about the stadium proposal is its potential to redevelop the West Side south of 42nd Street, an area that now includes bus and truck parking lots, warehouses and other operations that could be moved to a less central location. As Charles Bagli reported last week in The Times, New York City is in desperate need of places to build new office space and housing. This page has called for the city to open up this area to commercial and residential development, a topic to which we will return from time to time. A transit station linking the stadium and the area to Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North and an extension of the No. 7 subway line is not an unrealistic idea. Public investment in such infrastructure would almost certainly generate new construction of offices, apartments and hotels. The use of incremental tax revenues from such projects could help finance the entire cost of construction.
The stadium idea is drawing fire from community groups, elected officials and others worried about congestion, expense and pollution. Their concerns cannot be dismissed. But it would also be a mistake to dismiss the stadium proposal as just another wild idea. It deserves to be looked at skeptically but also with an open mind.

HEADLINE: Rich Nations and Some Oil Producers Call for Price Cuts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Rich nations claimed a breakthrough today in their battle against high oil prices after persuading several oil-producing countries to join them in calling for cheaper crude. But their intensive campaign to stabilize commodity and currency markets awaited the verdict of traders on Monday.
Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia and the United Arab Emirates joined the Group of 7 industrialized nations and other members of the committee that governs the International Monetary Fund in condemning current oil prices as harmful. Their agreement did not constitute a binding commitment, but financial officials presented it as tangible progress before OPEC holds a meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, this week. 
 "The committee is concerned that current oil prices, if sustained, could hamper global growth, add to inflationary pressures and adversely affect prospects for many countries," its communique said.
Finance ministers who are gathered here for the annual meetings of the monetary fund and the World Bank hope that their sustained oratorical campaign against a $30-plus barrel price for oil will have a marked impact on a volatile commodity market that is sometimes moved by psychology and speculation.
But they are financial officials, not energy ministers, and they have so far been unable to announce concrete steps that would lead to a greater supply of oil by winter. Today's communique, like one released Saturday, praised the United States decision last week to tap its substantial strategic oil reserves to help dampen prices. Though the statement noted that other nations would also consider using emergency reserves to increase supply, none had made such a commitment by today.
Finance ministers once expected that their meetings would be overshadowed by anti-globalization protests. So far, those protests have proven mostly peaceful and far smaller than anticipated. But the high price of oil and the falling euro -- what the ministers have called twin threats to the global economy -- have overtaken the agenda. The big test will come Monday, when markets reopen and traders vote on whether official promises to corral prices are credible.
Central bankers from the United States, Britain, Japan and Canada joined the European Central Bank on Friday in a concerted intervention to prop up the battered euro, which had fallen almost 30 percent since it went into use at the start of last year.
In delicately worded statements, they have effectively promised to buy euros and sell their own currencies again if the market does not get the message. They could be dragged into defending their stance as early as Monday if the euro slumps.
Nations that control the monetary fund gave Horst Kohler, the former German finance ministry official who now runs the Washington-based International Monetary Fund, the chance to present his vision for the global lending agency.
The fund has come under sustained attack for practicing bad economics and imposing too much on poor nations, though the ministers gathered here are strong supporters of the fund because they see its as a bulwark against financial panic.
"I have not come to the fund to turn it upside down," Mr. Kohler said before the meeting began. "But there is a further need for change, and even accelerated change."
As expected, the nations that control the fund backed a plan to provide debt relief to 20 nations by the end of this year, up from 10 that have already been granted relief. The effort, intended at least in part to head off demands from protesters, requires that the monetary fund and the World Bank ease some conditions they have imposed on debt relief in the past.
The nations also approved changes to the fund's lending programs intended to preserve the fund's capital for crises and wean it away from some long-term lending to more financially stable nations. The overhaul was pushed by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers of the United States.
But finance ministers did not endorse specific changes to the way the fund imposes capitalist economic and financial conditions on nations that borrow its money. Though Mr. Kohler has spoken of his vision of streamlining and even eliminating some of those conditions, the committee's communique today warned against any severing of strings attached to loans. It did back a review of the matter, however.
Protesters favoring debt relief held a mock funeral today for children they say die needlessly because their countries are so poor, attracting hundreds of people to central Prague. Organized by Jubilee 2000, a London-based umbrella group that advocates debt forgiveness, the march was significantly smaller than similar events held recently in Seattle, in Washington, D.C., and in Cologne, Germany.
Other protest groups have vowed to blockade World Bank and International Monetary Fund delegates around town on Tuesday. But some organizers are worried that the number of activists arriving in Prague will fall short of the expected 20,000.
Some protesters are blaming overly zealous authorities for the low turnout. The police today halted an Italian train carrying protesters at the Czech Republic's southern border and refused to let it pass until four blacklisted activists got off.
Lee Sustar, an American who said he writes for a socialist newspaper in Chicago and had come to Prague to cover the demonstrations, said by telephone from the Prague airport that he had been stopped there by border authorities and refused entry. He said the police told him that he was on a blacklist given to them by American officials. He added that he had been detained during anti-globalization protests in Seattle last year.

HEADLINE: Faltering Euro Faces Test in Markets Today

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Having won pledges from the world's major central banks to support the euro, Europe's downtrodden single currency, the European Central Bank will have its toughness and its credibility tested on Monday by foreign exchange markets.
On Friday, the European bank bought up billions of dollars worth of euros and was joined by the United States Federal Reserve as well as the central banks of Japan, Britain and Canada. 
 Catching the markets by surprise, the central banks announced their "shared concern" about the euro's precipitous decline and suggested that they would intervene again if the euro's value against the dollar did not increase.
For the European Central Bank, which assumed power when the euro was born on Jan. 1, 1999, a successful intervention is crucial for its credibility and that of the currency itself.
Financial officials from Europe, the United States and Japan, who were here in Prague this weekend for meetings of the International Monetary Fund, spent much of the weekend talking up their commitment in the hope of jolting currency markets when they open for business on Monday.
"Markets understand that there is a clear will not to accept an undervalued euro," said Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund.
Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said he was pleased at how well the intervention has gone so far.
But experts and currency traders are uncertain. The intervention on Friday appears to have involved only a few billion dollars and may have little long-term impact if it is not followed up by more waves of euro-buying and dollar-selling.
If the intervention has little effect and if central bankers do not intervene again, experts say, the damage to the currency will be much worse than if they had not decided to intervene at all.
Few people are more aware of the risks than the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands. Like many other central bankers, he is skeptical about the value of intervention. In December, when the euro sank below parity against the dollar for the first time, he was determined to wait for the markets to correct themselves.
When the euro's value fell to 88.4 cents in early May, Mr. Duisenberg came under increasing pressure from political leaders to intervene. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France called for "joint action" to shore up the euro and even proposed strengthening the role of finance ministers of countries using the euro in monetary policy.
Mr. Duisenberg did not budge, though he did issue a formal statement expressing sympathy with those who were alarmed by the euro's decline.
Mr. Duisenberg has been careful not to spell out his goals or to suggest how much money the central banks are willing to commit to rescuing the euro. But he seems determined to push its value up rather than simply to stabilize it, and anything short of an increase will be taken by markets as an even greater proof of the euro's dim prospects.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Differences on Medicare Take Center Stage in Gore Campaign

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore opened a week dedicated to highlighting his differences with Gov. George W. Bush over Medicare by asserting today that Mr. Bush's plan for providing prescription drug benefits would force some low-income elderly people to go to welfare offices to qualify. Mr. Bush's aides called that contention "pure fantasy" and "a classic scare tactic."
The Bush campaign, meanwhile, vowed to wage a war against America's "education recession" in the week before the 2000 campaign becomes consumed by the long-awaited first debate between the Democratic and Republican presidential contenders. Aides at Mr. Bush's headquarters in Austin, Tex., buoyed by a polling rebound that accompanied the Texas governor's first good week in a month, also disparaged Mr. Gore for what they portrayed as his recent misstatements. 
 Mr. Gore's comments came in a 25-minute conference telephone call with reporters this afternoon from his official residence at the Naval Observatory here. The vice president departs on Monday for Florida, where he hopes to solidify his position among the state's pivotal elderly voters by releasing a new booklet containing his proposals for strengthening and expanding Medicare. He also plans to campaign this week in Michigan and Iowa before devoting the weekend to preparing for the first of three scheduled debates with Mr. Bush, on Oct. 3.
Mr. Bush, who spent the day in Texas and had no public schedule, embarks on a western swing to Oregon, Washington and California on Monday. By focusing on education, his campaign hopes to win over women, closing the gender gap that favors Mr. Gore. Bush aides also believe that the issue allows them to point to concrete accomplishments and statistics in Texas that demonstrate Mr. Bush's effectiveness in a given area of public policy.
The week dawns with a series of polls showing the race tightening into a dead heat, underscoring the importance of the debates, on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.
A survey by Newsweek magazine gave Mr. Gore a lead of 3 percentage points, a gap within the margin of sampling error. Mr. Gore led by 14 percentage points in a Newsweek poll a week ago. A daily Gallup tracking poll showed Mr. Bush with a lead of 1 percentage point, while a Fox TV poll had the candidates even.
The polls were taken during a week in which Mr. Bush seemed to regain his footing after nearly a month on the defensive. He did his best to keep attention focused on a series of Gore campaign missteps, charged Mr. Gore with political opportunism for calling for the release of oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve, and accused his rival of "misleading Americans."
Mr. Gore said today that he would remain focused on the issues, and said he would devote the week to discussing Medicare policy as a way to draw contrasts with Mr. Bush.
"We have some real and very significant differences," Mr. Gore said. "The other side treats the Medicare surplus as a piggy bank they can use for a tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans. I'll veto the use of any money from Medicare for anything other than Medicare."
Mr. Gore has proposed a plan to extend Medicare's solvency by five years, from 2025 to 2030, by placing the anticipated $400 billion, 10-year Medicare surplus in a secure fund that could be used to reduce the federal debt. That, he projects, would save $75 billion in interest payments that would be used, in turn, to shore up Medicare.
In addition, Mr. Gore would spend $338 billion over 10 years to provide a universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Individuals making about $12,000 or less would have their drugs covered without charge, while those with higher incomes would pay premiums on a sliding scale. The Gore plan also would spend $40 billion to increase funding for nursing homes, teaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies and rehabilitative services, all areas that suffered deep Medicare cuts under the balanced budget act of 1997.
Mr. Bush's Medicare plan, which would cost a total of $198 billion, would create a system where private insurers compete with the government to provide coverage.
His market-based approach would essentially provide subsidies to older people who could spend the money on a variety of government-approved plans, some of which would include prescription drug coverage. For those with the lowest incomes, the government would provide drug coverage free. During the four years Mr. Bush estimates it would take to implement his plan, he would spend $48 billion on a temporary series of grants to states to subsidize coverage for the low-income elderly.
"For the first five years, they would force many seniors to go to welfare offices to sign up for state programs," Mr. Gore said, "and middle-class seniors would be left out completely."
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that the welfare office accusation was wrong and that Mr. Bush's plan would expand on an existing program in 23 states where applicants return forms by mail.
"Al Gore spent last week making things up and today he's continued," Mr. Fleischer said.
Mr. Bush's assertion of an "education recession," a phrase that aides said tested well in internal campaign polling with women and independent voters, will coincide with the release of a Republican National Committee advertisement that makes the same point. The campaign will attempt to back up the charge by discussing declining test scores, safety concerns, and widening achievement gaps between rich and poor.
Mr. Fleischer used the phrase several times in a conference call with reporters today, saying the recession had "been present for the last 10 years," a span that dates to President George Bush's administration.

HEADLINE: Police Arrest 25 in Connection With Indonesia Bombings

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The Indonesian police said today that they had arrested 25 people in connection with a recent series of bombings in Jakarta, including one that killed 15 people at the stock exchange. The police said that the suspects admitted carrying out the bombings and indicated that their next target was to be the American Embassy.
They said the suspects were arrested in Jakarta on Friday and Saturday based on tips and information gathered by police investigators. One suspect, armed with a grenade, indicated after he was picked up that he had been on his way to attack the American Embassy and a nearby crowded department store, they said. 
 "The suspects have all admitted to being involved in recent bomb attacks, and one of them said that he intended to blow up the United States Embassy," said Superintendent Nur Usman, a spokesman for the Jakarta police.
American Embassy officials said they were aware of the arrests but declined to comment on them. Last week, the State Department warned United States citizens that American companies and interests in Indonesia might be the target of such attacks.
In the last week, there have been numerous anti-American demonstrations across Indonesia, during which American flags were burned. The protests followed a visit by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who warned Indonesia that it could face economic sanctions if it does not disband violent militia groups that are accused of killing three United Nations aid workers on the divided island of Timor. The militias are linked to the Indonesian military.
The police spokesman said three of the people detained are believed to be the ringleaders, while the others either knew about the plot or played minor roles. Mr. Nur declined to provide any details on the suspects or a motive for the bombing campaign, which included attacks on the Indonesian attorney general's office, the Philippine ambassador's residence and the Malaysian Embassy.
Although the investigation is continuing, Mr. Usman said there was so far no indication that the suspects were connected with the military or the police. There had been widespread speculation that the blasts were the work of disaffected members of the armed forces loyal to former President Suharto.
The bombings have coincided with major developments in the government's corruption case against Mr. Suharto, the former longtime dictator, and law enforcement officials have said attacks were meant to derail President Abdurrahman Wahid's democratic reforms.
The arrests brought a sigh of relief to residents of this bustling capital city of 11 million people, who had grown apprehensive in recent weeks as the government appeared helpless to solve the bomb attacks. Last week, the president, frustrated that not a single arrest had been made in the case, replaced the national police chief and ordered the arrest of Mr. Suharto's son, whom police questioned, then released for lack of evidence.
With Mr. Suharto's trial scheduled to resume this week, Jakarta had been bracing for perhaps another round of bomb attacks. Mr. Suharto's lawyers contend that he is too sick after three strokes to attend his trial.
In a related development, the Indonesian government, facing mounting pressure from other nations to contain the violence on Timor, began an ambitious campaign this weekend to disarm the militia groups that are accused of killing the three United Nations aid workers in West Timor early this month.
The police in West Timor, which is controlled by Indonesia, said that by this evening the militias had surrendered 34 automatic rifles, 9 grenade launchers, about 1,000 homemade guns and an equal number of rounds of ammunition. The government has said it will use force to disarm the militias if they do not hand over all their weapons by Tuesday.
The militias, which are infamous for decapitating their prey, went on a rampage in East Timor last year after the territory voted to secede from Indonesian rule. The vicious gangs continue to cause havoc on both sides of the border.
"So far, it appears that the militias are being very cooperative in turning over their arms," said Simatupang, the police superintendent in the West Timor border town of Atambua, where the three aid workers were killed. Mr. Simatupang said in a telephone interview that since Saturday at least 18 militia groups had brought weapons to the Atambua police station and that he expected more would be turned in.
But almost no one expects the crackdown to bring an end to the violence. Authorities have conducted several campaigns to disarm the militias in the past, collecting hundreds of weapons. But the gangs, which are friendly with the military, continue to resurface with guns.
Moreover, the situation has become critical along the West Timor border, where 120,000 refugees from East Timor are trapped in refugee camps with food supplies running out.

HEADLINE: Back Home, President Evokes Pride and Pain

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 24

 BODY:
Jason Maynard loves his grandfather and wishes he were still alive. But sometimes he thinks it may be just as well that his grandfather, Marion Crank, died in 1994, before Bill Clinton's presidency had so many dents.
His grandfather, a 20-year veteran of the Arkansas Legislature, had a fondness for Mr. Clinton. 
 "Grandfather was around to see him elected president in 1992, but not the rest of it," said Mr. Maynard, a marketing manager for a publishing company who recently left Little Rock to work in Chicago. "In a way I'm glad he never saw what happened."
But his grandfather, who died at 79 and has a bridge named for him in Little River County, would have found good in Mr. Clinton's flawed presidency and would not have been surprised that it endured, Mr. Maynard said.
"Knock him down, and he keeps coming back," his grandfather said of Mr. Clinton at a 1981 Democratic fund-raiser, as Mr. Clinton was trying to rebuild his political career after losing re-election as governor in 1980.
When Mr. Crank died, Mr. Clinton called his widow to offer his sympathies -- from the Oval Office.
This past week, as the long-running Whitewater investigation concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. Clinton, so, too, evaporated the threat of one more blemish on his battered presidency.
Perhaps it is the final one, say some in his home state, as his presidency nears its end and Arkansans here and around the country form his legacy in bars, cafes, boardrooms, church pews and construction sites.
But there is more to it than the usual breakdown of likes or dislikes, divided by party lines. His strength was always said to be his personal touch, Arkansans say, so it is only natural that they take his life personally.
"He had tremendous talents and abilities, and they were misguided," said Edward M. Penick Sr., who was born in Little Rock in 1922 and has lived here all his life.
Like many here, Mr. Penick speaks of Mr. Clinton with a mix of sadness and weariness.
"I'll remember him as a person who could have done a lot for this country, but somewhere in his makeup he lost character and integrity, and that's tragic," said Mr. Penick, a retired banker.
"He's still trying to establish his legacy, and I don't think it will be what he thinks it will be. The power of the presidency fed his ego, and he thought no one could do anything to him."
He does not hate Mr. Clinton, he is only disappointed in him.
"In Arkansas, he's remembered as a great embarrassment," Mr. Penick said.
Others said they were tired of the ribald jokes and the talk show jabs that are finally beginning to subside now that Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are providing fresh material.
"It gave us a black eye, but not a lasting one," said Martin J. Borchert, an affluent retired contractor who was Little Rock's mayor from 1967 to 1968. "We'll get over it, if we haven't already."
Others said Mr. Clinton never did much for the state that was his springboard to the presidency, that he did not deliver even one interstate highway, a sore point here.
But as easy as it is to find someone who regrets this state's connection to Mr. Clinton, it is just as easy to find someone who would vote for him again -- for president, for governor, for anything.
In the dust of a construction site on the northwestern edge of downtown, Robert J. Keeling wiped the grime and sweat from his face and thought back on a quarter century of Bill Clinton-style politics.
The sex scandals did not turn Mr. Keeling, a carpenter with a master's degree in education, from Mr. Clinton.
"It didn't bother me much," Mr. Keeling, 45, said. "If you did a roll call in Congress on who'd had an affair, hands would go up all over the place" if the lawmakers were honest about it, he said.
Whitewater meant nothing to him.
The economy stayed strong, and there was plenty of construction work. On Friday, he and other workers labored to transform an old Oldsmobile dealership on the edge of downtown into a temporary warehouse for Mr. Clinton's papers. A permanent library is planned.
"He didn't start with much," said Mr. Keeling, with admiration.
"He wasn't born rich. Look where he got. He did us proud," he said, and then paused, thinking. "Proud enough."
Mr. Maynard said there was no pure right or pure wrong in the legacy.
"He survived Monica," Mr. Maynard said. "He survived Whitewater. And now Al is looking pretty good," he said, weighing Mr. Gore's chances of winning the presidency.
Mr. Maynard said he believed Mr. Clinton was not the pure political animal he had been called. "He does care about people," he said. That, he said, is not an act.
Elsewhere in the city, people say Mr. Clinton's legacy will be one of neither great pride nor great embarrassment.
"I think history will treat him well, when it's all said and done," said Joe D. Bell, the son of a state senator and a senior partner in the influential law firm Friday, Eldredge & Clark here.
"He may not be a superstar president, but he won't be remembered as a Herbert Hoover," Mr. Bell said.
Mr. Bell said that reaction from outsiders to his being from Mr. Clinton's state is neither always good nor always bad.
"I get a mixed reaction when I travel out of state," he said. "Some people ask if it's as bad as they say it is, but others say he's a sharp guy, and we're glad you gave him to us."
In a way, Mr. Bell said, Mr. Clinton's success -- and then his survival -- may have actually improved the way some Arkansans feel about themselves.
"Clinton's enduring strength is that he never quits," Mr. Bell said. "It's just another example of the true grit of Arkansans."
Mr. Clinton's legacy is formed in Mr. Maynard's mind.
Mr. Maynard says he will have regrets about Mr. Clinton, of unrealized potential, of a potentially great but flawed man.
But he says that when he thinks about Mr. Clinton, whom he has voted for as long as he has been old enough to do so, he thinks about the day his grandfather died and how the phone rang in his grandmother's house, and Mr. Clinton's words.
"I'm sitting here in the Oval Office, thinking about the good times Marion and I had," Mr. Maynard recalled Mr. Clinton saying.
Mr. Maynard said he would never regret giving that man his vote.
"He is an impressive person," he said. "Anybody who doubts that should just be introduced to him, and after two minutes of conversation, they would know that."

HEADLINE: Leery of the Web, Olympic Officials Set Limits on News

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Christie Ambrosi, the hard-hitting outfielder for the United States Olympic women's softball team, has long had friendly dealings with her hometown newspaper, The Kansas City Star. So, when asked, she readily agreed to write an Olympic diary for The Star's World Wide Web site.
But shortly before she left for Sydney, Australia, in August, she sent an e-mail message to the newspaper, saying, "As far as the diary entry, we aren't allowed to do them during the Olympics." The International Olympic Committee was putting teeth into its often-ignored rule against publication of athletes' Olympic diaries during the Games. 
 Ms. Ambrosi was not alone. Siri Mullinix, the North Carolina-born goalkeeper of the women's soccer team, stopped her online chats with The Greensboro News & Record and said she could not contribute a diary during the Games. The Hartford Courant got the same message from Karen Scavotto, the 18-year-old archer from Enfield, Conn.
The 27th Olympic Games may be remembered for many things -- world records, peacetime logistical planning -- but it will surely be a benchmark in the struggle between those who hold intellectual property rights in sporting events and those seeking to cover sports, especially for the ever-expanding universe of news outlets on the Internet.
Concerned that the power of the Internet could eventually undermine the economic foundation of the modern Olympic movement, the Olympic committee is going to great lengths to control how and where the images and accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the public. The committee's actions echo what is happening in other areas of sports, as both amateur and professional teams and leagues aggressively invoke their property rights to control how and by whom events are covered.
Most of the committee's attention is focused on the Web. Here, streaming video -- still in its infancy -- may eventually attain both the technical quality and reach to cut into television audiences. This could, in turn, dilute the value of the most valuable asset of the Olympics: broadcasting rights. The Web could also spawn a horde of virtual storefronts where those with no rights to Olympic trademarks piggyback on the Olympic name to hawk their wares without returning anything to the nonprofit committee, which supports the athletes and the Games.
The prospects are worrisome enough to make Olympic officials take a hard line now. No athlete diaries or online chats. No streaming video of events -- even months-old replays of the Australian Olympic swimming trials, as the Australian site www.ninemsn.com.au discovered. No use of the Olympic rings to promote news organizations' own Olympic coverage.
Two months before the Games began, the committee filed a lawsuit in federal court in northern Virginia to dislodge 1,800 so-called cybersquatters, who had registered domain names using terms owned by the I.O.C. Names of the defendants took up 40 pages. The lawsuit is pending.
More than 20 private Web monitors on three continents are using the latest search engine technology to monitor possible violations of the I.O.C.'s property rights.
The strict enforcement of the diary rule hit local newspapers hard. Mike Fannin, the sports editor of The Kansas City Star, said, "I would assume that it is their ball and if you want to play, you play by their rules." But, he added: "The readers miss that connection with their local athlete. Christie Ambrosi's a softball player in the Kansas City suburbs. When she walks into a bar, people know who she is. The Olympics -- it's all about representing your hometown, your city, your country."
Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and new media for the International Olympic Committee, is keenly aware of the tension between property rights and unfettered coverage of the Games. But, he said, "I don't think the I.O.C. can be seen in any way limiting speech about the Olympics." He pointed out that 20,000 journalists are in Sydney -- nearly twice as many media people as athletes, all free to cover the Games as they see fit.
It is also true that the most important pieces of news, the results, are released instantaneously and sent immediately by wire services to all publications, online and off. And any journalist can interview the athletes, he added. "It's the most written-about event every four years," he said. "We're very far removed from any notion of limiting speech."
The aggressive enforcement effort, he said, is meant to ensure that "the association between the athlete, the sport, the values and the symbol that represents all this is clear."
The Internet has offered little revenue to the Olympics so far. There are concerns that the Web could cut into television audiences and undermine the economic underpinnings of the Olympic movement. The committee took in about $1.3 billion for television rights to the Sydney games alone. NBC paid $705 million for United States rights.
And though great technological improvements are needed before the Internet can offer high-quality video to large audiences, the Web's reach still expands the power of once-small publications. The existing rule against diaries was never enforced against "small newspapers," Mr. Servan-Schreiber said. Now, on the Web, "nothing is small."
(At least one newspaper, however, has printed an athlete's diary without repercussions. The Newark Star-Ledger ran an account on Thursday from Joetta Clark Diggs, an 800-meter runner. An editor there said no sports officials had objected.)
Still, the new emphasis on restrictions like the diary ban is at least puzzling to some.
Floyd Abrams, a constitutional lawyer with Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, said it was odd that "the increased availability of a means of communication leads to a ruling seeking to assure that less is said." But he said the I.O.C. was not a United States agency and so was not bound by the First Amendment.
The gradual fencing off of information and imagery by sports franchises was well under way before the Olympics. In the last few years, debates have been joined over whether game developments can be distributed instantly by pager (they can, a federal appeals court has ruled).
Earlier this year, Nascar, the stock-car racing league, backed off an attempt to make reporters agree that Nascar was sole owner of "images, sounds and data arising from and during any Nascar event" -- including the racing times and scoring information.
"They were saying, 'If it happens during the event, we own the intellectual property rights to it,' " said Michael Persinger, the sports editor of The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina, the epicenter of the Nascar universe. "You can't own the news."
For the International Olympic Committee -- a nonprofit organization that gives more than 90 percent of its revenue to sports federations, local Olympic committees, organizing committees of host cities and athletes -- the stakes in controlling the Web loom increasingly large, particularly in four, six or eight years, when streaming video on the Web may be far superior to the current fuzzy, jumpy images.
All the issues raised by the Web will be discussed at an Olympic committee meeting in December.
Thus far in the Games, The Associated Press's sports editor said, all scores had been sent out to news organizations instantaneously. "It's been going fine," the editor, Terry Taylor, said.
Given the 15-hour to 18-hour time difference between Sydney and the United States, many dedicated fans are turning to the Web for results. Traffic on the sports sections of all major sites, like sports.yahoo.com, msnbc.com and cnnsi.com, surged in the last week.
Allen Weiner, NetRatings's vice president for analytic services, said he thinks the Web has not cut into the broadcast audience. "People have been using it to determine what they want to watch on TV," he said. "If you were a basketball fan and heard they had a close game against Lithuania, you might be interested in watching."
Still, Mr. Fannin of The Star said, "All these leagues are getting more proprietary about their rights and what's theirs and what's theirs exclusively -- especially when it pertains to the Internet." And when it comes to sports, "it's a seller's market."

HEADLINE: Fear Persists About the Price of Oil

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
For months, Richard Nannarello has been girding his three-story Tudor here for a cold and costly winter. He invested in thermal drapes, removed the radiator covers for more warmth, and recently paid a $129 fee to get a long-term contract with an oil company that caps the price of his heating oil at $1.39 a gallon.
So it came as little relief to Mr. Nannarello when President Clinton ordered the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Friday to help control heating oil prices. Indeed, more than anything, Mr. Nannarello saw it as a temporary measure to win voters for Vice President Al Gore in the November election. 
 "After the election, it may all be forgotten," said Mr. Nannarello, 44, a human resources assistant at the United Nations who spent $1,200 last year on heating bills.
Like Mr. Nannarello, many residents in the New York metropolitan area say their worries have not dissipated even though oil from the strategic reserve is expected to keep their heating bills in check, at least for now.
Energy experts and government officials, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have warned that the price of heating oil could reach its highest level in years because of growing demand worldwide in a market of limited supplies. On Thursday, Mr. Gore joined them in calling for the release of oil from the strategic reserve.
The price of crude oil for November delivery fell by $1.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the president's announcement on Friday, closing at $32.68. Heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41 cents a gallon, to 95.48 cents.
In a telephone interview today, Senator Schumer praised the president's decision to release the oil and predicted that it would have a major impact. "I believe that the price of oil will come down considerably," he said. "My guess is it'll settle at below $30 a barrel." He added, "This is going to make a huge difference for New York families."
For weeks, anxious residents have been taking steps to insulate their homes -- and shield their wallets -- from cold weather and expensive oil. They have run through the stock of weather-stripping and insulation supplies at some hardware stores, rushed to fill their heating tanks before prices rose again, and signed up for contracts that guarantee a steady supply of oil at a fixed cost. Some homeowners are even switching to cheaper heating sources, like wood- and coal-burning stoves.
"Why wait for Jack Frost to come knocking?" said Richard Sanders, 65, a retired machinist from Port Chester, N.Y., who installed a wood stove in August and stocked up on five cords of split wood. "The summer was gone before it started, and now we have a long, cold winter ahead. It'll be a tough one."
Mr. Sanders said he would have bought the $1,500 stove even if he had known that the government would increase the supply of heating oil and thereby lower prices a month later. In the last five years, he said, his bills have doubled to $1,200 a year. "I certainly appreciate what they've done, but I don't know how much it will help," he said. "No matter what you do, it just seems like prices go up every year."
Minaj Patel, 43, who owns a dry-cleaning store in Englewood, N.J., said he had planned to raise his prices next month to offset the growing cost of heating oil, which is used to run his store's presses and machines. Now that may not be necessary. "It's supposed to help us, right?" he said of the release from the strategic oil reserve. "Whatever I can save this winter will be very good, because I'm not a rich man. If I can maintain the same kind of service for my customers without having to pay too much for oil and gas, that would be great."
But many residents and business owners have already decided not to take any chances on what could be a long, cold winter. At the Home Depot in New Rochelle, so many customers have requested caulking and weather-stripping that winter inventories were placed on the shelves in August, two months earlier than usual. The most popular items have since been reordered.
Paul Gencarelli, 28, a construction worker in New Rochelle, emerged from the Home Depot on Thursday afternoon with a 20-foot-long plastic sheet rolled up in his shopping cart. After spending $1,600 for heating oil last winter, he decided to insulate his home by wrapping plastic around the screened-in porch. "It's getting ridiculous," he said. "It's so expensive that I'm doing everything I can to tighten up the windows and everything else."
Other cost-conscious homeowners have been shopping around for the lowest heating oil prices. Since June, for instance, more than 500 people have joined a fuel buyers' program organized by the New York Public Interest Research Group, which negotiates discounts of at least 10 to 30 cents a gallon off retail prices for its 14,000 participants from Albany to New York City and Long Island. "I think consumers should be concerned, and this should be a wake-up call to the amount of energy we are using," said Cathleen Breen, director of the fuel buyers' group.
Hundreds of customers of the Almeida Oil Company, based in Scarsdale, have signed up for the company's program to cap oil prices between $1.39 and $1.59 per gallon (depending on the contract) until June 30, 2001. In past years, it offered a fixed price of 99.5 cents per gallon. "This was the first year I've not fixed the price," said Robert Almeida, the company's owner, who is also an economist, "because the market went up so much that I couldn't buy oil at reasonable enough prices for the customers."
Mr. Nannarello, for his part, said the $129 that he spent for the price cap would ease his mind through the winter. Early Thursday, an Almeida Oil worker arrived at his home to top off the 275-gallon heating tank in his basement. It was the first of 25 stops that day for the worker, Jimmy Pyrch. "Morning, sir," Mr. Pyrch said as he unfastened a hose from his truck and fit it around a pipe on the side of the house. "What do you think, we going to have a cold winter?"
As his customer nodded, Mr. Pyrch twisted a valve to release the flow of heating oil. "I hope so," he said with a broad smile. "For the boss's sake anyway."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS;
With Its Independent Streak, Wisconsin Remains a Tossup

SERIES: BATTLEGROUNDS: Wisconsin

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis., Sept. 22

 BODY:
After almost 14 years in office, more than any other governor in the state's history, Tommy G. Thompson bestrides Wisconsin politics like a colossus. He has built a national reputation as a reformer and innovator, and this summer he headed the committee that drafted the Republican platform in Philadelphia.
But he has never managed to carry his state for his party's presidential nominee. Not for Bob Dole four years ago, and not for George Bush in 1988 or 1992. He tried hard. On Halloween Day, 1992, he whistle-stopped across the state with Mr. Bush, from Mukwonago and Waukesha to Oshkosh and Chippewa Falls, a made-for-the-cameras trip on a train called the Spirit of America. 
 This time, the governor recently proclaimed, "I'm not worried."
If not, he is the only politician in Wisconsin who is not. The race between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore is breathlessly close here, in the estimation of political pros in both parties. Like several other Great Lakes states, this is one of the year's main presidential battlegrounds, although it is a bit smaller than most, with only 11 electoral votes.
Some recent private polls, like one taken for a big Wisconsin union, show an inconclusive edge for Mr. Gore; others show the race even.
This is a quirky state, politically speaking, hard to read, full of ticket-splitters and independents. It produced both the LaFollettes, the great clan of Progressive reformers, and the right-wing zealot Joseph R. McCarthy. Both of its senators, Herb Kohl and Russell D. Feingold, are Democrats, but both take offbeat positions on some issues and work closely with Republicans.
Ross Perot pulled 16 percent of the Wisconsin vote in 1992.
"We're 35 percent Republican and 35 percent Democratic and 35 percent independent," said Bill Dixon of Madison, a Democrat who managed Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign. "It doesn't add up, but then, neither do we."
Wisconsin is made to order, one might think, for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, and he campaigned here on Wednesday, pounding away at "the concentration of power in the hands of a few." Mr. Nader sounded a bit like Fighting Bob LaFollette, and he drew sizable crowds -- more than 1,000 at a rally in Milwaukee and about 1,800 in Madison. In a poll taken in June, he had 16 percent of the vote in traditionally liberal Dane County (Madison), and some Gore backers have warned that he could hurt Mr. Gore in that area.
The vice president's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who campaigned here on Tuesday, and other surrogates argue that a Nader vote is a Bush vote.
"I don't think they have much to fear," said John Bibby, a retired political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. "The closer we get to Election Day, the more people will worry about throwing their vote away. He'll do well in Madison, but not so well elsewhere. Obviously, if it turns out to be really close, even a few percentage points could be decisive."
Mr. Nader is handicapped, of course, by a shortage of money and a resultant inability to match the major parties' television spending.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have been saturating the state with commercials for months. According to a continuing national study by Kenneth Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, they have spent $2.6 million in Green Bay and Milwaukee alone since June 1.
Those cities are two of the places where Mr. Gore has advertised most intensively; this summer, only Flint, Mich., Scranton, Pa., and Pittsburgh saw more Gore commercials than Green Bay and Milwaukee. This month, Green Bay has seen more Bush commercials than any other city except Scranton. This week, the Republicans were trumpeting the governor's new slogan, "Real plans for real people," and the Democrats were replying with the taunt, "George Bush's real plans hurt real people."
Nor have the candidates missed opportunities to campaign here. Mr. Bush spoke to the American Legion national convention in Milwaukee; both nominees spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August. Mr. Gore's first postconvention event was a riverboat trip down the Mississippi, complete with a Mark Twain impersonator, starting from La Crosse in southwest Wisconsin. Perhaps with an eye on possible defectors to Mr. Nader, Mr. Gore arranged for his erstwhile rival, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, to issue a belated endorsement here in Green Bay.
"Wisconsin," said Professor Goldstein, whose study is underwritten by the Pew Charitable Trusts, "is seeing action like it's never had before."
Jeff Mayers, a political reporter in Madison who runs a Web site that has been covering the campaign intensively (http://wispolitics.com), sees the election as a fight, in essence, between Governor Thompson's organization and the state's most powerful union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, a teachers' group with 90,000 members.
The union's president, Terry Craney, was one of the few Gore delegates at the 1988 Democratic convention, and his organization has helped to set up the vice president's major Wisconsin appearances in the last eight years. In 1996, it turned out a crowd of 30,000 for a Gore rally, one of the biggest political gatherings in state history.
Governor Thompson, who attributed the elder George Bush's 1988 defeat in Wisconsin to "just mistake after mistake" by Mr. Bush and his strategists, has helped Governor Bush raise money in the state. Several politicians here said they thought that in the event of a Republican victory in November, Mr. Thompson hoped to be named United States ambassador to Vatican City.
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top national strategist, said in Wisconsin on Thursday that Mr. Bush would return to the state three or four times before Election Day. Mr. Thompson's support, he asserted, will not transfer directly to Mr. Bush but will ensure that those who like the governor and his policies "give us a better hearing."
At the moment, Governor Bush is "a couple points up, a couple points down" in the state, Mr. Rove said.
Darren Schmitz, Mr. Thompson's former press secretary, is running the Bush operation in Wisconsin. He said the organizational foundation laid down over the years by Mr. Thompson would inevitably benefit Mr. Bush.
"But more important," Mr. Schmitz said, "education is the crucial issue in this race. We are an education state, and Governor Thompson is identified with education. He has poured $3 billion into education during his time in office. He has supported the charter school movement and Milwaukee's school voucher program, which is the most comprehensive one in the whole country."
National Democrats and the teachers' union oppose the voucher program, of course, but it is backed by Mayor John O. Norquist of Milwaukee, a four-term Democrat, and it finally triumphed in 1999 when voters ousted antivoucher members of the school board.
Still, Teresa Vilmain, Mr. Gore's top Wisconsin operative, thinks the vice president can win on education and such other issues as health care, the economy and the environment. In this state, Ms. Vilmain said, "we're fighting on our turf." Even so, she added: "It's going to be very tight. We only won here by a few points four years ago. It's totally challenging for us, because we are up against a Republican governor who is totally engaged in this fight."
Mr. Schmitz also sees a struggle to the end. Asked how things stand now, he replied, "I've seen private polls that show it dead even."
Milwaukee remains a major manufacturing city, and Wisconsin has a dozen or more smaller cities with sizable employers, like Wausau and Oshkosh. It also has a significant farm population, which supports the state's noted dairy industry. But here as elsewhere, the suburbs seem to hold the political key this year. Not coincidentally, one of the main Bush offices is in Wauwatosa, west of Milwaukee, a town with a goodly number of Reagan Democrats. Ronald Reagan carried Wisconsin twice, people here recall, and Richard M. Nixon carried it three times -- in each case with a lot of help from Democrats.
Any number of things could tip the race one way or the other.
Low prices for farm products, for instance. Or high oil prices. This is one of the states that is paying runaway sums for gasoline, and that is a topic mentioned by many voters when asked what issues are on their minds. But so far, they do not seem to have decided whom to blame for the increasingly large share of their budgets taken up by heating their houses and operating their cars.
Mr. Gore made a pre-emptive strike this week by calling on President Clinton to release some of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and Mr. Bush replied at once, accusing him of playing politics with a major element of national security.
Another imponderable is the possible crosscurrents that Senator Kohl's re-election race could generate. A popular figure, he is expected to win easily, but he is not much of a team player -- his slogan is "nobody's senator but yours" -- and many of Wisconsin's ticket-splitters might find a Bush-Kohl combination attractive. Or so some Gore senior strategists speculate.

HEADLINE: Cost Hinders Effort To Reclaim a Castle;
After $7 Million, Newark Wearies Of Restoring a Looted Landmark

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Rising like a Bavarian castle on a knoll overlooking the skyscrapers downtown, the Krueger-Scott Mansion has long been one of this city's architectural jewels, a relic of the gilded age when Newark was a proud industrial powerhouse and High Street was its boulevard of nouveau-riche extravagance.
The 26-room house was built by Gottfried Krueger, a German immigrant who rose from poverty to become Newark's most flamboyant beer baron. Clad in salmon sandstone, its slate roof punctuated by six chimneys and a soaring turret, it was the largest residence in town when it was completed in 1888. It was also the first in New Jersey to have an elevator. 
 The house was later the home of Louise Scott Roundtree, a South Carolina-born former maid who had become a beauty-parlor magnate. Many believe she was the first black woman in the city to become a millionaire.
While $7 million worth of work has restored the exterior, the house is a ruin inside. Years of municipal neglect and repeated looting have robbed the house of its crystal chandeliers and pearl-inlaid wainscoting. After a decade of work -- and, some say, wasteful spending -- plans to turn the house into an African-American cultural center have been frozen by the Municipal Council, which refuses to allocate any more money for a project that was originally scheduled for completion in 1993.
"Looking at that place, there's no way anyone could say $7 million was spent on that building," said Donald Tucker, a Council member whose recent vote helped defeat a proposal that would have allowed the Newark Housing Authority to finish the job. "It's an abysmal failure, a total waste of taxpayer money."
The Council's refusal to spend more money puts it at odds with Mayor Sharpe James, who has vowed to finish the project, at a cost of $5 million more. "If I have to, I'm going to move into that building myself and force the city to provide me with heat, electricity and plumbing," he said in an interview. "We've got to keep the legacy of Louise Scott alive."
For a city struggling to rebuild its shattered ego, the Krueger-Scott project has become an outsized symbol of Newark's faded glories, bungled opportunities, and aspirations for a more glorious future. As the home of a self-made black businesswoman, the house is also freighted with issues of race and black pride.
Although Newark is enjoying a long-awaited revival, it remains one of the nation's poorest cities, one that many say can ill afford to spend millions renovating a Victorian estate. Although he wants to see the building rehabilitated, Mr. James no longer supports public financing for a historically accurate restoration. He simply wants the house brought into public use, even if that means a gut renovation or a deal with a private corporation that would get office and meeting space in return for its investment.
"We are not a cash cow," Mr. James said. "The citizens won't support open-ended spending."
In many ways, the fortunes and misfortunes of the Krueger-Scott Mansion mirror those of this battered city, which was one of the nation's wealthiest until the riots of 1967 and the ensuing depopulation drained Newark of its prosperity.
It takes some imagination to picture the days when High Street was lined with opulent estates, each one bigger and more outlandish than the last.
Now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, the street has become a hodgepodge of weatherworn stately homes, empty lots and synagogues that have been recycled into churches. Next door to the Krueger-Scott Mansion is a 21-story apartment building, Hill Manor, that is awaiting demolition, part of the city's effort to replace its high-rise housing projects with town houses.
In building his fantasy home, Mr. Krueger is said to have been inspired by the baroque castles of his native Baden.
"People considered it the most garish thing they'd ever seen," said Charles F. Cummings, the city historian, who has written about High Street's genteel past. "But he loved it. He also loved to rub people's noses in the fact that he was a penniless German immigrant who came to own one of the biggest breweries in town."
Dressed in Louis XIV decor, the house was outfitted with rosewood floors, stained-glass windows, embossed leather walls and a five-story atrium capped with an elaborate copper-filigreed dome.
The Kruegers moved out at the end of World War I, and the house became the headquarters of a construction company. In 1925, it was bought by the Valley of Newark Scottish Rite, a Masonic organization that left its painted gold insignia on the dining room walls.
Mrs. Roundtree, who owned a hotel and a chain of beauty schools, bought the building in 1958 and converted it back into a residence. Over the years, she used the rambling house as a nursery school, a neighborhood cultural center and offices for the Scott College of Beauty Culture.
By the time Mrs. Roundtree died in 1982, her fortune had dwindled and the city, saying she owed back taxes, seized the house and evicted her family. Left unattended, the house was stripped of its furnishings, its massive organ and the hand-carved baroque columns that supported a staircase.
"It's been horribly cannibalized," said Douglas Eldridge, executive director of the Newark Preservation and Landmarks Committee, who toured the house before Ms. Scott's death. "If the city had secured it when it took it over, things wouldn't have gotten so bad."
By the late 1980's, a group of preservationists were rallying around the house. In 1990 they won a $625,800 grant from the New Jersey Historic Trust and a spot for the house on the National Register of Historic Places. The city of Newark matched that amount, and over the years devoted more than $4 million to turning the home into a center focusing on the black contribution to Newark's development. The federal government contributed an additional $1.5 million.
In 1993, Mayor James recruited a curator from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Catherine J. Lenix-Hooker, to raise money, resurrect the building and get the cultural program off the ground. Although her book parties, concerts and poetry readings were deemed a success, the restoration effort, critics say, fell victim to runaway overspending.
Work stopped for a year while Ms. Lenix-Hooker looked for a company to reproduce 23,000 thin "Lincoln Red" bricks. Specialized craftsmen were hired to replicate the terra-cotta tiles, the coachmen's portico, and the carved caryatids that hold up the massive front porch. All 140 windows were replaced, and structural work was done to prop up listing walls.
When Ms. Lenix-Hooker came back to City Hall two years ago looking for more money, the Council balked. The mayor, facing criticism and negative press, pulled her off the job. "I think the project was beyond her talents," he said.
But Ms. Lenix-Hooker has plenty of defenders, who say she was sacrificed to satisfy the Council's mounting discontent. Historic restoration, they point out, is a costly endeavor, something that many elected officials failed to appreciate.
"The work called for a high level of craftsmanship and high quality materials that will last for decades," said Harriette Hawkins, director of the New Jersey Historic Trust. "For a new building of that scale and bravado, you couldn't even put a price tag on it."
Ms. Lenix-Hooker, now in charge of marketing for Newark Symphony Hall, defends her work, saying the house was in worse shape than anyone had expected. "They don't understand that this was not about patching up an old building," she said. Once the press labeled the house a white elephant, she said, raising private money became impossible.
She added that her fund-raising efforts were eclipsed by those for the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, then under construction, which had dozens of staff members devoted to raising money. "I was the only one doing this, and in the end, I got terribly bashed," she said.
Since work stopped two years ago, the site has been ringed by a chain-link fence and guarded round the clock. Despite Council opposition, the housing authority is still considering its own rehabilitation plan, although it has yet to say what the building's final use would be.
Seeking a better assessment of the project's potential costs, the agency hired a team of engineers this month to survey the moldering interior and probe its underlying structure. Although hints of the building's former grandeur are still evident, including heavy oak doors and gilded rococo plasterwork, much of the house is a wreck. The debris-filled elevator slumps in its shaft, the fruitwood parquet floors have been damaged by years of rain, and the elaborate Craftsman-style banister has been mangled by looters.
As he inspected the decay recently, Peter Meyer, president of PPE, an engineering firm, shook his head with a mix of awe and despair. "It's definitely doable," he said. "But it's clearly a major, major job." The housing authority has said it is willing to spend upward of $5 million to make the building useful again.
Although the Krueger-Scott Mansion may get another chance at life, it seems increasingly doubtful that the home's interior will get the exacting restoration that preservationists and others have long expected. And some worry that in its haste to finish the job, the city will jettison its original purpose, to create a cultural center devoted to black history.
Among those eager to see the house brought back to life is Genevieve Tobin Scranton, one of Gottfried Krueger's granddaughters. Mrs. Scranton, 76, who lives in Vermont, would like to see the house turned into a museum of Newark's brewery past. "We all feel so helpless," she said. "When I think of what the house was, and what it has become, I feel sick."

An Independent Streak Makes Wisconsin a Tossup
The race between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in Wisconsin is close. Like several other Great Lakes states, this is one of the year's main presidential battlegrounds, although it has only 11 electoral votes. The two nominees have spent $2.6 million in Green Bay and Milwaukee alone since June 1. A1
 
Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush's plan for providing prescription drug benefits would force some low-income elderly people to go to welfare offices to qualify. Mr. Bush's aides called that contention "pure fantasy" and "a classic scare tactic." A21
 
Mr. Gore said he did not have any knowledge of a "mole" providing his campaign with secrets about his opponent's activities. Mr. Bush's advisers said the Gore campaign's suspension on Saturday of a junior staff member who had boasted about a mole in the Bush campaign raised serious questions about what officials with the Gore campaign might know about the situation.

HEADLINE: High-Speed Web Access Creeping Along

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Kevin Newman knew that his small Chelsea advertising company could not be competitive while relying on slow-speed computer modems. The company designs Web pages that often include streaming video and animated graphics. But its dial-up modems, which received data over regular telephone lines, were so slow that it often took minutes to get online access to some of the Web pages his employees had created.
So last year, Mr. Newman ordered four high-speed Internet digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L.'s, from Bell Atlantic for his ad agency, the William H. Brown Company. Sometimes, he wishes he had not. "There would be days I would come in when I had no phone lines and no Internet access at all," he said last week. 
 That happened after he waited nearly 10 weeks for installation after placing the order. Once the high-bandwidth lines were in place, he added, the service crashed often and there were software malfunctions, and it was often difficult to reach a Bell Atlantic technician.
Mr. Newman, who is the company's president, is not alone in his frustration with the D.S.L. service from Bell Atlantic, which recently merged with GTE to become to Verizon Communications.
In dozens of interviews, Silicon Alley executives listed things like Manhattan's high rents and onerous city taxes as the greatest long-term obstacles to the growth of high-technology businesses in the city. But when asked what was the greatest short-term threat to their ability to compete with top technology companies in other regions, the executives uniformly placed what they called Verizon's sluggish response to demand and its attempts to frustrate D.S.L. competitors at the top of their lists.
Andrew Brust, vice chairman of the New York Software Industry Association, a trade group, said, "The time it takes to get a data line and the effort it takes to keep it working is really important to New York and the growth of Silicon Alley."
Technology industries are driving the economies of several regions, from Silicon Valley in California to the Route 128 corridor outside Boston to Montgomery County, Md., where biotechnology firms have clustered.
Executives of Silicon Alley businesses believe that one of the main factors in recruiting and retaining good companies is being able to assure them that they and their employees can get high-speed Internet connections at home and at work. But it has not been easy guaranteeing that with Verizon, one of the largest local providers of high-speed Internet connections.
Jack Hidary, president of EarthWeb, one of the first Silicon Alley companies, said he considered Verizon's problems with its D.S.L. service to be an impediment to the industry's expansion in the metropolitan region. Mr. Hidary said it was "insane" that Time Warner Cable's high-speed Internet service, called Road Runner, is doing so well competing against Verizon D.S.L. Cable modems can be faster than D.S.L., but the connections are generally less secure and their speed can be less reliable, which is why small businesses often choose D.S.L.
"We are not seeing what we need when it comes to the whole process of wiring the city up for high-speed, secure access," Mr. Hidary added, referring to D.S.L. "Road Runner is simply taking over because you can get an appointment faster."
Cable modems use the same type of wire that brings cable television programming into a building. In general, cable downloading speeds average about 20 times as fast as a standard 56 kilobits-per-second telephone modem, while D.S.L. lines run about 11 times as fast as a 56k connection. But cable modems run on shared lines that can slow significantly if many people in the same area have the service.
Silicon Alley business executives said Verizon's missteps started around 1996, during D.S.L.'s infancy, when the company did not offer D.S.L. service in New York at the same time it was offering it in other parts of the country. At the time, one Verizon official compared it to testing a show on the road before taking it to Broadway. They say the show never really opened on Broadway because Verizon did not invest the money needed to upgrade its network and wiring or to train its sales and installation workers.
Verizon officials acknowledge that there have been problems with D.S.L., which they attribute to New York's complicated and aged wiring and the difficulties of being at the forefront of a new industry.
"This industry is only two years old" in New York City, said Larry Plumb, a spokesman for Verizon. "It is moving very fast, and you have a lot of demands, with a lot of people trying to work together."
But some industry leaders, including the New York Software Industry Association and the New York New Media Association, a trade group, have claimed that Verizon problems go beyond the complicated nature of the D.S.L. business. They complained that Verizon's decision to delay D.S.L. service in New York and the way it treated competing D.S.L. providers have slowed the growth of D.S.L. service in the city.
And they also charge that Verizon made it difficult for the other providers to flourish, because it ran its own D.S.L. service over telephone wires that were already installed, but forced competitors to put in their own lines, driving up those companies' costs and the costs to consumers. Verizon officials have denied trying to stifle competition.
Under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission, Verizon promised in May to open up its network of existing lines to D.S.L. competitors, a move that regulators say will lower costs and reduce installation delays.
Mr. Plumb, the Verizon spokesman, said D.S.L. service should improve. "It is difficult in New York because of the existing infrastructure," he said. "In other parts of the country, it is not quite as hard."
On that point, at least, Verizon and its critics are in agreement.

HEADLINE: A Great Hope of Physics Falls on Hard Times

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ 

DATELINE: LIVERMORE, Calif.

 BODY:
Two years ago at a scientific conference in Madison, Wis., a physicist named E. Michael Campbell gave a triumphant progress report on a project to build a stadium-size laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Somehow the big laser, which would be the most powerful ever built, had won Congressional approval despite a construction cost of $1.2 billion and another $1 billion for research and development. 
 The key to this remarkable success, the physicist said, could be found in its threefold attraction to science and society. When the project was completed in 2004, its 192 individual laser beams would converge on a tiny fuel pellet, crushing and heating it until fusion reactions among its atoms began spewing out nuclear energy.
Those experiments would allow bomb makers to study the physics of nuclear weapons without exploding them, helping to assure the reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile. They would also let engineers explore the possibility of commercial power plants based on this type of "laser fusion," and they would offer scientists the chance to probe matter under conditions never before created in a laboratory.
After using those advantages to help score a victory for the project, called the National Ignition Facility, or N.I.F., the scientist directing the project told the conference, "I see how hard it is to get a billion dollars."
Participants listened with a mixture of envy and admiration to the man they knew as Dr. Campbell. Many were deeply dispirited by recent revelations of sky-high costs, technical questions and an overoptimistic sales message that would soon bring Congressional wrath, and its budget ax, down on another titanic fusion project, this one based on powerful magnetic fields and called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.
Now, after a series of plot twists, the fabulous laser could face a similar fate. Events since that conference have damaged Livermore's credibility, derailed scientists' careers and perhaps threatened the nation's ability to safeguard its nuclear stockpile. Mr. Campbell even turned out not to have the Princeton Ph.D. that his peers assumed he had.
Moreover, in an ominous echo of his words in Madison, N.I.F. will cost at least $1 billion more than originally expected. If the project survives, it may have reached its nadir on Sept. 7, when project officials were denounced on the floor of the United States Senate.
As negotiations between the House and Senate for the fiscal 2001 budget conclude, lawmakers must now decide whether to move about $135 million to N.I.F. construction. The reallocation, which has been requested by the Energy Department, would nearly triple the Clinton administration's original request for the project and save it for the time being.
Saying that its scientists simply underestimated the complexity of building the laser, laboratory officials dismiss all accusations that technical problems were intentionally covered up. Still, the plunge in the project's political stock has been breathtaking.
"It looked as if they had all the answers, and they were moving on the project," said Dr. Dale M. Meade, head of advanced fusion concepts at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, who attended the Madison meeting and who specializes in the sort of fusion that the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor might have produced. "And since that time, the roof has fallen in on them."
Even so, Dr. George H. Miller, a former nuclear weapons designer, who is now associate director for National Ignition Facility programs at Livermore, argues that the laser is the only vehicle for scientists to study the high temperatures and densities of matter that occur in an exploding nuclear weapon -- except, of course, in actual nuclear tests, which the nation has not conducted since declaring a moratorium on them in 1992.
"N.I.F. is one of the major experimental facilities that we were lacking when we ended nuclear testing," Dr. Miller said. The purpose of the laser, he said, is to "allow us to maintain our nuclear deterrent, and to maintain it in a condition that is safe and reliable -- but do it without nuclear testing."
The American program to achieve that goal, called science-based stockpile stewardship, would eventually rely on data from the laser, lower-energy experiments involving high explosives, and information from nuclear explosions before the moratorium. Powerful computers would weave together all of that data as a substitute for actual tests.
Dr. Miller said it was crucial that fuel pellets crushed by the laser beams become hot and dense enough to achieve a condition called ignition, in which fusion reactions are pouring out relatively large amounts of energy, just as a bomb does. If the pellets do not ignite, he said, "it will call into question whether or not the whole stockpile stewardship paradigm will work."
Physicists have an imperfect understanding of the physics of ignition, and Dr. Miller concedes that that issue was controversial even when it was assumed that the laser could be built exactly as planned. It still is not known, for example, whether the precisely spherical implosion of the pellets needed for ignition can be achieved, since even tiny irregularities can cause energy to squirt out sideways and quench the process.
Dr. Gerald A. Navratil, an applied physicist at Columbia University, said that because numerous scientific review panels gave the laser project a passing grade, its ballooning costs and technical problems raised still more troubling questions.
"Even as an insider, you have to say that it causes you to question the way the system works today," Dr. Navratil said. "I think it would benefit science if we learn from this and make sure it doesn't happen again."
A commentary published in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Nature by Dr. Stephen Bodner, former head of laser fusion at the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and Christopher Paine, a senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, titled "When Peer Review Fails," came to similar conclusions on the project's history. "The advocates became captives to their own rhetoric, and dissenting voices were ignored," those authors wrote.
Ground was broken for the National Ignition Facility in 1997. Late the next year after the Madison conference, in the first hint that something was seriously wrong, an internal Livermore review led by Dr. Edward I. Moses, an engineer familiar with large projects, determined that constructing the laser would cost far more than physicists on the project had estimated, in part because the physicists in charge had not considered the difficulty involved in putting together the individual high-tech pieces.
But as construction continued, officials at Livermore, including Dr. C. Bruce Tarter, the laboratory's director, failed to pass that information along to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson before he gave a speech in June of last year hailing the project as on time and within its budget.
"Each person would be told that there was a potential -- because that is the way it was phrased for a long time -- a potential serious issue," said Dr. Tarter. "The reaction was, 'How can that be?' And can't possibly be right."
Dr. Moses' work turned out to be solid. A few months after the disastrous speech by Mr. Richardson, anonymous faxes to Livermore revealed that Mr. Campbell did not actually have the doctorate that he had allowed the laboratory to believe he had. Mr. Campbell eventually resigned. At about the same time, Mr. Richardson, having learned of the overruns, angrily announced a management shake-up at the project, a large fine for the University of California, which manages the lab under contract with the Energy Department, and other measures intended to put the project back on track.
Finally, the General Accounting Office, the Congressional auditing agency, reported last month that the true costs of the project would be at least $4 billion and that it would not be finished before 2008. The agency also confirmed that the laboratory and low-level Energy Department officials had failed to disclose the problems once they knew of them.
"They lied to us," Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said during budget deliberations on Sept. 7. "They simply lied to us."
Mr. Richardson has moved to save the project from collapse by asking that Congress reallocate $135 million from other programs to N.I.F. construction in the fiscal year 2001, nearly tripling the Clinton administration's original request. Of that effort, Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the energy subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he believed that the "G.A.O. report will haunt it."
The project's immediate fate rests with end-of-year budget negotiations in Congress. For their part, project officials say that the overruns amount to $1 billion, and that the other costs found by G.A.O. had already been in the laser's operating budget and were not a surprise.
These officials also point out that it was an internal review at Livermore that turned up the problems in the first place after numerous external reviews missed them, and they say that there had never been intentional deception about the overruns -- simply a particularly ill-timed period of disbelief and confusion leading up to Mr. Richardson's speech.
Last week, walking through the cavernous N.I.F. building, which is mostly complete although no laser components have yet been installed, Dr. Moses said that the project's budget was now realistic and that all remaining engineering problems could be overcome.
"The only thing that'll stop us is people not giving us the money," said Dr. Moses, who is now the laser's project manager, as he looked down from a walkway onto a complex of huge concrete braces, reminiscent of an indoor Stonehenge, but painted in pastels and designed to hold laser optics and long "beam tubes" through which the light would travel.
Dr. Moses compares the earlier management problems to those that arise when technology visionaries in private industry form companies but lack practical and organizational expertise. He said that a large part of the cost increases came about because project officials simply did not think about how the laser parts would actually be put together.
For example, he said, the beam tubes must remain free of dust that could drift onto optics and heat up, burning the optical surfaces when the powerful laser light flashed upon them. But while the tubes are constructed in special factory clean rooms, they must be joined together in the N.I.F. building, which would ordinarily contain dust. Project officials had not thought about those things.
"When you started thinking about those, which any project manager does, you realize there was a hole in the organization -- there was a hole in the plan," Dr. Moses said.
Project critics maintain that the final set of optics that will focus the intense beams onto the target will be susceptible to damage no matter how clean they are. But Dr. Moses said that at worst, the problem could be dealt with by changing those optics occasionally, and he hinted that the laboratory was close to a technical solution involving a treatment, called annealing, of the surfaces.
Still, the project faces other doubts.
At one point, physicists believed that a much smaller laser at Livermore, called Nova, would ignite its pellets. Nova never came close, but Dr. Miller says that scientists understand the process much better now and that he thinks the odds are good for N.I.F. The project's other credibility problems, however, have caused this otherwise obscure chapter of science history to be much discussed recently.
The immense price tag for N.I.F., even if it works perfectly and ignites, has also eroded hopes that anything resembling this kind of laser technology can ever be used economically to create commercial power.
Even basic scientists, who once could not wait to tether their wagons to a machine they could never afford on their own, are having second thoughts. That possibility once seemed "pretty exciting" to some scientists, said Dr. Michael E. Mauel, a physicist at Columbia University. Now, he said, the idea sounds "not very cost effective."

Chart: "Creating A Fusion Reaction"
Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hope they will be able to set off a thermonuclear reaction by using laser beams in the stadium-size National Ignition Facility, which is under construction.
 
1. The beams start as an optical pulse in the master oscillator room.
2. They make four passes through amplifiers that increase their strength.
3. Filters smooth out irregularities in the beams.
4. The beams are split into 48 sets of four and directed to the target chamber.
5. The beams enter the chamber and converge on a fuel target, perhaps igniting a fusion pellet.
 
The Challenges
 
Some scientists have expressed concern that some elements of the facility may not be up to the task of igniting a fusion pellet.
 
FINAL OPTICS ASSEMBLY -- Optics convert the laser beams from the infrared part of the spectrum to the ultraviolet. Imperfections in the optics could cause the beam to damage their surfaces.
 
THE TARGET -- The laser beams heat the inner surface of the cylindrical target, causing it to emit X-rays. The X-rays cause the surface of the fuel pellet to blow away, collapsing the interior and initiating fusion. Imperfections in the pellet could cause the implosion to be asymmetric, allowing energy to squirt out sideways instead of igniting the pellet.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Increased 9.3% in August

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Cheaper borrowing costs encouraged Americans to snap up existing homes in August, giving sales their biggest lift in 14 months. But economists said the rebound would not deter the Federal Reserve from leaving interest rates unchanged at its meeting next week.
The National Association of Realtors reported today that sales of previously occupied homes shot up by a surprising 9.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million. 
 "Mortgage rates came down, which make houses more affordable, plus August is a big home-buying month; people try to get settled before school starts," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group.
In August, the average interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage was 8.03 percent, down from 8.15 percent in July. But that was higher than the 7.94 percent rate in August 1999. Since August, 30-year rates have edged down. They stood at 7.90 percent last week.
The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times over the last 15 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. A spate of other economic reports shows that the Fed's rate increases are working to moderate economic growth and that has helped to ease mortgage rates.
Against this backdrop, analysts predicted that the Fed would leave interest rates alone not only on Oct. 3 but also for the rest of this year.
August's big increase came after existing-home sales plummeted 9.2 percent in July.
By region, the West posted the biggest gain, with sales rising 16.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million in August.
In the Midwest, sales rose 10.6 percent, to a rate of 1.15 million units. They grew 5.8 percent in the South, to a rate of 2.01 million, and sales went up 4.6 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 680,000.

 BODY:
The MBNA Corporation agreed today to pay as much as $7.8 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the company, the world's No. 3 credit card issuer, of luring consumers with misleading advertisements about low-rate cards.
MBNA will pay up to $6.5 million -- plus $1.28 million in lawyers fees -- to reimburse customers deceived by ads about how much they would save by transferring their credit card balances to an MBNA account, consumer lawyers said in federal court. 
 Andrew Spark, a Florida lawyer, sued MBNA in 1996 saying that the bank's ads did not disclose that new purchases would not carry the low interest rate promoted in the ads.
Under the settlement, the 1.8 million people who signed up for the 6.9 percent introductory rate will receive $3.57 to make up for the lost savings promised.

HEADLINE: 'Positive Spirit' as Arafat and Barak Meet

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 25

 BODY:
In an effort to improve a strained relationship, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, met tonight for the first time since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago.
Israeli and Palestinian officials do not expect anything tangible to come from the closed-door, late-night meeting. They do not presume to hope that the deadlock in the peace negotiations will be broken. 
 Rather, relations have deteriorated to the point where a mere meeting of the leaders is considered progress, and especially one held in an intimate setting -- in Mr. Barak's private home in the central Israeli town of Kochav Yair, according to the Israeli radio.
After the three-hour meeting ended, Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman said in a statement that it had been held "in a very good atmosphere and a positive spirit."
For weeks, Mr. Barak had insisted that there was no point in a meeting if Mr. Arafat did not agree in advance to consider American proposals to bridge the differences between them, especially on the seemingly intractable issue of Jerusalem's status. But under pressure from American officials and from dovish Israeli ministers, particularly Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, Mr. Barak dropped his precondition. President Clinton called and spoke with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat during the meeting, Mr. Barak's office said.
After the Kochav Yair meeting, senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to fly to Washington for talks in the next few days. American mediators have prepared a working paper that summarizes points of concord and differences between the parties and suggests solutions, but it is unclear whether they will use the document.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said today that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright informed Mr. Barak and Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami over the weekend that the Americans were going to hold off on presenting the document. The newspaper said the Americans had identified too many disparities on almost every issue to formulate a workable overall proposal.
Mr. Ben Ami visited Amman, Jordan, and Cairo today to promote the idea of entrusting the sacred heart of the Old City, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, to the United Nations Security Council to resolve conflicting Israeli and Palestinian demands for sovereignty over the site.
Speaking in English to reporters, Mr. Ben Ami announced, "There is going to be an agreement this week!" Quickly, he corrected himself and said he had meant a meeting, not an agreement. Then he repeated his mistake, laughing and saying his dual slips revealed how badly he wanted a breakthrough.
Mr. Barak told his cabinet this weekend that he would be willing to accept a partial deal with the Palestinians that set a time line for resolving issues, like Jerusalem. Haaretz endorsed the idea in an editorial today as a way to "prevent a crisis."
But the Palestinians have rejected both the proposal for United Nations control over the site and the idea of a partial agreement.
If tonight's meeting is meant to re-establish a link between the two leaders, that will be no easy feat. A senior American official said recently that Mr. Arafat never cottoned to Mr. Barak's terse military manner, and that the Americans constantly find themselves trying to interpret Mr. Barak's intentions to Mr. Arafat.
Muhammed Rachid, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Arafat, said rapport between the two leaders never gelled. This summer, right before Camp David, Mr. Rachid said Mr. Barak always gave the impression that he thought he was smarter than anyone else in the room; and maybe he was, Mr. Rachid allowed.
But Mr. Barak made it clear that he felt that if he just had several minutes alone with each individual, he could convince them all that his way was right for everybody, Mr. Rachid said.
And, Mr. Rachid suggested, that is not a good way to do business with Mr. Arafat.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Candidate In the Balance

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers today -- no oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making crazy promises. That's because Japan has been preparing for this day since the 1973 oil crisis by steadily introducing natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit and conservation, and thereby steadily reducing its dependence on foreign oil. And unlike the U.S., the Japanese never wavered from that goal by falling off the wagon and becoming addicted to S.U.V.'s -- those they just make for the Americans.
Imagine if America had that sort of steely focus. Imagine, in fact, if at this time of soaring oil prices and endangered environments, America had a presidential candidate who could offer a realistic plan for how to preserve our earth in the balance.
Wait a minute -- that was supposed to be Al Gore, but in the heat of the campaign Mr. Gore has shamelessly offered us instead a fly-by-night plan for putting America out of balance. The new Gore energy theory is to demonize the oil companies, tap into the nation's strategic oil reserve -- which only a few months ago he declared shouldn't be touched to manipulate prices -- and talk about developing new magic energy-saving technologies that will create jobs in the swing states where Mr. Gore needs to get elected and will allow Americans to keep driving gas-guzzling big cars and indulging their same energy-consuming habits without pain. 
 How nice! How easy! And how far from what's really required to free us from the grip of OPEC. Here is how we got into this pickle, which you won't hear from Mr. Gore:
OPEC came along in the 1970's and pushed the crude oil price up too far too fast, and it created a global economic slowdown, triggering both energy conservation and widespread new exploration outside of OPEC. The result was an oversupply of oil from 1981 to 1998 -- culminating in 1998 with oil falling to $10 a barrel, when the glut coincided with Asia's economic crisis.
This cheap oil lulled us into retreating from conservation, and was like a huge tax cut. And because it coincided with the technology revolution, it added to the booming U.S. economy, which helped fuel a world economic recovery. But this boom eventually stretched OPEC's capacity for quality oil, used up most of the world's oil tankers and once again pushed up prices. As such, today we either have to start to consume less oil -- by shrinking our S.U.V.'s, raising gasoline taxes and again taking conservation seriously -- or find more non-OPEC oil, which means figuring out how to tap more of Alaska's huge natural gas reserves without spoiling Alaska's pristine environment. Or else we pay the price.
Mr. Gore knows this, but instead of laying it on the line he opted for an Olympic-quality, full-body pander -- offering a quick fix to garner votes, and pain-free solutions for the future. Prime the pumps, pump the polls and pay later. Don't get me wrong, tapping the strategic reserve makes some sense to ease the current distribution crisis -- but doing it without also offering a real program for consuming less oil and finding more makes no sense at all.
It's also dangerous. Another name for the Gore strategy would be "The Saddam Hussein Rehabilitation Act of 2000." Because tapping into the strategic reserve, without conservation or exploration, only guarantees OPEC's dominance. And when the oil market remains tight, it means that Saddam is in an ideal position to hold America hostage. Any time he threatens to take any of his oil off the market, he can make the price soar.
Mr. Gore's oil pander also reminds many Democrats of what it is that bothers them about the vice president. Many Democrats really are not wild about him, yet they know they have to vote for him over Mr. Bush. They would at least like to feel good about that vote.
But when you hear Mr. Gore bleating that "I will work for the day when we are free forever of the dominance of big oil and foreign oil" -- without leveling with Americans that the only way to do that is by us consuming less and drilling more -- you just want to cover your ears. Surely Mr. Gore is better than that. Surely Gore supporters are entitled to expect more from him. I guess all they can hope for now is that he will show more spine and intellectual honesty as a president than he has as a candidate. You really start to wonder, though.

HEADLINE: Senator and Delegate Back Plan to Reopen Pennsylvania Avenue

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Mayor Anthony A. Williams, backed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Eleanor Holmes Norton, this city's nonvoting Congressional delegate, today urged the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, calling it a "visual blight" to "America's Main Street."
The street was closed after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, but Mr. Williams unveiled an architectural plan by the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and a security study by the Rand Corporation that he said showed a way to safeguard the president and those working at the White House. 
 The key element would be solid pedestrian bridges that would permit access by cars and even by sport utility vehicles less than 7 feet, 6 inches high -- but not trucks like the one used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
The proposal also calls for narrowing the avenue, which once held eight lanes of traffic, to four lanes and bowing it away from the White House -- drawn from a design once suggested by Thomas Jefferson.
The Secret Service was cool to the proposal. "We are agreeable to sit down with anybody on this issue to hear anyone's proposal and concerns," said Jim Mackin, a Secret Service spokesman.
He said the agency had received a summary of the proposal and added that from "what we have seen so far, in our opinion, the same vulnerabilities exist that led to the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue."
"However, we have not received the full report at this point to further evaluate the proposal," he said.
A meeting involving the proponents, the Secret Service and Lawrence H. Summers, secretary of the treasury, which oversees the Secret Service, will be held later this week, government officials said.
But Delegate Norton and Senator Moynihan were each sharply critical of the Secret Service this morning.
Ms. Norton called it a "secret police," and said it "operates with tunnel vision, considering security almost alone, not other American values or the American people."
Mr. Moynihan, the retiring senior senator from New York who has worked to develop Pennsylvania Avenue for four decades, said the service pursued the impossible goal of "zero risk," and would accept this plan "if they have any reason left to them at all."
The plan was put together by the Federal City Council, a private, nonprofit business-supported organization. Its president, former Senator Bob Dole, issued a statement saying, "The closed section of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House not only symbolizes giving in to our fear of terrorism, but it has resulted in literally cutting in half the downtown of the nation's Capital."
He said that "fundamental American values, such as openness and accessibility, must not be sacrificed for the sake of security."
The two major party presidential candidates -- one of whom will be in a position to decide what to do -- reacted with cautious support.
Doug Hattaway, Vice President Al Gore's spokesman, said Mr. Gore "would like to look into reopening Pennsylvania Avenue and would look forward to reviewing the proposal."
Gov. George W. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said that if elected, Mr. Bush "would meet with the Secret Service to get their best judgment on the implications of opening up Pennsylvania Avenue. He is keenly aware of the sensitivities in Washington, D.C., to the problems that have been created by the closing."
The Republican Party platform promises, "We will reopen Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House as a symbolic expression of our confidence in the restoration of the rule of law." The Democratic platform is silent on the subject.
The official White House response, first reported today by The Washington Post, did not deal with any concerns other than security.
Elliot Diringer, the White House deputy press secretary, said: "The safety of the president, the first family and visitors, as well as the protection of America's first home, are paramount concerns. We have had a preliminary briefing from the Federal City Council and we have asked them to brief Secretary Summers and the Secret Service. We look forward to receiving the details of their proposal and considering the views of Congresswoman Norton and Senator Moynihan."
The Rand study argued that the reshaped and narrowed avenue, the pedestrian bridges and state-of-the-art detection technology "could achieve the goal of securing the president's personal protection from catastrophic truck bomb threats while still remaining true to the principles of open access and unrestricted movement around our nation's most important historical landmarks." The study said the Secret Service and the Treasury Department had been unwilling to meet with the study authors, who got their security information from the F.B.I. instead.
Security and openness are not the only issues. Terence Golden, chairman of the Federal City Council, said the closing of the main east-west thoroughfare "is strangling our transportation and our economy."
Harvey Joyner of the Parsons Transportation Group said the avenue used to carry 29,000 vehicles a day, which have been diverted to other streets.
The traffic-free area in front of the White House is now used by pedestrians, skateboarders and roller-hockey players. The tour buses that once idled there now park on the other side of Lafayette Park.
Another change made in 1995, blocking 13,000 vehicles a day from westbound lanes on E Street south of the White House, ends this fall when reconstruction of the street further from the White House is completed.

ADD PEDESTRIAN FOOTBRIDGES -- The footbridges, at each end of the block, would restrict any vehicle over 7 feet 6 inches high. This would bar trucks or buses, which could more easily conceal explosive devices, but allow cars and light trucks through.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Fall as Investors Worry About Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices slipped again yesterday, pulled down by continued worries about coming earnings reports from big technology companies.
It appeared during morning trading that the impact of Intel's warning late Thursday about a shortfall in its third-quarter revenue figures had entirely dissipated. The Nasdaq composite index opened higher and remained in positive territory for a good part of the session. 
 But sellers began to lighten or eliminate positions in big-cap technology names later on, reasoning that if Intel was having problems, other companies must be having trouble, too.
"The fact that Intel spoke to a secular issue, meaning demand, and not a cyclical one, meaning currency, suggests that if they are having a demand slowdown so are a bunch of the rest of the gang," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in Boston.
Pulled down by a further decline in Intel plus drops in bellwether issues like Microsoft and Cisco Systems, the Nasdaq composite index fell for a third consecutive session, dropping 62.54 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,741.22.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.69 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,439.03. And the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 39.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,808.15.
Five stocks fell for every four that rose in price on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was 990 million shares. Just under 2 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq stock market.
Weakness in big technology stocks masked a good performance in other sectors of the market.
Financial service stocks did better, helped by a decline in market interest rates and a further drop in spot oil prices. Shares of biotechnology companies had a good day. And most big pharmaceutical stocks were good performers.
But large-cap technology names got most of the attention.
Intel, which plunged 22 percent on Friday after it issued its revenue warning, fell again yesterday. The stock closed at $45.38, down $2.56.
Cisco was another big loser, dropping $3.13, to $57.19. Hewlett-Packard dropped $6.25, to $98. And I.B.M. closed at $121.75, down $2.25.
Among Nasdaq stocks, Network Appliance was a big loser. It closed at $130.44, down $16.94, after an analyst from Wit Soundview said the company was likely to see revenue growth slow.
Ciena, by contrast, was a big winner on the Nasdaq. The fiber optic equipment maker jumped $6.81, to $127.56, after it said Korea Telecom had agreed to use Ciena systems for Internet and data-network traffic in Seoul and other cities in the country.

Treasuries Rebound
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bonds and notes rebounded yesterday after stocks erased gains and fell, bolstering demand for fixed-income securities as safe-haven investments.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to a price of 99 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.84 percent from 5.85 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 104 31/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.89 percent from 5.91 percent on Friday.
"Stocks are probably the most important" focus for bonds, along with falling oil prices and then the euro, said Michael Cloherty, a strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Declines in stocks can "help bonds slightly, but you'd have to see them really breaking lower to get much of a reaction," he said.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.482	96.974	High Rate	6.00%	5.98%	Investment Rate	6.18%	6.25%	Low Rate	5.95%	5.90%	Median Rate	5.99%	5.96%	Total applied for	$28,080,867	$28,610,714	Accepted	$14,625,917	$13,129,964	Noncompetitive	$1,160,309	$1,634,551	
 
Both issues are dated Sept. 28, 2000. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 28, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on March 29, 2001.

HEADLINE: International Lenders' New Image: A Human Face

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Deepa Narayan, a Indian woman with a steely gaze who spends much of her time in the poorest villages on earth, speaks of power, voice and equality as the keys to ending poverty. Keeping men from beating women does far more to raise living standards than any dam project ever did, she argues.
She would make a fine spokeswoman for protesters who plan to blockade World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials in their hotels here on Tuesday, when they hope to send a message that global lending agencies hurt the poor. 
 But Ms. Narayan, 48, works for the World Bank, and seems to like it there. And therein lies one of messages emerging from the meetings here: the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are successfully repelling the attacks.
Like those who disrupted the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle last year and the bank and the fund's meeting in Washington last spring, the protesters here view the World Bank and the monetary fund as retrograde institutions that carry water for multinational corporations. But increasingly the protesters are aiming at moving targets. The bank and the fund are, by the standards of huge bureaucracies, changing quickly, largely because of outside pressure.
In fact, Ms. Narayan just completed a two-year, two-volume survey of 20,000 people who live on less than $1 a day. She and others at the bank say the study is one of several revolutionizing who gets the bank's $30 billion in loans each year.
"I think some of the protests have been helpful in bringing about changes," Ms. Narayan said on the sidelines of the bank's annual meetings here today. "But they are also worrying. You can destroy overnight what has taken so long to build."
Ms. Narayan's study, called "Voices of the Poor," is one example of how James D. Wolfensohn, an American who is the World Bank's president, has tried to reinvent poverty programs. But equally telling is how he and Horst Kohler, the German who is managing director of the I.M.F., have cast themselves as allies of governments and charity groups in poor countries, sometimes taking stands against the rich nations that provide most of their financing.
The Prague meetings may be remembered among globalization experts as the time when the two institutions, so much under attack, managed to gain some footing. Their tormentors on the streets, always at a disadvantage because of their small budgets and mixed messages, seem to be taking the blows.
"Wolfensohn and Kohler have become extremely important allies for us," said Trevor A. Manuel, South Africa's finance minister and the chairman of the Prague meetings. "Our real problem is the U.S., Britain and France. The protesters seem not to understand these things."
He was referring to the reluctance of lawmakers in the rich nations, especially in the United States Congress, to provide more money to the bank and the fund that could be used to relieve the old debts of developing countries.
Mr. Manuel also criticized the reluctance of industrial countries to share power at the two lending agencies. Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Kohler have quietly pushed ministers of wealthy nations, especially Europeans, to give up some voting power.
Many critics are actually spending more time inside the Congress Center in Prague than on the streets this year. Mr. Kohler and Mr. Wolfensohn gave entry passes to some 300 charity and watchdog groups so that they could attend the annual meetings, and the outreach seems to be working. Many protesters now call the two lending agencies potential friends or, at worst, ciphers.
"They are civil servants," Ann Pettifor, organizer of the Jubilee 2000 coalition of debt-relief groups, said of Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Kohler. "We know who the bad guys are. It's the G-7," referring to the Group of 7, the organization of seven leading economic powers.
To some outside protesters, a mix of anarchists, Marxists, student activists and environmentalists, hers is a distinction without a difference. But their lack of discrimination is a handicap.
Their main protest event is scheduled for Tuesday, when the bank and the fund hold their formal meeting ceremonies. The Group of 7 ministers, including Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, attended sessions on Saturday at the German Embassy here unhindered. Some ministers have already left.
The bank and the fund, along with the World Trade Organization, make appealing protest targets as symbols of globalization. Their leaders are hand-picked, not elected, and they have historically been secretive. They make tens of billions of dollars of loans each year.
But they are accountable to nations who are members, rich ones most of all, but also poor ones. And, like any bureaucracy, they are scrambling to survive in a new era, making themselves imperfect proxies for multinational corporations or other presumed forces of evil.
Take Mr. Kohler, the new managing director at the fund. He took over the reins of the Washington-based monetary fund at perhaps the low point of its reputation last spring, when it was under attack for mismanaging bailouts in Asia and Russia in recent years.
He quickly departed on what he called a listening tour of 16 developing countries and when he returned he began talking about changes in how the fund makes loans. He says he will streamline the much criticized conditions its attaches to its money.
For instance, when the fund provided $40 billion in emergency financing to Jakarta during the Asian crisis, it attached a list of more than 100 conditions. It required, for example, that the government disband its clove monopoly and eliminate price subsidies on basic foodstuffs, seen as ways of using the lending as leverage toward a free market.
Mr. Kohler said the conditions went too far, alienating Indonesians. "I will not have another Indonesia," he said.
He also agreed to eliminate a requirement the fund had imposed on Mozambique. There, fund officials had told the government to eliminate import tariffs on sugar, which the government had imposed to help the troubled industry. Mr. Kohler now says he will no longer force developing nations to adopt trade liberalization that rich countries like the United States or those in Europe have not yet undertaken.
At the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn routinely points out that almost half the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. He readily admits that many of the bank's traditional clients have not done much to improve the lives of the poor.
Although Mr. Wolfensohn is a former investment banker, he is proving hard to outflank on the left. He gave Ms. Narayan's team of economists latitude to write what the bank calls its World Development Report, a flagship document that -- after much internal debate -- threw stones at the orthodox temple of development economics by challenging the notion that all loans should aim to stimulate growth. Freeing trade, privatizing government companies and limiting government spending were once seen as main ingredients.
The latest report does not attack those ideas. Instead it focuses on "empowering" poor people, addressing dysfunctional family structures, and cutting government middlemen out of aid distribution. It reads like something written by people Mr. Wolfensohn himself once described as the "Berkeley Mafia."
Bank officials promise that their loan portfolio will look radically different in five years, reflecting the report's new priorities. But it already looks quite different than it did when Mr. Wolfensohn took power five years ago when the bank spent one in five of its aid dollars on electrical infrastructure projects. Today that ratio is 1 in 50.
This year the bank is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fight AIDS and malaria. It has begun a $500 million pilot program in Indonesia examining how to channel aid directly to villages where poor people live, rather than entrusting authorities to do that for them.
All this talk raises pressure on the bank and the fund to make far more progress in fighting poverty in the next decade than they did during the last, when living conditions for the poor in Africa, the former Soviet Union and much of Latin American actually deteriorated.
But now, at least, the protesters have worthy challengers in the battle for public opinion.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Talk of Euro's Revival May Be Premature

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 25

 BODY:
As a show of market power, the joint intervention to rescue the euro seems not to have much impressed its audience.
Today, on the first full business day after major central banks intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden European common currency, and threatened to do so again, the markets barely reacted. 
 The euro, the currency adopted by 11 European nations nearly two years ago, traded throughout the day around 88 cents to the dollar, and weakened to 87.30 cents in late New York trading, compared with 87.87 late Friday. At its high point after the intervention, the euro sold for about 90 cents. Today's rate is only around 3 cents above its low and well below what some European officials consider its true value.
Indeed, as finance ministers and central bankers from around the world attended annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here today, there were new signs that the American leaders are less worried than Europeans about reversing the euro's decline.
The unexpected decision by the United States to join the rescue attempt on Friday surprised investors and lent further credibility to the European Central Bank's move. Japan and Canada intervened, too.
But the tone of American statements was more ambivalent than that of European bankers. Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers insisted over the weekend that the United States had not changed its view that "a strong dollar" was in the interests of the United States.
Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, let it be known today that he and other German officials were frustrated by Mr. Summers's remarks, as they seemed to undermine the use of future interventions.
"They thought the remarks of Larry Summers had not been very helpful," said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, who met with Mr. Welteke and other senior German officials here this morning.
European leaders made clear that they wanted to do more than simply stop the decline of the euro, which has lost about 25 percent of its value against the dollar since its introduction in January 1999.
Over the weekend, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France emphasized the need to achieve a higher rate.
Wim Duisenberg, the European Central Bank president, talked about achieving an "orderly reversal" in the euro's decline.
Because a failed intervention would do greater damage to the euro's credibility than no intervention at all, it is hard to imagine that the European Central Bank will not act again.
European officials meeting here in Prague said repeatedly in the last couple of days that they would intervene again if appropriate and made clear that the euro's current value is nowhere near the level they want.
But there was no hint of a follow-up campaign today, nor was there any anxious repositioning of portfolios by currency traders in anticipation of one.
Adding to the pressure, European officials are preparing for the possibility of more bad publicity on Thursday, when Denmark votes on whether to adopt the euro. Polls have shown the Danes almost evenly divided, but the euro's decline in the last few weeks appears to have strengthened the opponents.
While a Danish rejection of the euro might have little immediate impact on its trading value, it could increase resistance in the two bigger countries that have stayed out of the monetary union, Britain and Sweden.
"Of course it would be bad news for the euro," said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank. "Right now, all news about the euro is bad news."
The more fundamental problem, analysts say, is that the euro's weakness does not lend itself to a quick fix through central bank intervention.
Intervening on behalf of a currency generally works best if a large number of speculators have already been betting heavily in one direction, because central banks can often squeeze out traders with a short but intense bout of buying in the other direction.
But the euro's core troubles are reflected in long-term investment flows, and may stem from the effects of corporate mergers and acquisitions as well as portfolio investments. In general, those investments have been pouring out of Europe and into the United States, reflecting higher American growth.
"It is the long-term flows that are leaving the country," said Tony Norfield, chief currency analyst at ABN Amro, "not the mad speculators. There are very few positions out there to squeeze."
Indeed, analysts say that money managers, particularly in Asia, bet too heavily in favor of the euro. Many did so initially because they liked the idea of having an alternative to the dollar, but then funds invested heavily on the mistaken conviction that the euro was overdue for a rebound after its early declines.
Those expectations were kindled by almost all major bank and investment banks, which were overly optimistic about the euro's prospects.
Axel Siedenberg, head of economic research at Deutsche Bank, said the goal of intervention is not so much to strengthen the euro as to keep it from sinking further. And that, he said, is an attainable goal.
"The intervention was not intended to start a new trend toward a strong euro," Mr. Siedenberg said. "The message to the market is that this is the bottom."

Oil Prices Ebb On Release From Reserve

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The prices of crude and home heating oil fell yesterday in the wake of the Clinton administration's decision last week to release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve. But it still appears that this will be a difficult winter for consumers, as home heating oil and gasoline prices remain near 10-year highs.
Even optimistic energy analysts do not think the added supply will rescue home heating oil users from a bitter fall and winter. 
 "It will be tight; prices will be high," said Charles T. Maxwell, senior energy analyst at Weedon & Company in Greenwich, Conn. "But we will get through the winter without people freezing for a lack of fuel."
Still, he said, this means that people will be wearing sweaters and may be paying close to $2 a gallon to fill their home heating oil tanks. The East Coast retail price averaged $1.4635 a gallon last winter, with a high of $1.9470 in the first week of February, according to the Energy Information Administration. The price reached $2.1230 in New York State that week.
Even with the additional oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, inventories of crude oil, which reached 24-year lows in August, are still tight. Heating oil inventories nationally, according to the energy agency, are at 48.1 billion barrels, down from 72.4 billion a year ago. On just the East Coast, heating oil inventories are 24.4 billion barrels, down from 48.5 billion a year ago. The three million to five million barrels in additional home heating oil the Clinton administration is promising would reduce that gap only slightly.
The 800,000 barrels a day in increased production that OPEC promised earlier this month will not start flowing until Oct. 1, and it takes about six weeks to arrive at refineries in the United States. The crude oil from the reserve is not expected to show up as home heating oil at the retail level until the end of November or December. Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said that the expectation of extra barrels of home heating oil assumes that refineries produce fuel at a pace above their normal rate.
And things can go wrong. First, there is the weather. Last winter was unusually warm. So if this winter is just average, it will be colder, increasing the demand for home heating oil. The Energy Information Administration is projecting a 6 percent increase in consumption this winter in the Northeast.
The other wild card is Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. Iraq produces 2.3 million barrels of crude oil a day, about 4 percent of daily consumption. With the United Nations about to debate reparations for Kuwait and the approach of the expiration in December of the Iraq food-for-oil program, which allows it to sell oil to meet its country's humanitarian needs, some analysts are worried that the Iraqi leader might cut or halt production.
The outlook, said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company, "depends on the weather now and Saddam." She said that Iraq had temporarily halted production in the past when its food-for-oil program came up for renewal.
"The bottom line is that the S.P.R. sale does not change the reality of a tight supply-demand balance, with capacity constraints in both OPEC and non-OPEC nations," Merrill Lynch's energy team said in a bulletin on the effect of the release of the 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
But despite questions on the impact of the extra oil from the reserve, the announcement on Friday did affect prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for November delivery dropped $1.11, or 3.4 percent, to $31.57. The price of home heating oil for October delivery fell 1.41 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 94.07 cents a gallon.
The price of unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.26 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 92.70 cents a gallon. Much of the crude oil from the petroleum reserve will go into the production of more gasoline and diesel fuel. Mr. Richardson said on Friday that this action "will likely benefit everyone who drives a car."
The average price of retail regular unleaded gasoline nationally hit a high of $1.681 a gallon in June. While it fell to $1.447 a gallon in August, it is rising again as the strong economy and the popularity of low-mileage vehicles like sport utility vehicles are keeping demand strong. The price for the week ended yesterday was $1.548 a gallon, the Energy Information Administration said.
Two parts of the crude oil release helped enhance its effect, analysts said. One is that the administration released 30 million barrels of crude oil, instead of the 5 million barrels that Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, had asked for. In addition, the administration said it would review the need for oil in 30 days, which could mean another release just before Election Day on Nov. 7.
"The government has taken some of the risk premium and the panic from the price," Ms. King said. She added that the larger amount of oil released and the threat of more would make traders who had been betting on further price increases more cautious.
Mr. Maxwell said that some of the recent surge in prices, which took crude oil to $37.80 a barrel last week and home heating oil to $1.0760 a gallon two weeks ago, may be, in part, a result of both local home heating oil companies' increasing their normal reserves and homeowners filling up their tanks earlier than normal. If this is the case, then some of the normal winter pressure on home heating oil prices may have just come earlier in the season.
But he is still worried about the outlook, especially because this will be a fall and winter season when the inventories and stocks of home heating oil and natural gas, the other winter fuel, will be at much lower than normal levels, in large part because of strong demand. "It is a difficult problem when you have a lack of oil," he said. "It is a double whammy when you have a lack of oil and natural gas."
The other reason that the announcement of the release of the 30 million barrels may mislead some is that very little of that crude oil ends up as home heating oil. This is because refiners cannot alter their production mix much and because there is still demand for other oil products, including gasoline and diesel fuel.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, a refined barrel of oil generally produces about 45 percent gasoline and 20 percent to 25 percent, depending on the season, of distillate. Home heating oil and diesel fuel are made from distillate. The rest of the barrel is jet fuel, petrochemical stocks and the residual fuel used by utilities.
Of the distillate, about one-third goes to home heating oil and two-thirds to diesel fuel. Based on this formula, about 2.5 million barrels of the 30 million would be home heating oil. The extra production the administration is counting on would bring the number into the three million to five million range.

HEADLINE: More Companies Offering Same-Sex-Partner Benefits

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
More companies are offering health insurance benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees than ever before, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies, a new study has found.
As of August, 3,572 companies, colleges, universities, states and local governments were offering or had announced that they would offer health insurance coverage to domestic partners of their employees -- an increase of 25 percent from last year, the study found. In August 1999, 2,856 of these companies, educational institutions and governments offered such benefits. 
 Sixty-five percent of those in the survey provide domestic partner benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex couples; 35 percent offer benefits only to same-sex couples, the study found.
The study was conducted by the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based group that represents gay, lesbian and transgender Americans.
"Employers have discovered that these benefits help attract and keep the best workers, a critical consideration in the current tight job market," said Kim I. Mills, education director for the Human Rights Campaign and an editor of the report.
Among Fortune 500 companies, the number of employers offering benefits to domestic partners increased 46 percent, the study found, to 102 this year from 70 in 1999.
The Big Three automakers -- DaimlerChrysler,, General Motors and Ford Motor -- announced in June that they would offer health benefits to the same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States. This was a "landmark move" in the effort by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and lesbian couples, the report concluded.
Coca-Cola also announced in June that it would extend health coverage to domestic partners, joining General Mills and Pillsbury, two other leading food producers that offer these benefits.
Boeing decided last October that it would offer health coverage to nonunion members and their partners. Honeywell, another leading aerospace company, provides benefits to domestic partners.
Until this year, the two largest American companies offering same-sex benefits had been I.B.M. and Citigroup, Ms. Mills said. Both companies are based in the New York area, where gays and lesbians are more politically and economically influential than in the Midwest.
"There is a cultural shift taking place," Ms. Mills said. "People want to be open about their lives in the workplace. The public attitude is that this kind of discrimination is wrong."
In May 1998, President Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian work force. To date, all cabinet-level departments and 24 independent agencies have adopted nondiscrimination policies with regard to sexual orientation. But the federal government does not provide same-sex benefits for its employees.
Ninety state and local governments or government agencies, however, provide domestic-partner health benefits, the report showed. Since August 1999, Connecticut and Washington have added benefits for state workers, joining California, New York, Vermont and Oregon. In addition, 12 cities and counties have added or announced that they would begin to offer these benefits, including Atlanta; Phoenix; Montgomery County, Md.; and Albuquerque.

HEADLINE: POVERTY TOUR REVISITED/American Voices;
Forget Washington. The Poor Cope Alone.

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: CLARKSDALE, Miss.

 BODY:
In Eastern Kentucky, a 15-year-old boy dreams of quitting school to make real money working at a pizza parlor. Here in Clarksdale, a 68-year-old widow thanks God that she can manage the $200-a-month rent on a house one good rain could wash away. In East St. Louis, Ill., a 20-year-old mother of six wishes she could find a public housing project where the broken glass on the stoop is swept away.
Poor people learn to keep hopes small. So when President Clinton came calling on some of the poorest places in the country last year with ideas to make things better, it was like rain in the desert. 
 The president's six-state, four-day poverty tour, highlighting for the first time in his two terms the places that remain untouched by the longest economic boom in this nation's history, caused an excitement that bordered on the spiritual. He was like a charismatic preacher, stirring the congregation to believe.
A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up has long faded. And so has the notion, if it ever existed, that the federal government is the answer to the empty downtowns, idle laborers and the dilapidated buildings all too common in these communities.
In a presidential election season, when the two major-party candidates are suggesting that everyone should benefit from the nation's prosperity, the people who might be buoyed by the words have little use for national politics. In dozens of interviews in communities the president visited -- Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern Kentucky towns of Hazard and Annville -- what was clear was that Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are more concerned with how to fix their own communities than in the state of the country.
Unlike the extensively reported tour of poor communities by Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, when he was a presidential candidate, Mr. Clinton's tour was a day's headlines. And perhaps because this is the age of welfare changes, the places Mr. Clinton visited expected little beyond the visit. East St. Louis, which looks leftover from a bombing, is bent on proving that it is not the urban war zone it became known as a decade ago. Appalachia, which is humming along, in parts, is concerned with telling the world that it is not a haven for barefoot hillbillies in shotgun shacks.
 
Clarksdale
Facing Adversity, Showing Resilience
Clarksdale, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, is determined to prove that with grit, it will not only endure, but prevail.
It is, as the mayor says, "resilient in the face of adversity."
The morning of the day the president came to town, Shirley Fair opened Ooo So Pretty flowers and gifts at the regular time, 9 a.m. Ms. Fair nodded to the Secret Service agents on the roof, said hey to the ones who had been hanging around the store for 10 days and managed to take a few orders for bouquets.
Her store, on the corner of a nearly abandoned strip of downtown Issaquena Avenue, had been chosen for a meeting between the president and local small-business owners. Word was that he was bringing ways to lure businesses that had fled to Highway 61 back to town, besides enticing new ones.
But Ms. Fair, barely getting by after 21 years in business, would bet on just two things that day. It would be hotter than heck, and Mr. Clinton's visit would make great pictures.
She was right. When President Clinton strolled through the tired, broken streets of downtown, sweating enough for two men in the 105-degree heat, it was the most exciting thing to happen to Clarksdale (population 22,000) in a long time. Maybe ever. He passed the boarded Roxy Theater, the closed-down Pac-Man lounge and the falling-down wooden houses as if he were right at home. Then he came into Ooo So Pretty and listened to people sing the business blues for about an hour, a lot longer than his schedulers had planned.
And then, he left.
"It was a great Kodak moment," Ms. Fair said.
As she expected, nothing has really changed on Issaquena Avenue. Like so many downtowns abandoned for highway strips, the Roxy (the mayor pointed it out to the president as a place that might make a great cultural center with some kind of grant or loan), is still boarded. The Pac-Man lounge is still closed. The falling down houses look ready to give up completely.
Johnny Newson is still putting in the long hours at Newson's Auto Parts, in a blocklong building, inherited from his dad, across the street from Ooo So Pretty. Mr. Newson opens at 7 and stays until 7 or 8 to compete with the Wal-Mart and Auto Zone on Highway 61. "Right now," he said, "it's just like the president never came."
A lot of people say the same thing. Hardly anyone blames the president, though. In Clarksdale, people pay as little attention to Washington politics as Washington politics pays to them. No one faults any of the presidential candidates for not coming around; they are used to being ignored.
They tend to blame Wal-Mart for their problems, for stealing business from downtown. Or Memphis, 75 miles away, for stealing brain power. Or the local politicians, for letting downtown slip into a coma without a fight.
They blame themselves, too.
"People got to want to improve," said Ethel Mae Clark, sitting on her mother's porch on downtown Yazoo Street. Next door was a boarded shack of a house. Across the street, where houses used to be, was a lot overrun with weeds.
Ms. Clark, who lives nearby, has diabetes and a failing kidney, and her world is framed by the $400 Social Security check she receives each month. Her mother, Martha Riley, who was sitting on the porch sewing a quilt under a sign for "Pigee's Beauty Salon" -- a remnant of her landlord's defunct business -- is in similar straits. Ms. Riley pays $200 a month rent for the house and wishes she could afford better. She blames not being able to read or write for her lot. "Here," she said, "Things just get worser."
Still, Clarksdale is a proud old place. Some of the biggest names in the blues walked these streets. Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker grew up in town. Bessie Smith died here.
The Delta Blues Museum, which is fighting for financing from the Clarksdale Board of Commissioners, attracts visitors from all over the world. Tony Czech, the director, showed off the guest book to prove it.
"Look at these," Mr. Czech said, leafing through a few pages that revealed addresses from Paris, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Alaska. "And these are just over a couple of days."
But after these visitors tour the museum, they have nowhere else in Clarksdale to go.
For the really poor people -- and that means nearly 40 percent of Clarksdale residents, who live below the poverty level -- shopping means taking a long walk along a busy road. Local bus service is nonexistent.
Richard M. Webster Jr., the mayor, had hoped the president's visit would lead to a real change. But Mr. Webster is not surprised that it did not. "We Deltans have learned to be resilient," he said. "Resilient in the face of adversity. Just the fact that we are able to live and work here is a sign of that."
Yet there are occasional cries of desperation. Dave Williams, a part-time carpenter, started shouting, "Factories! We need some factories here!" when he saw a reporter and photographer walking around town.
He has lived here all his life, 42 years, but cannot see sticking it out much longer. "I would like to have a full-time job," Mr. Williams said. "So would a lot of people. I know a friend of mine, he's living in one of those cattle boxes that sit on the tracks. So are a lot of people. See for yourself."
On a scorching day, there was no one in the metal cars. Hardly anyone walked the streets, either, except for a twig-skinny woman who asked for $5 for a fix, and a man gathering cans in a plastic grocery bag.
 
East St. Louis
Self-Help Is Seen As the Solution
It was Sunday, the sun shining like a halo, and the streets of East St. Louis were virtually empty, as though the city had been warned of an air raid.
This made the abandoned buildings all over town stand out in bold relief. From boarded churches to closed-down gas stations and burned-out houses and storefronts, the rotting buildings, more than 1,500 in all, mocked the city's pride, marring every neighborhood.
Businesses, even on State Street, the main drag, are few and far between. The city's only places to eat are the kind that measure customers by the millions. So many businesses have left that when the president stopped by on his poverty tour, the best example of a positive economic growth that the city could come up with was a new Walgreen's.
East St. Louis, with about 32,000 residents, 99 percent of them African-American, is clearly one very poor city. About 40 percent of the residents live below the federal poverty line of $16,600 for a family of four. A three-bedroom house can be bought for $10,000. The unemployment rate is more than 10 percent, twice the national average.
President Clinton, with an entourage that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson and several cabinet members, promised that East St. Louis would not be forgotten. But while his brief visit has yielded little concrete change, residents overwhelmingly vote Democratic, all the time. Few people have anything but praise for the president's gestures toward their city.
"The visit shed a lot of light on the things that we have to offer," said Greg Lewis, one of a dozen members of the local Democratic club who was spending his Sunday afternoon renovating a building the club recently bought for its headquarters. "A lot of it," Mr. Lewis added, to a chorus of yeahs, "depends on us."
Like other members of the committee, Mr. Lewis, who is 38, the father of two boys, 12 and 15, and a relocation supervisor in nearby St. Louis, could not say enough good things about his hometown.
"My wife and I have a six-figure income between us," he said. "We live in this city because we believe in it. The stigma is something we're trying to get away from."
Told that the city looks grim, Mr. Lewis and other residents talk about how much it has improved from 10 years ago. The police cars did not have working radios and the fire engines would not run. Trash was piled high in the streets because the city had no money to hire haulers. In 1990, a man who was physically abused while in jail sued East St. Louis and won, forcing the city to turn over the deed to City Hall to him to satisfy the court judgment. And when things seemed as if they could not get any worse, they did. In 1991, the city posted 68 homicides, a record.
Now, with tax revenue from the Casino Queen riverboat, which opened here in 1993, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis's Gateway Arch, and the new $15 million waterfront hotel adjacent to it, the city can afford at least basic services. Still, many of the casino's 1,200 employees, even those who come from East St. Louis, live elsewhere, where the schools are better and there are neighborhoods where houses appreciate in value.
For the very poor in East St. Louis, prone to not voting or participating in civic life, the city still looks very bleak. Andrea Mitchell, a 20-year-old mother of six, moved to East St. Louis from Washington Park, Ill., less than two years ago. With local schools too overcrowded to accept her 5-year-old and 4-year-old, Ms. Mitchell said she was about ready to move again. She lives in the Normandy Houses, a barrackslike public housing complex, and despite help from neighbors, she cannot manage her young family in her two-bedroom apartment and police her neighborhood as well.
"All these empty lots and empty houses are terrible," Ms. Mitchell said. "The streets need to be fixed. There really ain't no businesses here. People should all pitch in and clean this place up."
Since the president's visit, a Blockbuster video store and Save-A-Lot grocery store that had already been in the works have opened by the Walgreen's, creating a small but bona fide shopping center in the heart of town. They represent the first major retail development in the city since the 1950's.
But with so much abandonment, and such seemingly intractable poverty, longtime residents and business owners say it will take more than a few new chain stores to lift the city off its knees.
Fredericka Nash and her two sisters run the Nash Funeral Home, which their parents opened more than 70 years ago. Ms. Nash, 80, remembers when East St. Louis was "a bustling city."
"To look around, you certainly wouldn't see it," Ms. Nash said. "Sometimes, it looks like a battle zone. The people want better. But how are you going to achieve that?"
Like others, she brushed off the possibility of a federal solution. "With the proper city administration," she said sternly, "possibly it may be able to stem the tide."
The mayor, Debra Powell, did not keep a scheduled appointment to talk about her city, and was busy the next day as well. Her assistant said Ms. Powell was too busy planning to meet the actors Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover, who were considering investing in the city.
 
Appalachia
Anger at Being Part Of Poverty Tour
Of all the jobs in Jackson County, Ky., those on the assembly line at the Mid-South Electronics Company in Annville are among the most coveted.
Mid-South, a contract manufacturer for several multinational companies, has nearly 900 employees, up from 40 workers 10 years ago. And the nonunion shop keeps hiring more workers, while few leave. Employees say the pay, which starts at $5.75 an hour, is pretty good, especially considering medical benefits.
Kevin Dunn, who has worked at Mid-South for 7 years, after 11 years at a textile plant in London, a town 22 miles away, considers himself lucky. "I'd say it's one of the better jobs around," said Mr. Dunn, 50, the single father of two boys.
It was at Mid-South that President Clinton stopped on his poverty tour last year of the Appalachian region of Eastern Kentucky to prove his point that companies can park themselves anywhere and do well.
Folks at Mid-South say it was a big thrill to have the president walk through the plant, even though many workers are Republicans through and through.
"I voted for him, but I'd better not say that too loud," said Mr. Dunn, giggling, as he sat on a picnic table outside the plant on his lunch break.
Della Dell, a quality control supervisor who has been at Mid-South for 16 years, said she was excited to meet the president, even though she is a Republican.
"He stopped in here because he cared about jobs," Ms. Dell said, "even if we were doing fine already."
There is a lot of that kind of talk in Eastern Kentucky. People are weary of the image of Appalachian hillbillies in miners' hats and rope belts. Time and again they said it would be wrong to take pictures or interview the rural poor without including the rest of the people. Some were insulted that the president's visit was part of a "poverty tour."
As poor as the region is -- nearly 35 percent of the people in Jackson County, which includes Annville, live below the poverty line, as do 30 percent of those in Perry County, where the president addressed a rally in Hazard -- the emphasis is on telling the world that encouraging private investment is the way to go.
This is God's country. From Annville to Hazard, people grow patches of tobacco in the backyard and post the Ten Commandments on their lawns. Signs on lampposts read: "God is coming soon. Are you ready?"
People time and again said they were blessed to live in a place as beautiful as Kentucky, where the mountains are green and lush and the trees look as old as time.
William Gorman, the mayor of Hazard, invited the president to visit his town months earlier, largely to show how well Appalachia is doing.
"I'm a Republican, and I really think he did us a great honor," said Mr. Gorman, who traces his family's roots in the region to the Revolutionary War. "The greatest problem I've seen with people is the lack of hope. You give them hope and they'll conquer the world."
Mr. Clinton talked about his "new markets initiative," to entice businesses to invest here, but for Mr. Gorman, who has been mayor for 23 years, Hazard (population 5,416) is already benefiting from the new economy.
"Appalachia has a lot of problems," he said, taking the time on a Saturday with his assistant and friend of 50 years, Charlie Hammonds, to give reporters a tour of the town. All traffic pointed to the Wal-Mart, and the grand opening of a new off-track betting center, the U-Bet.
"But the quality of life here is no different than it is anywhere in the country," Mr. Hammonds piped in. "We're just the same as most places."
Mr. Hammonds was worried that the president spent a little too much time in places where the old stereotype of Appalachia persists -- on rural roads, out where families have little education or work.
But the fact remains that very poor people still live along the back roads of Appalachia, in houses that look like abandoned barns. Some of them even live right on the roads for all the world to see.
Take Jesse McWhorter and his family, who live off a county road in Burning Springs (population about 500), up the road from Annville.
Jesse, 15, lives with his mother and two sisters, 11 and 8, in a house with so many dogs and puppies and cats and kittens that no one can say exactly how many they own.
He owns cocks, too, beautiful bantam roosters that he has spared from death despite his belief, once he was born again last year, that raising cocks is the Devil's business.
"I kept two cocks because they're so beautiful," Jesse said. "The other ones I just took and went like this," he said, twisting his hands to show how he snapped their necks.
When the school van dropped him off recently, his mother, Linda, was on the porch with his sister Chrissie, home from school because she did not feel like going. An old friend, Martha Couch, was on the porch, too.
Ms. McWhorter and Ms. Couch vaguely remembered the president's visit, though they said they did not vote or pay much attention to politics.
Ms. Couch, who recently learned from a social worker that she was 75 years old ("I thought I was 72") said there were not many people like herself and the McWhorters left, families who have lived in the area for generations, mining or growing tobacco, minding no one's business but their own.
But Jesse, chewing tobacco and spitting it, awkwardly, said he was going to live a different life.
"I can't wait to start making some money," he said. "I can drive a truck. Or I can make pizzas."
He said he was not even thinking of college. "I can't afford it," he said, dismissing the notion of scholarships or loans. "I can afford to find my own way, though. I can definitely afford that."

HEADLINE: Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were going up and why a new generation of power plants was needed, and the message centered on one word: demand.
Millions of new air-conditioners, computers and other gadgets are humming, blinking and draining electricity from the power pool, utility executives and state energy officials said over and over again. The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in the region were assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead, those officials suggested, if residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods. 
 What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for building power plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity. Nor was the public told that the means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power needed, if the political will could be exerted.
Before New York's energy markets were deregulated, beginning in 1998, the state required companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system -- through energy efficiency measures, for example -- if that choice was cheaper than building a new plant.
Under deregulation, that requirement has been lost. In an open market, every participant wants to sell more energy, and the government agencies in New York and other deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives have become silent or powerless.
"The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led to a simplistic set of solutions: build more power plants," said Richard Cowart, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier, Vt., that works with state regulators and utilities.
On the new playing field, Mr. Cowart and other experts said, the incentives are all one-sided.
Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less energy or to use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is at its peak. And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more electricity through their wires. "The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming," Mr. Cowart said.
Certainly, demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the country, and most experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed. And New York State's top electricity official, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, has emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures must be part of the solution to rising demand.
The problem, environmental groups and energy analysts say, is that in an arena in which government has taken a step back through deregulation, it is harder for regulators to make those opinions count.
Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this summer, it would be easy for the public to think that the region's energy situation is worse than it actually is. Most long-term projections for the region say that demand will increase less in New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the next 10 to 15 years. New York, it turns out, is not an energy hog.
The most recent official long-term projection for New York, called the State Energy Plan, issued in late 1998, said the state could get by with only a very modest expansion in generating capacity for the next 10 years, or no expansion at all if the levels of electricity that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified.
The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down, not accelerating. Within the territory served by Consolidated Edison, which includes all of New York City and its northern suburbs, peak demand, the highest single moment of energy use on the heaviest day of the year, rose by 1.7 percent a year from the mid-1990's to the end of the decade. In the new century, that growth rate is expected to be 1.2 percent a year.
"It will be more modest," one senior Con Ed official said.
The main implication of those projections, economists and energy analysts say, is that most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed at all, at least to meet new demand. In the Con Ed service area, meeting a 1.2 percent growth in demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 500 to 750 megawatts over the next five years. Developers and power plant builders have proposed a total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years alone.
"No one plant can make the argument that it's really needed," said Ashok Gupta, an energy economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group. "Like malls, power plants are now being built for market share."
Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult. In the early 1970's, for example, the accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid pace that it had in the 1960's. Academics and utility industry officials said the country might need 1,000 nuclear plants by the turn of the century.
But the oil shocks of the mid-1970's and early 1980's forced the introduction of energy-efficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless. Energy use as a percentage of the nation's economy, called energy intensity, began declining and has done so ever since.
Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the overwhelming focus on supply is the result of a still-new electricity market that is not yet functioning as intended.
Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of consumer choice had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction -- they sell ways to cut energy use through technology or better management -- would compete with companies selling supply. But that has not happened yet. Part of Con Ed's prediction of more modest growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that demand-management companies will emerge within the next few years, company officials said.
But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 1990's to reduce spending for conservation and efficiency measures. The state, which once led the region in financing for alternatives to new supply -- an effort that included television commercials urging people to think about saving energy -- now spends about a third as much per capita as most states in the Northeast, including Connecticut and New Jersey, according to figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
Last month, a report filed with the State Public Service Commission recommended an increase in financing for the efficiency program. The report was produced by representatives of the electricity industry, working alongside consumer and environmental groups. But the state's utilities, including New York State Electric and Gas, Niagara Mohawk and Con Ed, refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its conclusions.
"Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy efficiency," said Edward A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a research and advocacy group that helped write the report. As electricity companies have become more conscious of the bottom line under deregulation, Mr. Smeloff said, demand-reduction programs have become a threat to profits.
For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies, moving more electricity through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits, Mr. Smeloff said. "That's the business," he added.
Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one hour each year, that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity. To a great degree, planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that crucial moment so as to avoid blackouts. But experts like Mr. Smeloff say the tools already exist to dampen those peaks, and reduce prices to consumers as well, if only a constituency existed to push for the changes.
Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be postponed for a few hours to dampen load on peak days, a plan that efficiency experts say would be particularly easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally controlled and monitored. In England, one electricity provider created lower rates for consumers who ran appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in off-peak hours. The program became so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly during the discount-pricing window.
Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real demand in New York could create a kind of self-fueling spiral. If too many new plants are built, they say, prices will probably fall, encouraging people to use more electricity, while at the same time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products.
In New York and elsewhere in the country, much of the growth in demand is being driven by the spread of air-conditioning, especially from people buying extra units to cool more parts of their homes. Last year, Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in which employees began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and counting the number of window air-conditioners. In one year, the total went up by 5 percent.
Some energy experts say more air-conditioning could further increase the spurts in demand that could in turn lead to more power plants, which many scientists say are prime sources of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
"We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse gases because of more air-conditioning," said Joseph Romm, the executive director of the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions, a nonprofit consulting institute based in Virginia. "It would certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power plants."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Bush Would Use Medicare For Tax Cuts, Gore Says

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: CORAL GABLES, Fla., Sept. 25

 BODY:
Campaigning in Florida, where as many as 40 percent of this November's voters may be 60 or older, Vice President Al Gore promised today to strengthen sanctions against health maintenance organizations that pull out of the Medicare market and to eliminate Medicare copayments and deductibles for a variety of preventive tests.
Mr. Gore unveiled those proposals in a speech in St. Petersburg that opened a weeklong discussion of Medicare policy, an issue that is particularly potent in Florida. Before flying here to attend several fund-raisers, Mr. Gore used his speech to convey his stark differences on the issue with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a comparison that illustrates the broader philosophical differences between the two campaigns. Along those lines, Mr. Gore also drew attention to a five-year-old interview in which Mr. Bush expressed support for the deep Medicare cuts championed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
 Mr. Gore's aides provided reporters with a videotape of the interview on Oct. 19, 1995, by a television station in Austin, Tex., in which Mr. Bush commended that year's House Republican plan to cut $270 billion over seven years from Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly. The proposal died after a prolonged battle with Congressional Democrats and the White House that prompted two government shutdowns.
"Elderly people will not suffer as a result of this plan," Mr. Bush said in the interview with KXAN. "It's going to make the plan solvent. And Republicans will be heralded, not only for saving Medicare, but at the same time for having the political courage to balance the budget."
Mr. Gore's aides then made him available for an interview with The New York Times, in which he said that Mr. Bush's comments were "very revealing of his basic attitude toward Medicare" and belied his assertion that he was a new kind of Republican.
"He doesn't like it," Mr. Gore said. "He disagrees with its basic premise and he is looking for any politically viable opportunity to gut it."
Mr. Gore then said Mr. Bush would do "virtually the same thing to Medicare that Gingrich proposed: raising premiums, taking money out of Medicare for a tax cut that goes mainly to the wealthy, forcing seniors into H.M.O.'s, privatizing Medicare."
Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said Mr. Bush had made it clear with his own 10-year plan to restructure Medicare, at a cost of $198 billion, that he was committed to the program.
Mr. Bush's proposal, issued earlier this month, would allow private insurers to compete with the government to provide a variety of coverage options, some of which could include prescription drug benefits.
"His proposals will strengthen Medicare so it will be just as successful in the future as it has been in the past for millions of seniors," Mr. Bartlett said.
As for Mr. Bush's comments in 1995, Mr. Bartlett said, "What is important here is not what Governor Bush said about a plan five years ago that wasn't even his. What's important is what he says about his plan today."
Today's trip was Mr. Gore's fourth to Florida since the Democratic convention last month, and his ninth since early March. But despite that sign that Mr. Gore is competing aggressively for the state's 25 electoral votes, his campaign admits that it is being badly outspent here on television advertising.
Karl Koch, a senior consultant to the campaign in Florida, said that the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee had spent an estimated $2.2 million on advertising from Sept. 11-19, compared with only $330,000 by the Gore campaign. The Democratic National Committee, which had been advertising in three Florida media markets, is currently off the air but plans to return, Mr. Koch said.
A senior campaign official said today that either Mr. Gore or his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, would travel to Florida each week between now and Election Day. The official also said the campaign would increase its advertising and ground troops in the state.
The Gore campaign considers Medicare a major issue partly because it plays well in key states like Florida that have large elderly populations. But Mr. Gore's strategists also know that with 39 million beneficiaries nationwide, a number that is projected to more than double by 2035, Medicare is a significant concern for a large cross-section of voters. Indeed, the vice president also used the Medicare issue to batter his opponent in the Democratic primaries, former Senator Bill Bradley.
In his speech in St. Petersburg, delivered to a crowd of several thousand people, most of them elderly, Mr. Gore vowed that "the heart of my agenda is a rock-solid commitment to Medicare."
Reading from a teleprompter, Mr. Gore explained the key elements of his Medicare proposals: to protect the projected $360 billion, 10-year Medicare surplus by placing it in a secure fund; to add a voluntary prescription drug benefit at a cost of $338 billion; and to invest $40 billion in reimbursement for nursing homes, teaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies and rehabilitative services.
Those were among the proposals that were repackaged in a 74-page booklet on Medicare that was released by Mr. Gore today, three weeks after he issued a 191-page synopsis of his economic plan.
But the booklet also outlined Mr. Gore's new proposals for an array of sanctions against H.M.O.'s that pull out of the Medicare market, a growing problem. Mr. Gore would prevent H.M.O.'s that drop coverage of Medicare recipients from returning to that market for four years, double the existing sanction of two years.
He also would require H.M.O.'s to sign up Medicare beneficiaries for two years instead of the current one year. And the vice president would ban H.M.O.'s from the Medicare market if they showed a persistent pattern of cherry-picking the least expensive recipients by offering coverage in relatively healthy communities while not offering it in less healthy ones.
"We will no longer just accept the rising wave of H.M.O.'s dropping seniors and denying them coverage, all to enhance their bottom line," Mr. Gore said.
Another new proposal would eliminate existing Medicare copayments and deductibles for preventive services like hepatitis B vaccinations, colorectal and prostate cancer screenings, mammographies, pelvic exams and bone mass measurements. Gore aides said those changes would cost $8 billion over 10 years.
"No seniors should be priced out of tests that could save their lives," Mr. Gore said.

Opposition Candidate Claims to Defeat Milosevic
Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate in the Yugoslav presidential election, claimed victory over President Slobodan Milosevic in the elections Sunday. Mr. Kostunica's supporters said their tally showed him well on his way to a first-round victory. But Mr. Milosevic's ruling coalition said the president was ahead, though the government suspended vote counting; the legal deadline for announcing results is Thursday, and the opposition is concerned about Mr. Milosevic's willingness to acknowledge defeat.

A Verdict on Bosnia
A federal jury in Manhattan ordered the Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic to pay $4.5 billion to victims of rape, torture and genocide in the Bosnian war. Even though Dr. Karadzic is at large and the award may never be collected, the jury foreman said he and other members of the jury felt the need to express their outrage over the abuses. A10 

Barak Is Host to Arafat
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, met for the first time since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago. Officials on both sides do not expect that the deadlock in the peace negotiations will be broken, but see the meeting, in Mr. Barak's home, as progress in itself. A12
 
U.S. Defends Action in Peru
American officials defended their role in pressuring Panama to give refuge to Valdimiro Montesinos, Peru's ousted intelligence chief, asserting that his departure was necessary to avoid a military coup. Human rights groups criticized the United States for seeking to arrange a soft landing for Mr. Montesinos outside of Peru, where it could be more difficult to prosecute him for abuses. A10

Senate Approves Measure To Restore Everglades
The Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve a $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades and its ecosystem, a project supporters say is the most ambitious environmental restoration effort ever. The plan, drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers, will revamp South Florida's water supply by capturing and storing more rainwater, then redirecting its flow into the Everglades. The House has not set a vote for the bill. A1
 
Removal of Barricades Urged
Mayor Anthony A. Williams of the District of Columbia, backed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's nonvoting Congressional delegate, urged the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.

Determining Drunken Driving
A dispute in Congress over setting a national standard for what constitutes drunken driving is delaying a transportation spending bill. Advocates of a tougher standard want all states to adopt a blood alcohol level of 0.08, which a 170-pound man would expect to have after drinking five beers in two hours; 30 states currently use 0.10 as the level, which allows that man to drink six beers.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
The White Sox Are Showing That Sometimes Less Can Be More

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
No greater irony could impose itself on the playoffs than the presence of the Chicago White Sox. No. 26 in the Major League Baseball payroll standing for most of the season, the White Sox have the majors' best won-lost record and are the newly crowned champions of the American League Central.
That the White Sox could go so far on so little is a tribute to every facet of their organization, beginning with Jerry Reinsdorf, the chairman. But that's where irony rears its delicious head. 
 As the players association's Enemy No. 1, as an owner who would fight the players to the catastrophic end over control of players salaries, Reinsdorf has produced a team that undermines every argument the owners make about salaries and payroll disparity. At a time when officials and owners have identified payroll disparity as the game's most pressing problem, a team that pays its players one-third the amount the Yankees pay theirs has already clinched its spot at the postseason party, while the Yankees still plod on to secure their place.
Not only that, but the Cleveland Indians, with a payroll twice that of the White Sox, have been bumped from their perennial place in the A.L. Central and may not even earn an invitation to the party.
But then, in terms of economic impact, this has been a very different season from last. Last season the playoffs were populated by teams with 8 of the 11 highest payrolls. The trend was painfully clear, officials and owners lamented, and would never be reversed without some drastic change in the system.
A big payroll did not guarantee postseason play, they said in a frequent refrain, but a team could not reach postseason play without a big payroll. But this is a new year. Times have changed quickly. This season only four or five of the top 14 teams in payroll will play games after next Sunday. They are the Yankees, the Mets, Atlanta, St. Louis and maybe the Indians.
The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles once again lead the big spenders who have gained the least for their money. One wonders if they'll ever get it right. The Arizona Diamondbacks, who won a division championship last season, added about $10 million to their payroll this season, but may as well spend this October in the swimming pool beyond the right-center-field fence at their ballpark. Those three teams began the season among the top five in payroll.
Seattle, on the other hand, was 15th and San Francisco 17th. Close to the bottom were the White Sox and just ahead of them the Oakland Athletics. Three or all four of those teams will play postseason games.
In the interest of having Reinsdorf, the most militant of owners, explain how his poorly paid White Sox could outplay far wealthier teams, a telephone call was placed to his office in Chicago yesterday and then a request for a telephone interview was placed with the team's public relations department. The subject of the interview was provided.
"No, thanks," came the reply from Reinsdorf via a club spokesman. Maybe he's saving his secrets for a book. But is this any way to persuade the players something has to be done to adjust payrolls?
Billy Beane, the Athletics' general manager, was not as reticent about addressing the subject.
"Certainly we'd like to make that an antiquated argument," he said, referring to the payroll-disparity issue. "But the realism of it all is I think this is a pretty unique situation in Oakland. It's a testament to the talent of the young players who are here, but the system hasn't allowed any guarantee that we can retain our best players in the prime of their careers. These young players are not going go be young and inexpensive for long."
Beane's last comment was one of the points Commissioner Bud Selig made. "I won't deny there's a potential for an aberration once in a while," Selig said. "But the fact is the cost of keeping the White Sox up there will be so high. When the Reds almost made it last year, Jim Bowden said don't think this aberration makes the system right," he said referring to the Cincinnati general manager.
The White Sox and the Athletics aside, Selig said, disparity remains a problem.
"I think you definitely have overwhelming evidence of a correlation between high payroll and winning," he said. "See me next year. I'm confident of that. Remember, you still have the same teams winning, the Yankees, Atlanta, the Mets. Let's see what happens in the playoffs. If there's an aberration, it's a quick short aberration."
He recalled what Drayton McLane Jr., the Houston owner, said of the Astros' three division titles: "Someone had to win the National League Central, but we got banged out in the first round each time."
Not surprisingly, the people in the union office offered a different view of this season's developments.
"I think at a certain point you have to have some sympathy for the owners," Gene Orza, the union's No. 2 man, said, then proceeded to cite examples of dire projections some owners have presented during labor negotiations in the last 15 years.
"In 1985 it was Oakland going out of business and they turned around and won three division championships in a row," Orza said. "Then they picked Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh won a few division championships. Then it was San Diego, but San Diego was in the World Series. It's been a string of bad luck for them, almost Kafkaesque bad luck."
If Reinsdorf shows up at any of the negotiating sessions next year after talks for a new collective bargaining agreement begin, the dialogue between him and Orza would probably be worth the price of a playoff ticket.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Expands on Education Theme, Saying a Reading Crisis Endangers the Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., Sept. 25

 BODY:
Sounding his new slogan intended to raise anxieties about the nation's well-being, Gov. George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration today of helping create an "education recession" in which minority and low-income students were routinely allowed to fail.
Seeking to draw a clear link between the nation's future economic health and the quality of its schools, Mr. Bush asserted that the nation faced a reading crisis that had contributed to crime and caused American students to fall behind their peers in other industrialized nations. 
 "This is a leading indicator of troubles to come," Mr. Bush told 500 supporters early today at an elementary school in Beaverton, Ore., 10 miles west of Portland. "Children who never master reading can never master learning. As uneducated adults, they face a life of struggle on the fringes of our society. Some will turn to crime and end up in prison."
Mr. Bush, the Republican nominee for president, outlined his proposals to improve grade school reading programs, expand scholarship programs for math and science students and encourage annual testing of students in grades three through eight. He accused his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of promising change but instead protecting a failed status quo.
"They call for new spending without real reform or accountability," the Texas governor said. "It's like pumping gas into a flooded engine."
Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, countered that Mr. Bush would not be able to afford his education proposals because he would need the entire federal surplus to pay for his military programs and tax cuts. Mr. Bush denies that.
Mr. Bush's school event kicked off a three-day swing on the West Coast that today took him through Washington and Oregon, states where Democrats have carried recent presidential elections but where polls show Mr. Bush running neck-and-neck with Mr. Gore.
In both states, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, has recently drawn enthusiastic crowds of more than 10,000 people and is considered a threat to draw disaffected Democrats away from Mr. Gore.
Later today, Mr. Bush told several hundred supporters at an airport rally here that he would oppose breaching hydroelectric dams on the Snake River, as some environmentalists had proposed, to improve salmon habitats. He also attacked Mr. Gore for having said he wanted to study the issue further.
"He's worried about some kind of group's not liking him," Mr. Bush said. "He wants to study it as way of not taking a position."
Mr. Bush also plans to spend two days in California, where polls show Mr. Gore holding a comfortable lead. Part of Mr. Bush's goal is to tap into the state's wealth: he plans to raise more than $1.4 million for the state Republican Party at Silicon Valley and Los Angeles fund-raisers.
But Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, asserted that the governor also wanted to show that he planned to contest California until Election Day.
"He wouldn't be going there, at a critical point in the campaign, if we didn't think we could compete in California," Ms. Hughes said.
Coming about a week before what will probably be among the most important moments of the fall campaign -- a nationally televised debate with Mr. Gore -- today's event in Beaverton also gave Mr. Bush an opportunity to fine-tune his message on a signature issue before a friendly audience.
Mr. Bush did not hold a news conference but instead fielded gently worded questions from the largely partisan audience. With each response, Mr. Bush expounded on his plans to cut taxes, increase military spending and improve education.
While Mr. Bush has sought to lay blame for the nation's education problems squarely on the administration's doorstep, many educators contend that the federal government plays a relatively minor role in primary and secondary education. The most important decisions -- on curriculum, standards, testing, personnel and construction -- are made by state and local officials.
Mr. Bush himself acknowledged the limitations of federal action today, noting that Washington provides only 7 percent of public education spending.
"It's not as if the federal government is going to solve 100 percent of the problems," he said. "The best education is that where it's focused at the state and local government."
The focus of Mr. Bush's education plan is to ensure that all children read proficiently by the fourth grade. He would provide aid to help primary schools expand reading programs and reward schools that administered standardized tests annually to help educators identify learning problems early. For those and other proposals, Mr. Bush has called for increasing federal education spending by $47 billion over 10 years.
Schools that failed to reduce the gap in test scores between low-income students and their more affluent peers in three years would lose some of their federal Title I funds, which are earmarked for low-income children. That money, $1,500 a student, would be given directly to parents of children in failing schools, who could use it for other educational purposes, like hiring tutors or paying private-school tuition.
Mr. Gore has called for increasing federal education spending by $115 billion over 10 years to help districts build new schools, provide preschool for most students, hire more teachers and raise teacher salaries.
Like Mr. Bush, he has proposed withholding federal aid from states where test scores do not improve. But unlike his opponent, he would redirect that money to the local schools with the greatest problems, rather than give it to parents.
Toward the end of the education event in Beaverton, Mr. Bush was asked what could be done to help students reconnect with politics, and he recommended that candidates not make decisions based on polls or focus groups.
But the Bush campaign is not completely averse to such tools; the phrase "education recession" was carefully poll-tested before Mr. Bush first deployed it today.
While Mr. Bush was pitching his education ideas, his running mate, Dick Cheney, continued his attacks on Mr. Gore, accusing him of having a conflict of interest involving stock and oil prices.
Mr. Cheney told reporters in Springfield, Ohio, that Mr. Gore supported extending a moratorium on royalties paid by United States companies drilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. That position, Mr. Cheney said, would benefit Occidental Petroleum -- a company whose stock is held in a trust belonging to Mr. Gore's mother.
"Gore continues to be the prospective beneficiary of holdings of stock in Occidental Petroleum in the family trust," Mr. Cheney said, "and I think that that does constitute a conflict of interest."
Mr. Cheney said the vice president should either recuse himself from participating in decisions about energy policy or ask his mother to divest the family trust of oil stocks.
Ms. Spell, the spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said that the vice president neither owned nor controlled any stock in Occidental and that there was no way of knowing what stocks would be in the family trust when he inherited them.

Schumer Urges Steps To Aid Technology

BYLINE: By Jayson Blair 

 BODY:
Senator Charles E. Schumer told members of one of Silicon Alley's largest trade groups yesterday that if the city is to remain competitive in the technology industry it must create more options for less-expensive commercial space, force competition into the high-speed Internet field and train more skilled workers.
Senator Schumer, Democrat of New York, told about 1,000 people gathered in a ballroom at the Brooklyn Marriott for the annual New York Software Summit that a decade ago the city was reeling and that it was "surely at the bottom of any company's list as a prospective business site" until Silicon Alley began to revive the economy of Lower Manhattan in the mid-1990's. The event was sponsored by the New York Software Industry Association, a trade group. 
 There are now about 138,000 technology jobs in New York City, compared with about 27,000 in 1993, according to a New York New Media Association study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and released in March.
Mr. Schumer said the hiring by Silicon Alley companies "exceeds the number employed in banking, construction, legal services and the apparel business" and has helped diversify the city's economy.
He said that the city had taken a step in the right direction by offering incentives to technology companies interested in moving outside Lower Manhattan and into places like Harlem, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Long Island City, Queens. But without guarantees that the companies will be able to receive high-speed Internet access in those locations, there is no way New York will be able to compete, he added.
"If we don't, we will suffocate the new-media industry or drive them into the arms of New Jersey industrial park developers," Mr. Schumer said. Jayson Blair

"There's too many of our schools not meeting the challenge. Expectations are not high enough. Performance is not strong enough. And our leaders are not bold enough to reverse this slide. . . . 
 Texas has ended the education recession. And as president, I intend to end the education recession in every public school in America. The issue of education provides one of the biggest differences, one of clearest choices in this campaign for the presidency. With the reforms in Texas, reading scores have gone up and under this administration, national reading scores have gone down. Texas is closing the achievement gap between rich and poor and Anglo and minority. Under Vice President Gore, the achievement gap in America has grown wider.
Texas has spent money well and wisely, with results to show for it. Under the vice president and the administration, money has been spent without accountability or results."

A Drop in the Barrel?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
The decision to release part of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been widely criticized. Even many commentators with no ax to grind seem convinced that there is something irresponsible about the move.
But they're wrong. We should be tapping our oil reserves; in fact, the big mistake was not using them months ago. 
 Put it this way: Why has the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, derided as irrelevant only two years ago, suddenly become so effective again? The answer is that now, as in the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-80, circumstances have given OPEC what amounts to a temporary corner on the world oil market. Our long-run policy should be to encourage production and discourage consumption, so this doesn't happen again. But in the meantime we should try to prevent OPEC from taking full advantage of that corner. Releasing oil reserves to set a cap on prices -- and making it clear that we are prepared to release more -- will do exactly that.
Successful attempts to corner markets are rare, but they happen. A Japanese company managed to corner the entire world copper market in the mid-1990's (though it lost it all by overplaying its hand). The standard procedure is to surreptitiously buy up a large part of the supply of your chosen commodity, then pull some of that supply off the market, causing prices to soar for the rest. In effect, the market manipulator creates a temporary monopoly position for himself -- the market corner -- and exploits that temporary monopoly by selling some but not all of his stockpile at very high prices.
OPEC did not follow the classic procedure, but events have produced much the same result. Very low oil prices a few years ago discouraged independent producers; oil exploration fell off sharply. Then demand for oil surged as Asia recovered from its financial crisis and Americans bought ever more S.U.V.'s. The result is that for the time being, even with non-OPEC production at maximum, a few major exporting nations know that they have enormous market power. By producing a few hundred thousand barrels a day less than they could, they can drive prices on the oil they do produce to levels not seen in many years.
This situation won't last indefinitely. As long as we don't do something foolish like encourage consumption by cutting taxes on gasoline, new supplies of oil, together with falling demand in response to high prices, will eventually eliminate that market power. Until then the oil exporters have us, yes, over a barrel, and are exploiting their temporary advantage with gusto.
But if withholding a few hundred thousand barrels a day from the market can drive prices sky-high, putting a similar amount back in can bring them back down to earth -- as demonstrated by the sharp drop in oil prices that followed the announcement of plans to tap U.S. strategic reserves. And Western governments have more than a billion barrels in reserve. Why not use those reserves to break the market corner, or at least to limit its effectiveness?
Some warn that if we supply more oil, OPEC will supply less. Indeed, yesterday Libya's oil minister made that threat explicit. But the logic of the situation suggests that this threat isn't credible. Oil producers know that they are getting higher prices for their oil now than they will in a year or two; the only reason they are not pumping as much as they can is that they believe that holding back will keep prices high. But if they know that attempts to drive up prices by restricting production will be offset by increased releases from Western reserves, they will have less, not more, reason to keep oil off the market. A credible promise (threat?) to use our petroleum reserves to prevent prices from going too high might well actually persuade OPEC to produce more than it otherwise would.
Remember that we're not talking about fundamental market forces here. This market is already being manipulated by a handful of exporting-nation governments -- so why shouldn't the importing-nation governments also enter the game? We have a lot of influence over this market, if we choose to use it. And it would be not just a shame, but positively shameful, if we allow ourselves to be deterred from acting in our own interest because we're afraid to annoy the oil cartel.

PERSIAN MIRRORS
The Elusive Face of Iran
By Elaine Sciolino
Illustrated. 401 pages. The Free Press. $26.
For many Americans, Iran conjures up the hostage crisis, terrorism, the crowds chanting "death to America" and the fierce Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denouncing the United States and Israel. 
 Elaine Sciolino shows a different Iran. More than 20 years of visits, interviews, encounters and analyses have given Ms. Sciolino, a senior correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, her deep and wide-ranging insights. Her perceptive book "Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran" conveys the diversity of Iranians and the subtleties, dilemmas and contradictions of their society today.
Iran is not easy to know well, but Ms. Sciolino knows it intimately. Its people are warm and welcoming, but do not reveal themselves readily. Conversation, she reports, is full of politeness, self-abnegation, hypocrisy and lying, all to avoid offense and loss of face. What happens can be accepted, but talking about it is taboo if it strips away dignity and honor. Ms. Sciolino succeeds because she has unraveled a difficult code of cultural expectations.
She is particularly sensitive to Iranian women. "There is an unspoken bond among us that transcends culture, history, nationality and language," she writes. She shows both their helplessness and their power. In public life Iran's women must not be visible. Their heads and bodies must be covered. They may be beaten for violations of these rules.
In private and family matters, Islamic law puts them at a disadvantage. Although it is easy for a man to obtain a divorce, a woman can get one only in extreme circumstances, and the husband is given custody of all but the youngest children. Husbands can also take second wives or arrange "temporary marriages," which are religiously acceptable.
Nonetheless, women fill almost all the roles of a modern society. More than half of Iranian university students are women. Women work, drive, own property, have access to birth control and vote. Moreover, the book notes, women "are experts in finding ways around the constraints of the male-dominated system." Ms. Sciolino found everything from gender-segregated parties to beauty salons to a woman who ran a gambling business in her apartment, where women in low-cut dresses drank and danced to heavy-metal music.
This activity is very dangerous. There is always the possibility of an unexpected intrusion by the morals police, perhaps just to extort a bribe, perhaps to arrest the participants. The insecurity is deeply resented.
Women also show extraordinary courage in fighting the system. Azam Taleghani, the publisher of the weekly newspaper Payam-e Hajar, is committed to Islam and the revolution but challenges clerical ideas of male supremacy and promotes a more feminist interpretation of the Koran. Another activist, Faezeh Hashemi, published a newspaper until it was banned and now promotes sports programs to combat depression among women and to encourage them to fight for their rights.
Minorities do not fare well at all, but are nonetheless loyal to the Iran of their ideals. Zoroastrians and Christians are barely tolerated. Jews are accepted in business, medicine, engineering and law, but anti-Semitism is widespread, and the government maintains incessant anti-Israeli propaganda. Bahais are persecuted relentlessly. Their marriages are not recognized by the state. Their property has been confiscated. They have been expelled from the universities and many have been executed.
But even under this pressure, the religious minorities are loyal. Jews -- Persian is their native language -- feel profoundly, truly Iranian. And a Bahai engineer says: "I am Iranian. I love this country."
Courage and love are essential because the authorities are powerful and oppressive. The clerical establishment, headed by the supreme leader, now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls the judiciary and large sectors of the economy. A vast apparatus of military, police, intelligence officers, morals enforcers and organized vigilantes is used to crush drugs, gambling, homosexuality, prostitution, rape, murder, spying, counter-revolutionary activities and "sowing corruption on earth." Above all, it punishes women for being improperly dressed in public. Recently Iranian journalists and students have been beaten and killed.
Still, the authorities have not been able to check the demand for a transformation of the Islamic Republic into an Islamic democracy. There is a vigorous though embattled press. Guardedly, young people, women and intellectuals, including many liberal clerics, struggle for the future.
Recent elections gave 70 percent of the seats in parliament to liberals, but they are still paralyzed by the powers of the conservatives, and it is not yet clear who will win. Although the struggle is sometimes framed as a conflict between Persian and Islamic identities, religion and popular culture, clerical rule and freedom, dictatorship and democracy, in this supple and sophisticated country even liberals accept the Islamic state. Looking beneath the surface, Ms. Sciolino makes us aware of deeper currents flowing toward political compromise and synthesis.
Iranians, she points out, have a love-hate relationship with the United States. In politics it is the Satan that opposed Iran in the war with Iraq, shot down a civilian airliner, orchestrated an embargo and sides with Israel. Yet America, avidly consumed on television, audio and videocassettes and computer software, is the country of Iranian dreams. It embodies their fantasies of a good life. American relations with this fascinating nation hold unanticipated possibilities.
Through the eyes of Ms. Sciolino, we see a culture of paradoxes: a nation that is open and welcoming but remains hidden and mysterious; a clerical dictatorship but one of the Middle East's liveliest democracies; a puritanical regime but a people who love everyday life; a severe orthodoxy but an expressive cinema and an argumentative press; a state that makes control of women its first concern but whose women are powerful as personalities and even subversive; a revolution that has rejected secularism but a nation heading toward a fusion of Islamic and Persian identities.
First and foremost, Ms. Sciolino shows Iranians as human beings trying to cope with an unusual and very difficult situation. For this wise perspective the reader is grateful.

HEADLINE: The New Kings of Soft Money

BYLINE: By William Kristol and Jeffrey Bell; William Kristol is publisher of The Weekly Standard. Jeffrey Bell, a principal in Capital City Partners, a public policy consulting firm, was an aide to the presidential campaign of Gary Bauer.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Republicans and conservatives around the country desperately want Rick Lazio to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York Senate race. Yet the Lazio campaign is forcing them to rethink two of their most cherished dogmas: Republican faith in soft money, the unrestricted donations to political parties and outside groups that are used to help campaigns, and conservative aversion to campaign finance reform.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's reluctant acceptance Saturday of a soft-money ban was a victory for Mr. Lazio. The New York Senate 2000 Committee, an arm of the Democratic senatorial campaign organization that has been advertising on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, was spending more than $1 million a week of soft money on TV "issue ads," with a lot more to come. Mr. Lazio has raised more hard money (that is, individual contributions directly to the campaign, which are limited to $1,000 a person) than Mrs. Clinton. If the agreement to ban soft money more or less holds, as pressure from the media may ensure, Mr. Lazio should have an advertising advantage in the last month of the campaign. 
 So much for Republicans' belief that soft money is their friend. Republicans, of course, as a pro-business party, have raised their share of soft money. But the Democrats have now caught up and, in fact, are moving ahead. Soft-money raising, focused on economic interests and unconstrained by any legal limit on contributions, is particularly suited to the Democratic Party of the Bill Clinton era -- a party that is at once pro-business and pro-government and that is willing to approach corporate interests with the prospect that government policies can help or harm their industries. That's why the committees that aid Democratic candidates for Congress are in their best position in decades relative to their Republican counterparts -- despite the Republicans' majorities in Congress.
Most competitive Republican candidates, on the other hand, have an advantage in $1,000 donations and an even bigger advantage in smaller contributions. Isn't it in Republicans' interest to revive the hard money system by increasing individual limits and curbing the soft money system? Rick Lazio thinks so. And others are coming around to this view.
Why did Mrs. Clinton agree to a limit that could hurt her campaign? Because she thought that not agreeing would harm her even more. She was probably right.
Conventional wisdom in Washington, especially conservative conventional wisdom, is that campaign finance reform doesn't matter as an issue. Conservatives resolutely refuse to learn any lesson from John McCain's thumping of George W. Bush in New Hampshire, when he made campaign reform his central theme -- or from Mr. McCain's subsequent defeat after he veered from that message. But campaign reform turns out to have surprising political salience. Conservatives should welcome this fact, since they have no stake in the current system.
The great conservative triumphs of our time came, after all, before the rise of soft money: Ronald Reagan's near-victory, fueled by small-dollar, hard-money donations, in his primary challenge of 1976; the conservative gains in the Congressional elections of 1978 and 1980; and Mr. Reagan's winning presidential campaign of 1980. The full flowering of the soft money system in 1996 has coincided with a period of conservative political and policy retreat.
Is it too much to ask our fellow Republicans and conservatives to rethink their self-defeating defense of the current corrupt campaign finance system, and shape campaign reform legislation that would be good for them and for the country?

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
A Dream of Zinfandel, Delivered to the Door

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
EVERY year around this time, the mail brings a raft of notices from California's small exclusive wineries offering their latest vintage. The wines are listed with prices, and an address to which I should send my check.
There's only one problem: they won't sell me any wine. There are 29 states in which it is illegal to ship wine from another state directly to a consumer. I live in one of them, New Jersey, and work in another, New York. 
 These laws are strongly supported by the liquor and wine wholesalers and by most retailers. They are terrified that the Internet, through which most of these direct sales are made, is going to put them out of business. The states support these laws for fear that direct shipping will elude their taxes.
I might not be so exercised over all this if, with the mails blocked to me, I could slip around to my local wine merchant and buy the wine there.
But I can't.
In the last 40 years, the number of liquor wholesalers has shrunk by a staggering 97 percent. And while their numbers have dwindled, the number of wineries has exploded. There are more than 800 in California alone, producing some 4,000 different wines. The wholesalers are more interested in volume than variety, and that leaves most people without access to some of best small producers in the country.
As a result, hundreds of small wineries, desperate for an outlet, have turned to the Internet and mail order, but they find themselves largely stymied there as well.
Understandably, the frustrated winemakers and their customers have begun to fight back. And they are finding a sympathetic ear in some courts. In the past year, wineries and consumers have filed lawsuits in six states asserting that to single out wine for special controls is discriminatory, a restraint of trade and a violation of the interstate commerce clause, which grants Congress the exclusive authority to regulate commerce among states.
In two of the suits, in Indiana and Texas, the plaintiffs won. On Sept. 13, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Indiana decision, a ruling that a spokeswoman for the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Juanita Duggan, called "a major step forward for the state officials who are trying to prevent out-of-state alcohol shippers from evading taxes and selling wine, liquor and beer without checking ID's."
John DeLuca, the president of the Wine Institute, a trade group that deals with legislation and consumer issues affecting the wine industry, said that the decision seemed to be based mostly on courtroom technicalities. A consumer group, the Informal Coalition to Preserve Consumer Access to Wine, noted that with laws being challenged in New York, Virginia, Texas, Florida and North Carolina, "the Seventh Circuit opinion will certainly not be the last word on this issue."
A week earlier, the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York denied a motion by the wholesalers' lawyers to dismiss the New York suit. New York liquor laws make it illegal to ship or advertise wine in the state without a license. Out-of-state wineries are ineligible for licenses. In allowing the suit challenging the New York laws to go to trial, Judge Richard Berman cited United States Supreme Court cases that declared states' laws invalid if their purpose was "mere economic protectionism," which of course is the fundamental purpose of the laws being challenged.
The wholesalers hotly deny this, claiming they are equally concerned about the effects of the under-age drinking that direct shipping would surely encourage. "The Constitution prevailed over reckless disregard for temperance, tax collection and local custom," Ms. Duggan said.
The United States Senate is expected to consider a new direct shipping bill, probably in the remaining weeks before the end of the current session. Sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and called the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, the bill would, in essence, allow the states to get federal help in prosecuting out-of-state wineries that ship wine directly to a wine drinker.
By itself, the bill probably wouldn't get anywhere. Tacked on to one appropriations bill or another, it will probably pass, but direct shipping advocates say it will have minimal effect on the growing number of suits in the federal courts aimed at overthrowing the states' shipping laws.
The whole fracas will almost certainly end up in the Supreme Court, not because it's important that some dot-com plutocrat gets his Pahlmeyer Chardonnay from Jason Pahlmeyer himself, but because it affects the future of e-commerce and what many consider outmoded interpretations of the 21st Amendment.
Back in 1933, the idea behind the 21st was to keep gangsters out of the liquor business. The thugs never did get out; they just went legit, as Damon Runyon would say, and with the people who had been locking them up on their side, they prospered.
Now, for the first time, the wholesalers face a serious threat. And not just from a passel of wine geeks. The rise of the Internet has created a new dynamic in the business world, one that a group of outmoded monopolists, with a few prohibitionists along for old times' sake, cannot long withstand. Besides, once the wineries agreed to pay state taxes -- which they have -- it was all over but the shouting.
It may take a while, but one day not too far off, clicking on zinfandel and waiting for the Federal Express delivery will be an essential part of the wine experience.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Where Wine Can't Go"
Dark-shaded states do not allow wine from out of state to be shipped to consumers. All other states limit shipping, either allowing it only from states with reciprocal agreements on wine sales, by wineries with special licenses, or in limited amounts.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Index Rose In September Over Job Security

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose in September as optimism about job security bolstered the outlook for the rest of the year, the Conference Board said yesterday.
The board's index of consumer confidence increased to 141.9 this month from 140.8 in August. The September reading was close to the record 144.7 set in January and matched in May. 
 "Nothing in this latest survey suggests the economy will run out of steam soon," said Lynn Franco, an economist with the Conference Board, a private research group based in New York.
Unemployment at 4.1 percent, close to a 30-year low, and higher earnings have buoyed confidence, and that should prolong the economy's record nine-year expansion, analysts said. Growth has also pushed the poverty rate to a 20-year low and sent household income to the highest ever in 1999, a separate report from the Census Bureau showed yesterday.
The Conference Board's survey of 5,000 households found the share of consumers expecting more jobs to become available rose to 17.9 percent in September from 17.1 percent in August. The share of consumers seeing jobs as hard to get dropped to 10.7 percent from 11.5 percent.
"Until this rises -- which means until the unemployment rate rises -- confidence will remain strong," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y.
Still, consumers may be scaling back spending plans, the report suggested. The share of survey participants expecting to buy new homes, cars and major appliances all fell in September.
Oil prices that rose to a 10-year high last week have pushed up the cost of gasoline and heating oil. That leaves less money for other things.
The price of gasoline at the pump was as high as $1.60 a gallon this month, up 22 percent since the start of the year. Home heating oil prices are up 37 percent so far this year.
"The oil price run-up will start to hurt confidence a bit if it continues," said Ethan Harris, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. "Once people start seeing home heating oil bills, that could do it."

HEADLINE: Arafat's Visit to Barak's Place Broke the Ice, Both Sides Say

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept. 26

 BODY:
It was just a little suburban dinner party, nothing fancy. The host and his guest of honor cracked jokes. They strolled in the garden for an intimate chat. And then the host kissed his guest goodbye, walked him to a waiting Israeli military helicopter and waved as the guest, wearing his trademark kaffiyeh, flew back to Gaza City.
A senior adviser to Yasir Arafat said the late-night supper, at Prime Minister Ehud Barak's private home in Kochav Yair on Monday, was the single best meeting ever between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. 
 The adviser, Nabil Shaath, said today that it had been "very cordial," even congenial. He noted that the two men had walked together to the balcony twice -- "and both came back."
Similarly, Mr. Barak said the evening had been "warm and open."
How did the two leaders move from tense, strained relations to hugs in a single evening? Only their advisers know. Has improved chemistry shortened the distance from a deadlock to a permanent peace treaty? Probably not.
Nothing substantive was discussed, the advisers said.
But today both sides were willing to declare fresh momentum and, as their negotiators were landing in the United States, to move forward once more into yet another "decisive" phase of peacemaking.
"Yesterday, in my home in Kochav Yair," Mr. Barak said today, "we met with Arafat and the entire Palestinian leadership for a warm, open meeting that I believe will help us in our efforts to renew the negotiations. I would say that we are at the entrance to a very intensive effort and, in a way, to the last effort in this round to reach a breakthrough."
Such an intimate meeting between Mr. Arafat, once Israel's mortal enemy, and an Israeli leader would have been unthinkable just years ago. Mr. Arafat only made one previous visit to an Israeli prime minister's home, and that was to pay condolences to the family of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin after he was assassinated in 1995.
Mr. Shaath said the Kochav Yair meeting had been engineered by an American Jewish businessman, S. Daniel Abraham. Mr. Abraham, founder of the Slim-Fast Food Companies, is a leading contributor to the Democratic Party's election campaigns this year and a backer of Israeli-Arab peace efforts through the Washington-based Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, which he co-founded.
While Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat made an effort at developing a relationship last fall and earlier this year, they never clicked. Since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago, they have not communicated directly, though they did shake hands at a United Nations gathering of world leaders earlier this month.
The 15-day meeting at Camp David, presided over by President Clinton, did not produce a permanent peace accord to end 52 years of bitter conflict, as planned. But it provoked substantive debate on all of the issues and something close to a meeting of the minds on the key issues of territorial division, water resources and security cooperation.
After Camp David, though, both sides say the momentum evaporated and they lost ground on those issues. In a rare news conference by a senior Palestinian official today, Mr. Shaath, the minister of planning and international cooperation, blamed the Israelis for focusing too much on the most difficult issue, the future status of the holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al Sharif.
"We can live without turning our feuds into religious issues," he said. "And the stalemate cannot be broken if we just concentrate on Haram al Sharif. It wouldn't be at all bad if instead, where we are close we made things closer. Trust would be created if on five to seven issues we could measure some progress."
In Washington, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to meet separately with American mediators to review a bridging proposal that seeks to reconcile conflicting demands on all of the key issues on the negotiating table.
Mr. Shaath said President Clinton first reviewed a final copy of the document on Friday and suggested summoning the parties to review it rather than making it public, to the risk of provoking further discord.
"The man is agonizing over it," Mr. Shaath said, referring to Mr. Clinton, "because he doesn't want another failure."
The Palestinians do not feel the same sense of urgency as Mr. Barak, who will face a possible dissolution of his minority government when the Israeli Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.
Mr. Shaath said Mr. Barak could find a way to reconstitute his coalition. He also said the Palestinians thought there were advantages to dealing with a "lame duck" American president after the November elections.
"The Israelis are trying to create a mental picture of Palestinians like croupiers at a casino pocketing all the chips and not giving anything in return," Mr. Shaath said. "I think the giving has already happened.
"Israel has had a great two years" because of Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation that has reduced terrorism, he said.

HEADLINE: Protests Distract Global Finance Meeting

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Black-masked protesters hurled cobblestones ripped from Prague's medieval streets and attacked the police with homemade gasoline bombs today, trying desperately -- but unsuccessfully -- to shut down the global finance meeting here.
The riot police had to escort government ministers attending the annual conference of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank into special subways cars to whisk them away from their meeting at the end of the session, though by evening, normal access had been fully restored. 
 The violence, which both the police and many protesters said was provoked by squadrons of European anarchists and communists, did not stop the meetings.
But it did steal the media spotlight, giving it to protesters who had vowed to re-create the blockade of the trade talks last year in Seattle.
Inside the halls, financial leaders who are here to discuss aid policies tried to show that they are at least as passionate about the poor as the protesters are. Many pledged to rededicate themselves to fighting poverty, even to inspiring a new spirituality.
Everyone seemed to cite the statistic that 3 billion people live on $2 or less a day.
"Something is wrong when the richest 20 percent of the global population receive more than 80 percent of the global income," James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said in his keynote address. "Our challenge is to make globalization an instrument of opportunity and inclusion -- not fear."
The leaders of the World Bank and the I.M.F., and finance ministers from some rich nations that back them, said they would speed up debt relief, allow poor countries to have more say in planning loan programs and consider replacing some loans with grants.
But by afternoon, protesters had stolen the show, at least as far as the television cameras were concerned. The demonstrators included Czech anarchists, Italian Communists, British schoolteachers and German truck drivers, many of whom contended that the lending agencies are the problem, not the solution.
The Prague police had prepared for a siege, with 11,000 officers around the city. In the end, the police estimated that there were 6,000 demonstrators. The protesters, who once expected 20,000, claimed that they actually had 10,000. Even if they were right, they still failed to match the police one for one, and they fell short of the tally in Seattle and at other recent protests.
Early in the day, in what has become the signature vandalism, several people smashed the windows and tore up the interior of a McDonald's in Wenceslas Square, the site of the peaceful protests during Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution in 1989.
Near the hilltop Congress Center, where the meetings were held, a small group of demonstrators provoked the police by hurling fist-sized stones that later littered the street behind police lines. Some protesters wore black masks and carried the red-and-black flag of anarchists. Several threw Molotov cocktails, igniting the uniforms of officers stretched in a line across the street.
The police responded with repeated shots of tear gas. They sprayed water from cannons to disperse the crowd, while armored personnel carriers raced into position to close off the streets.
The police said as many as 65 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, most of them officers involved in the melee. There were dozens of arrests. A few demonstrators were hurt by the police who seized them, with one man bleeding from the face after four officers threw him to the ground.
The skirmishes spread to the valley below the meeting hall, where demonstrators burned barricades of wood and tires to keep the police back, then smashed windows and destroyed a car. An American flag was burned, while protesters yelled, "No new world order."
Tomas, a 19-year-old from the Moravia region of the Czech Republic with orange hair and a rooster cut, was there throwing plastic bottles at the police. "I hate the police and they hate me," he said. "I would like some real fighting to happen."
A 23-year-old man from Berlin who refused to give his name carried several cobblestones as he prepared to rush police lines. He removed his black mask to reveal his face, seared red from pepper gas.
"To fight them for me is symbolic of fighting the I.M.F., which will never change on its own," he said.
Today's protests did succeed in blocking access to the conference center for several hours in the afternoon. But by that time meeting participants had already arrived, and their sessions continued uninterrupted, though delegates surrounded television monitors to get the latest news from the barricades.
By late afternoon, some people at the meeting were complaining to guards that they had planes to catch and had to leave the center immediately, prompting authorities to open a subway station to officials only.
Protesters had been gathering in Prague for a week, with many of them vowing to turn this session into a repeat of Seattle, when demonstrators briefly kept delegates away from their meetings.
Many protesters decried the violence.
"We're really disappointed," said Chelsea Mosen, an organizer. "We were really hoping for a nonviolent protest on the basic issues of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, but instead now the focus has shifted to the streets of Prague."
Catherine Devon, 38, a teacher who traveled from Birmingham, England, by train for 24 hours to reach Prague this morning, said, "This is not what I came for." She said she decided to join the demonstrations because her son often woke up in the middle of the night, frightened about global warming.
"I want to tell him I am doing something about it," she said. "We must show up every time these people meet. Someday, they will get the message."
Though they attracted less attention, delegates at the meetings from developing countries also challenged the lending agencies and wealthier governments to improve their policies.
Trevor A. Manuel, South Africa's finance minister and the honorary chairman of this year's meetings, scolded the representatives of wealthy nations for pressing poor nations to embrace free markets while often protecting their own markets from the goods that developing countries produce.
"The robust state of the global economy is due in no small measure to the success of the fundamental reforms undertaken by developing countries," Mr. Manuel said. "Their boldness needs to be matched by the richer countries."
The United States treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, who addressed the opening ceremonies early in the day, prodded the World Bank to spend more on human development projects, including education. Such proposals have met some resistance on the bank's board.
Mr. Summers also called on the bank to provide some grants as well as its traditional loans, echoing a recommendation first made by a Congressional review panel that was highly critical of the bank's practices.
Mr. Summers said the grants would go to programs like those that help prevent the spread of AIDS, whose benefits cannot be measured in money.
It was left to Vaclav Havel, the Czech president and former dissident, to try to reconcile the demands of protesters with the money controlled by the ministers. He asked whether all the proposals to increase material well-being had obscured the task of improving spiritual health.
"We often hear about the need to restructure the economies of the poorer countries and about the wealthier nations being duty bound to help them accomplish this," Mr. Havel said. "But I deem it even more important that we should begin also to think about another restructuring -- a restructuring of the entire system of values that forms the basis of our civilization today."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For Venezuela's President, Steep Oil Prices Are Just

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 26

 BODY:
With oil prices at their highest level in a decade and the United States and other industrial countries calling for relief, heads of state and oil ministers from the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are to begin a two-day summit meeting here on Wednesday.
Since the group is more united than in the recent past, and several of its members, including the host, Venezuela, anticipate record oil revenue this year, the mood of the gathering promises to be both celebratory and unbending. 
 The meeting also offers President Hugo Chavez, who has played an important role in the tripling of world oil prices over the last 18 months, a chance to step onto the world stage as a critic of the rich and defender of the poor.
"OPEC has risen again," Mr. Chavez exulted in a televised speech to his country on Monday. He described the price of crude oil, which last week soared at one point to nearly $38 a barrel before retreating some, as "fair and just" and said that with "the equilibrium of the universe hanging in the balance," he wanted the oil producers' group to use its power to create "a more just world."
"For a century, they took millions of barrels of oil at giveaway prices," Mr. Chavez said Sunday on his weekly radio program, referring to the "bad habits" of industrial nations in another preview of the arguments he is likely to make during the conference. "How nice it would be if they also lowered the prices of things they sell to us, lowered the prices of computers, medicine, cars and the interest rates on the foreign debt," he said.
Ali Rodriguez Araque, the president of OPEC and Venezuela's oil minister, said no decision on a production increase would be made during the conference. The cartel's members account for three-quarters of the world's proven oil reserves and more than 40 percent of output.
Consumer nations have been calling for such a step, but Mr. Rodriguez said it would not be discussed until an OPEC ministers' meeting on Nov. 12.
The gathering here begins, though, with cartel members unsure how to respond to the Clinton administration's decision last week to release 30 million barrels of crude oil from the United States reserve.
Since Thursday, after Vice President Al Gore's call for the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, prices have fallen by about $4 a barrel. Today in Washington, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the administration would consider releasing more oil in 30 days if prices did not stay down.
Oil prices were little changed today in New York, where the November delivery price fell 7 cents, to $31.50 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, initially dismissed Mr. Clinton's move as "an election ploy requested by Al Gore," but upon arrival here Monday, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the American action "will stabilize the price of oil."
Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, criticized the American move as "a very short-term measure that may give the wrong signal that OPEC doesn't have enough capacity" to meet market demand.
His Libyan counterpart, Abdullah Salem el-Badri, said the action by the United States "comes at the wrong time."
During the conference, OPEC members are also expected to increase criticism of the calls made by industrial nations at the International Monetary Fund talks in Prague over the weekend for OPEC to contain the price of oil.
OPEC members argue that the main sources of high prices at the gasoline pump are high demand and exorbitant taxes in industrial nations.
"We have done our part" by increasing production by a total of 3.2 million barrels a day this year, OPEC's general secretary, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said at a news conference here Monday. "If they want to bury their heads in the ground over the heads of their citizens, that's up to them," he added, referring to European nations that have led the call for lower oil prices as many of their people have blocked roads and otherwise engaged in public protest.
For his part, Mr. Rodriguez argues that OPEC is already producing two million barrels a day more than the world economy needs and that speculators are benefiting at the expense of consumers. In the last six months, he said, "OPEC was supplying the market more than was required, and that means stocks are building somewhere."
This week's gathering here is only the second in OPEC's 40-year history intended to bring heads of state of member countries together, the other having been a 1975 meeting in Algeria. Efforts to organize similar events have foundered in the past, in 1980 because of war between Iran and Iraq and in 1990 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Venezuela was chosen as the site in part because it holds OPEC's rotating presidency, but also because OPEC's founding was largely a Venezuelan initiative. On Sept. 10, 1960, with the price of oil falling, Venezuela's energy minister at the time, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, persuaded four Mideast nations to join him in "securing a steady income to the producing countries."
Over the years, though, Venezuela, which has the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East, earned a reputation in the cartel as a quota buster, almost always willing to raise production in an effort to compensate for falling prices. As the price of crude oil fell below $10 a barrel and OPEC members drifted deeper into debt, those complaints intensified.
Since taking office in February 1999, Mr. Chavez has become one of the leading hawks within OPEC, creating the possibility of conflict with more cautious members like Saudi Arabia. Venezuela produces 2.65 million barrels a day, more than six times its domestic consumption. Mr. Chavez hopes to use the windfall resulting from expected petroleum revenue of $26 billion this year, up more than $10 billion over last year, to help finance an ambitious $2.1 billion social works program he announced earlier this month.
"OPEC has increased its production this year much more than is necessary," he said recently. "We must never allow ourselves to fall to our knees again."
Hoping to expand OPEC's influence further, the Venezuelan president has also made it clear that he would like to see new members enter the group. Early this month he invited Russia to join, and he has said that the door is also open to Latin American producers like Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico.
"This meeting isn't only about oil," Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel sometimes described as a populist, said on Monday. The president, who led led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, said it was also necessary for the oil group to take the lead in discussing issues of "poverty, inequality in the world, foreign debt and the autonomy of nations."

Japanese Learning the Value of Corporate Public Relations

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry thought it might be a good idea to prepare a handbook for member companies interested in learning how to cope more effectively with the media during a crisis.
Its idea was so good the chamber badly underestimated the demand. The 1,000 copies it had printed in mid-July sold out in a day. To catch up, it printed an additional 42,000. 
 Corporate Japan has suddenly awakened to the need for crisis control. Unsettled because of the public relations blunders committed by big Japanese companies like Bridgestone, Mitsubishi Motors and Snow Brand in recent weeks, Japanese managers are scrambling to learn how to avoid the appearance of looking irresponsible and uncaring.
Officials in charge of general affairs or public relations are collecting books and literature on crisis management, calling consultants for seminars and training sessions, and rethinking the way their companies handle public crises.
Tatsumi Tanaka, a Tokyo crisis management consultant, said his firm had been swamped with requests for lectures and seminars -- 10 times the requests he had been getting before July, when revelations of corporate skulduggery seemed to start coming all at once.
First there was a scandal at Snow Brand, a leading producer of milk and dairy products, which was held responsible for a food poisoning that sickened thousands. Then Mitsubishi Motors admitted it had concealed customer complaints about faulty automobiles for more than two decades. More recently, Bridgestone has been criticized in the Japanese media over the defective tires sold by the company's Firestone subsidiary, mostly in the United States. Bridgestone officials, who at first seemed to treat the scandal as a minor event in a foreign country, are now feeling the strain of public relations damage.
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, said recently that while Ford conducted a highly effective public relations campaign that faulted the tires, "Bridgestone's 'silence' strategy failed in that it only bred mistrust in consumers and investors."
Glen Fukushima, president in Japan of the consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said: "P.R. is not considered all that important. You can see that from the fact that public relations is not a big industry here."
There are about 200 public relations firms in Japan, a fraction of the number in the United States, and the majority of them are one-person operations. Most public relations work at these firms revolves around product and service promotions and rarely deals with crisis management.
A survey done by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce of member companies showed only 11 percent said they would contact a public relations firm or an advertising agency when a major crisis hit their company.
"Dealing with the media in a crisis is where Japanese companies are the weakest," said Atsushi Kuse, a crisis management expert. Consequently, he said, their response to the public often deviates wildly from what the public perceives as right.
Companies implicated in scandal often admit to only a small portion of what later turns out to be a systematic flaw in the company's products or quality control, as was the case with Mitsubishi and Snow Brand.
Sometimes, chief executives utter inadvertent remarks as they flounder through news conferences. When Snow Brand's president, Tetsuro Ishikawa, who resigned in disgrace in July, was confronted with a reporter asking him why he decided to cut short the news conference, Mr. Ishikawa replied under the gaze of TV cameras: "You! I haven't even been sleeping these days." The nationally televised scene was broadcast repeatedly.
Corporate attitudes toward public relations in Japan have been shaped partly by the country's postwar economic boom, when manufacturers mass-produced quality products at what were considered fair prices, industrial companies grew and the standard of living rose. The small number of consumer complaints were ignored or suppressed.
But the sensibilities of Japanese consumers have changed drastically in recent years. Their tastes have diversified and they are armed with information they can use to compare products and commiserate with each other.
"Japan's society is changing," Mr. Tanaka said. "Companies haven't realized that."
Even when Mr. Tanaka is called in by a scandal-hit company to consult, he said, the management often remains dishonest. "First, they lie to me," he said.
Another new variable is the gradual demise of lifetime employment in Japan. The readiness of many big companies to shed unwanted workers is spawning a growing number of disgruntled workers who no longer display the loyalty to their employers they once did.
Indeed, the Mitsubishi cover-up scandal came to light when an insider tipped off Transport Ministry officials about the company's practices.

HEADLINE: Hemophilia Drug Requires Applications

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Unable to manufacture enough of a new drug for hemophiliacs, the Bayer Corporation has taken the unusual step of asking patients to apply for the drug through a corporate program rather than getting it from a pharmacy or another distributor.
Under the company's new program, patients will fill out an application, including details of their medical history and their insurance coverage, and submit it with a prescription. If the patient is accepted, the program will deliver the new drug, Kogenate FS, directly to the patients. The first ones approved will get the drug first, with others put on a waiting list. 
 Bayer and doctors who treat hemophiliacs expect that for the foreseeable future demand for the new drug will greatly exceed the amount of Kogenate FS the company is able to make.
The new drug is a synthetic, genetically engineered version of the naturally occurring coagulation protein that is missing or deficient in people with hemophilia A, a condition affecting about 13,000 Americans. It can cost patients as much as $150,000 a year, according to the National Hemophilia Foundation, the nation's largest advocacy group for hemophiliacs.
Bayer executives said yesterday that they set up the unusual program because they did not want extra inventory of the drug held at pharmacies when it was in short supply.
"We believe that we are pioneering and finding a novel alternative to a distribution system that does not work," said Terry Tenbrunsel, vice president for sales and marketing at Bayer's U.S. operations.
But Bayer's new distribution program has angered doctors and advocates for hemophiliacs at the foundation. Leaders of the foundation said yesterday that there was already a shortage of the two other synthetic versions of the drug, known as blood-clotting factors.
The foundation's leaders said they feared that Bayer would accept patients based on their insurance coverage, which could leave out poor people on Medicaid and those without insurance.
"This is going to be about who has the best insurance," said Stephen E. Bajardi, the foundation's executive director.
But Bayer denied those assertions. Mr. Tenbrunsel said the program would evaluate the patients' applications and verify the insurance coverage just as a pharmacy or a home-care company would.
"It is a blind process," he said. "It doesn't matter what is the basis of your insurance coverage."
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota, said Bayer's new program, known as Bayer Direct, is unusual for the drug industry, but not unique.
Dr. Schondelmeyer said that when some early AIDS drugs were first approved, the drug companies distributed them through a limited number of mail-order companies. He said the program did not appear unreasonable as long as it was used only in the short term. Long term, the company should be able to find a way to meet demand, he said, and the regular distribution system should be used.
"This limits the marketplace from working," Dr. Schondelmeyer said. "Consumers can't go look for the drug at pharmacies and hospitals and get a better deal."
Kogenate FS is the new version of Bayer's Kogenate, a synthetic clotting factor that has been sold for several years, and will be priced similarly, Bayer said. Kogenate, which will be phased out, and another synthetic clotting factor, made by Baxter, have been popular with hemophiliacs because older drugs were made with human blood. In the 1980's, many hemophiliacs contracted hepatitis C, a potentially fatal liver infection, while taking the old drugs. Many also contracted H.I.V.
While Kogenate was a synthetic drug, it still contained albumin, a human protein that comes from blood. The new drug, Kogenate FS, contains one-thousandth the amount of albumin of Kogenate, and the company says that will reduce the potential risk of transmitting viruses to the patient.
Dr. Jeanne Lusher, a pediatric hematologist at the Children's Hospital of Michigan, said many patients now get their drugs through one of the companies that deliver drugs directly to homes. "That has worked very well," said Dr. Lusher, who also sits on the foundation's board. "This new program is really frightening to some patients."
Bayer has hired Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management company in Maryland Heights, Mo., to process the applications and deliver the drug. Bayer said that its factory, working 24 hours a day, can now produce enough of the drug for about 700 people. Bayer said it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration to double the capacity of certain equipment in the factory, which would let the company double the supply of the drug.

HEADLINE: Incomes Rise and Poverty Ebbs, Data Shows

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Census Bureau reported today that median household income topped $40,000 for the first time last year and that the percentage of households living in poverty dropped to the lowest point in more than two decades. It was the fifth straight increase in median income, the first time that has happened since the bureau started keeping track of household incomes since 1967.
In its annual reports on income and poverty, the bureau noted that median household income rose by 2.7 percent in 1999, to $40,816, from $39,744 the prior year. It reported that 11.8 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 1999, down from 12.7 percent the year before. The poverty rate in 1999 was defined as a household income of $17,029 for a family of four. 
 Over the long term, the bureau's reports describe an economy that is merely returning the country to where it was at the beginning of the 1990's. But they also present a vivid picture of sharp gains that occurred last year as the economic recovery reached further down the income scale. For example:
*Median income for African-American ($27,910), Hispanic ($30,735), as well as non-Hispanic white ($44,366) households reached the highest levels ever recorded.
*Households in the bottom fifth of the income scale saw their household earnings rise by 5.4 percent, the largest of any quintile.
*The number of people living in extreme poverty, defined as having incomes that are less than 50 percent of the official poverty line, dropped to 4.6 percent of the population, from 5.1 percent.
*More than 80 percent of the 2.2 million households that moved above the poverty line in 1999 lived in the inner cities.
*While seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, California, New York, South Dakota, Utah and Virginia -- and the District of Columbia saw their overall poverty rates decrease, no state saw a statistically significant rise in poverty.
"What's so striking about these numbers is that it shows that the economic progress is not just restricted to Silicon Valley or to the stock market," said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, after reviewing the census data.
Still, 1999 was only the second year in a row that median income topped the $38,837 level of 1989.
Released six weeks before the election, the eagerly awaited report often provides fodder for political campaigns. The Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore's campaign immediately claimed credit for the robust results.
"This certainly shows that progress has been made over the last eight years," said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. "But the central question of this campaign is how we build on our prosperity to make new progress and to benefit everyone, not just a few."
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also sought to take credit for the economic progress in his state during the past few years, pointing out that Texas' two-year average median income rose 3.5 percent, higher than the 3.1 percent increase for the country as a whole.
The Bush campaign attributed the growth in income to policies he pushed as governor, like the "two biggest tax cuts in Texas history."
The average two-year median income did rise faster than the national rate and more than several states, including Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. But Texas' income growth was less than that of states like Arkansas, Rhode Island and New York, and the District of Columbia.
There were, however, some downturns in the Census Bureau's upbeat news. For the second year in a row, the earnings gap between men and women increased. Median income for women who work full time, year-round, fell slightly to $26,324 from $26,433, while median income for men working full time rose to $36,376 from $36,126.
Median household income is the level at which half the 120 million households in the country bring in more money and half bring in less. It is considered a more accurate measure than average household income, which can be skewed by a relatively few super wealthy families.
In addition, for the sixth year in a row, the gap between the rich and the middle class and the poor did not change, and there is a dispute among economists as to whether it may have increased.
The bureau's calculations of income do not take into consideration some government benefits like the earned-income tax credit, which has directed billions of dollars of cash assistance to poor people who work. Census officials say factoring in the tax credit would cause a closing of the income gap between the rich and the poor.
On the other hand, the bureau does not factor in capital gains earnings on the sale of stocks or property when calculating income figures. Since the information on income is gathered from telephone interviews, census officials say people are generally not asked about their capital gains income, since most people do not have that information at their fingertips.
Some economists say including capital gains income would greatly widen the income gap between the affluent and the poor. They note that the Internal Revenue Service reports that capital gains income rose to $427 billion in 1998 from $163 billion in 1993, and that the great bulk of those earnings went to tax filers with incomes over $200,000.
"One begins to worry that inequality has stabilized at a historically high level," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization. "I don't see any good reason in an economy as strong as ours, at this point in the business cycle, that we don't seem to be nudging income inequality down."

HEADLINE: In Election Confusion, U.S. Sees Serb's Demise

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Surprised by the sweep of the vote for the opposition presidential candidate in Yugoslavia, but cautious about gloating, President Clinton praised the "brave people" there today for choosing change and sought to embolden them by offering to lift economic sanctions if they prevail.
Mr. Clinton, who has dealt throughout his presidency with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as a noxious central character, warned that although Mr. Milosevic seems to have lost his legitimacy, he may still try to "cling to power at the expense of his people." 
 Despite the public wariness, born of watching Mr. Milosevic manipulate his way out of seemingly impossible corners, the Clinton administration has concluded that the Yugoslav has finally lost his magic.
No longer, senior officials said today, is Mr. Milosevic invincible in the eyes of his people, and signs of fissures within Mr. Milosevic's ruling circle spelled the beginning of the end, they added.
Telling evidence of paralysis is appearing within his government, the officials said. Student leaders, who had been arrested and harrassed before the election, have been left alone by the police and the military in the last 48 hours. The barrage of official propaganda through the state news media has virtually ground to a halt, and acolytes of Mr. Milosevic have given varying accounts of the vote tally, creating a picture of confusion in the inner sanctum.
And the decision today by Mr. Milosevic to call a second round of voting on Oct. 8 was interpreted by administration officials as a desperate effort to buy time.
The fact that Mr. Milosevic did not announce an outright victory, the officials said, means that he either failed to set up an efficient scheme to steal votes or that he would have had to steal too many to make a credible claim. In contrast to Mr. Milosevic's weak election operation, the opposition movement managed to organize a fast parallel vote count, enabling them to announce a credible 54.66 percent victory for their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, over Mr. Milosevic's 35.01 percent.
Mr. Milosevic's forces suddenly announced today that preliminary results showed he had finished second with 40.23 percent, and the opposition had won with 48.22 percent. With neither side reaching more than 50 percent, the government said, a runoff is needed.
Clinton administration officials said they hoped that in the next two weeks the opposition would create even more of a steamroller and that Mr. Milosevic would not be able to withstand it.
But it is also possible, Balkan experts in the administration said, that Mr. Milosevic could try to cut a deal with Mr. Kostunica. And it is conceivable, given his past behavior, that Mr. Milosevic could create some kind of crisis: either an intervention in Montenegro, the smaller republic in Yugoslavia where the leadership boycotted the election, or a cancellation of the election altogether.
As they assessed the uncertain situation in Belgrade and other urban centers, the administration tried to weave a delicate balance between showing support for the opposition, which it helped finance, and keeping a distance so as not to offend Yugoslavia's voters.
Mr. Kostunica, a proud Serbian nationalist, is stridently anti-American and has repeatedly said that if he came to power, he would not allow Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague, to be handed over for trial. He has strongly criticized the West's war in Kosovo and the presence of NATO peacekeepers.
Extending a hand of friendship to the opposition -- and urging it to keep its courage -- Mr. Clinton said today in a speech at Georgetown University Law Center that Serbia, the dominant republic, would have much to gain with a change of power.
"If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe and the world will be open again to Serbia," Mr. Clinton said. "We will take steps with our allies to lift economic sanctions, and the people of Serbia who have suffered so much finally will have a chance to lead normal lives. I hope that day is arriving."
But he also acknowledged differences with the opposition, whose forces benefited in the last year from $25 million in support from the Clinton administration for get-out-the-vote groups and independent news media.
"I am under no illusions that a new government in Serbia would automatically lead to a rapprochement between the two of us," Mr. Clinton said. "And any new leader of Serbia should pursue, first and foremost, the interests of its own people."
In Europe, support for the opposition was unequivocal. The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said France, as the current president of the European Union, would reward an opposition victory with the rapid lifting of sanctions.
"The hour of change has struck in Belgrade," Mr. Vedrine said. "Something has begun with this vote that is no longer to be stopped."
In what administration officials saw as an encouraging sign, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, persuaded the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to join him in a statement in Moscow on Monday that stressed the vitality of the Serbian opposition and the democratic process.
If Russia can be removed from Mr. Milosevic's camp, then his isolation will be almost complete, officials here said. One of the comfort factors that Mr. Milosevic has traditionally offered his top cronies is the notion that there is always some major country for them to turn to.
The administration even took small cheer from the fact that Mr. Milosevic invited election observers to come from China -- he declined to accept them from anywhere else -- but that the Chinese did not come.
But as Mr. Clinton pointed out today, there was no certainty that the Yugoslav drama would end without violence.
"I do not underestimate Mr. Milosevic's desire to cling to power at the expense of his people," Mr. Clinton said, referring to the war in Kosovo last year and NATO air raids in Bosnia in 1995. "I have witnessed it, lived with it and responded to it first-hand."
In some quarters, Mr. Milosevic's desire for a second round of voting was seen as an effort to try to organize military and police units that would fight, if necessary.
"His strategy has always been: string them out and then beat them up," said one official, recalling the scenes in 1991 when Mr. Milosevic called out tanks against protestors in Belgrade.
But nearly 10 years later, it seems that the Serbian people have given more votes to a charismatic leader of a united opposition: Mr. Kostunica. And after three lost wars -- over Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- it seems that many in the military and the police have voted for him.
"The question now is how Milosevic will go out and who he will take out with him," said one administration official who has been at the center of Balkans policy. "Finally, the people stood up."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE COMPANY;
At Microsoft, Still Business According to Strategy and Plans

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Microsoft has long maintained that the government antitrust case would do nothing to alter its business practices or long-term strategy. And today, as it won at least a procedural victory in the case, the company had another opportunity to make its point.
In recent months, Microsoft has accelerated a range of business and technical initiatives, continuing its strategy of adding software applications to its operating systems -- like the browser that brought on the antitrust scrutiny -- and moving into new computing markets ranging from the largest mainframes to the video-game business. 
 Today, at a long-planned event, Microsoft and a group of industry partners unveiled new operating system software intended to take the company into the very high end of the corporate computing market. And Microsoft executives took the opportunity to reiterate that the antitrust suit would have no effect on the company's strategy.
Commenting on the Supreme Court decision today not to take a direct appeal of the antitrust ruling, leaving it in the hands of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, said: "I'm happy to get on with the legal process. This is really a positive procedural step forward."
The stock market initially reacted positively to the decision as well. The company's stock jumped up as much as 5 percent before settling back to close at $62.69, up 2.35 percent for the day, but still near the company's 52-week low of $60.38.
While most legal experts saw the Supreme Court's decision, which could extend the legal process as much as a year, as a qualified victory for Microsoft, some noted that its effect on the company might not be entirely positive.
"This is clearly a victory for Microsoft," said David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor, "because the appeals court has historically been more favorable to Microsoft."
But he and other analysts added that the decision could prolong the period of uncertainty that the company faces, leading to declining employee morale and holding down the company's stock price.
"This just prolongs the agony," said George Colony, president of Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., computer consulting firm. "I think they should get it over fast. I'd want resolution."
Whatever agony Microsoft might be feeling two and a half years after the antitrust case was brought, it is nonetheless pushing ahead on a variety of fronts to move into new markets and consolidate existing ones.
In its most ambitious strategic shift since December 1995, when it decided to "embrace and extend" the Internet market, the company embarked this summer on an ambitious strategy called .Net, essentially creating a set of programs resembling an operating system that will live on the Internet rather than on individual desktop computers.
Then this fall the company firmed up its plans to try to compete with the video game giants Nintendo, Sega and Sony, previewing its first Microsoft-branded computer system, the X-Box, to be available at the end of next year.
Today Microsoft added the final piece of a computing strategy initially sketched out by its former chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, a decade ago: to produce operating systems stretching from the smallest hand-held computers to the most powerful supercomputers.
Microsoft's aggressive move into the market for large corporate computer systems, bringing it into even sharper competition with companies like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Oracle, is viewed as a significant transformation of the company by analysts, who said it would require a fundamental change in Microsoft's corporate culture as well.
"Until now Microsoft's NT operating system has never made it into the largest enterprises," Mr. Colony said. "Microsoft loved to throw software over the corporate wall and checks came back from the other side, but they never crossed over the wall to get their hands dirty."
That business approach, he said, has been why the largest computer users, including companies like J. P. Morgan, have largely ignored Microsoft's corporate computing efforts until now.
But Mr. Ballmer, in an interview, said this so-called enterprise portion of Microsoft's business already represented about $4 billion of its $23 billion in annual revenue. More significant, he said, it involved between 7,500 and 8,000 of Microsoft's nearly 40,000 employees and that number is growing faster than any other part of the company's employee base -- as much as 25 percent in the next year.
As for getting Microsoft's hands dirty, Mr. Ballmer said: "I have to look at my customers and tell them that I have more skin in the game now. I have to look them in the eye and tell them, 'I'm here for you 7 by 24.' "
Although Mr. Ballmer was generally bullish on the company's new push into the very highest part of the computer business, he acknowledged today that there remained some industry sectors where Microsoft would have a tough time displacing its entrenched Unix competitors like Sun and Oracle.
"We're going to have quite an uphill battle in the next generation telecommunications sector," he said. Because there has been a strong tradition of Unix in the telecommunications network market -- one of the largest users of high-end computers -- it will be difficult for Microsoft to break in to that market, he said.
Mr. Ballmer, who took over from William H. Gates as Microsoft's chief executive earlier this year, said Mr. Gates had traveled to Sydney, Australia, to see the opening of the Olympics last week and that he was still on vacation. Mr. Gates, who remains chairman, has shifted his focus to the company's technology strategy and has taken the title of chief software architect.
While Microsoft's desire for new frontiers appears to be unabated, several longtime industry executives warned that even with its dominance of operating systems and office software, the company was bumping up against real limits.
"Ultimately there are only a small number of A-teams at Microsoft by definition," Mr. Yoffie said, "and their ability to conquer all areas of computing is going to be difficult or impossible when they are fighting against other A-teams."
Others said the company's Achilles' heel might be that it was trying to accomplish too much, too quickly.
"What I.B.M. had accomplished in 30 years Microsoft has taken on in just 6," said Andrew Heller, a former I.B.M. executive and computer designer. "They haven't executed with the same level of control and process I.B.M. developed."

Events Leading Up to Supreme Court's Microsoft Ruling
By The Associated Press
Following are key dates in the antitrust investigation of Microsoft:
 
OCTOBER 1997 -- The Justice Department sues Microsoft, saying it violated a 1994 consent decree by forcing computer makers to sell its Internet browser as a condition of selling its Windows software.
 
DECEMBER 1997 -- Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court issues a preliminary injunction forcing Microsoft to stop, at least temporarily, requiring manufacturers who sell Windows 95 "or any successor" to install Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The company appeals.
 
MAY 1998 -- The Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft, saying it illegally thwarted competition to protect and extend its software monopoly. One state later withdraws.
 
JUNE 23, 1998 -- A three-judge federal appeals panel removes the restrictions Judge Jackson imposed on Windows 95 software, saying there was adequate justification to bundle the Internet browser in Windows.
 
OCT. 19, 1998 -- The antitrust trial begins, expected to last six weeks.
 
NOV. 5, 1999 -- Judge Jackson, in preliminary findings, declares Microsoft a monopoly. He rules that the company's actions are "stifling innovation" and hurting consumers.
 
NOV. 19, 1999 -- Judge Jackson appoints Richard Posner, chief judge for the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, to oversee voluntary settlement talks.
 
APRIL 1, 2000 -- Talks between the federal government and Microsoft break down, and Judge Posner says he is ending his mediation effort.
 
APRIL 3, 2000 -- Judge Jackson finds that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, "maintained its monopoly power by anti-competitive means," and tried to monopolize the browser market. He also rules that it could be sued under state anti-competition laws.
 
APRIL 28, 2000 -- The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general ask the judge to break the company into two parts -- one to develop and market the Windows operating system and the other to develop Microsoft's other holdings.
 
JUNE 7, 2000 -- Judge Jackson orders the breakup of Microsoft into two companies, declaring the software giant had "proved untrustworthy in the past." Microsoft vows to appeal.
 
SEPT. 26, 2000 -- Supreme Court refuses government's request for the justices to consider Microsoft's appeal directly, sending the case instead to a lower court.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says 2 Russia Advisers Misused Positions for Gain

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors today filed a civil suit contending that two Harvard University advisers who helped mold Russia's economic reforms in the mid-1990's misused their government-financed positions in pursuit of personal gain for themselves and their wives.
The two advisers, Andrei Shleifer, a prize-winning economics star and tenured Harvard professor, and Jonathan Hay, a former Harvard legal expert, deny any wrongdoing. Harvard University, too, rejects the accusation that it failed in its obligation to supervise the advisers. 
 Today the univerity's general counsel called the request for damages -- up to $120 million from Harvard and the defendants -- far out of proportion to any harm possibly done.
The case, which has been under investigation for more than three years, concerns advisers who worked for the Harvard Institute for International Development, which spearheaded American efforts to help Russia make the transition from Communism to a market economy in the 1990's, and received more than $40 million in government grants to finance its efforts.
United States Attorney Donald K. Stern, who announced the suit today, said in a statement: "The United States paid Harvard for impartial and unbiased economic advice, both in fact and in appearance. Despite clear prohibitions against investing in Russia, Harvard advisers abused their positions and attempted to tip the playing field to their own private financial advantage."
The main accusations concern the advisers and their wives -- Nancy Zimmerman, Mr. Shleifer's wife, and Elizabeth Hebert, who was then Mr. Hay's girlfriend and is now his wife. Both women are financial professionals and were actively working on investments and funds in Russia.
The four are accused of making prohibited purchases that include investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian companies and the creation of a real estate company. Prosecutors also accuse the advisers of using the staff and offices financed by the United States Agency for International Development money to make private investments.
Mr. Hay's lawyer, David M. Zornow, issued a statement on Mr. Hay's behalf today, saying: "Mr. Hay's actions were lawful and proper. Indeed, at the time Harvard's program was in effect, the highest levels of the U.S. government recognized that it was enormously successful."
In fact, prosecutors are not asserting that the Harvard advice given the Russians was bad. But, Mr. Stern said today, the situation was something like an investment counselor who has promised a client unbiased advice and then pushes stock in a company in which he owns shares. The client may make money, but a contract has been broken.
Harvard's general counsel, Anne Taylor, emphasized today that the advisers did not simply have a contract from the aid agency; they were working in cooperation with it, and under its supervision as well.
In any case, "all the services the government contracted for were delivered," Ms. Taylor said. "The government's own evaluation of the project over the years rated it extremely highly."
Furthermore, Ms. Taylor said, the government's complaint against the advisers said they worked to conceal their private investing, adding: "If there's active concealment, it seems to us unreasonable to expect that we could have caught this. Nobody with administrative authority knew about this. Nobody."
Professor Shleifer appears to be taking a different tack in his defense; his lawyer, Earl H. Nemser, issued a statement today saying that Dr. Shleifer and his wife were glad the matter was finally going to court and that the accusations against them "are meritless as a matter in law."
"In the main," it said, "the complaint proceeds from the false premise that Professor Shleifer and his wife were prohibited from investing in Russia." But "as a consultant to the project, as opposed to an employee of the project, Professor Shleifer had a specific consulting contract which did not restrict his investment activities or those of his wife."
Though prosecutors are not criticizing the Harvard advice given Russia, it does seem clear that the accusations, which were first publicly raised by American officials in 1997, harmed both the image of American aid in Russia and the reformers whom the Americans were trying to help.
"When the accusations were first made, there were Russians who said, 'You see, the Americans said they would come and be a big help and be selfless, and here they were just like everybody else, dipping in the pot,' " said Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Center for Russian Studies at Harvard, who has also challenged the wisdom of the substantive advice that the Shleifer team gave. "That has caused deep harm."
Early this year, Harvard decided to disband the Harvard Institute for International Development, which had 159 employees and provided technical assistance around the world, saying it had strayed too far from the university's central missions of teaching and research. The Russian case was not a central reason, Harvard officials say, but was illustrative of problems the institute raised.
Previous talks about a settlement between Harvard and the federal government failed, but the prospect for a settlement remains.
"We are always amenable to reasonable discourse with the government," Ms. Taylor said.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW;
JUSTICES DECLINE A DIRECT APPEAL IN MICROSOFT CASE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Supreme Court handed a major tactical victory to the Microsoft Corporation today when it rejected the government's plea to hear the appeal of its landmark antitrust case immediately and instead returned the proceeding to a lower court.
The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to pursue its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return any time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a settlement, could have the effect of prolonging a final court judgment by a year or longer. 
 It returns the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in the past has shown a greater receptivity to Microsoft's defenses than has the trial judge. And it is virtually certain to have the effect of leaving the supervision of the federal case in the hands of the next administration, which Microsoft executives hope will be open to reconsidering both the merits of the lawsuit and the order to break up the company.
Microsoft executives applauded today's decision.
"I'm happy that we're moving on with the process," said Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, in an interview in San Francisco, where the company was announcing an alliance aimed at capturing the high end of the corporate computing world. "We are confident in our case on appeal." Page C1.
For their part, Justice Department officials today began preparing for a new round of court appearances. "We look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals as expeditiously as possible," said Gina Talamona, a department spokeswoman.
Before today's decision, the government had tried to short-circuit the uncertainties associated with bringing the case to the court of appeals by going directly to the Supreme Court instead.
Arguing that the case against Microsoft involved issues of "immense importance to our national economy," the Justice Department had urged the Supreme Court to invoke a rarely used procedural rule to bypass the appeals court, quickly review the case and uphold the order issued by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson three months ago to slice Microsoft into two smaller companies.
After a 78-day trial, Judge Jackson ruled in April that Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, had repeatedly violated federal antitrust law, bullied rivals and stifled competition and innovation. In June, Judge Jackson ruled that the company should be broken up but stayed that order pending appeal.
Microsoft had opposed the government's request for immediate Supreme Court review, saying it "would impose an extraordinary burden on the court" and that there was no reason to depart from the normal procedure of using the appeals court to narrow the complex legal issues and voluminous trial record.
Today the Supreme Court, in a perfunctory three-sentence order, agreed. It directed that the case be sent to the court of appeals. The appeals court had already decided that the full court -- not the usual three-member panel -- would hear the proceeding and that it would move quickly. The full court has 10 members, but 3 have recused themselves from this case for undisclosed reasons.
Within hours of the Supreme Court's announcement, the court of appeals ordered the government and Microsoft to submit scheduling proposals for its proceeding by Monday.
Following its usual practice when it denies reviews, the Supreme Court did not announce the actual vote among the nine justices. But in a published dissent from today's decision, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had voted to hear the appeal because the case "significantly affects an important sector of the economy."
"Speed in reaching a final decision may help create legal certainty," Justice Breyer wrote. "That certainty, in turn, may further the economic development of that sector so important to our nation's prosperity."
For now, though, the court's decision dramatically reshapes the contours of the case and is a big legal win for Microsoft on several levels. Foremost among them is the timing of the case.
For both Microsoft and the government, the timeline is crucial. Experts have raised concerns that fast-paced changes in both the technology and the marketplace may make the proposed remedy of splitting Microsoft both irrelevant and unnecessary.
Government officials have long feared that it was to Microsoft's advantage to stretch out the time of the case as long as possible. For its part, Microsoft has denied that it is interested in delay, maintaining that its primary goal is getting the case dismissed as quickly as possible.
As he has in the past, Mr. Ballmer today denied that the company had opposed immediate review by the Supreme Court in an effort to slow down the legal process.
"For us the best resolution will be a court decision that allows us to continue to innovate," he said.
The appeals court includes two judges who in 1998 handed a legal victory to Microsoft in a separate but related case. They ruled that Judge Jackson was wrong on the law when he ordered Microsoft to immediately unbundle its Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer Web browser. Earlier this year Judge Jackson took the unusual step of criticizing the appeals court ruling, saying that it ignored antitrust precedents laid down by the Supreme Court.
After they deliberate over the next few months, the seven judges on the appeals court have a wide range of options, including sending the case back to Judge Jackson for further proceedings consistent with their ruling, a process that can further delay a final resolution.
After the court of appeals rules, the case could go to the Supreme Court. But, since the Supreme Court is under no obligation to review the eventual decision of the appeals court, that court could have the last word, although that may not be known until some time in 2001 or later.
Finally, today's decision virtually assures that the government's case will wind up under the control of a new administration that could, if it wanted, either drop the federal lawsuit or seek to rekindle settlement negotiations on less-onerous terms than those offered by officials in the Clinton Administration. It remains to be seen how closely the next administration would work with the attorneys general in the 19 states that have brought a parallel antitrust case against Microsoft.
In an unusual statement attached to today's decision, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist defended his decision to participate in the Microsoft case even though his son, James C. Rehnquist, is a Boston lawyer representing Microsoft in private antitrust litigation that could be affected by the outcome of the government's antitrust lawsuit.
Justice Rehnquist said his son had no financial interests in the outcome of the case, and that he did not believe that his impartiality "might reasonably be questioned."
"A decision by this court as to Microsoft's antitrust liability could have a significant effect on Microsoft's exposure to antitrust suits in other courts," Justice Rehnquist said. "But, by virtue of this court's position atop the federal judiciary, the impact of many of our decisions is often quite broad. The fact that our disposition of the pending Microsoft litigation could potentially affect Microsoft's exposure to antitrust liability in other litigation does not, to my mind, significantly distinguish the present situation from other cases that this court decides."

HEADLINE: Accord Likely on Measure Allowing Drug Imports

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
A proposal to allow imports of low-priced prescription drugs won support from House Republican leaders today, making it all but certain that Congress and President Clinton could eventually agree on the legislation.
Although the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied furiously against the measure, the House Republican leaders announced that they would approve the Senate-passed version of the bill, which Mr. Clinton also supports. Their decision to make the bill a priority, just six weeks before the elections, suggests how potent the cost of prescription drugs has become as a political issue.
 
 "We are comfortable with the Senate bill," Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said today.
The White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said the bill "may well emerge from the rubble," and added, "if they want to do the Senate bill, it's fine with us."
The measure, drafted by Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, addresses the disparities that force American consumers to pay two or three times as much for some American-made drugs as do people in Canada, Mexico and some other countries. Prices for many prescription drugs are often lower in other countries because foreign governments regulate the prices.
The measure would allow pharmacies and wholesale distributors to buy prescription drugs abroad, reimport them and then sell them to consumers at a lower cost. Although the measure is designed to reduce drug prices in a roundabout way, it is not likely to do so for about two years. That is how long it is expected to take for the Food and Drug Administration to write regulations that would govern this new business. Experts say it is too early to know with any accuracy what volume of sales may flow through such a route.
The Senate bill, approved on July 19 by a vote of 74 to 21, also includes safeguards to protect consumers, something the F.D.A. said was necessary. It would require the importer to provide large amounts of data to the agency to ensure that the drugs were authentic and complied with federal standards. Tests would be conducted by the pharmacist, the wholesaler or the manufacturer.
Somewhat different proposals to relax restrictions on the import of prescription drugs were approved by the House with overwhelming support on July 10.
Vice President Al Gore supports the bill, and Gov. George W. Bush has not taken a position.
"We think there is something that should be done there," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. "We do want to make sure about the safety aspects, and that's one of the things that concerned the industry. The potential for fraud is very strong, and you want to make sure that our people are not being duped."
Mr. Lott said Congress might want to tighten up the safety provisions.
Mr. Clinton today praised the Republican leadership for agreeing "in the face of the drug companies' opposition, to give Americans access to prescription drugs that are cheaper in other countries."
At an event celebrating the economic expansion, he added, "I think it's wrong when drug companies sell the same drugs for a much higher price at home than they do overseas, even when those drugs are manufactured right here in America."
Despite today's accord, the bill's path to the president's desk remains somewhat rocky. The measure is now attached to an agriculture spending bill, which is tangled up in a dispute over legislation to weaken the United States economic embargo against Cuba. That conflict must be resolved before the bill can be voted on in the House or the Senate.
Still, at some point, Congress must pass a bill to finance the Department of Agriculture, and if all goes as expected, the measure would be tucked inside. "If it's not done, it's as close to done as anything can be," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, a co-sponsor of the legislation.
John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said the Senate language might be "tweaked" a bit, but should not pose an obstacle.
By pushing the prescription drug reimportation bill, over protests of the pharmaceutical industry, Republicans hope to inoculate themselves against Democratic charges that they have done nothing to make prescription drugs more affordable for the elderly.
Drug manufacturers have lobbied vigorously to kill the drug reimportation measure in recent weeks, running expensive television advertisements to get their message out.
Mr. Hastert and Mr. Lott sent a letter to Mr. Clinton this week indicating their desire to act on the drug reimportation bill, among other things. They said time was running out for action on broader legislation to establish prescription drug benefits for the elderly under Medicare.
While Democrats said they were pleased with today's developments, they made it clear they would not back down from the goal of securing drug coverage through Medicare.
The provisions of the Senate bill would take effect only if the secretary of health and human services certified to Congress that the measure would "pose no risk to the public's health and safety," and that it would produce "a significant reduction in the cost" of prescription drugs to American consumers.
Ronald J. Streck, president of the National Wholesale Druggists' Association, said, "The demand for imported prescription drugs could be quite high because importers will advertise low-price imported medicines in newspapers and magazines, on television and over the Internet."
The White House said the F.D.A. would need $23 million to develop a new system of regulating imported drugs. House Republicans said they were willing to provide that amount.
Under the Senate bill, importers would have to provide large amounts of data to the F.D.A. to show, for example, that a statistically valid sample of all drug shipments had been tested to ensure compliance with federal standards.
Imported drugs would have to have the same color, formulation, labeling and dosage as products approved for domestic sale. Importers would have to maintain records showing the "chain of custody" of the drugs. They would have to inform the F.D.A. of the "points of origin and destination" for imported drugs; the wholesale and retail prices, and "the manufacturer's lot or control number" for each shipment.
Under existing law, a prescription drug made in the United States and exported to another country may not be reimported, in large quantities, except by the manufacturer. The law, adopted in 1988 as a consumer protection measure, sought to choke off a "gray market" for drugs that were counterfeit, adulterated or too old to be used safely.
The National Wholesale Druggists' Association opposed the legislation. Mr. Streck, the president of the association, said "wholesalers do not have the experience, equipment or personnel" to sample, test, re-label and track imported drugs.
Wholesalers also expressed concern that they could incur costly new legal liability for the imported drugs, and they said they would have to pass on such costs to consumers.
It is not clear whether drug companies would cooperate in efforts to import low-price versions of their products. "Why would manufacturers produce additional product in Canada, or export additional product from the United States to Canada, so it could be sold at a lower price in this country?" Mr. Streck asked.
Mr. Streck said he feared that low-price counterfeit drugs would flow into the United States to meet the demand not met by manufacturers.
John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "This legislation should not be viewed as a substitute for insurance coverage. We still need Medicare drug benefits."
Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said drug companies opposed the legislation because "it would put American patients at risk by making it easier for counterfeit, adulterated or subpotent medicines to enter the country."

HEADLINE: MILOSEVIC SEEKING A RUNOFF ELECTION AFTER HIS SETBACK

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced tonight that President Slobodan Milosevic was trailing his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but rejected Mr. Kostunica's claim to an outright victory.
The commission said the opposition candidate had fallen short of the 50 percent required for a first-round win and called for a runoff to take place on Oct. 8. Opposition leaders immediately called the commission's figures fraudulent and said they would not take part in a runoff. They said that Mr. Kostunica had won almost 55 percent of the votes, and that he said he had rejected a government feeler, through intermediaries, for a second round. 
 "This is an offer that must be rejected," Mr. Kostunica said in a statement. "The victory is obvious, and we will defend it by all nonviolent means. The people have given their political no to Milosevic and his policies. Our first duty is to carry out that verdict."
The state television broke into the main evening news program with the announcement that Mr. Milosevic, with 40.23 percent, had come in second to Mr. Kostunica, with 48.22 percent, with a turnout of about 64.65 percent. Opposition members of the commission said they had not been involved in the tallying.
The opposition said that by its own figures, gathered from election monitors in each constituency who had signed the returns before they had been shipped to Belgrade for final approval by the election commission, Mr. Kostunica was beating Mr. Milosevic by 54.66 percent to 35.01 percent. The opposition said that the turnout had been 74 percent, and that its monitors had counted more than 98 percent of the votes.
Accordingly, Mr. Kostunica declared that a second round was unnecessary. "There is no single reason, not moral or political, by which we would accept such trampling on the electoral will of the people," he said. But Mr. Kostunica promised to avoid "careless moves that could raise tensions in society, that could lead to unforeseeable consequences."
In Washington, President Clinton praised the voters and offered to remove economic sanctions if democratic change prevails against any efforts by Mr. Milosevic to "cling to power." Page A10.
 The opposition has scheduled rallies in Belgrade and other cities for Wednesday night to defend what it called Mr. Kostunica's victory -- rallies that could prove confrontational, depending on how the police respond.
The risk for Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer who is a moderate nationalist, an anti-Communist and a democrat, is that if the popular will proves insufficiently forceful, the boycott of a second round could let Mr. Milosevic claim an unopposed victory and remain president.
In 1996 thousands of Belgrade citizens marched for three months to defend the opposition's victory in local elections, which Mr. Milosevic had challenged in the courts, before he relented.
Tonight Belgrade's squares were largely empty, although some people were out on their terraces banging pots and pans, and an independent radio station, Radio Indeks, said its telephone lines were clogged by angry listeners. About 9 p.m., its signal was jammed. On the street, Ljiljana Zivkovic, 50, an accountant, said simply: "They can't steal the votes anymore. We'll make them leave."
In the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Novi Sad, large rallies were reported, with 15,000 and 5,000 people respectively, to protest the commission's announcement.
In an important message, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, who met with Mr. Kostunica today, urged Mr. Milosevic "to accept the electoral will of the people and contribute to the welfare of the nation and the state."
The patriarch "called on everyone, including the army and police, to defend the interests of people and the state rather than individuals," a church statement said.
The official announcement on state television that Mr. Milosevic was trailing was already an extraordinary admission that the government's campaign had gone badly wrong. It followed what government officials have described as a furious debate about how to handle Mr. Milosevic's first electoral defeat ever.
Proposals that Mr. Milosevic declare outright victory in the first round appear to have been rejected as too confrontational and risky.
A second round, especially with Mr. Milosevic trailing, at least keeps his options open and can be taken by some Serbs as democratic and non-confrontational. It will be harder for Mr. Kostunica to complain that his victory has been stolen, given what would appear to be near certainty that he would win a second round.
Most important, the tactic buys time for the government to consider its next step, and perhaps to bargain for a secure exit, especially with Western countries that have been sending word to Mr. Milosevic that his position is untenable and he must consider how to save himself from a system that could crumble rapidly.
But the effort to throw the election into a second round was interpreted by the opposition as a clumsy effort by Mr. Milosevic to escape his fate.
"A second round gives Milosevic 10 more days to find a pretext to call off the election, falsify it or postpone it," said one opposition leader. "It's a trap for us."
Before the election on Sunday, even Mr. Kostunica said he thought a second round would be necessary and hoped that Mr. Milosevic would not cancel the election altogether. But the breadth of the anti-government swing on Sunday took the opposition by surprise.
"This is a big fraud," said Zoran Djindjic, leader of the coalition that backs Mr. Kostunica, speaking of the call for a second round. "In last two days, we knew that they were preparing something to get Milosevic into the second round. But we have proof of our figures, and we will defend the people's vote to the end."
At the same time, Mr. Djindjic urged patience. He said the opposition would demand to see the commission's figures, and compare them with the opposition's.
"We have 98 percent of the facts in our hands," he said. "We know they are trying to manipulate the results from Kosovo." He alleged that the commission had taken 400,000 votes from Mr. Kostunica and had given 200,000 to Mr. Milosevic.
The commission has 28 members, 2 from the governing coalition and 2 from the opposition coalition, but with a majority appointed by the government. Mr. Milosevic was in the shadows today, but the commission is considered to be acting on his behalf.
Opposition representatives say they have been locked out of any counting. Tonight, one of Mr. Kostunica's representatives on the commission, Djordje Mamula, said at least 4 percent of Mr. Kostunica's votes had been stolen from him. "I don't know how their gummy mathematics work," he said.
Belgraders love to reminisce about the happy days of the winter of 1996, when thousands of protesters marched every day for three months after Mr. Milosevic challenged the opposition's victories in local elections. He finally backed down.
This year, the government has already conceded a huge defeat in local elections -- the opposition will govern nearly 100 towns and cities in Serbia -- but now Mr. Milosevic's own future is at stake.
While Belgrade was quiet tonight, with no rally scheduled, people were angry. Snjezana, 32, a shop attendant, said: "I'm not afraid. They can say whatever they want. But they are defeated -- history. If we have to defend our victory on the street, we'll do that. We've had enough."
A lawyer of 35, Branomir Misic, said: "We were out on the street so many times. And this time we will be there again. There is no way out for them."
Zarko Korac, an opposition political leader, said tonight that victory could not be taken from the nearly three million people who had voted for Mr. Kostunica. "Milosevic is fighting for his political survival," he said. "But democracy is about accepting the will of the people. This was a political verdict, a referendum on Milosevic, and he lost it."
In the presidential election, Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica had three other competitors -- Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, who got 5.1 percent of the vote according to the election commission; Vojislav Mihailovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who got 2.59 percent; and Miodrag Vidojkovic of the Affirmative Party, who got 0.8 percent.
People also voted for both houses of the federal Parliament. Despite the opposition's strong showing in Serbia, Mr. Milosevic will control both houses and can form a federal government with no other partners.
He will do so because his allied party won the seats reserved for Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, after the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, urged his citizens to boycott the elections, saying they were unconstitutional.
In Montenegro itself, fears of a Milosevic move on Mr. Djukanovic were receding. Special police troops remained on alert and were guarding state buildings dressed in full combat gear and helmets, but Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzan said in an interview that he believed that government fears that Mr. Milosevic might order the Yugoslav Army to take over government institutions or impose a state of emergency in the republic were receding.
"If he survives he will be very dangerous," Mr. Burzan said of Mr. Milosevic. "But now he cannot influence the generals as he could even yesterday."

THE DEBATES
 
NO SURPRISE INVITATIONS -- The Commission on Presidential Debates has formally invited Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to participate in the first of three planned debates, on Tuesday at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. 
 The bipartisan commission said yesterday that of the seven major party and minor party candidates whose names were on ballots in enough states to "have a theoretical chance of winning a majority of the votes in the Electoral College," only Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush met all of the panel's requirements. The central requirement is that a candidate must have the support of an average of 15 percent in five national polls by news organizations.
Two of the excluded candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, have repeatedly criticized the 15-percent threshold as virtually unobtainable for a third-party contender.
The commission also invited the major party candidates for vice president, Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, to a debate on Oct. 5. Peter Marks (NYT)
 
BOOK AGENT TAKES PARTISAN ROLE -- Dick Cheney got a bit of a surprise when he found out whom Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has tapped as his surrogate Dick Cheney for practice debates. It's Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer and book agent who represents Lynne Cheney, Mr. Cheney's wife. "He's Lynne's book agent!" Mr. Cheney said when he got the news. To which Mrs. Cheney joked, "My former book agent. Until this minute he was my book agent."
Mrs. Cheney, who has written several books, has the Secret Service code name Author. Mr. Lieberman has also written several books. His agent: Robert Barnett. How does Mr. Cheney think Mr. Barnett will do portraying him? "I'm sure he does fine," Mr. Cheney said. "He's a smart guy."

THE SENATE
 
PLEA ON SOFT MONEY -- The Senate's leading supporters of campaign finance legislation appealed to Al Gore and George W. Bush yesterday to follow the lead set in New York's Senate race and ban soft money advertisements in the presidential contest.
"In the same spirit that motivated the Lazio-Clinton agreement, we respectfully encourage you to attempt to make a similar agreement in your race," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a letter sent to the White House hopefuls. Similar letters were also sent to all candidates for the House and Senate. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore did not immediately respond. (AP)

HEADLINE: Military in Struggle for Resources but Ready to Fight, Officials Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The nation's senior commanders will warn Congress on Wednesday that the armed services are struggling with aging equipment, shortages in spare parts and shortfalls in training that will require billions of dollars in new spending, officials said today.
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, will argue that the nation's front-line combat forces remain ready to fight. 
 But they will also warn that the readiness of some support units has fallen, despite two years of budget increases approved by President Clinton and Congress, officials familiar with the planned testimony said today.
Beyond the state of today's military, the chiefs will also focus on tomorrow's forces. They plan to argue that the Pentagon's procurement budget -- the money for new weapons and equipment -- has not risen quickly enough to begin replacing aging weapons and equipment built during the 1980's.
The chiefs' testimony comes as a highly charged political debate rages about the American military, and the officials said the warnings would offer ammunition to both sides.
Their argument that readiness remains high among combat forces undercuts accusations from some Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that American military might is fraying.
At the same time, their warnings about other readiness problems and aging weapons echo many made recently by Mr. Bush and by other military officials.
The officials said that the chiefs would use Wednesday's hearings to start making the case for increases in spending and the size of the force, now at 1.4 million troops, though they might not propose specific figures.
While the Clinton administration has raised the procurement budget to $60 billion, from $43 billion three years ago, the chiefs believe they need $70 billion or more as new weapons arrive in the years ahead, a senior military official said. Others have suggested the figure should rise to nearly $100 billion.
"We've got an aging force structure -- in terms of airplanes, ships, tanks, et cetera -- where obsolescence will start to come into play," an official familiar with the chiefs' planned testimony said today.
"If we don't accelerate the pace of replacing ships and airplanes," the official added, "we are not going to maintain the steady-state requirements to keep the age of the force at the current level -- not to mention modernizing it."
Debates over the Pentagon's budget have always been political, but the hearings before the armed service committees of the House and the Senate on Wednesday are expected to cast this year's debate in an increasingly partisan hue.
Congress has already adopted a $295 billion military budget for the fiscal year that begins on Sunday, and President Clinton has signed it.
That has prompted administration officials to complain that scheduling the hearings before Election Day was simply a partisan effort to force the chiefs into voicing readiness concerns raised by Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney.
Senator Carl M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Senate's armed services committee, said he had urged that the hearing be postponed until after the election, only to be overruled by the committee's Republican chairman, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia.
"I don't think we should put the chiefs in a position where they're caught in a political crossfire," Mr. Levin said. "I don't know how it's avoided in this setting, given the timing."
Still, the chiefs appear intent on using the hearings as a platform to begin making a case for increased spending by the new administration, regardless of who wins in November.
Both major-party candidates have proposed increasing military spending. Mr. Bush has called for $45 billion more over the next decade; Vice President Al Gore has gone even further, proposing the spending of another $80 billion over the same period.
While the officials said the chiefs had not yet completed specific budget requests, it was clear that the shortfalls they planned to cite would cost more to fill than the $4.5 billion and $8 billion annually that the two candidates have proposed.
"The chiefs' appetite will be larger than anybody can satisfy," a senior military official said today. "We are going higher, but they want to go higher still."
The current debate over the military's readiness -- and its budget -- began two years ago, when the chiefs at the time appeared at similar hearings and warned that the reductions in forces and spending after the cold war had left them strapped.
At the time, President Clinton proposed increasing Pentagon spending by $112 billion over six years. With added financing from Congress and emergency supplements to cover peacekeeping operations like those in Kosovo, the Pentagon's budget is now projected to grow by nearly $160 billion, rising from $295 billion in the newly adopted budget to $332 billion by 2005.
With the spending debate intensifying, the administration recently added another $19.5 billion to future Pentagon budgets.
The officials said the chiefs would emphasize steady improvements in readiness, citing gains in morale, among other things, following increases in pay and benefits. One official said that the real impact would be felt in the year ahead as spare parts and other equipment the budget increases paid for began reaching bases around the country.
The chiefs, though, are expected to argue that current readiness continues to face strains because of the high pace of operations overseas, which forces the services to give a lower priority to forces that are not deployed.
One official said that a fighter wing based in Italy, for example, can maintain peak performance, but it comes at the cost for readiness by similar units in the United States, which must make do with scarce parts and less money for training.
In recent weeks, senior military officers have warned of readiness problems. In testimony before a subcommittee last week, the Army said it needed $4.6 billion to buy new weapons, from Abrams tanks to Apache helicopters. The Navy's inspector general warned in a report released last week that the readiness of the service's aircraft had declined because of shortages in spare parts and training.
As he stepped down as commander of forces in the Persian Gulf in August, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni warned of growing strains on American troops. In an interview he, too, warned that the military was stretching the life of aging equipment -- a point the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James L. Jones, is expected to make on Wednesday.
"I climbed in a CH-46 helicopter when I was a lieutenant in Vietnam," General Zinni said. "My son is a lieutenant and he climbs into the same helicopter."
With increasing warnings about readiness from the senior ranks, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen met with the chiefs early this month and cautioned them not to use politically charged debate as a means to argue for raising their budgets.
The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said that Mr. Cohen told them "not to beat the drum with a tin cup in hand to try to generate more pressure for defense spending but, on the other hand, to talk honestly about pressures they face."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RUNNING MATE;
Lieberman Faults Records Of Opponents

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
In his toughest attack yet in this campaign, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman yesterday portrayed the platform of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as a wide-ranging deception, saying their promises contradicted their records.
"Over the last several weeks, there has been a troubling pattern emerging in this election," Mr. Lieberman said in an address to a bricklayers' union convention in Atlantic City. "On issue after issue, our opponents tell us one thing, but their records and the details of their plans tell us something very different." 
 His remarks signaled an intensified offensive against Mr. Bush, and echoed the Republicans' main line of attack, the charge of inconsistency and hypocrisy. The Democrats are bent on painting Mr. Bush as a staunch conservative who poses as a moderate with empty promises on education and health care.
Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, challenged Mr. Bush's recent claims that public education has stagnated under the Clinton administration, calling the claims unfair to schools that are improving. And while he gave a long list of education projects that Vice President Al Gore would invest in, he said the Republicans would have no money to spend on schools after their tax cuts.
"I'll tell you what the real education gap is in America this year," the senator said. "It's the gap in the Bush-Cheney campaign between what they're talking about and what their plan will actually do. When it comes to education, I promise you Al Gore and I have not only the will to improve education in our country, but the wallet -- or the money left in the wallet -- to make it happen."
Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: "Senator Lieberman would be better served explaining why America's in the midst of an education recession in the Clinton-Gore years. We've seen test scores stagnate, and the achievement gap between minority students and their peers remains wide."
For the first time, Mr. Lieberman directly criticized the record of Mr. Cheney, asserting that his record directly contradicted the Republicans' recent claims that they would "leave no child behind."
"When he was in Congress in the 1980's, he voted against Head Start funding five times, against measures important to the school lunch program six times," Mr. Lieberman said of Mr. Cheney. "He was one of only 33 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a plan to provide a lump-sum benefit to widows and children of federal law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty."
He also noted that under Mr. Bush, Texas ranks near the bottom among all states in the percentage of its children with health insurance.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
In Nassau, Hard to Leave A Gilded Past

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y.

 BODY:
THE good news is that Nassau County's long-running financial nightmare is reaching a climax. Within weeks, the bumbling band of county officials will take their weed whackers to their beloved bureaucracy, and then they will likely raise taxes (by $100 a household, at most). If not, state officials will take over and do it. And just like that, the greatest municipal finance crisis in one of the state's richest counties will be on the mend.
Solving the problem requires Nassau's leaders to wrench themselves from their dysfunctional past of big paternal government, a gold-plated police department and extreme tax aversion -- a maneuver that is becoming painful to watch. 
 County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the undisputed master of the grainy "grip and grin" weekly newspaper photo, has tried to portray his efforts as a Marshall Plan for Nassau. But he's come off more like the discount clothier than the general.
Every constituent is a consumer to Mr. Gulotta. He's fiercely proud of resisting raising county taxes for nine years. But his back is to the wall. He wants to lay off 350 employees, mostly lower-level people who clear the snow and run health and recreation programs and make the suburbs the suburbs. His big concession is a proposed $33-per-household property tax increase, pocket change in a county where the average house sells for $254,500.
Nor is Mr. Gulotta forgetting a favorite constituency, the county police. He hammered out a proposed contract with the police, whose $90,000-a-year veterans are among the highest paid in the nation. The police agreed to forfeit the Flag Day holiday and other pricey baubles that Mr. Gulotta said would save tens of millions of dollars. In exchange, Mr. Gulotta agreed to increase their pay 22 percent over five years.
As a reality check, Police Commissioner William Willett was asked Monday what he thought of a big raise during a financial crisis. No reality found. "I really haven't given it that much thought," he said, blithely.
Political thought in Nassau County has historically hewed to the Republican Party gospel of low taxes, ample patronage, stellar services and a barrier against the evils of New York City.
The enforcement mechanism behind the gospel was laid out in 1996 testimony by a Nassau County detective, Melvin Boone, in a voting rights case in the Town of Hempstead. "There was never a written or spoken directive," Mr. Boone said, speaking about patrolling the Queens-Nassau line. "However, you would come to know if there were people coming over the border, good people of Nassau County didn't want that, so you were to make sure they had business and that they would do their business and then go back where they belong."
Mr. Boone's party affiliation?
"I was applying for a job as a police officer in Nassau County," he said, "and I was instructed that I ought to register Republican if I was going to get that job."
POLITICAL reality has changed, though. Now, Republican leaders are desperate for any victory at the polls and eager to hoist all blame for the county's problems on their former ally, Mr. Gulotta. Population shifts have altered Nassau's racial and political complexion. And Nassau's stacking-doll system of towns and villages and school boards and fire districts and sewer districts -- most with independent taxing authority -- has produced steady increases in local taxes, even as the county held its own taxes down.
But the setting for the budget debate, like the debate itself, seems stuck in time. The county legislative chamber resembles a 1960's suburban den with wood paneling, linoleum flooring and fluorescent fixtures.
For months, Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican legislative leader, has been saying the same thing. "We provide the Cadillac of services," he said Monday. "You have to streamline." Where? Child care. Services for the mentally ill. How about tax increases? "I have neighbors who live on 60-by-100 lots and are paying $6,000 to $8,000 in taxes," he said. "They say that's enough."
This is the suburbs, and Judith A. Jacobs, leader of the Legislature's year-old Democratic majority, has neighbors, too. Hers are incredulous when she tells them that a $100-per-household annual tax increase could solve much of the county's fiscal problems without deep layoffs that would hurt services people like. "When people find out the amount of money we're talking about they think we're crazy," she said. "$78! $100!"
Besides, easing the crisis would free Mrs. Jacobs from what has become a full-time legislative job, allowing her to resume work at her husband's real estate firm.
"He'd pay $200 to have me back."
$250, anyone?

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Bush Is Pointing to the Cloud in the Silver Lining

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 26

 BODY:
For decades, political scientists have considered the economy the single best predictor of the electorate's mood. Good times favor incumbents, bad times insurgents. And so for Gov. George W. Bush, one challenge has loomed high above the others in his quest for the White House: how to defeat a sitting vice president during these roaring good times.
For a while, it seemed as if Mr. Bush might defy history, as he stayed ahead of Vice President Al Gore in polls even as the economy hummed along. But his lead in those polls has vanished. And the issue that once seemed to play so well for him, character, has diminished in importance, the polls show. 
 It is largely for that reason, many political analysts say, that the Texas governor has adopted a new slogan this week: "education recession." Ostensibly, it refers to what he calls a "crisis" in the nation's public schools. But at its heart, the slogan is also meant to raise alarms about the health of the nation's economy in the not-too-distant future.
And in raising those red flags, the analysts say, Mr. Bush has turned his signature issue, education, into a weapon for slashing at the central arguments for electing Mr. Gore: peace and prosperity.
"Gore's advantage on the economy is critical for Bush to try to overcome," said Evans Witt, president of the Princeton Survey Research, a polling firm. "If you say we're in a recession long enough, it certainly has an economic connotation, even if you are using it to discuss education."
Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, acknowledged as much, saying, "The point of this is that while the economy is strong, there are problems in society."
During a tour of the West Coast this week, Mr. Bush said he saw warning signs in America. Then he ticked them off: Gasoline prices spiraling out of control. Farmers struggling to survive. The nation in danger of losing its technological edge. And illiterate youths on the cusp of criminality.
"In some places, there is a recession in America," Mr. Bush said today at a high school in Northern California. "In some school districts there is a recession, and this country needs to do something about it early, before it's too late."
He went on to say, "If American students don't lead the world in math and science, the next generation of Americans may not lead the world."
Raising concerns about the economy represents something of a tactical shift for Mr. Bush, who has spent much of the campaign attacking Mr. Gore's character and credibility. But several recent polls indicate that voters now see little difference between the candidates in terms of their morality and honesty.
"It's much harder for Bush because he can't hammer at character anymore," said Mr. Witt.
But some analysts said Mr. Bush would have trouble tapping into voters' anxieties about the economy, because there is so little there to tap. According to a Fox News poll taken last week, 60 percent of voters said they thought the country was headed in the right direction, one of the highest readings since January 1998.
And a Gallup Poll conducted in June showed that only 22 percent of Americans said that the most important issues in the race were economic, as compared with 69 percent who felt that way in the fall of 1992.
"I don't think it makes much sense," said James Campbell, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo who has studied the effects of the economy on presidential elections. "There are no obvious clouds on the horizon."
Still, Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said he could see the logic to Mr. Bush's strategy because voters care deeply about economic issues even in good times.
"It's not top of mind this year," Mr. Newport said. "But when we mention the economy, people say: 'Oh yes, that will be very important. How the candidates handle the economy is important."
Some analysts also said that raising concerns about the economy could strike a chord with working-class voters, typically families who earn less than $40,000 a year and live from pay check to pay check. Polls show those people tend to be swing voters whose allegiances could easily change if they felt the economy were turning sour.
Aides to Mr. Bush said their internal polls had shown that the slogan "education recession" had played well among independent voters and women.
Mr. Witt noted that many such swing voters live in the industrial Midwest, where the presidential race is most closely contested, including Missouri, Michigan and Ohio, as well as in Pennsylvania. And they are a group that might find Mr. Bush's plan for across-the-board income tax cuts appealing, he asserted.
"Bush has hit pretty heavily on the idea that Gore's tax cut may leave people out," Mr. Witt said. "That's a point that I think might resonate with some people in this group." Because they are on the edge."
Several analysts also said they thought it was clever of Mr. Bush to tie two major issues together in a way that could undermine Mr. Gore's support. "It has a subliminal quality to it," said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington.

"I'm going to win California. I am. . . . I was up in Silicon Valley. I've got a huge base of support in Silicon Valley for a lot of reasons. One, I support H-1B visas, free trade, tort reform. I've got a good chance amongst the Hispanic voters here in California.
My reputation as an inclusive governor preceded me here in this campaign. People, you know, the Republicans have been associated, rightly or wrongly, with being anti-immigrant in the state of California. We've turned that around. I've got a great record when it comes to public schools and education is a very important issue in the state of California.
My job is going to be to find those Republicans that were strong Republicans up until 1992 that Perot peeled off from us and get them back in the party. And I think I can do so by being a positive, optimistic, forward-looking candidate."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Proposes Ban On Ads for Young Children

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: CEDARHURST, N.Y., Sept. 26

 BODY:
Declaring that advertisers were directing a "barrage of materialistic marketing" at young children, Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the federal government to ban commercials aimed at preschool children, and to prohibit advertising inside public elementary schools.
Mrs. Clinton, in the second of two days of campaigning directed at Jewish audiences, said the Federal Trade Commission should be authorized to ban advertising that it determines is intended for young children susceptible to manipulation. She also called for legislation that would prohibit the marketing of materials to children in elementary schools, as on book covers with advertisements. 
 "Too many companies simply see our children as little cash cows that they can exploit," Mrs. Clinton said as she introduced what her advisers described as a new theme in her campaign, a topic that she raised with increasing vigor throughout a day of campaigning on Long Island and in Manhattan and the Bronx.
"We know that advertisers target the youngest of our children," she said. "Imagine. They are advertising to children who have not yet even reached kindergarten. They are trying to get these children to be influenced in what they want to buy and own."
The first lady offered scant details of how such a regulation might be accomplished, including, for example, how the government would distinguish between an advertisement intended to influence adults and an ad intended to manipulate children. Mrs. Clinton's aides said that under her proposal, that determination would be left to the Federal Trade Commission.
The commission made a similar a proposal in 1978. Congress responded two years later by stripping its authority to issue such regulations, and Mrs. Clinton essentially called today for that authority to be restored.
Mrs. Clinton introduced her idea while her campaign was making a concerted effort to turn attention from her dispute with her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, over the use of so-called soft money -- largely unregulated contributions -- in their campaigns.
Mrs. Clinton was to fly off Wednesday on a three-day trip to Oklahoma, Las Vegas and Los Angeles to raise soft money for the national Democratic Party, but not, she said, specifically for her campaign, given her agreement with Mr. Lazio to ban such money from their campaigns. Her campaign declined to release details of her itinerary which would have allowed reporters to follow her, saying that such events were considered private.
The proposal on ads is reminiscent of the kind of proposals that formed the bedrock of President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, in that it strikes what many politicians believe is a particularly receptive chord among voters on an issue that Mrs. Clinton's opponent is unlikely to dispute her on. One of Mrs. Clinton's chief advisers is Mark Penn, who was a pollster for President Clinton in 1996, and was described by aides as one of the driving forces behind her decision to embrace this idea.
Mr. Lazio responded to Mrs. Clinton's proposal not by attacking it, but rather by offering a list of contributions she had received from corporations that, he said, were guilty of the kind of offenses she criticized today. Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that she did not have the grounding to make such a proposal.
"Everybody likes kids," Mr. McLagan said. "Her program sounds nice, but it's difficult to take her seriously because she's a wholly owned subsidiary of Hollywood and the entertainment industry."
Mrs. Clinton proposed her idea as both candidates made a concerted effort to nail down support from Jewish voters. A day after she received the endorsement of Elie Wiesel, winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize and chronicler of the Holocaust, she campaigned in the Bronx with Hadassah Lieberman, the wife of Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
Mr. Lazio met today with Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat. Mr. Hikind said that, as with Mrs. Clinton, he discussed the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, the American convicted of passing secrets to Israel. Mr. Hikind and others have pressed President Clinton to grant Mr. Pollard clemency.
Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have signaled that they may support clemency, but both have said they need to review what is now classified information before offering an informed position.
Through it all, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio clashed on their economic plans. Mr. Lazio asserted that Mrs. Clinton's spending proposal, which includes tax deductions for college tuition and the expansion of Medicare to include prescriptions for elderly Americans, would wipe out the nation's projected $4.4 trillion surplus over the next decade.
"The entire surplus would be spent," Mr. Lazio said at a luncheon of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. "There is no question that my opponent would have to raise taxes to pay for all these new federal spending programs."
Mrs. Clinton responded by attacking Mr. Lazio's record of votes on the economy and his own call for a large tax cut. "This is part of his continuing campaign of diversion because he doesn't want people to look at his own tax plans, which total over a trillion dollars," she said. "I've called it Bush Lite, and it truly is a fiscally risky approach that is not good for our country."
The first lady, whose attacks on Mr. Lazio increased in volume as she campaigned, noted that Mr. Lazio opposed President Clinton's economic plan in 1993, which she and other Democrats have credited for the nation's economic revival, and that he had supported the economic proposals of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.
"You can be from New York and not be for New York, and if you look at his record, that's what you see," Mrs. Clinton said. "And he'd do it again if he were given a chance."

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH/MEL AND PATRICIA ZIEGLER;
About to Hatch Their Third Republic

BYLINE: By PETER HELLMAN

DATELINE: CORTE MADERA, Calif.

 BODY:
ZEN is an upfront influence at the office of ZoZa, a new fashion company set for its Web debut in mid-October. Shoes are to be removed at the entrance and placed in cabinets. A hefty Chinese gong stands ready to call meetings, and there's a large empty swath of carpet for the staff's morning yoga classes.
ZoZa's high-tech stretchy clothes feature a symbol from the I Ching that means both "contemplation" and "mountain." Floating across the screen at www.zoza.com will be a mini-swirl of snowflakes; click on it for a kernel of Zen wisdom, like, "Be present, not tense." 
 Mel Ziegler calls these aphorisms "mind crackers." He and his wife, Patricia, as ZoZa's co-founders, have even signed on a genuine Zen master as consultant: Norman Fischer, retired abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, the largest of its kind in America. "I have absolutely nothing to offer ZoZa," Mr. Fischer said, "which is what the Zieglers really love!"
Zen minimalism is a far cry from the amusing, flashy icons of Banana Republic, the Zieglers' first business, with its full-size, in-store giraffes and jungle jeeps poking through the display windows. The couple began a retailing revolution 22 years ago a few miles away in Mill Valley, with safari-style clothing stylishly tweaked by Mrs. Ziegler, a former San Francisco Chronicle illustrator, and promoted by a nifty catalog written by her husband, an ex-Chronicle reporter. Hearing their name for the business, a friend advised: "Bad choice. You'll be picketed by people from small hot countries."
No protesters picketed that first outpost in 1978, or at any of the thundering herd of stores to come, jet-assisted by the wildly popular movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark." When the Zieglers abruptly resigned in 1988, selling their interest in Banana Republic, by then a unit of Gap Inc., it had 110 stores and was ringing up annual sales of a quarter billion dollars. But customers tired of the Indiana Jones look. Relations between the Zieglers and the Gap's founder, Don Fisher, soured when the couple insisted on publishing a travel magazine and began selling travel books in their shops. (Mr. Fisher reportedly said that if he'd wanted to sell books, he'd have bought Rand McNally.)
"The real problem," Mr. Ziegler said, "was that Patricia and I were fundamentally unemployable."
Now in their 50's, the Zieglers are hitched to a speedy urban rhythm with an accent on easy movement required by his dirt biking and her daily yoga routine, which includes bends that even a tree boa might envy. They're not averse to a touch of functional elegance and even sophistication. The endless safari days are past.
The Zieglers came away from the Gap divorce feeling tattered by their far-from-smooth ride to moguldom. They retreated to the foothills of Mount Tamalpais above Mill Valley, to a shingled house, circa 1929, they have renovated -- doubling its interior space and adding an aerie that is now a workout room. The project cost $2 million; today the house is worth an estimated $5 million.
"We'd first driven up to the place at night," Mrs. Ziegler recalled. "It reminded us of the Ahwannee Lodge in Yosemite National Park, where we loved to stay. But the main thing is the way the house was cradled by the mountain. We were pretty intimate with the hiking trails up there. You could reach them directly out the back door of this house without stepping on the street."
Those trails were the Zieglers' first priority. A distant second was the unobstructed view of San Francisco, 10 miles off. Often fogged in by morning, the city scintillates like a distant jewel box by night from the south-facing windows.
Those ample windows, with their original steel frames, had also caught Mrs. Ziegler's offbeat eye. "They reminded me of windows in artists' lofts in old industrial buildings," she explained. (In the renovation, she looked far and wide to locate a firm that still fabricated steel windows.) She oversaw much of the redesign, from the minimalist redwood baseboards (she thought stock ones were "too fancy") to the new cedar shingles on the facade. The Zieglers elected to use a labor-intensive, technique, a throwback to the Arts and Crafts movement: hand-dipping each shingle in an oil-based stain and then letting it air dry. The result, worthy of Greene & Greene, is shingles that will shrink evenly as they age.
The couple have filled the house with Mrs. Ziegler's paintings and with folk art -- snakes and other reptiles preferred. Once, while climbing in the Peruvian Andes, Mrs. Ziegler was suddenly enveloped by a giant shadow. Looking up, she saw a gliding adult condor, its wingspan easily twice her own length. Back home, she sketched a condor's head and had it carved into the living room's redwood beams. Wild creatures also abound in Mrs. Ziegler's paintings. A tiny watercolor on a stairway wall shows elephants dimly seen in a nocturnal march, their tusks reflecting moonlight.
In the aftermath of Banana Republic, the Zieglers assumed they'd be full-time homebodies and parents to Zio, now 12, and Aza, 8. Even when Revlon came calling, asking the couple to start a new line of natural cosmetics, they stayed put. When Aza' s third grade teacher asked the class to describe what their parents did, she reported that her mother painted and "my daddy rides his dirt bike in the mountains."
They studied Zen in the quiet time after Banana Republic, and traded in their espresso machine for a teapot. "We were attempting to live our lives by sips instead of slurps," Mr. Ziegler said. Fine tea was harder to find locally than fine coffee. So, with a young business partner, the Zieglers created a new company in 1991, naming it the Republic of Tea. The labels for the company's metal tea canisters, handsome and practical, were painted by Mrs. Ziegler while she was confined to bed during her second pregnancy. They still incorporate the squat, black family teapot.
Mr. Ziegler named the teas and wrote the canister copy as beguilingly as he had written Banana Republic's catalog. (In 1999, the trade magazine Catalog World named Banana Republic's catalog the best ever.)
In 1994, the company was sold to a Midwestern beverage bottler. The Zieglers, who'd gotten this company up and running without ever leaving home, celebrated the sale by buying the house next door and converting it into a painting studio, play area and meditation center.
The couple had no intention of starting a third business. But then, last summer, they got a phone call from Edward Strobin, their old chief operating officer at Banana Republic -- and a loyalist in their struggle with the Gap. "Everyone else is making a bundle with Internet start-ups," Mr. Strobin said. "Why should we be left out?"
Last February, infused with $12 million by Softbank, the Japanese venture capital giant, in return for a 20-percent stake in the company, ZoZa was born. The Zieglers, who are majority shareholders, say they "seeded" the company, but refuse to disclose their investment. The couple insist they would never have committed to a new business without Mr. Strobin to handle daily operations. But they lost him in July to a swiftly attacking cancer. "It was too late to put on the brakes," Mr. Ziegler said. "We had 40 people working for us."
ZoZa is a word that, like the names of the couple's children, is a pure Zieglerism. Like Banana Republic, the company is spun out of the couple's lifestyle of the moment.
The clothing -- 56 pieces in all -- is entirely made from the newest hi-tech performance fabrics from Japan and Italy. Everyone knows the mantra -- these are the fabrics that wick away sweat, breathe, stretch with the body -- and the Zieglers are hardly unique in upthinking them. But they found most true tech clothing too big, too shapeless or too tight for spiffy segues from office to see-and-be-seen bistro.
ZoZa's declared mission is to bring maximum refinement of cut, style and finish to a washable ready-to-wear line: "Patagonia crossed with Prada," is how one hopeful ZoZa marketing executive puts it. Well, not quite. But there is a floor-length evening gown with an oval cutout in back and a mermaid-like sweep back from the feet. Seams wander with the wearer's curves, which are cradled in built-in underwear. Made from Lycra swimsuit fabric, it comes bundled in a small mesh sack. Stuff it into the glove compartment in the morning on the way to work and pull it out, unwrinkled, to slip on just before party time. If you get tossed in the pool, just start swimming. The gown can even be washed in its sack.
ZoZa seams attempt to go where the body goes -- especially in enticing places like the small of the back. "Patricia puts seams where they have never gone before, but where they always should have been," said Gale Parker, ZoZa's design director, formerly head designer for Ralph Lauren.
The original plan to sell ZoZa only as Web wear has been scrapped. The first ZoZa "walk-in Web site"is planned for later this year in Mill Valley. Customers will be able to try on the clothes, then order from in-store computers. An old-fashioned paper catalog, sized like a CD case, is also pending, and there has been interest from two retail giants to form a strategic alliance.
Daniele Clutier, director of fashion research at the Institut Francais de la Mode, in Paris, viewed the ZoZa Web site. "Like Banana Republic, ZoZa seems to promise fashion with a soul and a strong personality," Ms. Clutier said. "Postmodernist theory tells us that we humans need meaningfulness, which we try to derive partly from consumer objects, especially clothes. So it seems good for ZoZa to have something to say beyond 'We're nice and fashionable.' "
This is a tense time for the Zieglers, with Patricia getting out the clothes and Mel working on the next round of financing. The pair preserve their calm with a 30-minute commute to their new "Zen house," situated on a bluff over the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach. "You won't see the house," Mr. Ziegler warned. "It's behind a redwood fence with a hidden gate."
After the elaborate, art-filled Mill Valley manse, the Zen house, marked by a single Japanese lantern, comes as a bit of a shock. It's a small place, sparsely furnished, with a garage that has been converted to an art studio. But all artwork has been banished. Mrs. Ziegler motioned to the big windows with their sweeping vistas of the ocean and muscular hills where evergreen trees alternate with straw-colored meadows. "Those are our paintings," Mrs. Ziegler said.
The Zieglers insist that, if not for its relative isolation, they'd prefer to live now full time in the "squalor" of the Zen house rather than in the grander Mill Valley home. "The difference in the two homes is like the difference between Banana Republic and ZoZa," Mrs. Ziegler explained. "The Mill Valley is about romance. It's hard to maintain. The Zen house is simple and really functional, like ZoZa clothes."
On a bright late summer day, the Zieglers prepared to head to San Francisco. Zio, Aza and a friend had already piled into the rear of the family station wagon. Mr. Ziegler said, "It's fun to be working for ourselves again after years of working for them."
Mrs. Ziegler pointed to a large black duffel bag stuffed with samples of ZoZa wear. "Sometimes, something just coagulates in midair," she said, "and people say: 'That's it! That's the spirit of the age!' "
The cybercurtain is about to go up on ZoZa. Clicking rather than clapping will determine whether, once again, the Zieglers can transmute the spirit of this high-tech age into clothes.

HEADLINE: To Bear Arms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The academic wrangling over the founders' intentions with respect to individual gun ownership overlooks an important parallel (Week in Review, Sept. 24). Similar scrutiny of their intentions with respect to slavery confirms a tacit endorsement of the right to own chattel. Yet legislators expunged that right when its moral repugnance (and decreasing economic utility) caused widespread public concern. 
 By approaching the founders' intentions in a fundamentalist way, scholars ahistorically play down the evolving values that the United States Constitution has proved so capable of accommodating. They should be exploring channels to modify what may in fact be a constitutional right to bear arms.
In an era when children have legitimate worries about getting shot at school, we would do better to assume that the founders did indeed stipulate the right to gun ownership and then figure out a way to reverse it.

HEADLINE: TRADE SECRETS;
4-Star Kitchens Delivered on a Takeout Budget

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
IN New York City, remodeling an entire kitchen for less than $20,000 -- with new appliances in better locations, new countertops, cabinets, floor and labor -- is the equivalent of finding a two-bedroom apartment for $1,000 a month. It's possible, but not very likely.
To Michael McDonough, a New York architect, the $20,000 remodeled kitchen is an urban fairy tale. "It's 'the brother-in-law kitchen,' " he said, meaning that it can be achieved only if your brother-in-law is a licensed plumber, electrician and general contractor, and utterly devoted to you. 
 The kitchen and bath are the most expensive rooms to redo because they require appliances, cabinetry, countertops, electricity, water and gas lines, plus the labor to install them. Remodeling magazine pegs a minor American kitchen makeover (new paint, new cabinet fronts, perhaps a new floor) for this year at $8,655, and a major remodeling (the works) at an average of $31,090. The appliances and materials are one-third of the cost; the rest is labor. And in New York, labor runs high. "All the trades have to be involved," said Paul Deffenbaugh, Remodeling's editor in chief. "You'll do it once or twice in your lifetime, kind of like getting married, and you'll want to do it right."
Nonetheless, the $20,000 makeover is possible, especially if no walls or fixtures have to be moved. Here are four kitchens to prove it, from a modest $5,000 redo to a makeover that slightly topped the budget because a wall was demolished. In addition, House & Home asked three Manhattan design firms for budget "concept" kitchens. Ikea cabinets, those affordable chameleons, turned up in kitchens traditional and modern (with finishes from aluminum to laminate to cherry). In realizing her vision, Helene Verin sacrificed custom cabinetry -- but not style -- for Ikea's frosted-glass cabinets, lighted from within to glow softly. The savings let her splurge on walnut counters. Each kitchen, real or theoretical, offers uncluttered counter space and invites a person to get busy and cook.
 
Whimsical Feminism
Ms. Verin is a designer of interiors, furniture and wallpaper who lives in the Flatiron district, and her kitchen is a tongue-in-cheek statement of feminism (she just got divorced and she's happy). The pass-through from the kitchen to the dining room is cut in the shape of an egg. And the thick walnut counter for the pass-through? "It's the shadow of the egg," Ms. Verin said. Three ceiling lamps in the shape of milk bottles, designed by Droog, complete the feminist symbolism.
Ms. Verin knew how to prioritize artfully. She loved the voluptuousness of custom-cut solid walnut, made for the pass-through and around the sink. She then economized by using walnut veneer for below-the-counter cabinetry and the front of the refrigerator. For a backsplash, she had glass cut to fit, but she frosted it herself using a $4 tube of spray frost, called Krylon Glass Interior Frosting Spray. The Magic Chef stove, Bosch dishwasher and Franke sink are new; their chrome or stainless steel finishes resemble those of higher-end appliances. But she kept the old refrigerator.
The kitchen is 10 feet by 7 feet 3 inches, but "the advantage of this place is that the ceiling is 12 feet high," she said. So she raised the height of the cut-out entrance to the kitchen from 7 1/2 feet to its full 12 feet, and suddenly a small kitchen soared. Total cost: $12,000.
 
 The Endless Counter
Suzie Jackson wanted a kitchen with more than enough counter space. Ms. Jackson is a food stylist who until last month lived with her husband, James, and daughter, Edwina, in a TriBeCa loft. (They have since moved to Australia.) Brad Zizmor, who designed the loft with Dag Folger, his partner at A&I Design in Manhattan, obliged. The kitchen is 18 feet long by 12 feet 9 inches wide; the counters run the entire length on both sides.
The efficient room is an austere homage to the loft's industrial heritage, warmed with wood. The countertops are Fireslate, a synthetic heat-resistant, laboratory countertop material (800-523-5902), so Ms. Jackson could put hot pots directly on it. Although Fireslate is only half an inch thick, the architects attached it to the sides, so the counters appear to be "big and bulky and permanent," Mr. Folger said. They designed a storage system of birch plywood shelves, drawers and cabinetry, framed with Speed-Rail, a cast aluminum tubing system intended for scaffolding or industrial handrails. The floor is trompe l'oeil: What appears to be concrete is 4-by-4-foot squares of Ply-cem, half-inch thick panels of concrete impregnated with wood fibers. "It's used for industrial roofing," Mr. Zizmor said, "but it's lighter and more stable than plain concrete, which can also crack." Total cost: $17,450.
 
Midcentury Modern for Less
David Colman's clutter-free, cozy (that's another word for "small") midcentury-modern kitchen cost only $5,000. "I wanted a nice, clean, white and green kitchen," said Mr. Colman, a freelance writer who lives in the Wall Street district. "The kitchen had an awful ivory and wood laminate-accented cabinet with a hideous tile floor and fluorescent light." Out went everything except the refrigerator and stove.
He installed an antique porcelain sink, a new pine floor, butcher-block counters and those glass-fronted cabinets from Ikea (to hold his red and white 1950's Paul McCobb dishes, found on eBay). To economize, he gave up on the idea of $50 crystal knobs and bought chrome ones at P. Guerin, a custom hardware house in Greenwich Village, for $5 each, and painted the walls himself. "My knobs have pedigree," he said.
 
Minimalist, Barrier-Free, Zen
At age 89, Will Machado, an interior designer who lives on the Upper West Side, gave himself an inspiring present: a minimalist Zen kitchen that is warm, serene and efficient. He wanted a kitchen that was easy to walk around, and he demolished a wall separating the kitchen from the living room. "I wanted to simplify my life," he said, but even with a $30,000 budget (including demolition) he had to make trade-offs. He loves wood for its warmth and tactility, and he hired Stephen Iino, a cabinetmaker, to execute his design in ash and maple. (The old appliances stayed -- Mr. Machado cooks some meals at home, or goes out to Nick & Toni's Cafe a block away.) Mr. Machado eliminated the thing that annoyed him most: overhead doors that swung out.
"Why open doors and bang your head?" Mr. Machado asked. "All the doors slide, the pulls are holes and drawers slide out." He pulled out a drawer, and shut it with a bump of his hip. The cabinetry was $20,000. The demolition, rubber floor, and other work cost an additional $10,000.
 
THREE KITCHEN SCHEMES
House & Home asked three design firms to take an 8-by-10 foot Manhattan galley kitchen and create a replacement kitchen for $20,000, labor included. Their recipes included a mix of things expensive (Antonio Citterio's $800 plastic rolling carts for Kartell) and modest (those Ikea glass-fronted cabinets).
 
Plan I: Pret-a-Porter
"We used off-the-shelf pieces that would require a minimum amount of craft," said Robert Young, who did the design with his partner, Shea Murdock, of Murdock Young Architects. They were inspired by industrial kitchens to use two under-the-counter refrigerators and a freezer.
"We made it open to seem larger, and banished any big vertical space hog, like a full-size refrigerator," he said. "You reach down and grab what you need," just as chefs do, he said. They used only one closed cabinet. "You have to be able to deal with putting things in nice containers. But it's not for everyone," he said.
The custom stainless steel counter has a built-in sink and backsplash; stainless steel shelves are bolted onto painted plywood panels. The planned appliances, like the Jenn-Air gas range and dishwasher, Braun hood, Marvel refrigerators and freezer, are also stainless steel.
Closed storage includes, yes, one Ikea glass-fronted cabinet ($148), but also Antonio Citterio's cobalt blue plastic rolling carts from Kartell ($800 each), custom-fitted with butcher block tops.
The rubber tile floor is from Flexco. "It's easier on your feet than a ceramic tile floor," Mr. Young said. Total cost: $19,586.
 
Plan II: See Through
Deborah Gans and Matt Jelacic, of Gans & Jelacic Architecture, designed a glowing kitchen with sliding glass cabinet doors and glass shelves. "We wanted the transparency," Ms. Gans said, "because part of making the shoe box kitchen a great space is the quality of the light, and the cleanliness of the line."
The architects proposed industrial-grade steel brackets and standards, and laminated glass doors made of two pieces of glass with plastic film in between. "You can go from opaque white to clear just by choosing a different kind of film," Ms. Gans said. The sliding doors are hung on a heavy-duty track. Cereal boxes can go behind opaque doors, and Champagne flutes behind clear.
An open shelf holds the computer, perhaps the kitchen tool of the 21st century. They also proposed a poetic sheet of glass along one wall, etched with measurement equivalents.
The stainless steel counters have two holes cut into the top, for nonrecyclable and recyclable garbage. Elsewhere, inexpensive ($146 each) wire cabinet-carts will roll out on wheels; they have plywood fronts sprayed with durable auto body paint. "You can get a slick, personalized, color-coordinated finish," said Ms. Gans, who likes the brilliant color palette of the Volkswagen Bug available from Heavenly Bodyworks in Chelsea (212-691-1092). The walls and floor are equally slick, and are made of Pergo, a washable composite laminate that resembles wood. Total cost: $17,000.
 
Plan III: Optical Tricks
Like Gans and Jelacic, Ronald Bricke, an interior designer, created a kitchen with glass-fronted cabinets (Ikea again) and an open shelf for appliances. His design differs, however, in his use of tiles for texture and scale. For the counters and floor, he used dusty green glass ceramic tiles 12 inches square, from Trans Ceramica Ltd. in Pennsauken, N.J. They're "the color of a dried bay leaf," said Mr. Bricke, a great amateur cook. Total cost: $18,031.
The tiles for the backsplash and the back half of the counters are polished, and the ones in front of the counter are unpolished to keep water from flowing over the edge. On the floor, he alternated double rows of polished tile with double rows of unpolished ones, for both aesthetics and function. "The stripes give an impression of widening the room," Mr. Bricke said, "and although it would be safest if you kept the whole floor unpolished, the staggered pattern of polished and unpolished is fairly safe." He has tried it on a client, who in three years has never slipped, "and still has all her teeth," he said.

HEADLINE: Meet the New Web. Same as the Old Web.

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
ONE night this summer, Robert Smith was in a bar debating the name of an obscure supporting actress in an equally obscure John Wayne film. It was his telephone that finally settled the discussion.
Mr. Smith, however, didn't call anyone. Instead, using a minibrowser on his Samsung digital cell phone, he poked around the Web for about five minutes before finally uncovering the answer. "I was amazed I could pull that off," he said later, "especially since I had $5 riding on the outcome." 
 But winning bar bets is low on the list of things that persuaded Mr. Smith to get wireless Web access. (About two months later, he couldn't even remember the name of the actress or the film involved in the bet.) Mr. Smith, a regional manager for a company that insures renters of everything from party tents to portable toilets, began using the wireless Web 11 months ago to tap into a Web-based database of his 1,200 clients without having to use a laptop computer.
Media Metrix estimates that nearly 7.4 million households in the United States now have devices like cell phones, pagers and personal digital assistants that can pluck data from the airwaves. And although there are no reliable overall figures, people in the industry say that only a small percentage of users with Web-ready devices actually exploit that feature. Only 200,000 of Sprint PCS's customers have signed up for Web service. Similarly, AT&T Wireless estimates that just 100,000 of its subscribers tap into the wireless Web.
Those who do explore the wireless Web are discovering that it is a very different world from the Web they reach on desktop and laptop computers.The content now available on the wireless Web -- mostly stock quotes, sports scores and weather forecasts -- is served up in basic text menus with a minimum of graphics and fanfare. In some ways, it is almost the opposite of the all-singing, all-dancing wired Web.
"In focus groups, people say that they want full Web browsing, and that's the one thing we can't deliver," said Michael Mace, chief competitive officer at Palm Inc. "We need to let people know that wireless is not like using a PC. When people who don't know that get there and try to browse, they say, 'What is this garbage?' "
But some others, like Mr. Smith, are even beginning to prefer the wireless version. He likens using his sleek, state-of-the-art Samsung phone to his early days of personal computing, when he was a proud owner of a boxy Kaypro.
"What I find on the Web is too much junk," Mr. Smith said. "Logos and graphics don't thrill me -- content does. But the wireless Web is like it was in the old days when we were tapping into bulletin boards with a 300-baud modem."
In a narrow sense, Mr. Smith isn't actually on the Web. While wireless users may think they're viewing the World Wide Web, many wireless providers in the United States, including AT&T, limit their customers to special pages stored on closed servers. Some people in the wireless Web business predict the Web will become increasingly divided into two streams, wired and wireless.
"The Web is going to become highly segmented," said Andrew Sukawaty, the former president of Sprint PCS, the wireless company that counts Mr. Smith among its customers. "You're going to see specialized pages for specialized needs"
Exactly what Americans are doing on the wireless Web and what it may look like in five years remain something of a mystery. For starters, none of the major Net ratings companies has started tracking wireless Web use. And Bruce Ryon, vice president of Media Metrix's new-media group, which is developing such a measurement system, said that the widespread use of the wireless Web in Asia and Europe does not offer a model of what is likely to happen in the United States. In Europe, for example, online wireless games are popular. In Japan, there is a Web-based version of karaoke.
American customers are not likely to be singing karaoke into their cell phones anytime soon. The biggest difference is cost. As with traditional phone service, there is a bewildering array of options for wireless Web customers, most of them more expensive than those in Europe or Japan. Sprint PCS, for example, estimates that its customers pay an average of 25 cents a minute to surf the Web.
"The thing about Europe and Asia is that there's a whole different economic model," Mr. Ryon said. "In both places it's very expensive to be wired to the Web. It can cost hundreds of dollars a month. But wireless access costs only a few dollars a month. Here, I have a Web cell phone that I'm paying about $70 a month for, and most people can get on the wired Internet practically for free." As a result, Mr. Ryon said, the relative expense of wireless browsing means that North Americans "will not use it for time killing, like people in Europe."
Sprint PCS was the first United States wireless phone service to offer a practical way onto the Web using handheld gadgets. Most major wireless companies offer some form of Web service. Typically, they deliver text-only Web pages written in Handheld Device Mark-up Language -- H.D.M.L. -- or Wireless Mark-up Language -- W.M.L. In part, because wireless modems are sluggish -- most systems in this country reach a top speed of only 14.4 kilobits per second -- companies like AT&T try to reduce delays by holding pages on closed servers and by using a series of technology standards known as the Wireless Application Protocol, or W.A.P.
The content offered by the wireless Web also pales beside that of its wired cousin. Fast Web and Transfer, a search engine company, has indexed 400 million Web pages from the traditional Web in its main search engine. But its W.A.P. search engine offers only 400,000 pages configured for the wireless Web.
"This space is so new to all of us that we don't really know what services people will want on mobile devices," said Deanna Sanford, lead project manager for the mobile version of Microsoft's MSN Web portal.
Mr. Smith is a good example of an early adopter of the wireless Web. Despite his phone's limitations, he has found a relatively sophisticated way to use it as he travels. Shortly after getting his new phone, Mr. Smith downloaded a wide variety of information about his clients -- contact information, policy expiration dates -- into a Web-based address book offered by Yahoo.
"I use it to access my database when I don't have a laptop," he said, "or during times like when I'm in a restaurant and I don't want to pull my laptop out and wait for it to boot up."
One thing Mr. Smith does not do, however, is stray outside of the roughly 40 sites offered by Sprint's wireless menu. Looking at pages not rewritten for Web phones usually involves scrolling through several screens containing only the text for the various navigation buttons and bars that surround the actual contents of a page when it is viewed on a personal computer.
W.A.P. and its special standards are not the only answer to that problem. Palm Inc. and others stick with traditional Web technical standards by using scraping or clipping software that tries to lift out only the most important text on a page. Other wireless-site developers are looking to create material aimed only at the wireless market. Lee Hancock, chief executive and chairman of Go2 Online, a Web-based business directory, said the company is altering and limiting the material it sends through its wireless Web service. "You might not be looking for a plumber from your cell phone, but you might be looking for a hotel," he said.
Go2 also hopes to take advantage of technology that will indicate future cell phones' physical locations (a feature that all phones sold in the United States after Oct. 1, 2001, must contain by law to aid 911 emergency operators) to automatically sort wireless Web pages. With that, the service would be able to deliver information on, say, restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the user.
To no one's surprise, many companies are hoping that the wireless Web will become part of the world of e-commerce. The wireless Web versions of online stores like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com are already being touted as comparison-shopping tools. The theory is that shoppers will pause in store aisles to check online prices before heading to the checkout.
Mr. Ryon, at Media Metrix, has his doubts about the plan. "I just kind of roll my eyes when it comes up at conferences," he said. But he also said that future generations of Web-enabled phones might become part of another big Internet trend: downloadable music.
As Web-enabled phones improve, Mr. Hancock said he expects that many users may even leave behind the wired Web, with its slow downloads and overwhelming multimedia features, just as many cell phone users have abadoned their land lines.
"There is a very good chance that in many cases the wireless device becomes the primary entrance to the Web," Mr. Hancock said. "But it will be very different than the Web as we now know it. We'll have to create a user experience I don't believe can be met by wired access."
 
Routes to Wireless Web
 
Web-Enabled Cell Phones
To reach the Web with a cell phone, users must first open a minibrowser that establishes a wireless connection with the Internet, usually through a special server. To save users the frustration of entering a Web address using the buttons on the telephone's numeric keypad, service providers usually present choices of text prompts on each phone's display.
Some providers may limit some customers to specially designed wireless Web pages on the companies' own servers. Others let their customers view any Web pages. But the inability of cell phone screens to reproduce color or graphics means that Web sites written in special text-only languages are about all that is worth viewing. The pricing plans vary widely among cell phone companies.
 
Pagers That Surf
Pagers with tiny keyboards from Motorola and Research in Motion are primarily used to send and receive e-mail. But Research in Motion recently introduced a larger-screen model as a step toward linking its users to the Web as well.
WolfeTech's Pocket Genie browser service (www.wolfetech
.com) offers owners of RIM's BlackBerry or Motorola's TimePort pager access to any Web page under plans that cost either $9.95 or $14.95 a month. The company's servers reformat pages for the tiny screens. Go America offers its Go.Web wireless service (www.goamerica.com) for pagers as well as P.D.A.'s and laptop computers with plans ranging from $9.95 to $59.95 a month. The company says its users can reach any Web page. Pages are compressed digitally before transmission.
 
P.D.A.'s That Go Online
Owners of Palm Inc.'s VII and VIIx models can subscribe to Palm.Net, a wireless service operated by the company, under plans that range from $9.99 a month plus additional-use charges to $44.99 a month for unlimited use. Palm's system, unlike those for cell phones, uses conventional Internet page language and offers about 400 sites that have been revised using what Palm calls Web clipping. To speed up downloading, that technology strips away graphics and links from Web pages. Palm.Net also offers services that will clip any page on the Web on demand, although the results can often be disappointing. Other wireless service providers also offer Web services that work with Palm, Windows CE and Pocket PC devices.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Don't underestimate the government's role in building the economy.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a new collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." Mr. Madrick, Virginia Postrel, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
GEORGE W. BUSH has finally made government the issue of the presidential campaign. After wasting months focusing on Al Gore's character, he returned to what was always the Republicans' meat and potatoes. As president, Vice President Gore would give you big government, Governor Bush now emphasizes. But if voters elect him instead, Mr. Bush says, he would continue to tame Washington.
Mr. Bush is picking up, of course, from the legacy of Ronald Reagan, who was determined to bench government as long as he could. President Reagan helped make entrepreneurialism and profits respectable again, which was no small achievement. And some deflation of government was no doubt deserved. In the 1960's and 1970's, advocates of progressive actions underestimated how difficult such tasks as reducing poverty and revitalizing the inner cities really were, and did not take sufficient care to develop new policies that would be effective. Americans also overestimated the nation's potential affluence. Remember guns and butter? 
 But the oversimplified fear of big government has been damaging and does not accurately reflect American history. On the crucial role of government in the nation's economic success, our past is unambiguous. Beginning with Jefferson's presidency, the federal government may have resisted building a national system of roads, but by the 1820's the states picked up the ball. Led by New York, the states invested millions of dollars, which was big money then, in new canals, and New York even made loans to business. Where would the early economy have been without these canals?
In those same years, federal laws were passed to protect the rights to the ownership of property for millions of Americans, including squatters, even though it violated the sanctity of the contracts the nation's rich landowners held. To Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian development specialist and author of "The Mystery of Capital" (Basic Books), America's far-seeing protection of property rights was a key to economic success.
Before the Civil War, there was a pitched battle over whether primary education should remain private, but public education thankfully prevailed, and America became the best-educated nation in the world. Now, economists believe educational attainment is the foremost economic resource of a nation.
Throughout the 1800's, the federal government aggressively subsidized the building of the railroads. After a couple of decades of a simplistic Social Darwinian ideology of "survival of the fittest" at the end of the 19th century, the progressives established regulations that made competition fairer and protected workers from abusive hours and labor conditions.
In the early 1900's, local governments built much-needed high schools. In the 1930's, Social Security and unemployment insurance were introduced over the vehement objections of conservatives. And after World War II, the federal government was responsible for the highway system, the G.I. Bill of Rights, the Pentagon-sponsored research that resulted in the Internet, and civil rights legislation that helped bring African-Americans into the economic fold.
The record is plain: government has done many things awfully well. And beyond the historical evidence, there is also strong statistical support for the idea that government investment has produced substantial returns. Ishaq Nadiri, an economist at New York University, has developed with colleagues a provocative model of public investment that is widely accepted. Their research shows that the return on federal transportation investment, for example, has been every bit as strong as the returns on private investment in recent years (and even stronger in the past) because such investment benefits society as a whole.
Economic theory is consistent with Professor Nadiri's findings. Private investors will systematically underinvest in areas in which such social returns exceed private returns because the individual companies themselves will not enjoy all the benefits. Good theory, then, tells us that investments in public goods, from roads, sewers and airports to research and education, cannot be completely entrusted to private markets.
Since the Reagan era began, America has largely neglected many of these areas. Of course, government will make mistakes (so does business). But consider that federal investment in transportation, research and development and education and training has fallen to only 1.7 percent of G.D.P., 30 percent lower than it was in 1970. At former levels, it would have been roughly an additional $100 billion of spending a year.
The new economy is also creating new needs that are going unmet. Paying down the nation's debt is apparently our priority, but two-worker families desperately need quality day care. The information age requires even better education, but according to Richard Rothstein and Karen Hawley Miles, both education specialists, schools have increased inflation-adjusted spending per pupil since the late 1960's by only 1 percent a year, much less than the growth of the economy.
What does the low level of teachers' salaries say about our society? Nancy Folbre, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, argues that such caring professions, including nursing and caring for the elderly, are themselves public goods that require serious government assistance.
And, although deregulation and privatization have been useful, regulatory vigilance cannot simply be relaxed across the board as the economy changes. What are we to make of deregulation in a time when tire companies neglect safety standards, and the number of product recalls continues to set records? Despite the dangerous collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Investment Capital two years ago, no new requirements for public disclosure of financial information are in the works.
Both business and government have vital roles in the economy, and always have. But for many people, government has become an us-versus-them issue. For the sake of the nation's economy, the next president should realize that the government is us.

HEADLINE: Danes to Vote on Adopting the Euro

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Denmark, pursuing an odd calling as the barometer of Europe's mood, holds its fourth referendum in less than a decade on Thursday on what degree of integration with the European Union the country desires.
This time, the question being put to just over four million voters is whether Denmark should follow 12 other states of the 15-member Union and join a shared European currency, the euro. But the real issue may be summed up otherwise: it's the politics, stupid. 
 The Danish currency, the krone, is pegged to the euro and has followed the currency's 25 percent slide against the dollar during the past 21 months. This link will be maintained whatever the outcome of the vote.
But even if this arrangement ties Denmark irrevocably to Europe's economic fate, many Danes are concerned about adopting a currency they see as a political symbol of a push for a European superstate in which the identity of small nations like Denmark would be diminished.
"Countries should have their own borders, their own defense and their own currency, but all of this is being eroded by attempts to create a United States of Europe," said Peter Skaarup, a member of the right-wing Danish People's Party. "If we give up the krone, we won't be masters in our own house any more."
Such fears have bolstered the "No" campaign, and most opinion polls suggest that Danes will reject the euro. The vote, however, is too close to call, with at least 10 percent of the electorate undecided, and the government of Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is placing its faith in a last-minute swing in favor of the euro.
Other European governments will be watching closely. The euro's weakness since its introduction in 1999 has been tied partly to a market perception that the will does not exist in the European Union to pursue the sort of political integration that would bolster the currency.
A Danish rejection would inevitably reinforce such sentiments at a time when the European Central Bank, with support from the United States and Japan, has already felt obliged to intervene in support of the currency. Any prospect of Britain and Sweden adopting the euro would also recede.
A Gallup poll published today showed 47 percent of Danes against the euro and 41 percent in favor. A poll by the National Statistics Office gave the anti-euro camp an even wider victory, with 51.7 percent voting "No" and 41.3 percent "Yes." Only one survey, by the Vilstrup polling center, gave a narrow victory to euro supporters.
Jorn Thulstrup, a pollster who has followed the national mood closely and was predicting a month ago that Denmark would accept the euro, said he had now reluctantly concluded that the country would reject it.
Fears about pensions reflect anxiety among Danes that joining the euro would open the way to outside domination in the form of an insistence that Denmark cut its taxes, scale back its welfare state and deregulate its economy along the lines that markets generally favor.
Many Danish Socialists continue to oppose the euro on the grounds that it would prove incompatible with their welfare state. As a result, the left and right have come to oppose the euro for different reasons.
"We are facing an unholy alliance of right-wing nationalists concerned about our identity and left-wingers worried about economic freedom," said John Iversen, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Welcomes Vouchers, But the Word Eludes Him

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush concluded three days of education events today with a visit to a parochial school in this city's heavily Hispanic South-Central section, talking about reading, character education and discipline. But there was one issue Mr. Bush did not so much as mention: school vouchers.
That Mr. Bush, the Republican candidate for president, would avoid discussing at a Catholic school a policy that many Catholic parents staunchly support -- and that he has endorsed -- spoke volumes about the way he has been campaigning on the education issue this week. 
 On Monday, Mr. Bush's aides distributed a 16-page pamphlet on his education agenda that does not use the words school vouchers. On Tuesday afternoon, when asked if he supported vouchers, Mr. Bush sidestepped the issue by saying the decision should be left to state and local officials. And on Tuesday evening, when Larry King asked him on his CNN program whether he thought vouchers worked, Mr. Bush replied, "I'm not positive."
From his extraordinarily careful handling of the issue, one might conclude that Mr. Bush harbored deep reservations about vouchers. But in fact, a voucherlike proposal is an integral part of his plan to push public schools to be more accountable for student achievement.
Under his proposal, the federal government could take aid away from chronically failing schools and give it directly to low-income parents. The parents could use the money -- $1,500 per student -- for a variety of educational purposes, including private school tuition.
That is the widely accepted definition of a voucher, yet Mr. Bush declines to use the word, suggesting that he considers it loaded with bad connotations. Instead, he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, emphasize the concept of choice. Their plan, they say, would provide poor children trapped in bad schools a range of options normally available only to the more affluent, such as hiring tutors, transferring to other public schools or attending private schools.
"A voucher connotes that you want everybody to take the money and flee into the private world," said B. Alexander Kress, an education adviser to Mr. Bush. "I think the governor is of the notion that the problems will be fixed by the public schools. But if they aren't, then there are these other options."
But aides to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, contend that Mr. Bush is running away from a contentious policy that they say is widely opposed by the moderate swing voters, particularly women, he is assiduously courting.
Mr. Bush "realizes most Americans don't agree with vouchers," asserted Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. "That's why they don't use the word vouchers for what is a voucher plan."
Actually, many polls suggest that the public is divided on the matter. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in July showed that 47 percent of voters supported the concept of taxpayer-financed vouchers, while 46 percent opposed it.
Mr. Gore strongly opposes taxpayer-financed vouchers, arguing that they drain public aid away from the schools that need it most. That is also the position of the powerful teachers unions that are expected to provide important support in getting out the Democratic vote in November.
Viewed more broadly, Mr. Bush's approach to vouchers is similar to his handling of a number of contentious conservative policies. Mr. Bush has won support from groups like the National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life Committee by opposing most forms of gun control and by vowing to sign legislation outlawing the procedure known by opponents as partial-birth abortion. Yet he rarely discusses those views on the stump.
During a week in which Mr. Bush focused on education, hammering at Mr. Gore's policies and warning of an "education recession," his avoidance of the word, or even the concept, of vouchers was often striking.
The pamphlet his campaign issued on Monday, titled "Ending the Education Recession," says that Mr. Bush of Texas would give parents "real options -- like tutoring or the ability to transfer to another school," avoiding any mention that the money could be used for private or parochial schools.
At a public high school in Redwood City, Calif., on Tuesday, a student asked Mr. Bush how he felt about vouchers. Mr. Bush never acknowledged that he supported the concept.
"If the state of California wants to do that, it's up to the state of California," he said. "I believe in local control of schools."
Mr. Cheney offered a similar answer to voters in a visit to Michigan on Tuesday. Michigan and California have hotly contested ballot initiatives this year calling for the creation of voucher systems.
Later on Tuesday, during his interview on "Larry King Live," Mr. Bush said, "I'm not positive vouchers work." But, he continued, "I think we ought to try them."

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, a Vision Of a Cultural Haven;
Academy Plan Generates Buzz and Backlash

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES

 BODY:
The three desolate lots that encircle the Brooklyn Academy of Music have gnawed at Harvey Lichtenstein for decades.
Mr. Lichtenstein made his reputation rebuilding the academy of music by discovering how to turn Manhattan's attention to Brooklyn. Under Mr. Lichtenstein, the academy's stately Beaux-Arts opera house was filled with provocative and avant-garde productions. The strategy worked, bringing in the kind of Manhattanite who never before would have admitted to taking the No. 4 train past Bowling Green. 
 But even as the academy thrived, the lots around it remained as scars on the street grid. When Mr. Lichtenstein stepped down in 1999, after 32 years as president and artistic director of the academy, the empty spaces continued to bother him. So he took charge of the academy's local development corporation to see if what clicked for an old opera house might work for vacant lots.
In recent months, Mr. Lichtenstein has been trying to sell artists, community leaders and public officials on his idea of raising up a cultural district on those empty tracts and in the surrounding area. He envisions a visual and performing arts library, a charter school, a new-media center, a mixed-use arts complex, theaters, nonprofit offices, a museum, retail space, loft housing and a hotel.
To match his ambitions, Mr. Lichtenstein dreams of unique buildings for the project and has hired Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch architect known for nontraditional designs. Mr. Lichtenstein says he hopes that Mr. Koolhaas will draft building plans that can lure established cultural institutions and create a great public architecture rarely seen in Brooklyn.
"BAM had made a reputation as a performing arts center, but the context never grew up around it," Mr. Lichtenstein said. "Now it is the right time to develop it as a cultural district."
So far, Mr. Lichtenstein's game plan appears to be working. The city has pledged $25 million to the project and the academy's renovation of the Strand Theater, just north of the academy. Construction has begun on a new headquarters for the Mark Morris Dance Group. The development corporation is negotiating with other dance companies, theater groups, nonprofit organizations and a museum, all of which feel squeezed out of Manhattan. Mr. Lichtenstein has also piqued the interest of a charter school and the Brooklyn Public Library.
In short, he has begun to generate buzz.
But where there is buzz there is backlash. Some community leaders in Fort Greene, the neighborhood next to the academy, are worried that Mr. Koolhaas's ideas will clash with the neighborhood's brownstone architecture. Business owners who have helped usher in an African-American renaissance along Fulton Street worry about being left out of the project. Rents have already shot up in Fort Greene in recent months, and some black residents fear that the project will make the neighborhood whiter.
Mr. Lichtenstein and Jeanne Lutfy, the president of the development corporation, argue vociferously that they are taking care to make sure their development only helps residents and merchants.
But the district, Mr. Lichtenstein has made clear, is not supposed to be artistically safe. It is supposed to be exciting.
Although Mr. Lichtenstein has filled his office at the development corporation with the trappings of an urban planner (zoning rules, aerial photos, land-use maps), he still thinks like the creative director of a performing arts group.
Mr. Lichtenstein's wild eyebrows, tightly packed teeth and wide smile give him an impish look that match his love of attention-getting actions.
"The district will develop like a work of art," he said recently as he and Ms. Lutfy discussed their plans. "It will be a creative process. It could be terrible; it could come out terribly."
As Mr. Lichtenstein said "terrible," Ms. Lutfy shifted uncomfortably in her seat and tried to cut him off. But Mr. Lichtenstein would not stop.
"Anything creative starts out with that possibility, that it could be terrible," he continued. "But we have the commitment, flexibility and nerve to go through with it."
Mr. Lichtenstein hopes his first show of nerve was hiring Mr. Koolhaas. Only the initial stages of research and study have begun, but Mr. Koolhaas has clearly begun to think about what he wants to create.
Mr. Koolhaas argues that Manhattan has begun a process of super-gentrification, becoming an island of shiny buildings and unchecked consumerism.
"In Brooklyn, I want to set up a polarity," Mr. Koolhaas said. "I want something less shiny, less consumerist, more productive."
Mr. Koolhaas first made his reputation not with a building but with a book on architecture, "Delirious New York," first published in 1978. In the book, Mr. Koolhaas argues the city's position as a cultural capital is intertwined with its soaring, dense architecture. And that idea, he said, informs the Brooklyn Academy of Music's project. Packing many cultural institutions close together will produce creative results, for both the programs and the architecture, Mr. Koolhaas said.
Those possibilities clearly excite some of the proposed tenants. The Brooklyn Public Library is studying a proposal to build a $50 million, 100,000-square-foot visual and performing arts branch in the district.
"I look at the library as really being the center of knowledge for a neighborhood," said Martin Gomez, executive director of the library. "Translate that to the BAM cultural district and you see that many of those groups are going to need a place to find information to enable them to pursue their craft."
The initial ideas that have popped forth for the cultural district from Mr. Koolhaas's Office for Metropolitan Architecture bear his distinct stamp. Mr. Koolhaas is known for his preoccupation with horizontal layering, rendering buildings like off-kilter sandwiches. His team's early ideas for the museum and the library incorporate layers, each dedicated to different uses, and each set off from the floor below and above.
Howard Pitsch, the president of the Fort Greene Association, said he was excited by the prospect of creating a district designed with "good, clean, contemporary modern architecture."
"Why should it be bad?" Mr. Pitsch said. "There is nothing but parking lots there now.
"If we can build Fort Greene as a cultural center, couldn't we all celebrate?" he said.
Others, though, are more reserved. Robert Evans, chairman of Community Board 2, said he liked the idea of the district. But he said architectural proposals that resulted in radical design, glass boxes or loft housing made him nervous.
"Everyone in the area is very much interested in protecting quality," Mr. Evans said. "We are not much interested in modernizing. You are going to create problems if the buildings are too outlandishly modern."
Business owners and residents worry that Mr. Lichtenstein will succeed too well, that he will change the character of the area. Some business owners in the Fort Greene shopping area known as the Bogolan District (named after the Mali word for "mud cloth") worry that the development could drive up commercial rents and provide new, subsidized retail space for Manhattan businesses, while shutting out existing merchants.
Jonathan Adewumi, chairman of the Bogolan Merchants Association, said he worried that visitors to the academy of music district would never venture beyond its borders into Fort Greene proper.
"You don't want to look across from your store and see a bright, shiny new retail space and you are not a part of it," Mr. Adewumi said. "I think the current project just looks at luring people from Manhattan and does not look at the people who are already here."
Tracye Gardner, a black Fort Greene resident and founder of the Brooklyn Young Filmmakers Center, said that more white families had moved into the area recently, and that she worried that black families were being pushed out.
"I am very happy about having a beautiful cultural district in my neighborhood, as long as I can stay in my neighborhood," Ms. Gardner said. "Fort Greene is already an amazing community in terms of the black resources and black history, but that could change radically. It could become a culture district for a portion of Manhattan that is relocating."
Backers of the project contend that the cultural district is not the cause of gentrification. Rather, the project is the product of the same forces that are gentrifying Fort Greene.
"Gentrification is happening in Fort Greene already, even though we haven't done anything yet," said Bruce C. Ratner, chairman of the academy of music and the president of Forest City Ratner Companies, a real estate development company. "That proves that what causes gentrification are economic good times."
Ms. Lutfy said that the development corporation had extended the borders of the cultural district into the Fort Greene shopping area, in an effort to integrate those businesses into the project. Both the development corporation officials and architects argue that they are taking pains to ensure that any plans they come up with enhance the brownstone neighborhood.
"We are trying to situate this so that it is not an alien mega-project dropped in the neighborhood," said Charles Renfro, the project manager for Diller & Scofidio, the New York architecture firm working with Mr. Koolhaas.
Mr. Ratner said he thought that in the end, Brooklyn would accept a more avant-garde architectural proposal than parts of Manhattan might.
"Hopefully, we are at a stage in the city where we are more accepting of extraordinary architecture even if it doesn't mesh with what people are used to," Mr. Ratner said. "It's even expected that we at BAM will do something that is cutting edge and contemporary."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Offers Debt-Reduction Plan; Lazio Questions Its Value

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

 BODY:
Supported by Robert E. Rubin, the former secretary of the Treasury Department, and Warren Buffet, the billionaire investor, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged yesterday to protect the federal budget surplus from Republican "tax schemes" by proposing legislation to limit tax cuts and new spending.
Mrs. Clinton, laying out one of her most detailed plans for the budget surplus since entering the New York Senate race, proposed mandatory "debt-reduction caps" that would make it more difficult for Congress to use expected budget surpluses for cutting taxes or paying for new programs. 
 Her plan, similar in general terms to the one proposed by Vice President Al Gore, goes further than Mr. Gore's by setting aside more money for debt reduction and imposing legislative hurdles for making exceptions.
Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, 20 percent of the budget surplus each year over the next 10 years, apart from money for Social Security and Medicare, would be reserved for reducing federal debt. That would create a pool of about $360 billion, her campaign staff estimated.
If Congress wanted to spend that money or use it to offset tax cuts, it would have to do so with a vote of three-fifths of the members of both houses, she said. In addition, the estimated $2.7 trillion surplus in the Social Security and Medicare accounts would be set aside for debt reduction, she said.
According to her campaign staff's estimates, Mrs. Clinton's proposal would devote about $60 billion more over the 10 years for debt reduction than would Mr. Gore's budget-surplus plan. Mr. Gore's plan also does not require a three-fifths vote for breaking the spending and tax cut limit.
"We have to put first things first and be conservative in how we use this surplus and project our expenditures," Mrs. Clinton said during an economic forum at Columbia University. "I would propose that we set some limits on what we can do with the surplus and just keep everybody on the same page."
But the Republicans said the spending habits of Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats, not their party's proposed tax cuts, are the biggest threat to the surplus. Representative Rick A. Lazio, speaking in Newburgh after touring a riverfront development project, suggested that Mrs. Clinton's policy proposals would leave little of the surplus left to apply toward reducing the debt. He cited a report by the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, that said her economic and education plans would nearly wipe out the surplus.
"So, it's fine rhetoric, but when you add up the numbers, it doesn't add up," Mr. Lazio said. "My economic plan would reserve three-quarters of the surplus to protect Social Security and Medicare, pay down the debt and also invest in some important priorities, like education."
Mrs. Clinton used her budget-surplus proposal as an opportunity once again to criticize Mr. Lazio's tax plan, which she says would give back too much of the projected $4.5 trillion surplus to taxpayers, and which Mr. Rubin said would "reject fiscal discipline." Speaking to an audience of students organized by the university's College Democrats club, Mrs. Clinton said they must look beyond their immediate self-interest.
Mr. Lazio spent the day in the Hudson Valley, touring businesses and the Newburgh waterfront and speaking at a business breakfast in Rockland County. The visits were intended to highlight the potential for his plan for improving the economy through an increase in partnerships between the federal government and the private sector, and through lower taxes that Mr. Lazio says will stimulate the economy.
"I think what we're doing here is we're demonstrating that there is one candidate in this race who has got the capacity to build the kind of partnerships that will be necessary to improve the quality of life for New York," Mr. Lazio said.

HEADLINE: Parent Says Chrysler Unit Will Post a Third-Quarter Loss

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 27

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that its Chrysler car group would report a loss in the third quarter -- the first such loss since a recession in the United States nine years ago -- and that Chrysler's highly respected design chief, Thomas C. Gale, would retire at the end of this year.
Though neither announcement had been entirely unexpected, they provided new evidence that DaimlerChrysler remains deeply divided between its American and German car companies long after their merger. 
 Mr. Gale, 57, is the latest in a long series of top Chrysler executives to bail out of the company since the merger two years ago.
Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's former president and the top American working on integration of the two companies, quit last year after his relations with German executives soured.
Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's former chairman, who had been a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, retired in March, earlier than expected. Many others below the top ranks have left as well.
DaimlerChrysler attributed Chrysler's anticipated third-quarter loss to extremely stiff price competition in the United States and the costs of bringing new models to the market quickly.
But the company insisted that Chrysler would again turn profitable in the last quarter of the year and asserted that total operating profits this year would match those of 1999.
That would be better than many analysts had been fearing, because rumors have been circulating for weeks that the entire company might report a loss and that full-year profits would decline sharply. Reflecting the relief, shares in DaimlerChrysler rose 2.6 percent in Frankfurt, to 52.8 euros or about $46.62. In New York, shares rose 94 cents, to $45.94.
That said, the loss at Chrysler is extraordinary given the company's reputation for profitability during the mid-1990's. It is the first such loss since an $82 million shortfall in the third quarter of 1991 -- and that was a recession year, in contrast to the flush economic times in the United States now.
Investor concern about Chrysler is reflected in the shares of the parent company, which have still lost more than half their value since they peaked at $108 in January 1999. And the basic problems confronting Chrysler are not over. Though the retro-styled PT Cruiser has been a runaway hit, other models are getting stale and need to be revamped.
In a determined effort to hold its market share, Chrysler has torn into its profit margins by spending vast sums on discount programs and other incentives to consumers.
In outlining its predictions for the rest of the year, DaimlerChrysler said that Chrysler would lose about $530 million in the third quarter of this year but would post an overall profit for the year of about $1.7 billion.
Jurgen Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, has already announced plans for billions of dollars in cost-cutting moves during this year and next.
But the company is looking for additional cuts, while also trying to speed up the introduction of new models and expand production of the PT Cruiser.
In contrast to Chrysler, Mercedes has continued to post healthy gains. Even though the German market for midprice cars shriveled this year, largely because of a flood of nearly new used cars on the market, Mercedes sales increased slightly in Germany and about 4.5 percent worldwide.
Even the much-criticized Smart, the snub-nosed two-seat vehicle that was a flop, has bounced back. Its sales jumped 67 percent through August, to 69,500 cars.
The resignation of Mr. Gale had been widely expected, but it could be an important loss. Having spent 33 years at Chrysler, Mr. Gale oversaw the design of cars ranging from the popular Chrysler Intrepid sedan to the Dodge Viper, an eye-catching muscle car that helped jazz up Dodge's dusty image.
Rumors about Mr. Gale's departure spread as soon as it became clear that Mr. Stallkamp was on his way out as president. Earlier this year, when asked in an interview about his intention to stay with the company, he carefully avoided making any long-term commitments.
Today, Mr. Gale strongly implied he had indeed begun planning his departure about that time.
"When Jim Holden took his position as president, I agreed to stay on and see the future product plan through, while continuing to build the team to succeed me," Mr. Gale said. "Now that both of those processes are complete and we're in the next phase of development, it's time for me to step back."
Mr. Gale will be replaced by Richard O. Schaum, who has been in charge of engineering platforms -- the basic chassis and components that are common to many different car models. Trevor M. Creed, who was recently promoted to senior vice president in charge of design, will be responsible for the more visible aspects of exterior and interior styling.
Mr. Gale also said there are no plans to replace him on the 13-member DaimlerChrysler management board. His departure would leave a 12-member board -- 9 from Daimler and 3 from Chrysler.

Jeep Investment in China
By The New York Times
SHANGHAI, Sept. 27 -- DaimlerChrysler will invest $118 million in cash to revive Beijing Jeep, one of the earliest joint ventures in China, which has been making the same modified Jeep for the last 15 years.
The investment is part of a $226 million revamping plan meant to prepare the joint venture for competition after China enters the World Trade Organization and duties on imported sport utility vehicles fall. DaimlerChrysler plans to produce two new models at the venture in the next three years. China is expected to join the W.T.O. within the next few months.

HEADLINE: Protests Diminish at Conference in Prague on Worldwide Aid

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Protests diminished sharply today as financial officials and many demonstrators condemned an outbreak of violence and vandalism on Tuesday that turned a conference on aid into a street battle.
The officials ended the conference a half-day early, saying the formal presentations on the agenda had been completed ahead of schedule. 
 The officials said moving up the closing ceremony, originally planned for Thursday, had nothing to do with the protests.
Some bilateral meetings and news conferences remain scheduled for Thursday.
The delegates have been meeting here for a week. Although some began leaving today, the senior officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which organize the annual event, stayed.
But shattered glass covered the sidewalks along Wenceslas Square, where hundreds of protesters -- many masked anarchists with clubs -- smashed a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Dunkin' Donuts and a Mercedes-Benz dealership on Tuesday. Earlier that day they had repeatedly clashed with the police near the hilltop Conference Center that was the site of the finance meeting.
About 100 people were injured, including 63 police officials, a spokesman for the government said. The police arrested 420 people. But many of those taken into custody were quickly released.
The police today sealed the protesters' center of operations in an old factory on the outskirts of Prague.
This afternoon, two cordons of officers surrounded several hundred protesters in a downtown square, holding them in place until they agreed to disperse.
The violence helped the demonstrators generate publicity, as well as highlighting a gulf between them and representatives of poor nations that they often say they represent.
"Violence has no place in a civilized society," Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha of India told delegates this morning. "I stand here on behalf of India, the land of Mahatma Gandhi, who espoused the cause of nonviolence, and I condemn the violence which was unleashed here."
Czech officials said the protesters had lied to them when they promised, at marathon negotiations before the meetings, to conduct peaceful sit-ins.
Protest organizers distanced themselves from what they called hoodlums and extremists who had no ties to the main march. Even some anarchists criticized the violence.
"We agreed to nonviolence, and it all turned out badly," said a 24-year-old Brazilian who gave his name as Ivan and wore a "Punk Not Dead" T-shirt caked with dust. He sat with other protesters on Peace Square today, hemmed in by the officers who would not let them march. "But I should say that I respect the people who committed the violence. They are not my enemy. The enemy is the I.M.F."
Though protesters distracted the news media from the conference, just as they had helped to undermine a similar meeting last year in Seattle, some said the almost ritualistic violence common to several recent antiglobalization protests obscured their main message.
Many protesters argue that the World Bank and the I.M.F. do more harm than good in poor countries and need to be radically overhauled or abolished.
"The media only care about the violence, not about our arguments," said Katarina Bartovicova, 22, of Bratislava, Slovakia. "They are making us pay for yesterday."

HEADLINE: From Europe, Creative Taxation;
Hungry for Revenue and Seeing Web Sales as a Banquet

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Europe is rushing to tear down borders, but the Internet is toppling some of them even faster, making life distinctly uncomfortable for European policy makers.
A big source of that discomfort is the threat of lost tax revenue, because European nations depend far more on taxes on consumption than the United States does. So in contrast to the United States -- where a federal commission failed to agree on how states should tax basic electronic commerce and mail-order sales like books, consumer electronics and other products -- European officials are pushing hard to adopt a seemingly narrow but potentially far-reaching proposal to ensure that digital products bought in Europe over the Internet do not escape taxation. 
 Essentially, the legislation proposed in June by the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the 15-nation European Union, defines digital products like software and video programming downloaded by computer as services rather than goods.
The idea is to ensure that such transactions face the value-added tax, an elaborate system begun in Europe in which purchases are taxed at each stage from production to final sale. (However lucrative, it is a system that politicians in the United States have shied away from.)
Normally in Europe, services would be taxed in the country of origin, meaning that European nations would gain no tax revenue from services flowing in from the outside. But this bill, which has stirred controversy not only on the Continent but among high-technology companies in the United States, would require companies outside Europe with sales here of such services exceeding 100,000 euros, or about $88,000, to register in one European country for the purpose of paying value-added taxes.
The stakes are significant. In 1999, European e-commerce sales were $3.4 billion, or less than one-half of 1 percent of total sales. But by some estimates, such sales in Europe may rise as high as 12 percent of the total in the next few years. And while sales of digital products from outside Europe are only a small fraction of that, policy makers -- even more than their counterparts in the United States -- are fretting over possible lost revenue.
In contrast to the United States, where relatively few people pay state sales taxes on Internet purchases, European governments already impose national value-added taxes on goods sold over the Internet within Europe. The tax rates and the list of goods covered vary from country to country. For services sold by European companies in Europe, the V.A.T. is paid by the selling company in its home country.
As a result, European governments already tax e-commerce more than the United States does. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, passed by Congress in 1998, created a moratorium on sales taxes on e-commerce across state lines until 2001, and antitax forces in Congress have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to extend the moratorium until 2006.
Washington has sought to coordinate Internet tax policies with the Europeans through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. At an O.E.C.D. conference in Ottawa in 1998, the Europeans and the United States agreed on a list of principles for treating digital goods as services rather than manufactured products, to avoid customs duties on their delivery, and on jurisdiction in case of eventual taxation.
But here, the issue is considered a pressing one. European governments depend for roughly 40 percent of their total revenue on value-added taxes, while state sales taxes in the United States make up only about 25 percent of total state tax revenue. The budget of the European Commission is financed almost entirely by the V.A.T.
In Europe as in the United States, governments are also coming under pressure from traditional retailers that must collect taxes on all their sales -- taxes that Internet providers can skirt. The American software producer Symantec, for instance, which sells its Norton Utilities software to Europeans in several languages through its Web site, encourages customers to download the software directly, saying that there is "no value-added tax, shipping or export charge."
Still, serious obstacles face the proposed European legislation, and enactment is far from certain. For one thing, the bill will not become effective unless it is approved and enacted into national law by all 15 members of the European Union. It also needs to pass in the European Parliament. So difficult is the debate expected to be that Thomas Tindemans, a tax expert in the Brussels office of the law firm White & Case, said the delays would probably produce "a de facto moratorium."
What makes the debate complex is that the proposed legislation affects not only software but also other electronic services like pay-for-use radio and television broadcasting.
The path the Europeans have taken is not unlike the one Congress chose in July, when it passed legislation to resolve the issue of how to tax cellular phone use in the United States. Under the new rules, cell phones have a "primary service area" in which the telephone user pays state and local user taxes. But unlike the American legislation, the broader European measures face bitter opposition.
The European legislators are treading a thin line. National governments -- at pains to see their industries close the gap with the United States, where Internet use by business and consumers is ahead of Europe's -- do not want to impose extra burdens. Yet officials in Brussels also worry that inaction could encourage individual countries to take unilateral action to prevent tax erosion. Mr. Tindemans of White & Case said the goal appeared to be "to force debate at the European level and try to coordinate it."
Initial criticism has been intense. In the United States, the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group, assailed the draft as "fatally flawed." Mark Bohannon, the group's general counsel, said the measure would be unenforceable because it is often impossible to tell where a customer is in cyberspace. He called the proposed law a step backward from international agreements not to tax the Internet.
In Europe, just about every interest group seems unhappy. At Eurocommerce, a trade organization for wholesale and retail distributors, officials are preparing a catalog of objections, including ones to the provision setting the threshold at 100,000 euros. They say that would discriminate against small European companies that already pay the tax while their small rivals abroad would not.
Moreover, the trade group hopes to use the issue as a cudgel to force governments to harmonize value-added tax rates at lower levels, arguing that the proposal encourages foreign companies to register in countries with little or no V.A.T. for digital products, like Britain, where the rate on some items is zero, rather than, say, Sweden and Denmark, where the uniform rate is 25 percent.
"You have the theory," said the chief tax adviser at Eurocommerce, Dimitris Kalogeras. "The practice is quite different."
Freddy Tengberg, chief executive of a company called Buyonet, could not agree more. When Mr. Tengberg, a former mechanical engineer with Exxon, set up his company in 1997 to sell software on the Web and to help other companies do likewise, he established headquarters in Sweden, but registered it in Seattle. The company sells all its products to Europe from the United States.
Buyonet's main competitors, Mr. Tengberg explained in an interview, are American companies like Beyond.com that enable European customers to download their products without paying the value-added tax. If Buyonet added Sweden's 25 percent rate to its prices, he said, "people just would not buy."
Mr. Tengberg, one of the most outspoken opponents of the legislation, called it "primitive and impossible to enforce." The authorities in Europe, he argues, would have no power to force American companies to register. And if American authorities cooperated, he said, many companies would simply move the computers used to deliver their products "to Uruguay, Burkina Faso or Brazil."
"In a digital world," he went on, "where you deliver from doesn't matter. A buyer in Bahrain gets the same service as a buyer in Philadelphia. It's a beautiful fact, but for the tax man it's a nightmare."
Therese Torris, a tax specialist at Forrester Research B.V., regards such comments as nonsense. So far, she said, the market for directly downloaded digital products consists mainly of software sales to corporate customers.
"Large companies have no incentive for tax evasion," Ms. Torris said, relying on governments for assistance in matters like antipiracy and copyright protection. Small businesses may seek to evade taxes, "but it's not in the interest of big companies."
"When they have a problem," Ms. Torris added, "they go to the government and the law."
She said European and American governments face a formidable challenge when digital goods are delivered online and paid for directly over the Internet. But she also said that the problem was purely technical and that companies specializing in tax-collection software were already providing solutions. Taxware International, for instance, recently began marketing software to track European value-added taxes.
Stephane Buydens, a tax specialist at the O.E.C.D., said Europe's value-added tax system could more readily be adjusted than what exists in the United States, where 7,000 revenue jurisdictions create a minefield of differing sales tax rates, and there are contrasting definitions of taxable and nontaxable items.
"In the long term, Europe will have to make some changes," he said. "In the United States, the discussion is about the system itself."
But Mr. Tengberg of Buyonet said that he, like many other executives of businesses operating in cyberspace, believes that the Internet ultimately spells the end of the European value-added tax system.
"It works in a physical market," he said. "It doesn't work here."

HEADLINE: Effect of Prison Building on Crime Is Weighed

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
The first studies to look at the link between the enormous growth of incarceration and the significant drop in crime in the 1990's show that the nation's prison-building boom has accounted for 5 percent to 25 percent of the eight-year decline. In light of those findings, some of the researchers questioned whether the benefits from the growth of incarceration were worth the cost to taxpayers.
The studies found that the number of inmates in jails and prisons quadrupled over the past two decades, to two million, and now cost about $40 billion a year. To avert one killing in the 1990's, it required locking up an additional 670 prisoners, at a cost of $13.4 million a year, according to an estimate by Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. 
 Professor Rosenfeld's findings are included in the most comprehensive of the new studies, a book, "The Crime Drop in America," to be published next month by Cambridge University Press. Written by a group of academic experts, the studies found that "no single factor can be invoked as the cause of the crime decline of the 1990's."
Instead, the authors conclude, "the explanation appears to lie with a number of factors," which interacted with each other, making "it difficult to isolate the relative contribution of any one of them."
Among these factors, in addition to the growth in incarceration, the authors said, were the ebbing of the crack epidemic, innovative efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, new police tactics and an improved job market. The authors said it was difficult if not impossible to determine how much these factors contributed to the drop in crime.
In addition, Professor Rosenfeld said, the country may be undergoing a cultural change in which people have become less tolerant of certain forms of violence, particularly domestic violence, which has helped account for a decline in killings by adults every year since 1980.
"It is possible that American adults are becoming, in a word, more civilized," he said.
A similar cultural change beginning in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe, with the spread of courts of law and better manners, helped reduce crime so that homicide rates there today are only about one-tenth of what they were in the 14th century, other scholars have found.
Another study, released today by the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group in Washington, found that states that had increased the number of prison inmates the most in the 1990's actually had smaller reductions in crime than those states with below average increases in incarceration.
Texas led the nation with a 144 percent increase in prisoners from 1991 to 1998 and had a decrease in crime of 35 percent, the study said. But two other populous states, California and New York, which had much smaller increases in incarceration -- California of 52 percent and New York of 24 percent -- had even sharper drops in crime. In California, the drop was 36 percent and in New York, 43 percent.
In another recent study, of the impact of the growth in incarceration on the drop in crime, Anne Piehl, an associate professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, drawing on changes in crime and prison data for each state, found that the increase in incarceration from 1989 to 1999 accounted for only about 5 percent of the drop in overall violent and property crime.
Carlisle Moody, a professor of economics at the College of William and Mary who has long studied the link between incarceration and crime, criticized the new estimates of the effect of imprisonment, saying they were far too low because they did not take into account the recent history of prisons.
The rate at which criminals were incarcerated remained remarkably stable from about 1900 to the mid-1960's, as did the crime rate, Professor Moody said, but then, with a sharp increase in crime in the mid-60's, there was not an equivalent buildup in incarceration. The rate of incarceration has only recently begun to catch up with the crime rate.
"I'm pretty sure these other people are underestimating the effects of incarceration on crime because they are ignoring the historical changes," Professor Moody said. "Prison has a much greater effect on crime than anything else, like employment or policing."
The new book contains two studies of the impact of the growth in incarceration on the crime drop in the 1990's. Besides the study by Professor Rosenfeld, who estimated that incarceration reduced homicides by adults by 26 percent, a study by William Spelman, a professor of public policy at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, calculated that it reduced violent crime by 25 percent.

HEADLINE: The First Lady Heads West to Raise Money, Both Hard and Soft

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton began a three-day fund-raising trip outside New York yesterday with a visit to Oklahoma City, where her host was a former state attorney general who came under scrutiny in one of the fund-raising investigations involving her husband's re-election.
Mrs. Clinton then held an event in Las Vegas last night, and after that travels to the Los Angeles area for two days. 
 Her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has criticized her for relying heavily on contributions from Hollywood celebrities, a traditional fund-raising source for Democrats, and at first, her aides would not disclose the names of sponsors of the California events.
They later acknowledged that one host would be Cher. The others include the financier Marvin Davis and his wife, Barbara.
Most of the money from the fund-raising trip is expected to go to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, but she also plans to collect soft money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
In the New York contest, she and her Democratic allies have tentatively agreed not to spend soft money -- the largely unregulated contributions collected by parties in an effort to circumvent contribution limits -- under an arrangement with Mr. Lazio.
But Mrs. Clinton, who headed West after addressing an economic forum at Columbia University yesterday morning, has said she will continue to raise soft money, which would be used to help other Democrats, not her candidacy, as long as the New York arrangement stands.
Over all, Mrs. Clinton has received about 60 percent of her campaign contributions from out of state, more than Mr. Lazio or most Senate candidates.
"Rick Lazio has a clear financial advantage in this race because he has raised millions out-of-state with his insult-filled direct mail," said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. "As a result, we have to work harder to be competitive."
In Oklahoma City yesterday, the host for a fund-raising luncheon for Mrs. Clinton was Michael Turpen, the former state attorney general and one of the state's most prominent Democrats.
Mr. Turpen's fund-raising activities were examined by Congressional Republicans in 1997 after he raised a large donation for the Democratic National Committee from an Indian tribe in Oklahoma that has sought to reclaim federal land that the tribe believes was stolen from it.
Mr. Turpen had been hired as a lobbyist by the tribe, the Cheyenne-Arapaho. He suggested to tribal leaders that they could gain access to federal officials if they pledged a $100,000 donation to the Democrats, tribal leaders said.
The leaders were soon invited to a lunch with President Clinton at the White House, where they asked him for help on the land issue. The president, according to the tribal leaders, said he would look into the matter.
The president ultimately took no action, and after the circumstances surrounding the donation were publicized, the Democratic National Committee returned the money. But Republicans in Congress who investigated the affair called it part of a pattern of Democratic fund-raising abuses.
Mr. Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said the fund-raiser sponsored by Mr. Turpen yesterday was "perfectly legal and appropriate."
Mr. Turpen did not respond to two messages left for him.
Also yesterday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, sent a letter to the National Abortion Rights Action League, requesting that it refrain from airing any advertising attacking Mr. Lazio for his position on abortion, in deference to the agreement between the Lazio and Clinton campaigns.
Leaders of the group had initially chafed at the deal, arguing that it interfered with their rights. After meeting yesterday, board members said they would unveil a new advertisement today, but pointedly did not say whether the advertisement would be aired.
Several Democrats said last night it was likely that NARAL would unveil the ad today, expecting that it would be the subject of news reports, but would not buy ad time in deference to the deal.

HEADLINE: A BIG PUSH IS ON FOR NATURAL GAS UNDER THE ARCTIC

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: INUVIK, Northwest Territories

 BODY:
For three decades, geologists probing beneath the Arctic Ocean near here and offshore Alaska have mapped the largest known untapped reserves of natural gas in North America: 165 trillion cubic feet, seven times what the United States will consume this year.
But, until recently, with gas prices low, indigenous opposition high and environmental issues looming, energy companies never found a way to build pipelines to send the gas south to heat homes and to generate electricity. 
 This is changing as fast as it takes to read a home heating bill.
Wholesale prices for natural gas have doubled over the last year, and industry analysts expect that the 55 million Americans who heat their homes with gas will pay 25 to 40 percent more than they did last winter. And with the Energy Department forecasting that demand for natural gas in the United States will rise 40 percent in the next two decades, prices may go higher still.
At the same time, native groups that once opposed development of the big gas fields near here now spy chances for economic development, and are campaigning for royalties and jobs.
After a winter of planning and politicking, energy companies, pipeline operators and Indian tribes expect to announce next spring plans to build one, and possibly two, subterranean pipelines to carry Arctic gas to North America's pipeline grid. Building two pipelines, one from Alaska along the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the Alaska-Canada Highway, and the other from Canada's Northwest Territories, along the Mackenzie River Valley, would cost $10 billion and take seven years.
While pipeline company executives say they are confident they can finance and engineer the projects, environmental problems remain unresolved and some conservation groups vow opposition. Development also portends radical change for isolated places like this one-stoplight town, where the barks of sled dogs herald the long Arctic night and the northernmost road in North America trails off into tundra.
Arguments in favor of tapping the gas fields echo those heard three decades ago, when the United States debated building the Trans-Alaska pipeline to move crude oil south from Prudhoe Bay. The theme is self-reliance in energy in a world buffeted by higher oil prices orchestrated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"We aren't dependent on OPEC for gas," said K. Terry Koonce, president of the Exxon Mobil Production Company. "Gas is up to us Americans to bring about."
Often called a continental commodity, natural gas consumed in the United States comes from North America, delivered by pipelines. Canada, which doubled its exports to the United States in the 1990's, now supplies 16 percent of American consumption, and Canadian executives expect exports to the United States to grow 50 percent this decade.
Last summer, as brownouts hit California and electricity bills jumped in New York, consumers and politicians started demanding new power plants. But with natural gas the fuel of choice for 90 percent of power plants now built in the United States, few people asked the follow-up question: With demand already outstripping supply, where is this gas for these plants going to come from?
The Energy Department predicts that consumption will increase to 31.5 trillion cubic feet a year by 2020, largely because it is a relatively clean fuel. Gas, when burned, produces only one-third the carbon dioxide for each unit of energy as coal and two-thirds as much as oil.
While high prices led energy companies to double their exploration efforts in the United States over the last year, industry executives do not expect production in the lower 48 states to pace consumption. Energy companies and consumer groups see Arctic reserves as crucial to meet future needs.
Environmentalists, who bitterly opposed the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970's, are split over building gas pipelines in the Arctic. Greenpeace opposes them, saying Americans should wean themselves off fossil fuels and invest the billions of dollars it would take to build pipelines in alternative energy sources like solar and wind. Other groups, recognizing that gas pollutes less than oil, plan to focus on reducing the environmental impact of the lines by pushing to have them follow the existing Alaska oil pipeline and the Alaska-Canada Highway.
In Canada and the United States, federal and local authorities will have to approve drilling plans and pipeline construction, but industry executives said the rising price of gas made their case for the project.
"At the end of the day, consumers are going to make a lot of pressure to have this gas flow to the lower 48," said Michael E. Phelps, president of WestCoast Energy Inc. WestCoast is working with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. to build a gas pipeline from Alaska to Alberta, where it would tie into existing lines south to the United States.
Some development has already begun, particularly in Alaska, where companies have been pumping oil from under Prudhoe Bay for more than two decades and sending it south through the Trans-Alaska pipeline.
Canada, too, has moved ahead. Chasing what Canadians call frontier gas, the first pipeline nosed "north of 60" in May. This small link, connecting gas fields in Fort Liard, Northwest Territories, to the continent's pipeline grid, crossed a psychological barrier, the 60th parallel, a line on maps that separates the settled southern provinces from frontier northern territories.
In Canada's first commercial gas development north of the Arctic Circle, Inuvik Gas Ltd. started pumping gas a year ago to houses in this town of 3,500 people on the Mackenzie River. The company is jointly owned by Enbridge Inc. and AltaGas Services Inc. of Calgary, Alberta, and the Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation. The Inuvialuit company is wholly owned by the Inuvialuit people, one of two main native groups in this corner of the Canadian Arctic. Their participation represents an about-face in native attitudes toward energy development here.
In the late 1970's, tribal chiefs up and down the Mackenzie River Valley spoke out against any gas or oil development and obtained a court-imposed 10-year moratorium that stopped work during the 1980's.
"We had no offices for our chiefs, no telephones," recalled Stephen Kakfwi, a member of the Dene tribe who fought the pipelines 25 years ago. "Of our people, 75 percent were trappers. They weren't involved in the process. We had no understanding of the way that the government of Canada worked. We had no business experience."
In the intervening years, the federal and territorial governments settled virtually all native land claims in the valley, giving tribes legal standing to negotiate rents and royalties. Today, tribes own drilling companies and negotiate exploration royalty payments with multinational companies. Mr. Kakfwi is now premier of the Northwest Territories.
In January, chiefs of all 30 tribes in the region unanimously approved a joint statement "to build a business partnership to maximize ownership and benefit of a Mackenzie Valley pipeline." Their representative, the Aboriginal Working Group, which is seeking a majority stake in a pipeline, has hired the aboriginal banking unit of the Bank of Montreal to secure job guarantees, job training, service contracts and rent payments from pipeline companies. In May, Mr. Kakfwi flew to Calgary, where he pitched the pipeline to the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.
"What has changed? We are now in control, the majority of the territorial legislature is aboriginal," Mr. Kakfwi said in Yellowknife, the territorial capital. "The nations have got their own land back. They have businesses. They have money."
With energy company engineers studying three possible routes from the Arctic Ocean to pipelines in Alberta, some environmentalists question spending billions of dollars to perpetuate North America's dependency on fossil fuels. They stress that Arctic gas would only feed United States needs for less than one decade.
"Drilling for new oil, or putting in natural gas pipelines, is not how we are going to get energy security," said Melanie Duchin, a member of Greenpeace. "Rather than opening up a fossil fuel frontier, such as trying to drill for these immense natural gas reserves, the money should go for developing renewable energy."
In the Canadian Arctic, however, Greenpeace has little credibility with aboriginal leaders. They say the group's anti-fur campaigns destroyed their traditional hunting and trapping economies.
"My people were Stone Age people 30 years ago," Mr. Kakfwi said. "We have embarked on a journey and we can't turn back. To say, 'You should be a happy little tree hugger, choking rabbits, while everyone else exploits your diamonds and gas' -- no, I don't think so."
In her office a block from Inuvik's stoplight, Nellie J. Cournoyea, chairman of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, dismissed environmentalists' objections. "If these people want to be useful, they should start cleaning up the south, stop the pollution that is damaging to the Arctic wildlife and environment," she said, referring to windborne soot and smog.
With northern native support solid and southern consumer support expected to solidify after this winter's home heating bills go out, the race is now on to to see who builds an Arctic gas pipeline first.
On Sept. 14, rival companies presented proposals in Washington for a pipeline through Alaska to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is run by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska. Forrest Hoglund, chairman of the Arctic Resources Company of Houston, said the multibillion-dollar race to build a gas line out of the Arctic was the 21st-century "equivalent of the first railroad to California."
Many Alaskans are eager to see a gas pipeline built because oil production on the North Slope near Prudhoe Bay dropped by half in the 1990's. As royalties dwindle, Alaskans face big tax increases in five years if there is no gas development.
"Alaska is extremely interested in getting the gas out," Mr. Koonce, the Exxon Mobil executive, said after testifying in Washington. "Frankly, we are, too."
Spokesmen for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said their respective candidates did not have positions on the pipeline proposals.
Proponents of an Alaskan route said they could start pumping gas south in six years. They said they could work so quickly because permits and an international regulatory framework have existed since the late 1970's to place a gas pipeline parallel to the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, and then east, along the Alaska-Canada Highway.
At the same time, improved telecommunications, high-speed mechanized welding and the use of rock saws to cut permafrost have combined to make pipeline building faster and cheaper than ever, said Mr. Phelps, the executive at WestCoast, one of the companies planning to build a line.
"The route using the Alaska pipeline and highway makes sense, because you are not dividing the wilderness any further; you are using existing corridors," said Charles M. Clusen, an Alaska policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group.
Executives at BP Amoco, one of the largest gas owners in Alaska, have said they expect to make a decision on building a gas pipeline by the middle of next year.
But the 1,700-mile Alaska-Yukon route, with a price tag around $8 billion, would leave the Canadian Arctic gas reserves stranded.
To link the two reserves, other companies have proposed a second, $3 billion pipeline up the Mackenzie River Valley and 300 miles west to Prudhoe, running 15 feet below the floor of the Arctic Ocean. In March, four major companies that own gas in the Canadian Arctic plan to release results of a feasibility study for a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.
Although this route could provide cheaper gas to consumers, environmentalists oppose a submerged line, saying it could endanger caribou and polar bear populations. Many Alaskans oppose a submarine pipeline because it would deprive their towns and cities of piped natural gas.

Correction of Data Shows Slightly Higher Inflation
The government said that a software error caused it to slightly underestimate inflation during the first eight months of the year. Revision of the data means somewhat higher payments for recipients of Social Security and other federal benefits.
And while economists said that the error, one-tenth of a percentage point, was not large enough to significantly alter their view of the nation's economy, it was nonetheless in the direction of faster inflation. Page C6. 

Northern Gas Pipelines Proposed
Energy companies, pipeline operators and Indian tribes expect to announce next spring plans to build one, and possibly two, subterranean pipelines to carry Arctic natural gas to North America's pipeline grid. A1.
 
Priceline Drops on Sales Forecast
Shares in the online retailer Priceline.com fell more than 40 percent after the company said its sales in the third quarter would be as much as 11 percent below forecasts. The company attributed the shortfall to slow sales of airline tickets -- its signature product, which still account for 87 percent of its sales. Shares of Priceline fell $7.89, to $10.75. C10.
 
Stocks Slump on Earnings Concern
Stock prices fell as investors continued to be concerned about third-quarter results. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 2.96 points, to 10,628.36. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 32.80 points, or 0.9 percent, to 3,656.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 of a point, to 1,426.57. C13.
 
Audit Firm's Inspections Criticized
In a report to be issued today, a professor contends that PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest factory-monitoring firm, does a shoddy job and overlooks many safety and wage violations in plants overseas. Pricewaterhouse disputed the conclusions. A12.
 
FleetBoston in Talks to Buy Summit
Summit Bancorp, the largest bank in New Jersey, is in talks to be acquired by FleetBoston Financial, executives close to the discussions said. Analysts estimated the bank could be sold for $7 billion. C6.
 
Sale of Global Crossing Unit Is Seen
In a move that would advance its lead in the business of storage and maintenance facilities for Web sites, Exodus Communications is close to acquiring the Web-hosting division of Global Crossing for about $6.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said. C10.
 
Interpublic Names a Coordinator
Bruce S. Nelson, an executive with experience in the account, creative and strategic realms of advertising, is being named to a new top post at Interpublic Group. Mr. Nelson will coordinate efforts to manage the increasingly diversified Interpublic units specializing in interactive and direct marketing, public relations, media services, research, programming and consulting as well as traditional advertising. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C12.
 
Judge Favors Release of Tire Data
A federal judge ruled that the public should have access to extensive information on tire technology that Firestone had to turn over during a lawsuit over a fatal accident. The company said releasing the documents would amount to giving up trade secrets. C2.
 
Air France Sues in Concorde Crash
Air France said that it had sued Continental Airlines because it believed a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 that fell onto a runway led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July. A5.
 
Government Still Has Economic Role
George W. Bush has made government a campaign issue, arguing that as president he would continue to tame Washington. But the oversimplified fear of big government has been damaging. The next president should realize that both business and government have vital roles. Jeff Madrick: Economic Scene. C2.

Soft-Money Spending Outstrips Campaigns' Own
Republican and Democratic Party organizations are far outspending both special interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in the presidential election. Political analysts say the trend is transforming the parties and their soft-money donors this year from supporting players into full partners in the advertising efforts. A1
 
The Gore campaign is raising millions for an obscure fund limited to paying for legal and accounting costs. But recent solicitation letters for the fund suggest a donation will help the campaign attack Republicans, causing some campaign finance experts and Bush aides to say the messages are misleading and run afoul of federal election law. A23
 
Vice President Al Gore challenged Gov. George W. Bush to agree to ban the use of unregulated party money on television and radio advertising for the rest of the presidential campaign. The night before, Mr. Bush told Larry King in a CNN interview that he was unlikely to agree to such a pact because he did not trust the Democrats to abide by it. A23

HEADLINE: Parents Say Censoring Films Is Their Job, Not Politicians'

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: WESTLAND, Mich., Sept. 27

 BODY:
Overwhelmed by the competing proposals in a tight presidential race, Michael Horst grabbed a sheet of paper during the evening news the other night and drew a line down the middle. He wrote "Gore" on the left, "Bush" on the right, and then rated the candidates' positions, drawing a plus sign in the Bush column next to capital punishment and a minus sign next to the Texas governor's education record.
But nowhere on his cheat sheet did Mr. Horst mention an issue that has been the focus of much moralizing on the campaign trail: sex and violence in movies and popular music, and on the Internet. 
 Though Mr. Horst, 39, said he had agonized over how his 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were being affected by the seepage of nudity and mayhem into what they watch and hear, he said he was not looking to politicians for answers. It was, he said, something he could best grapple with on his own, however imperfectly.
"I really don't feel anything they say on this is going to influence me one way or the other," said Mr. Horst, a theft prevention manager for the Rite Aid chain of drugstores. "What decision they make is not going to affect what my children see."
Mr. Horst's sentiments echoed through more than a dozen other interviews with parents of adolescents in Westland, a middle-class suburb of Detroit that, like the rest of Michigan, is considered to be a close call in the presidential race. Neither Republicans nor Democrats dominate here.
Westlanders supported President Clinton, a Democrat, in 1992 and 1996, and Gov. John Engler, a Republican, in 1994 and 1998, and nearly everyone interviewed said they had not decided whom they would vote for in November.
But as they shopped for milk at Kroger, ate ice cream at the Westland Mall, sat in the bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena or even waited for an adjustment at Shunkwiler Chiropractic, most parents agreed that it was their responsibility -- and not that of the president, Congress or even Hollywood -- to filter what reaches their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save their breath for the economy and health care.
Yet all the parents conceded that they sometimes blurred the borders they had drawn between acceptable and unacceptable content.
Jenny Palise, 44, a homemaker whose husband is a tool-and-die maker at the Ford plant in Rawnsonville, said she tried to shield her son Anthony, 12, from nudity and bad language in movies. But the other day, after skimming a review of "The Watcher" to gauge its appropriateness for her son, she decided to take him to see the film, which was rated R.
"I didn't know it was about a serial killer," Ms. Palise said, loading groceries into her customized van. "I thought it was about a stalker."
Though Ms. Palise regretted asking Anthony to come along, he was unfazed. "I fell asleep," he said.
That even the sturdiest dams erected by parents can occasionally spring holes was obvious as Phyllis Blackman shopped for gospel records at Record Town in the Westland Mall with her 16-year-old daughter, La Toya Hamilton. Ms. Blackman said she had a zero-tolerance policy against rap -- unless it was the feel-good rap of the Hollywood star Will Smith.
"She doesn't play the stupid stuff in the house," Ms. Blackman said.
But as La Toya sought out a compact disc by the gospel singer Yolanda Adams, an artist adored by both mother and daughter, La Toya said she also enjoyed the music of the slain rapper Tupac Shakur, which, she admitted, is layered with references to "sex, bad-mouthing of some females, violence and killing."
"I knew she had it," Ms. Blackman said. "It's not something she continues to listen to on a daily basis."
Similarly, Mr. Horst, the Rite Aid manager, said he "blew my cork" when he discovered that his 8-year-old son had seen an Austin Powers video, rated PG-13, at a friend's house.
"Everything with Austin Powers has a sexual connotation, and I got hit with a lot of questions an 8-year-old shouldn't be asking," Mr. Horst said, watching from a bench at the arena as the boy scrimmaged with his ice hockey team, the Westland Eagles.
And yet Mr. Horst said that he did not hesitate to let his son watch the explosion-laden "Terminator" movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and that he took the boy and his 11-year-old sister to see "Titanic."
"That had a moderately explicit scene," Mr. Horst said. "My daughter asked me, 'Dad, what are they doing?' I said, 'He's an artist; he's painting her; they're not actually doing any intimate acts.' "
Mr. Horst, a self-described conservative who is a registered Republican, and Ms. Palise and Ms. Blackman, both Democrats, said they considered themselves strict.
Almost none of those interviewed said they wanted Washington to censor Hollywood, or even Hollywood to censor itself.
The one pledge that they hoped Hollywood would make would be to swear off marketing violent fare directly to teenagers, the subject of a Congressional hearing today, and a Federal Trade Commission report earlier this month.
In speaking against more regulation of Hollywood, the parents repeatedly cited their belief in freedom of speech, and said they often enjoyed material that they would prefer their children not see.
Mark Obsniuk, 48, a mail carrier whose children are 12, 14 and 16, said that any effort by Washington to rein in Hollywood would be "a waste of time." As his youngest child, Jenna, twirled on the ice during a skating lesson, Mr. Obsniuk described how he and his wife, Debbie, an elementary school secretary, enjoyed watching programs like "The Sopranos," the bloody and often sexually charged mob drama on HBO. But he said that they were careful to change the channel whenever their children entered the room.
Having voted for George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, Mr. Obsniuk said he was undecided between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But he said that his assessment of the economy, and of which candidate presented the best chance for continued prosperity, would drive his thinking.
Sitting in the bleachers nearby, Kevin Beahon, 47, a quality control inspector at the Ford national parts depot in Livonia, said he was eminently qualified to screen what reaches the eyes and ears of his sons, 13 and 16, and his daughter, 7.
Mr. Beahon, a likely Bush voter who has barred his two younger children from watching adult-oriented cartoons like "The Simpsons" and "South Park," said he had gotten pretty good at navigating the music Web site Napster. When someone left a note on the front door for his 13-year-old son, Stephen, imploring him to "Get Your Roll On," Mr. Beahon was puzzled. Stephen told his dad that his friend was using the title of a song by a rap act called Big Tymers to urge him to get going to a party.
Mr. Beahon went straight to the Internet to retrieve the song, and after listening to its rapid-fire references to oral sex, male genitalia, adultery and prostitution, he concluded: "This is the crudest thing I've ever heard." Though he admits he cannot control what his son hears outside the home, he told the boy, "I don't want to ever hear that again."
Nonetheless, he added, "I don't think a president should be delving into that."
In a community where many residents work in the skilled trades or middle management at auto plants in surrounding communities, few of those interviewed said they recognized the name of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate.
And fewer still were aware that, among the candidates on the two national tickets, Mr. Lieberman has waged the loudest campaign against what he describes as Hollywood's shrinking mores.
"Tell me the name again, because I'm good with names and I'll be sure to remember it," said one undecided voter and parent, a saleswoman at a furniture store.
Another parent, Tracy Hart, 34, whose presidential vote see-sawed from Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat, in 1988, to George Bush in 1992 and then to President Clinton in 1996, was one of the few people interviewed here who lamented that the issue of sex and violence in Hollywood was "not one of the major issues on the forefront, in terms of the campaign."
As they loaded their car outside Kroger, her daughter, Hillary, 11, quickly corrected her mother, raising the name of Mr. Lieberman.
"Who's that?" asked Ms. Hart, a single mother who is an administrator at a physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic.
Her daughter, citing an article in the Time magazine spin-off "Time for Kids," responded: "He doesn't think kids should be able to go to R-rated movies and he thinks bad music is bad. He wants to do something about it."
Ms. Hart said, "Well, maybe we know who we're voting for now."

HEADLINE: In America;
Focus on Women

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The most extensive analysis of women's views in this campaign season has shown that as the economy has improved, American women have been taking a much closer look at the quality of their lives, and not liking a great deal that they see.
The new economy has bolstered the incomes of millions of families, but it has also exacerbated the sense of estrangement between the haves and have-nots, and has left many women with the feeling that they have less and less time to spend with their families and properly care for their children. 
 The analysis was drawn from a series of focus groups and a bipartisan national poll conducted for Lifetime Television and the Center for Policy Alternatives. The joint project was called Women's Voices 2000.
The findings suggest it won't be easy for politicians of either party to fashion a "women's message" because the women's vote is far from monolithic, and some of the issues of concern to large numbers of women are so tough and so complex they will require very creative solutions.
For example, two of the major issues of concern to poll respondents were the ever-tightening "time crunch" (more time at work, less time with family) and what was perceived by many respondents as a decline in the nation's moral values. The best way to reverse the decline in moral values, according to the poll, was for parents to spend more time with their children. But the ever-increasing demands of work have made that virtually impossible for most families.
According to the poll, 59 percent of women with children under 6 said they were finding it harder to balance the demands of work and family now than they did four years ago, when the last Women's Voices analysis was conducted. And 30 percent said it was "much harder."
The poll also found:
That a large majority of women -- 72 percent -- would like their health insurance to be independent of their employment. This was not even one of the issues the pollsters had intended to ask about, but it came up repeatedly in the focus groups that preceded the polling. Politicians should take notice.
That 93 percent of African-American women, 91 percent of Latinas, 90 percent of Asian-American women and 87 percent of white women said equal pay and benefits for women should be one of the top policy priorities in the United States.
That retirement is a major worry for many women. Some 85 percent of Democratic women and 77 percent of Republican women want pension benefits that can be transferred from one job to another.
That nearly half of all women -- 48 percent -- feel they will eventually be responsible for the care of a parent or other elderly person.
The polling appeared to show that, more than ever, class distinctions among women are being shaped by whether a woman is college-educated and married. Women who are neither are frequently in a woeful economic state.
"Unmarried women feel so much more economically marginal than married women," said Celinda Lake, who conducted the polling with Linda DiVall, Linda Williams and Anna Rivera.
At the same time, like men, women are finding a big economic divide between those who have a college education and those who do not. And the awareness of these distinctions is increasing, Ms. Lake said.
"Women are now more likely to say they are concerned about the growing divide between the rich and the poor," she said. "The new economy, the new prosperity, has made the class differences more dramatic, because while everyone agrees the economy is better and offers more opportunity, one side of America tends to feel it has benefited much more than the other half of America."
While these concerns do not all lend themselves to government solutions -- and some, like the time crunch, offer difficulties that approach the level of paradox -- there is a noticeable sense among women that government should try to do what it can.
The good times are seen as pretty good, not great. And many of the poll's respondents, with little in the way of savings and troubling memories of the job crunch of a few years ago, look to the future warily.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Man, 82, Is First Known West Nile Fatality in U.S. This Year

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
New Jersey officials announced yesterday that an 82-year-old Passaic County man died of the West Nile virus two weeks ago, the first person known to die of the disease in the United States this year.
Officials believe it is most likely that the man was bitten in August. He fell ill on Sept. 3, was admitted three days later to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, and died there on Sept. 14. 
 The diagnosis of West Nile was delayed while blood and tissue studies were conducted. The man had chronic illnesses as well, officials said.
At a news conference, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and other state officials did not name the man but said he had lived in Little Falls. He was identified as Anthony Opalka by the Herald News of West Paterson, The Associated Press reported last night.
In all, there have been four cases of West Nile in New Jersey this year.
"I don't know if I would call this an epidemic," Dr. Eddy A. Bresnitz, the deputy state commissioner of health, said yesterday at the news conference in Hackensack. "I think what we do have is an outbreak."
A 72-year-old woman from Bayonne also contracted the disease in the last few months, but she is already home recovering, officials said. The other human cases previously confirmed in New Jersey involved a 43-year-old man from Jersey City and a 54-year-old man who had homes in both Cliffside Park and Brooklyn, N.Y. Both men were hospitalized for treatment and are recovering.
Blood tests were performed on 18 other people in the state whose illnesses resembled West Nile, but the results are still pending.
In New York City, West Nile has been diagnosed this year in 13 people, including a 73-year-old woman from Queens who the city announced yesterday was hospitalized but recovering. Among the other cases, eight were treated and released and four remain hospitalized.
Scores of birds and other animals have contracted the disease this year, so many that many health care officials have been surprised that more human cases did not emerge. Explanations of why that could be range from crediting state prevention campaigns to musing about the weather: Did cold air keep people inside? Did the wet summer keep birds around so mosquitoes were drawn to them instead of to humans?
While state officials never like to have any cases in their areas, the New York region has fared far better than Israel, where 14 people have died of West Nile this year.
Last year, West Nile killed 7 people in the New York region and severely sickened 55 others.
Governor Whitman said yesterday that New Jersey would re-evaluate its West Nile control plan, which has included spraying insecticide to kill adult mosquitoes in every county. In Bergen County tomorrow, the state will spray between 3 and 6 a.m. in the Carlstadt, Wood-Ridge, Franklin Lakes and Mahwah areas.
"Obviously, this is a disease that's going to be with us for some time," Mrs. Whitman said. "And I intend after this season is over to ask the relevant cabinet members, including the secretary of commerce and economic growth, the secretary of agriculture, the commissioner of health and senior services, to get together and to reassess everything that we have done."
Insecticides have been sprayed this year in all five New York City boroughs and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, on Long Island and in Connecticut and New Jersey, though not always to the satisfaction of New York City officials. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had complained earlier this year that northern New Jersey and Nassau County were endangering public health by not spraying aggressively enough.

To the Editor:
As an underpaid holder of a Ph.D. in philosophy, I empathize with Ann L. Berrios's discontent ("No Wealth of Opportunity," Op-Ed, Sept. 25). Our common plight points up the downside of America's free-market economy. 
 Those who are either unable or unwilling to enhance a company's bottom line, even if highly educated, are bound to find themselves less affluent than those with marketable skills.
The academic institutions at which someone with a liberal arts education used to be able to earn a good living are now themselves driven by the profit motive, hiring more and more part-time teachers and financially rewarding only those "scholars" whose work has market value. Is it any wonder, then, that intellectuals tend to favor socialism?

To the Editor:
Re "No Wealth of Opportunity," by Ann L. Berrios (Op-Ed, Sept. 25): 
 I can commiserate with Ms. Berrios blow by blow. I live in Evanston, on the exclusive North Shore of Lake Michigan. My husband and I own a portion of a modest four-room, two-bedroom condo (the bank owns the rest, of course). Because of the decision we made that I stay home with our small children, we do not have any of the "extras" that our children's schoolmates seem to take for granted.
My husband and I are generally happy with our life, and we realize that our standard of living is high compared with the worldwide average. But now that our children are becoming more aware of peer and societal pressure and values, we are pressured, and more and more squeezed into the North Shore mold. We, too, sometimes ask, If the wealth of opportunity is so evident to everyone else, why aren't we feeling it?

MANHATTAN: SCOOTER SAFETY PROPOSAL
A City Council bill introduced yesterday would require all children under 14 to wear helmets while using scooters in New York City. The bill was drafted in response to the recent death of a 6-year-old New Jersey boy struck by a car while using a scooter. (Proposals have been made in New Jersey for a similar law.) Violators would pay a $50 fine. The bill would also require the distribution of pamphlets on scooter safety. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT) 

COMMACK: STATE TO BE SUED IN KILLINGS
The family of a victim of Michael J. Swango, left, the former doctor who pleaded guilty to killing three Long Island men while at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, has taken the first step toward suing New York State. This month, Mr. Swango said he killed Thomas Sammarco, 73; George Siano, 60; and Aldo Serini, 62, while a resident at the medical center. Mr. Siano's family filed a notice of claim against New York, and the families of the other victims said they intended to join the suit. All three families plan to sue Ohio as well, for what they charge was a lax investigation of Mr. Swango when he was under suspicion of killing two patients in 1984 as an intern at Ohio State University Hospital. Tina Kelley (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: McCALL BACKS DEBT PLAN
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday that he had decided to ask voters to support a $3.8 billion transportation borrowing act, which will be the largest sale of state bonds in American history if it is approved in November. Mr. McCall, a critic of the state's reliance on borrowing, said the projects the bond act would help finance, including engineering work for the Second Avenue subway line, were needed to ensure that New York remained "economically competitive." But he said he was less than enthusiastic because New York was continuing to borrow "with no concern for our mounting debt load." Randy Kennedy (NYT)1
 
MANHATTAN: TAXI PASSENGER KILLED
A taxi passenger was killed around 12:30 a.m. yesterday when a car struck the cab on the Upper East Side, the police said. The passenger, Paul Sheridan, 29, died at the scene. Michael Glaubman, 42, was charged with manslaughter and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The police said Mr. Glaubman's car was headed north on Madison Avenue and the cab, driven by Joseph Brecevs, 37, was headed east on 82nd Street. Mr. Brecevs was in stable condition at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center. Elissa Gootman (NYT)
 
THE BRONX: WOMAN ATTACKED
A 24-year-old woman was raped at gunpoint yesterday morning in Bronx Park, near the New York Botanical Garden, by a man who was later arrested, the police said. The woman was in the sliver of park that lies east of the Bronx River Parkway at 9:30 a.m. when the man, Miguel Camacho, 24, attacked her, the authorities said. Mr. Camacho, of Morris Avenue in the Bronx, was arrested last night after a daylong search. He was charged with rape and weapons possession, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. Andy Newman (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: GARAGE LACKED BARRIERS
There were no protective concrete wheel blocks at the Virginia Beach, Va., parking deck where four New York nurses were killed when their car crashed through a rooftop cinderblock wall and fell 41 feet. The Sandcastle Resort Motel garage was built in 1985, and officials were investigating whether codes that applied to the building required wheel guards. (AP)
 
FARMINGVILLE: 64 CHARGED WITH LEWDNESS
The Suffolk County police said yesterday that they had arrested 64 men over three weeks and charged them with public lewdness. Most of the men had been engaging in sexual activities at the Vietnam Memorial here. Several veterans and other visitors to the park, on County Road 83, complained to the police, who conducted an undercover operation from Sept. 2 to 22. Those arrested included a New York City schoolteacher and an assistant football coach at Bellport High School, the police said.

BROOKLYN: CONEY ISLAND GANG ARRESTS
The authorities announced yesterday that 14 members of a Coney Island street gang had been arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, assault, robbery and drug dealing in and around the Marlboro Houses, a public housing project in southern Brooklyn. Known as "the Cream Team," the gang name is an acronym for Cash Rules Everything Around Me. Prosecutors said the gang was particularly violent, typically beating their victims, robbing them and stripping them of their clothes. Alan Feuer (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
PARSIPPANY: FEDERAL CUTOFF THREATENED
The federal government has threatened to cut off funds to New Jersey for the operation of Greystone Psychiatric Hospital by Oct. 12 because of what the government calls inadequate staffing. The funds, which are reimbursements to the state for the treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients and the uninsured, totaled $42 million last year, or much of the hospital's $50 million budget. The State Department of Human Services, which runs Greystone, said it had hired 99 new nurses, technicians and other staff members, and had moved 43 of Greystone's 615 patients. Steve Strunsky (NYT)
 
WYCKOFF: MORE JAIL IN INFANT'S DEATH
Brian C. Peterson, who served 18 months of a two-year prison sentence after he and his girlfriend pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter in the death of their newborn son in 1996 in Delaware, may be sent back to jail after being arrested Tuesday night at Shea Stadium. As he and a friend, Raymond Maniaci, watched a Mets game, according to the police, Mr. Maniaci tossed a partly filled bottle at John Rocker, the outspoken relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves. As officers led Mr. Maniaci away, Mr. Peterson interfered, the police said, yelling, swearing and flailing his arms. Probation officials in Delaware, where the infant's death occurred, said that Mr. Peterson's future would depend on the outcome of the new case. Robert Hanley (NYT)

NORWICH: UKRAINE SHIP FINDS HOME
Local officials are preparing to welcome the Ukrainian tall ship Bat'kivshchyna as it docks for the winter. The ship's captain, Dmytro Biriukovich, met with officials on Tuesday to cement a deal that will give the boat a free berth and utilities until it departs for tall ship festivities in the Great Lakes next spring. The ship, which persevered through numerous adversities on the way to the OpSail 2000 celebration in the summer, is in New London awaiting dry-dock space for repairs. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
A Devotion To Japanese Art Is Requited

BYLINE: By Suzanne Charle

 BODY:
Rene Scholten came to love Japanese art through a circuitous route. On a trip to Japan while working as a software consultant, Mr. Scholten, who is Dutch, purchased an inexpensive woodblock print. Then he saw a fine 1929 print by Torii Kotondo of a beautiful woman applying powder. Completely seduced, he bought it.
When an art dealer friend said he wanted to quit, Mr. Scholten took over his shop in The Hague. Business expanded, and so did the gallery; Mr. Scholten left his high-tech life and became a partner in Hotei Publishing, expanding its list of books on Japanese art. 
 His most recent venture is Scholten Japanese Art in Manhattan, which he opened two weeks ago with the help of two respected experts, Katherine Martin and Rosemary Bandini. Its first show focuses on the art of the Edo period in Japan (1603 to 1867). Intricate netsuke, the fanciful toggles that delighted the Japanese gentry for whom they were carved, are suspended in illuminated plastic cubes, as are shimmering lacquer boxes, better suited to holding admiration and wonder than more substantial stuff. On the walls are prints by some of the great masters: Suzuki Harunobu, Katsukawa Shuncho, Kitagawa Utamaro and Utagawa Hiroshige. Mr. Scholten spent $10 million to convert three floors of the town house at 63 East 66th Street, and it shows.
Woodblock prints known as ukiyo-e have been the portal into Japanese art for many Westerners, including Monet, whose collection can be seen at his home-museum in Giverny, and van Gogh, who copied two of Hiroshige's prints, most famously "Ohashi Bridge." The fragile colored prints were also favorites of Frank Lloyd Wright; an exhibition of his collection and his architecture in Japan will be at the Japan Society in March. The allure has not faded. A recent woodblock show at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco drew more than 80,000 visitors. "They have an immense following," said its director, Emily Sano.
"Not everyone can collect Monet, but they can collect prints," said Ms. Martin, the Scholten gallery's managing director. "Here are artists at a turning point. They are creating totally new abstract images, taking proportion and perspective and color and playing with them."
The prints lead the viewer into the floating world ukiyo, a Buddhist concept for the sad and transitory nature of the material world. Edo artists transformed the idea into the transitory world of pleasure, a demimonde of geisha and parties, actors and theater.
The high-flying Edo era was a boom period. Like present-day New York, Edo (now Tokyo) was the center of commerce and trade. Merchants flush with money from a new economy sought to spend it on pleasure and more pleasure. Ukiyo-e put the spotlight on this self-indulgent, glamorous world, immortalizing the day's most sought-after courtesans, the season's most popular Kabuki actors. "The beauties were Edo's supermodels, the actors its rock stars," Ms. Martin said. "The prints were the Edo period's color TV."
The prints were major productions. Publishers hired artists who drew images that were then carved into wood blocks (sometimes a dozen or more for one print) by a master engraver. The blocks were given to a printer who worked under the publisher and the artist.
Although publicly scorned by the higher caste samurai, the burgeoning merchant class collected the prints as passionately as later generations would collect posters and baseball cards. Some artists became almost as famous as their subjects. Utamaro, who worked at the end of the 18th century, was the Richard Avedon of Edo. Known for his innovative close-ups of the beauties of the day, he at once idealized them and captured, through simple elegant lines, their emotions and personalities. (His "Mirror of Courtesans of the Green Houses" is for sale at Scholten for $25,000.)
"There were thousands of images and varying levels of prints, ranging from cheap ephemera to mica-ground prints for the wealthy," said Sebastian Izzard, a dealer who has just opened a new space at 42 East 76th Street, Manhattan. Many were lost to fire or ruined by water. In the Meiji period, when the Japanese turned their eyes to the West, some were actually used for packing."We have no real idea of how many have survived," said Mr. Izzard, who worked at Christie's for 17 years. "What we do know is that there are many 'sleeping prints' stored away. Whenever a fine 'unique' print is sold for a high price at auction, another surfaces."
One of Scholten's aims is to make the gallery a focus for Japanese art: a library on the third floor will be open to students, scholars and collectors, and Ms. Martin plans a series of lectures next year. (Information and appointments: 212-585-0474.) "We want to develop collectors," Mr. Scholten said. "And you can only really do that through a gallery."
George Mann, a collector from Chicago, agreed: "It's one thing to see a print on a wall at a museum, and quite another to hold it and examine it. An even larger barrier is psychological. You can't own a museum print. A print in a gallery is much more seductive."
The novice has much to learn. A print of the famed Ohashi bridge by Hiroshige can sell for anywhere from several hundred dollars to tens of thousands. In a recent auction at Christie's an early impression went for $52,875; at Scholten, another fine impression costs $75,000. At issue is the quality and condition of the print. Often an early edition will command the highest price: the artist was there supervising the printer, making sure the proper colors were used. In later editions, when the artist was off creating new images, a printer might take shortcuts, using less expensive pigments.
But the first impression does not always command the highest price. Sometimes a coterie of patrons commissioned a deluxe edition printed on special paper with special pigments. Or the publisher or artist decided to edit the print to make it more salable or attractive. The first prints of Hiroshige's "Ohashi," for example, are sometimes known as "Two Boats"; in later editions two boats in the background were etched out to make the print more aesthetically appealing. Popular works could be printed and reprinted until the block became so worn that the impressions were virtually unreadable. The title of Hiroshige's series "100 Views of Edo" was actually changed to "100 Views of Tokyo." "The name of the city changed in 1868, 10 years after the print was made," Mr. Izzard said. "The condition of the blocks had to be pretty rough."
The prints are as ephemeral as their subjects, soon fading in direct light. Improperly stored, they become food for worms and insects. Today most serious collectors keep prints in acid-free paper in boxes, taking them out to look at or to hang on a wall, for only a brief time, behind protective glass.
Prices for ukiyo-e are driven by fashion, just as they were in the Edo period. Although a popular image in excellent condition would be out of reach for most (an actor print by Sharaku just sold at Christie's for $280,000), there are still many prints in fine condition available for as little as $3,000 or $4,000. "You might not be able to afford a fine print of 'Ohashi,' " Ms. Martin said. "But there are excellent prints from the same series that you could buy for $3,000. The market, today as in the past, is driven by changing tastes."

Two 'Enemies' Who Make Music By Playing Each Other So Hard

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
BACK in Norway, they heard about the victory tour, the commercials, the sponsorships, when the United States won the Women's World Cup in 1999.
"The United States has more money," said Silje Joergensen, who plays defense for Norway. "They are rich." 
 The Norwegian players did not sulk about losing to the Americans as they went back to their jobs, playing for local clubs for a few extra kroner. The countries are different. The cultures are different. The economies are different.
And besides, the Norwegians have been known to beat the United States more than occasionally -- and even ticked off the Yanks with a choreographed choo-choo train celebration after winning in their semifinal of the 1995 World Cup in Sweden.
"Archenemies" is the word Tiffeny Milbrett once used to describe the Norwegians, although last night the effervescent Milbrett was saying, "Gosh, you've got to give them credit."

 
 Hearing word of the way corporate and hometown America fell for the women last summer, the Norwegians could only remind themselves that their time would come around again.
It arrived in the final of the Summer Games last night when Norway outlasted the United States, 3-2, in sudden death. Norway is the only nation to hold an advantage over the Americans, 15 victories to 13 losses with 2 ties.
"Money is not everything," Joergensen said. "We showed that tonight."
The two old rivals, who have been storing up bruises and cuts, grudges and resentments, in the decade and a half of this sport in the Olympics, staged a classic game, as good as sport gets. The United States tied the game in the dying seconds of regulation time, and then Norway clutched the victory in the 12th minute of overtime.
The leaping header by the 5-foot-2-inch Milbrett was as stunning as Mookie Wilson's eccentric at-bat in the 1986 World Series. And the stunning overtime goal was as dramatic as Bill Mazeroski's home run that ended the seventh game of the 1960 World Series -- and more controversial because it involved a potential hand ball by a Norwegian forward.
Fans will debate how Hege Riise's perfect lofting pass was touched by Joy Fawcett and then bounced onto the chest/shoulder/upper arm of Norway's Dagny Mellgren, who lashed a grass-cutter under the fingers of Siri Mullinix.
The referee, Sonia Denoncourt of Canada, showed common sense in deciding that Mellgren had not blatantly positioned her upper arm to control the ball.
Would the call have gone that way in the jingoistic confines of the Rose Bowl in 1999? The Yanks got the benefit of the doubt when goalkeeper Briana Scurry leaped forward -- in violation of the rule -- to smother a Chinese penalty kick. Last night, Norway won on neutral turf, with many Norwegians sprouting Viking horns and painting their faces red.
These Americans and the Norwegians have become the Fraziers and the Alis of women's sport. When they become grumpy old women, they will still remember the mutual testiness.
In 1991 the Yanks beat Norway, 2-1, in China to win the first World Cup. In 1995 the Yanks were offended when the Norwegians crawled around the field clutching the ankles of the players in front of them. And the Norwegians were not thrilled when the Yanks beat them, 2-1, in overtime in the semifinals of the 1996 Summer Games in Athens, Ga. But they usually come back.
The two nations have produced the greatest offensive and defensive players in the history of the sport, Michelle Akers and Linda Medalen, the latter a detective who treated the Americans like suspected perps.
Without them, the legend grows. Gro Espeseth, Norway's defender, who missed the 1999 World Cup because of knee surgery, was back last night, scoring on a header off the desperate flying foot of Shannon MacMillan. That goal gave the Norwegians a reprieve at 1-1.
"I think we wanted it more," said Marianne Pettersen of Norway.
Milbrett conceded that the Yanks have a problem when they play Norway.
"With every other team, we play the way we want, but they know how to beat us," Milbrett said. "We just played the best game of the tournament, and we're going home with a silver medal."
The Americans are also going home to a professional league that begins next April. And, yes, the Norwegians have heard about the chunk of change being spent.
"I play soccer because I love it," said Joergensen, who is attending college to learn to teach retarded children. "I would love to play soccer for money. I would go to the United States to play in that league."
She would be welcome. And she would be gracious enough to not mention the status of the Norwegian-American rivalry, at least not very often.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
A Community Created By a Builder's Tenacity

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
John Ciardullo is planning to build himself a new home on Rock Shelter Road in the northern Westchester hamlet of Waccabuc, and why not? He carved the road itself out of rocky wooded terrain, designed, engineered and built all the 7 houses on it, and will do the 14 yet to come. 
 "I'm creating a community," he said during a recent visit, "so why not live in it?"
The community, set amid the rolling countryside, horse trails and estates of Waccabuc, an affluent hamlet in the town of Lewisboro, might have never been built had it not been for the tenacity of Mr. Ciardullo, whose projects in the New York City area have included public schools and parks, luxury high-rise apartments, low-income housing in the South Bronx and a refurbishing of the Algonquin Hotel. The story of his development and his singlemindedness shows the difficulties that developers can face in some areas even with comparatively small projects.
In 1985, Mr. Ciardullo bought a 100-acre parcel of land for $900,000 and an adjoining 7-acre lot for $120,000, and then spent the next 11 years filing, revising and refiling plans to prove that he would meet the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act and other state and local regulations.
Among the agencies with jurisdiction over his project were the Lewisboro Planning and Town Boards; the Westchester County Health Department; the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, because the property is part of the city's watershed; and the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The process was complicated because his acreage contained wetlands.
"I had to submit documents on the effect of the development on the topography, on the vegetation, on the wetlands, on endangered wildlife," Mr. Ciardullo said. "We had to do an archaeological study to see if anyone had ever lived there before, and we found a cave on the property that dates back 4,000 years -- which gave us the idea for the name of the street. I also had to put in a salamander crossing -- and salamanders aren't even endangered."
Though getting approval for a subdivision is usually a lengthy procedure, "the amount of time it took is extraordinary," said Adam Wekstein, a land-use lawyer who represented Mr. Ciardullo during the last three years of the process.
Once the hurdles were cleared, and Mr. Ciardullo had sunk $5 million more into the venture, he began to put in the road and build a model house.
Though he intended to offer only custom homes tailored to the individual preferences of the buyers, he has built several houses on speculation as models and then sold them. "People have no imagination," Mr. Ciardullo said, "no ability to visualize what it will look like unless they can see something."
The first spec house was sold two years ago for $250,000 less than it had cost him to put up, he said. "We gave it away for $1.3 million because though people were interested, no one wanted to be the pioneer in a new subdivision," he said. "People didn't know if we would survive. And no one knew the economy was about to boom."
Today, with six more houses completed and sold, two under construction and three on the drawing board, he is not giving anything away. Prices, which are agreed upon before any job begins, have risen with each house, to $2.4 million in the latest agreement.
"The buyers, generally people in their 20's and 30's, have been mostly people in the financial industries," he said. "Doctors can't afford these houses anymore."
Three of the buyers have been content to buy spec houses rather than ones in which they had any input.
"My husband wanted a new house, I wanted something older and this made us both happy," said Amanda Brown, who now lives in one of the houses that was built on speculation. "And," she added, "it had so many things we wanted we didn't feel the need to personalize."
Though he considers himself a modernist, Mr. Ciardullo has limited the Rock Shelter Road houses, replete with such details as Palladian windows, elaborate door casings and porticos, to classic Colonial style (albeit with the most current luxury appliances). "Modern houses don't sell today," he said. "Everyone wants Colonial so we give them an exact replica with all the modern accouterments."
Rambling in size from 6,700 to 7,400 square feet, they all combine formality (in living and dining rooms) with informality (large kitchens that flow into family rooms) and include vaulted ceilings, colonnades, expensive tile work and thick moldings. One of the spec houses had closets that were so large that the buyers turned two of them into children's bedrooms.
Set on four-acre lots, the houses are built into terrain that is sloping, densely wooded and clearly a construction challenge. "I like to figure out how to enhance land, not destroy it," Mr. Ciardullo said. He has put in stone walls along all the road and in other places within the property and incorporated the numerous outcroppings into the landscaping. For one of the houses under construction, he said, he had to blast 3,700 cubic yards of rock.
Because he is a one-man band, doing everything from laying out septic systems to helping clients decide on the depth of their Jacuzzis, Mr. Ciardullo gets to know his clients well. And when the job is done, he said, "you get me as a friend for all time."

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Creates Fund Tied to Internet Index

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Beginning today, investors will be able to tie their money to picks made in part by one of the most influential Wall Street analysts following the Internet.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is introducing an investment fund that will track the Morgan Stanley Internet index, whose 29 stocks are chosen by Mary Meeker and other analysts at Morgan Stanley. 
 Ms. Meeker has been called Queen of the Net by Barron's and was the subject of a long profile in The New Yorker last year. Her firm was the lead underwriter for such pioneering initial public offerings as Netscape.
Now Morgan Stanley is using Ms. Meeker to promote its new Internet fund -- she is scheduled to appear at a news conference today promoting the product, which will be the first investment fund for retail investors that has a tie to her research.
This year, of course, being Queen of the Net is not the most exalted perch. Internet stocks took a drubbing in April and have yet to recover. Since its introduction on March 24, the Morgan Internet index has fallen 48.4 percent. Ms. Meeker declined to comment, and Morgan officials refused to speak on the record. But they say that the index is a better gauge of the Internet industry compared with the dozens of other Internet indexes that have preceded them.
Ironically, as the market for Internet stocks has slumped this year, Internet stock indexes continue to proliferate, as do investment funds created to buy only Internet stocks. Because of regulatory bureaucracy and the investment industry's sometimes sluggish pace, new funds created to invest in hot market trends often arrive just in time to find that the hot investment trend has grown ice cold.
Two years ago, three mutual funds invested exclusively in Internet stocks. Today, there are more than 40 of various types.
"Is there room for more? My inclination is probably not," said Donald Cassidy, senior research analyst at the fund tracking firm Lipper. "The Morgan Stanley name will help. The fact that she'd talk it up will help. But, gee, this isn't the first one."
The StreetTracks Morgan Stanley Internet Index Fund, as the new fund is called, is an exchange-traded fund, a mutual-fund-like product that trades like a stock. The index is run in conjunction with the American Stock Exchange, which uses Morgan Stanley's research and its lists of recommended stocks to compile and alter the index, in which each stock is rebalanced with an equal weighting every quarter. The fund will be run by State Street Global Advisers, an investment firm in Boston that is introducing six other exchange-traded funds today. The Internet fund will have a 0.50 percent expense ratio -- the annual fee deducted in daily increments from mutual and exchange-traded funds.
"There might be interest because it's Mary Meeker, but there's no shortage of Internet investing options," said James Atkinson, president of an Internet investment company called Maxfunds.com. "This is a very late entrant into this field."
Mr. Atkinson helped create the first Internet index fund last July, when he was the top domestic mutual fund executive at Investec Asset Management, based in London. Investec's fund tracks an index maintained by Internet.com, a Web publishing company. Since then, funds have been introduced that track Internet indexes created by Dow Jones; Goldman, Sachs; and several firms with less familiar names.
"It's interesting how new funds are created," Mr. Cassidy said. "Somebody makes a marketing decision that's usually made in a favorable time. Then you take two, three, four months, whatever the process is in the particular house, before it finally trades. By then the market might be quite different."
Compared with last year, the market is quite different. The average Internet mutual fund has fallen 22.9 percent this year, according to the fund tracking firm Morningstar. Some have lost 40 percent to 50 percent. The optimist would call it a buying opportunity; the pessimist would call it a dark hole to jump into.
Diane Garnick, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows exchange-traded funds, said the Morgan fund would be a breed apart from existing Internet funds, a hybrid falling in between traditional index funds that try to represent the market or different sectors, and actively managed mutual funds, where stock pickers try to beat the market.
"You could say it is a giant leap forward toward actively managed E.T.F.'s," Ms. Garnick said. Because of the regulatory restrictions of a fund that trades throughout the day like a stock, all exchange-traded funds are index funds. Most prominent stock indexes, like those run by Standard & Poor's or Dow Jones, are compiled by a committee of economists trying to represent a market sector. Ms. Garnick thinks Ms. Meeker and the other Morgan analysts would add a different kind of selectivity to the process.
"Analysts know better the prospects of the companies," she said, and would go beyond merely trying to represent the Net industry and try to pick "the best companies."

HEADLINE: Mexican Chief to Promote Trade in Europe

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Bolstering his image as Mexico's free trade salesman, President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada promised today to carry his economic vision to Europe, where, he said, a new accord has the potential to be another Nafta.
Mr. Fox, who is to leave on Saturday for a five-nation tour of the European Union, called the free-trade agreement signed in July with the European Union a huge opportunity. The weeklong trip will take Mr. Fox to France, England, Spain, Germany and Belgium. 
 Mr. Fox compared the European accord to the adoption of Nafta in 1994, which he said has created thousands of jobs and generated $10 billion in direct foreign investment in Mexico. "With these figures," he said, "we can only imagine what we can do with Europe. Perhaps, it's not even too much to think that this could lower the trade balance between European countries and Mexico and become something as big and powerful as the North American Free Trade Agreement."
The new pact could make Mexico less dependent on the United States, the destination for 88 percent of its exports last year. Trade between Mexico and the United States has soared under Nafta, to $225.9 billion last year from $88.1 billion in 1993.
Mr. Fox said he would also present proposals to resolve the conflict with Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico, another priority for European leaders.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ENERGY ISSUE;
Supply vs. Demand Ideas Separate Gore and Bush

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
With oil prices up, consumers agitated and the winter heating season looming, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are going at it on energy policy, seeking to draw sharp distinctions over an issue on which both candidates have political vulnerabilities.
It is a topic that the two parties see as touching consumers every time they fill up at the pump or adjust their thermostats, and one that is inextricably linked to broader environmental, foreign policy and economic issues. 
 Mr. Gore forced the topic back onto the campaign agenda last week with his call, acceded to by President Clinton, for the government to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to head off shortages of home heating oil -- an action that both the president and the vice president had opposed earlier in the year. Mr. Bush, who criticized the decision as a political ploy to drive down prices just ahead of Election Day, is scheduled to discuss energy policy in a speech on Friday.
The most basic question facing the country on energy is how to keep supply and demand in line. Mr. Bush, like most Republicans, emphasized finding new oil and ensuring a flow from other oil-producing nations. Mr. Gore, like many Democrats, focuses on trying to use less energy, or at least on using existing energy supplies as efficiently as possible.
"In very simple terms, the Republicans would approach an energy problem from the supply side: 'What can we do to increase supply?' " said Robert E. Ebel, director of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The Democrats would say: "What can we do to make better use of what we've got?' "
There are a number of other clearly defined differences between them. Mr. Gore sees global warming as a serious threat, and strongly backs an international agreement reached three years ago in Kyoto, Japan, which calls for substantial reductions in emissions of industrial gases from burning coal, oil, wood and natural gas. Mr. Bush acknowledges that global warming is a potential problem, but says the Kyoto agreement would be too costly to the United States and would not ensure that developing countries do their part.
Mr. Bush, who worked for years in the oil industry and whose running mate, Dick Cheney, ran an oil field services company, supports opening some environmentally sensitive areas, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, to oil exploration and production. Mr. Gore opposes such steps.
Mr. Gore, who has long said he is willing to pay a political price for his environmental principles, has suggested that the United States needs to take drastic steps, like eliminating the internal combustion engine, a goal that is widely mocked by Republicans.
In an effort to encourage conservation, Mr. Gore has also supported higher taxes on energy consumption, including a broad-based energy tax proposed by the Clinton administration in 1993 but never adopted, and a 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax, which became law in 1993 over the objection of every Republican in Congress.
In some ways, the two candidates are not as far apart as they seem. For all his focus on reducing demand, Mr. Gore has supported limited expansion of domestic exploration and production, including in the Gulf of Mexico and on federal land. Mr. Bush backs policies that promote conservation and energy efficiency.
Although Mr. Gore would rely more heavily on a government role than Mr. Bush, both candidates see the market as the most powerful force for addressing energy problems. Both generally support the deregulation of the electric power industry to allow power producers to compete in serving consumers.
In their own way, both of them have had to manage balancing acts.
Mr. Gore's general philosophy, and some of the specific positions he has taken over the years, are based in part on the idea that higher oil prices could be a good thing in holding down consumption and encouraging conservation and use of alternative energy sources.
Yet Mr. Gore has also sought to portray himself as defender of the consumer against higher gasoline and heating costs. During the summer, he called for a federal investigation into whether oil companies were unfairly jacking up gasoline prices. And with winter looming and crude oil prices rising, he tried to pre-empt a possible spike in home heating oil prices with his call last week for release of supplies from the reserve.
"Gore is right that there is vast potential for alternative technologies and fuels," said Pietro S. Nivola, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning research organization. "But every time we try to manipulate or depress the price of oil, we put off the day when some of these innovations come online."
Mr. Bush has said the surge in oil prices this year has resulted from what he says is the Clinton-Gore administration's ineptitude in dealing with the oil-producing nations of the Middle East and on its failure to promote new oil production and modernization of power plants, pipelines and refineries at home.
But his own close ties to the oil industry and problems with air quality in Texas have sometimes left him on the defensive, and his choice of Mr. Cheney as a running mate only exacerbated the problem. And while Mr. Bush's advisers say his criticism of Mr. Gore for tapping the nation's oil reserves makes the vice president look like a crass panderer, it is unclear whether voters will appreciate that kind of principle more than immediate action to help them deal with surging prices.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, told reporters this week that energy was the "best issue" for the Texas governor in the campaign right now.
Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Bush's policy prescriptions would center on promoting more domestic exploration and production of oil, speeding the process of granting permits for new refineries, power plants and pipelines, more active diplomatic efforts to persuade oil producing nations to keep oil prices stable and at reasonable levels and a greater emphasis on working with Western Hemisphere oil producers, especially Mexico.
Mr. Bush would also work with industry to promote conservation and efficiency through innovations like time-of-day pricing, under which energy users would pay more at peak hours of demand, Mr. Lindsey said.
"Eight years of neglect cannot be made up overnight," Mr. Lindsey said. "It's going to take a lot of years of work on our part to rectify the problems that have accumulated."
In a series of speeches this year, Mr. Gore set out a list of energy initiatives. He relies heavily on tax credits -- for the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles and homes, use of low-polluting fuels and solar power, investment by business in energy efficient equipment and for production of electricity from renewable and alternative fuel sources.
But the core of his message is that developing efficiency-enhancing products and cleaner sources of energy is not an economic burden but an opportunity that can create jobs and profits for the United States.
His plan, Mr. Gore said at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania last week, would "create millions of new jobs by getting out in front of the market for these new boilers and new furnaces and new cars and trucks and buses and revamped power plants and new technologies that help us to conserve more energy."
What neither candidate is saying explicitly is that the best policy in the long run, according to some analysts, may be to promote prices that are substantially below the nearly $38 a barrel level that crude oil hit briefly last week before declining to around $30 today, but well above the $12 level that made gasoline so cheap two years ago.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged as much this week. He told reporters on Wednesday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' target range of $22 to $28 a barrel was "reasonable," but that he did not want to see prices "go back down to $13 or $12 or $10 again because that was also disruptive."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
OPEC's Unity Is Undercut By the Saudis

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 28

 BODY:
A display of unity by OPEC heads of state at the conclusion of their summit meeting today was undercut by the leading oil producer Saudi Arabia, which caused a sell-off in the petroleum market with a unilateral pledge to pump more crude to weaken prices that have recently hit 10-year highs.
The price of light crude oil, the benchmark grade in the United States, tumbled nearly 4 percent, to $30.34 a barrel and is now nearly 20 percent below the peak of $37.80 a barrel reached last week. 
 "The kingdom is willing and ready to offer the amount necessary to stabilize the world oil market," the Saudi crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, declared to other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at their meeting here. "We are worried today by the increase in oil prices, which if continued permanently could lead to a negative impact on the world economy."
Whether the Saudi pledge has a longer-term impact on the price of oil remains unclear. But Saudi Arabia holds the biggest reserves among the 11 OPEC members -- and the greatest ability to influence the direction of prices.
An underlying cause of the run-up in oil prices, which have tripled during the last 18 months, was a production cutback agreement that Ali Rodriguez Araque, Venezuela's minister of energy and now the president of OPEC, negotiated early last year with Saudi Arabia and Mexico. But the Saudi statement suggested that the three nation's singleness of purpose may now be fraying.
There were other indications today that the solidarity was weakening. Mexico's energy minister, Luis Tellez, whose country is a major oil exporter but not an OPEC member, called for world producers to cooperate to keep prices at what he called acceptable levels. Speaking in Mexico City, Mr. Tellez said he expected prices to stabilize eventually around $30 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia's pledge contrasted with the tone of the OPEC summit meeting's host, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who has said the cartel is not to blame for the oil inflation that has caused alarm and protests in the main industrialized consumer countries.
The Saudi pledge also overshadowed a call by the OPEC heads of state for a "constructive dialogue" with the industrialized countries to stabilize oil prices.
"OPEC is willing to dialogue at all levels" of government and "with all the countries and regions of the world," Mr. Chavez said in his closing speech this afternoon. But oil prices, he added later at a news conference, are "only a small part of an infinite globality of themes that we need to discuss."
Oil producers and consumer nations are already scheduled to meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in mid-November to discuss ways to stabilize oil prices. But Mr. Chavez, citing a telephone conversation Wednesday with the prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, said that an earlier meeting between OPEC heads of state and their counterparts from the rich industrialized nations or the European Union would be useful "if they desire it."
The 11 members of OPEC, who account for 75 percent of world oil reserves and 40 percent of total output, have agreed to increase production three times this year by a total of 3.2 million barrels a day in an effort to halt spiraling prices. But their efforts have met with little success, and President Clinton last week ordered the release of 30 million barrels from the United States strategic oil reserve in an attempt to drive prices down.
The Saudis have traditionally been closer to the United States and more cautious than OPEC members like Iraq and Libya, which are now closely aligned with Venezuela. Mexico must balance its interest in high oil revenue with its fears of an economic slowdown in the United States, its most important trading partner.
The OPEC heads of state attending the meeting here spoke in one voice, however, regarding what they regard as onerous taxes that the governments of consuming countries impose on oil products. "We are unfairly blamed for all the problems of the world economy" stemming from high oil prices, Prince Abdulla complained, adding that consuming countries should "share the sacrifice through the taxes that they impose on oil."
Consuming countries, though, are sure to resist any linkage between a price drop and a reduction of taxes. To ease taxes would not only increase gasoline consumption, and therefore OPEC's revenue, but extend the dependence on fossil fuels that industrialized countries are trying to reduce through the development of alternative sources of energy.
"According to our calculations, a tax cut of only 10 percent by consuming countries would increase OPEC revenues by 100 percent, of course benefiting consumers who are suffering from those high taxes," Mr. Rodriguez said at a news conference this morning. He and other OPEC officials also said it was necessary for industrialized countries, the United States in particular, to increase their oil refining capacity to help brake oil prices.
In addition, a joint communique read at the conclusion of the summit meeting by OPEC heads of state, the first such meeting in 25 years, contained a reference to the group's alarm at international negotiations intended to shape a treaty on global warming. At the latest round of talks, OPEC members insisted that such an accord must include a commitment to compensate them for any decline in the use of oil.
"The dominant attitude in the international negotiations on climate change is bent on driving a stake into the heart of oil production, especially in member countries," Olusegun Obasanjo, the president of Nigeria, complained. Policies "explicitly intended to dramatically reduce the consumption of fossil fuels" mean that "oil exporting countries would stand to lose more than $20 billion of revenue by 2010," he added.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Fidelity Sells Newspapers To Boston Herald Owner

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The owner of The Boston Herald is purchasing the Community Newspaper Company, a group of four daily and 88 weekly newspapers in the Boston suburbs, from Fidelity Capital, the new business and venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments.
The purchase price was not disclosed. 
 The deal gives Patrick J. Purcell, the owner of Herald Media Inc., a regional platform from which to compete with The Boston Globe, particularly in the wealthy suburbs west of the city. The Globe is owned by The New York Times Company, which earlier this year completed its purchase of The Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Massachusetts's third-largest newspaper, for $295 million.
The Telegram & Gazette circulates in many of the same western suburbs where Community Newspapers owns weeklies. The biggest of the four daily newspapers, The MetroWest Daily News, is published in Framingham.
In a conference call yesterday, Mr. Purcell declared, "Let the battle begin."
In the six and a half years since he bought The Herald -- which has a daily circulation of 266,000 -- from his old employer, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Mr. Purcell has impressed industry analysts and New England newspaper executives with his ability to keep The Herald profitable.
The same observers say that Fidelity struggled to get consistent returns on its investment in the newspapers and niche publications that serve 140 communities in eastern Massachusetts.
"In my view, Fidelity has not operated these newspapers well," said Steven Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
William B. Ketter, the former editor of The Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass., who is now chairman of Boston University's journalism department, said: "I think Fidelity has found that the newspaper business is a very difficult business. They tried the concept of 100 little mice trying to be an elephant, and they realized that it didn't work."
But Mr. Purcell, operating from a strong base in Boston, may be able to find economies and combinations that enhance The Herald's reach and profitability, while increasing the margins of the community newspapers, which have a combined circulation of about 900,000. "I think the purchase of the Fidelity papers by The Herald moves them up a significant notch in competition with The Globe," Mr. Ketter added.
Mr. Purcell said yesterday that "this is an extraordinary revenue-generating opportunity." He added that "the ability to generate ad revenue in this combination is enormous." He also noted that his was by far the biggest community newspaper operation in a single region.
Two other companies have pursued a similar strategy. Pulitzer Inc., the owner of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, paid $165 million in the summer for Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, including 38 newspapers and some niche publications. Hollinger Inc., the parent of Hollinger International, owns Chicago's No. 2 newspaper, The Chicago Sun-Times, as well as the suburban Pioneer Press newspapers.
The announcement of the Community Newspaper sale came on the same day The Globe started its new Thursday GlobeWest section, serving 35 communities in Boston's western suburbs. The Globe has also just finished a redesign, and has recently added new editorial initiatives, including focused weekly business coverage of the biotechnology industry -- a growing part of the economy of the same western suburbs.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Giving Praise to Clinton, Bush Says Gore Is Flawed

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis., Sept. 28

 BODY:
After more than a year of trying to hang President Clinton around Vice President Al Gore's neck, Gov. George W. Bush took the opposite tack today, saying the main problem with Mr. Gore was that he was not enough like his boss.
In a speech to workers at a manufacturing plant here, Mr. Bush tacitly praised Mr. Clinton's past calls for an end to "big government" and said Mr. Gore was not heeding them. 
 Instead, the vice president had "cast his lot with the old Democratic Party" in proposing a new level of federal spending and regulation that Mr. Bush said would endanger the country's current prosperity.
"The vice president was seated right behind Bill Clinton at the State of the Union when the president declared, 'The era of big government is over,' " Mr. Bush said, referring to Mr. Clinton's address in January 1996. "Apparently, the message never took."
"My opponent seemed interested in reinventing government," Mr. Bush said, alluding to one of Mr. Gore's signature phrases. "Now he seems interested only in expanding it. For him, big government has never really been dead. It's simply been biding its time, waiting for its next chance."
Those comments made up some of the sharpened language that Mr. Bush unveiled today to make the case that electing Mr. Gore might mean a return to "the old ways of tax and spend."
Pressing the point, Mr. Bush called on Mr. Gore to promise unequivocally that he would never raise the payroll taxes for Social Security to keep the entitlement program financially solvent. Mr. Bush has made that pledge.
The references to Mr. Clinton revealed a fresh tactic in Mr. Bush's intrinsically difficult quest to persuade Americans that they should unseat an incumbent administration in a period of unparalleled prosperity.
Mr. Bush was essentially saying that electing Mr. Gore would not be like re-electing Mr. Clinton, because Mr. Gore was less protege than dissident.
"He is proposing the largest increase in federal spending in 35 years, since the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson," Mr. Bush said. "The vice president's spending plan proposes three times more in new spending than Bill Clinton proposed in 1992. If the vice president gets elected, the era of big government being over is over. And so, too, I fear, could be our prosperity."
In casting Mr. Gore as financially profligate and trying to plant fears that he might raise taxes, Mr. Bush sounded much like his father did in 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush waged a successful campaign for the presidency against Michael S. Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts.
Mr. Bush did not use the word "liberal," which was the tag his father placed on Mr. Dukakis at the time. But that was clearly what the Texas governor meant. And what he intended was to persuade voters that prosperity was a potentially fragile thing and that Mr. Gore was not its surest protector but its direst threat, someone who would not use the projected federal surpluses in the right way.
Mr. Bush began an effort to wrest the issue of prosperity at least partly away from Mr. Gore this week when he warned that the vice president was not taking the necessary steps to end an "education recession" that imperiled the American economy down the line.
Today, he warned that too much new government spending could have the same effect. He said that his own proposal for a sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years was, in fact, "an insurance policy against an economic slowdown or a recession."
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, called Mr. Bush's assessments "absolutely laughable."
Mr. Hattaway acknowledged that Mr. Gore's 10-year budget plan called for higher expenditures in "education, health care, Medicare and the environment." But he said Mr. Gore's proposal for an estimated $500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years -- less than half the size of Mr. Bush's -- made that spending affordable.
By contrast, Mr. Hattaway said, Mr. Bush's budget "wastes most of the surplus on a massive tax cut and keeps the nation in debt."
Asked about Mr. Bush's pledge not to raise payroll taxes for Social Security, Mr. Hattaway said, "Did he say, 'Read my lips'? The last time a Bush made a silly pledge like that, he broke it."
Mr. Hattaway said Mr. Gore would not be making a similar vow, because the vice president had already outlined a plan for safeguarding Social Security that did not involve a tax increase.
Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Clinton twice -- and twice flattered him in comparison with Mr. Gore.
Previously, Mr. Bush had loudly rued the possibility of "four more years of Clinton-Gore" and implied that the vice president was a participant in an administration that, in Mr. Bush's view, was guilty of serious ethical lapses, divisive partisanship and failed leadership.
But today, Mr. Bush described Mr. Gore as an entirely different kind of politician from Mr. Clinton, one who had "left the vital center of American politics" and headed left, leaving behind a moderate group of Democrats that he championed.
"He has claimed to invent many things," Mr. Bush said, referring to that organization, "but he did help invent the Democratic Leadership Council."
 
IN HIS OWN WORDS: GEORGE W. BUSH
Remarks yesterday in Green Bay, Wis., on Vice President Al Gore's spending proposals:
"I'll treat people with respect. I trust them to know their own interests and chart their own course.
My opponent once had some sympathy for these ideas. He has claimed to invent many things, but he did help invent the Democratic Leadership Council. Senator Lieberman is also a member of that council.
 This is an organization of more moderate Democrats who want to modernize Medicare and Social Security. They want to shrink the federal work force and control spending. They want to use market-oriented ideas to help people in education and in health care. I don't always agree with this group, and they certainly don't always agree with me. But they are leaders, and the kind of leaders I will work with should I become the president.
Vice President Gore has cast his lot with the old Democratic Party. His promises throw the budget out of balance. He offers a big federal spending program to every -- to nearly every -- single voting bloc in America. He expands entitlements without reforms to sustain them. And when others, Republican or Democrat, propose needed reforms in Social Security or Medicare or education, he opposes them vigorously, and he attacks them. Just when progress on important issues seemed within reach, my opponent has left the vital center of American politics."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Says Bush Tax Plan Threatens Prosperity

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that "prosperity itself will be on the ballot" on Nov. 7 and then repeatedly portrayed Gov. George W. Bush's proposed income tax cut as a serious threat to the country's economic health.
"That's not tax relief," Mr. Gore said of his Republican rival's $1.3 trillion tax reduction plan. "That's a massive tax on America's potential." 
 Mr. Gore made his comments in a notably brief speech to a group of scholars and staff members at the Brookings Institution, one of Washington's most prominent research organizations. It is a nonpartisan group that conducts research on a broad range of domestic and foreign policy topics.
The vice president made no new proposals during his address, which he read somewhat impassively from a teleprompter while standing at a lectern. But he did introduce new language, and aides said the speech, like other Gore addresses this week, was designed as something of a test drive for Mr. Gore's first debate with Mr. Bush, which is set for Tuesday night in Boston.
If that is the case, viewers can expect to hear a vigorous assault on Mr. Bush's tax cut plan. Mr. Gore attacked the Bush plan five times in his 13-minute address. The candidates' disparate approaches to tax cuts provide perhaps the clearest distinction in this year's campaign, and Mr. Gore has long maintained that the Republican plan risks a return to heavy deficits.
The Bush proposal would reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, provide a break for married couples, repeal the federal estate tax and expand the deductibility of charitable contributions.
It would reduce federal revenue by $1.3 trillion in the nine years starting 2002 and would use $1.6 trillion of the federal surplus because of increased interest costs that the government would incur if the surplus is used for tax cuts.
The surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $4.3 trillion during the same period.
Mr. Gore, by contrast, opposes any across-the-board reduction in tax rates. He has proposed a $500 billion array of targeted tax cuts and credits aimed at providing relief for the middle class. They would include financial breaks intended to encourage retirement savings and to make college tuition, health insurance and child care more affordable.
Mr. Gore would spend more than Mr. Bush on education and health care, and he would devote significant sums to paying down the national debt.
"Consider this fact," Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush's proposal. "The other side's plan gives more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent -- $667 billion of the surplus -- than all the new money they would invest in education, health care, prescription drugs and the national defense combined."
He added, "I believe in smart investments for the future, not massive tax cuts for the few that could bring us back into deficit."

HEADLINE: Senators Doubt Progress on Global Warming Plan

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Several Republican senators today expressed strong concerns that talks to flesh out details of a global-warming treaty signed by the administration in 1998 would never produce a document that the Senate would approve.
The comments came as Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, spoke at a joint hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations and Energy and Natural Resources Committees in which he defended efforts to transform the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, from a broad commitment to stem global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into a detailed, enforceable plan. 
 The protocol calls for the United States and other industrialized countries to start by 2008 reducing emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which comes mainly from burning coal and oil. More than 150 countries have signed the protocol, but it has not been ratified by any of the world's industrial powers.
Negotiations will resume in November in The Hague on a variety of points, including defining ways for wealthy countries to get credit toward emissions targets by paying for projects in developing countries that help prevent releases of greenhouse gases as those economies grow.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the energy committee, said important aspects of the treaty were far from the goals the Senate set in a resolution 1997, before the accord was adopted at a Kyoto meeting.
It would still be an unfair burden on the American economy, Mr. Murkowski said, by forcing cuts in the use of coal and oil. And, he added, there appeared to be no requirement for developing countries to limit future emissions. That was a specific demand of in the Senate resolution, which passed on a 95-to-0 vote.
Mr. Loy, the chief negotiator for the United States in recent rounds of climate talks, said the agreement was not, and would not -- even after further talks -- be a complete or perfect solution to global warming. But, he said, it is an essential start, providing relatively cheap insurance against harm if scientists' predictions of the consequences of a warming climate prove correct.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said there were signs in his state that farmers would support a treaty if they got financial credits for sopping up carbon dioxide through certain farming methods.

HEADLINE: Tempering Rosy View, Lazio Revisits Economics Upstate

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio today sought to rebut the perception that he has been too upbeat in the face of economic suffering upstate, asserting before the Rotary Club here that new jobs are being created while acknowledging that "the recovery here has not reached every single family."
Addressing the group a week after his opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, told it that Mr. Lazio was out of touch, he stuck close to a stance that has generated some debate upstate and has led even some fellow Republicans to question his approach. 
 First, Mr. Lazio heard Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive and a Republican, present brighter figures on the economy that buttressed the more cautious "we're not out of the woods yet" view he gave to a newspaper last week. Today, Mr. Giambra said that while "boosterism is not going to solve the economic problems here," the "fiscal free fall has stopped" with the net gain of 11,000 jobs in the past 18 months.
Mr. Lazio, noting the statistics, said, "It is symptomatic of a dynamic economy -- of an economy that's changing, that's flexible, that's adapting, that in the end that is growing."
He added, "I know the recovery here has not reached every single family. I know there is still a lot of work to do, and I know that the next senator of New York will need to be a leader of that effort. But the question is: Do we want to build on our recent accomplishments or do we want to return to the policies that caused the recessions in the first place?"
In the end, however, Mr. Lazio did not lay out a plan aimed at the region, saying his overall plan to cut taxes and encourage partnerships between the public and private sectors would stimulate the economy. He did say that he would encourage more high-technology businesses to settle here and suggested that the region would benefit from a high-speed rail link to downstate, but he did not speak of the ideas in detail.
Some in the audience expressed impatience, asking for specifics on what he would do as senator.
Patrick Mills, who would not give his party affiliation but said he had not decided whom to vote for in November, told Mr. Lazio that he had spent too much time telling the group what "disqualifies your opponent rather than what qualifies you." Another man, John Ford, pointed at the dock outside and asked Mr. Lazio what he would do to develop that area. Mr. Lazio replied that it would depend on the vision of local officials.
Mr. Lazio has spent the past few days emphasizing his tax-cut plan in speeches, but he no longer assigns a figure to it. When he unveiled it in a speech last month, he said it would amount to $776 billion over the next decade, but Democrats and news reports suggested the figure was closer to $1 trillion, putting it much more in line with the one proposed by Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Lazio's aides have since conceded that some of the figures he used were outdated, though he has stood by the plan.
Mr. Lazio's latest swing through the state, which began Wednesday and concludes Saturday, is a prelude to a high-energy drive to secure the upstate vote, his strategists say.
Although it is a traditionally Republican area, polls -- both independent and Mr. Lazio's -- suggest that Mrs. Clinton poses a strong challenge after heavily campaigning with the message that the upstate economy is hurting and that she will focus on fixing it.
Mr. Lazio's assistants said he would spend considerable time upstate next month, focusing on potential supporters of Vice President Al Gore who tell pollsters they are undecided on a choice for Senate. "Anyone who says they support Gore but are undecided in this race does not want to vote for Hillary Clinton," a top Lazio official said. "They are looking for a reason not to vote for Clinton."
Mr. Lazio's aides said he had been hurt by commercials from Mrs. Clinton and her supporters that have set back his efforts to tell voters who he is.
Mr. Lazio has complained that the advertisements have distorted his record, and on this trip he has made an effort to correct what he considers misconceptions, especially regarding Medicare. Mrs. Clinton's camp has run commercials saying that Mr. Lazio voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion; Mr. Lazio instead voted to cut the rate of growth in the program, a position Mrs. Clinton has also supported. In his speeches, Mr. Lazio has told people not to pay attention to the advertisements.
Later, at a nursing home in Rochester, Julia Macikowski, 89, asked Mr. Lazio about his Medicare plan.
He replied: "I'm going to work to make Medicare stronger and to strengthen Social Security. I know how important that is to you."

THE DEMOCRATS
 
LIEBERMAN CONTINUES CRITICISM Senator Joseph I. Lieberman accused Republicans yesterday of deceiving voters about the Democratic plan to pay for prescription drugs, the second time this week he has called them dishonest. "What Bush and Cheney are saying about our Medicare plan is downright deceptive," Mr. Lieberman said, joined by other Democratic lawmakers on the steps of the United States Capitol.
On Tuesday, he said Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had repeatedly made promises that were contradicted by "their records and the details of their plans." 
 Vice President Al Gore has proposed adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Mr. Bush has derided the plan as forcing older people into a government-run health maintenance organization and has proposed a more limited program. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT)
 
THE ADVERTISEMENTS
 
BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER
Handgun Control Inc. will begin broadcasting television commercials this weekend that feature the actor Martin Sheen criticizing Gov. George W. Bush's record on gun control.
In the 30-second commercial, Mr. Sheen, who portrays the president on the television series "The West Wing," sits in front of an American flag and says: "Should the next president be the candidate of the gun lobby? Should he have signed a bill that allows hidden handguns in churches, hospitals and amusement parks? Should he be someone of whom the N.R.A. has said, that if he is elected, they'll be working right out of the Oval Office? That's Governor Bush's record."
One reason Handgun Control sought Mr. Sheen is that his brother Joseph Estevez did the voice-over for a commercial opposing gun control produced by a gun industry group, said Joseph Sudbay, the group's political director. Mr. Sudbay said Handgun Control has bought more than $300,000 in time on stations in Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis. The commercials have been timed to coincide with the season premier of "The West Wing." Last season's finale featured an assassination attempt on Mr. Sheen's character.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATES;
The Evolution of Bush the Debater

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 28

 BODY:
In the first debates of the Republican primaries, Gov. George W. Bush did not have to do much. With six candidates dividing an hour and a half, no one got more than 15 minutes.
Yet Mr. Bush filled up even less than that, his diaphanous answers sometimes ending many seconds before the allotted time. And while his opponents talked longer and louder during those early December meetings, few seemed as self-satisfied as the Texas governor. His lips twisted into an expression that opponents quickly branded "the smirk." 
 Within two months, however, he had grafted a layer of earnestness over any arrogance for his ninth debate, a special edition of CNN's "Larry King Live." There were just two other contenders left at that point. But Mr. Bush was suddenly a font of interjections and rebuttals, as if he had to rush to fit in all that he had to say.
As he approaches his first debate with Vice President Al Gore in Boston next week, it is impossible to know which incarnation of Mr. Bush will show up.
He and his aides are hoping for the better version, and will devote much of the weekend to debate preparation. It is their final push in a process that began last spring, and it is a recognition both that the campaign is entering a new phase, to be dominated by the three debates between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, and that these events represent Mr. Bush's best chance to erase any lingering questions about how serious and seasoned he really is.
But while Mr. Gore is a well-known quantity in this arena, a fresh, thorough review of Mr. Bush's 10 debates during the primaries and his two earlier debates in Texas showed him to be an unpredictable, uneven performer. At the same time, it revealed someone who, despite his image in some quarters as an overconfident slacker, can be capable of significant improvements, important adjustments and little surprises.
"The jury is still kind of out on Bush," said Greg Mueller, who was a senior adviser to the publisher Steve Forbes, one of Mr. Bush's former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.
Mr. Mueller was referring to Mr. Bush's aptitude for debates, but he said there was one clear lesson from the primaries: Mr. Bush brings weapons to the battle that should not be overlooked.
Foremost among them is his talent for humorous asides, some cleverly self-effacing and some clearly spontaneous, and Mr. Bush drew on this with increasing frequency and effectiveness as he progressed through the debates last winter.
At his fourth one, in early January, he was asked, "Would you take an expression like 'What would Jesus do?' into the Oval Office?"
"I would take an expression into the Oval Office of 'Dear God, help me,' " Mr. Bush answered, without missing a beat.
When Gary L. Bauer, another rival, muttered that the same thought would go through his head if Mr. Bush were president, Mr. Bush again found a fast and fitting retort.
"That wasn't very Christian of you," he said.
But Mr. Bush also, in the same forum, mispronounced "obfuscate," even though he was following his habit of edging up slowly to multisyllable clusters of consonants, as if pondering dangerous potholes on his oratorical highway.
That error demonstrated one of his debate liabilities: a wobbliness (and sometimes wackiness) with words that was present even in the Larry King performance, when Mr. Bush signaled his commitment to a growing economy by saying, "We ought to make the pie higher."
His debates to date form a fairly apt metaphor for his candidacy and, really, for his political identity.
At his worst, Mr. Bush came across as cocky, tongue-tied and only glibly engaged with the nuts and bolts of the matters at hand. At his best, he projected a genuineness of belief, buoyancy of spirit and affability of character that trumped any of his opponents' charms.
At all times, he leaned -- arguably a few inches further than other candidates do -- on transparently scripted, broad statements about his principles and qualifications, no matter what he had been asked.
The most memorable example was his answer, in a December debate in Phoenix, to a question about what he had learned from a biography of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson that he had previously said he was reading. Mr. Bush simply reverted to foreign-policy lines from his stump speeches.
But his aides and advisers are not talking much these days about that balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses; they are too busy building Mr. Gore into the most fearsome forensic gladiator in the empire.
In recent interviews, one of them called the vice president "the most effective and lethal debater in modern presidential politics." Several others said Mr. Bush would be lucky simply to remain upright in the face of Mr. Gore's onslaught.
The name of this game is the management of expectations, and Mr. Bush's associates played it perfectly in 1994, when he was running for Texas governor against a quick-witted incumbent, Ann Richards.
A recent look at the sole Bush-Richards debate that year left little doubt that she was funnier, more agile with facts, and more authoritative. And some of Mr. Bush's canned goods verged on hokey, as when he concluded his remarks by quoting the state song, "Texas, our Texas, all hail the mighty state."
But he had never previously engaged in a formal debate, so the fact that he stood his ground and stated his platform succinctly, clearly and sometimes even forcefully impressed many skeptical observers.
"Nobody thought he won," said Bill Miller, a political strategist in Austin, who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans. "But nobody said, 'Gee, Richards just wiped the floor with this guy,' so he came out of it well."
Several weeks later, he defeated Ms. Richards in the election.
Mr. Bush's advisers are now trying to create a similar dynamic.
They can, and will, tell anyone who asks that since 1984, Mr. Gore has debated about 45 times. They can, and will, recite chapter and verse of a long article about Mr. Gore's evolution as a debater in the July issue of Atlantic Monthly, the cover of which depicted the vice president as a political vampire.
But many of Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that behind the scenes, Mr. Bush has been practicing and practicing, to a degree that is not wholly characteristic.
During the primaries, for example, he did not bother with a single mock debate. For the general election, he began such rehearsals about four months ago, several advisers said. In May, he sat with aides in the governor's mansion in Austin and watched a videotape, edited by the campaign's chief media adviser, Mark McKinnon, that included scenes from Mr. Gore's debates as well as high points from past presidential debates.
In early June, he and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the stand-in for Mr. Gore, actually stood at lecterns in a room at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Me. It was a scenario repeated over subsequent months, with Stuart Stevens, another media adviser with the campaign, acting as a moderator.
On Friday night, at Mr. Bush's ranch near Waco, he and Mr. Gregg will hold a timed rehearsal at the same late hour as Tuesday's event, a dry run that will test him past his usual bedtime. They may do a second rehearsal on Saturday.
Advisers said that one goal of all this work had been to brief Mr. Bush thoroughly on the details of Mr. Gore's record and proposals. But another goal has been simply to make sure that Mr. Bush goes into Tuesday's debate feeling as comfortable as possible, because that often dictates whether he seems clipped or convivial, herky-jerky or fluid.
Many political analysts said that the way he showcased his personality would be a key to his success.
"His forte is not speed or specificity," said Roderick P. Hart, a University of Texas professor of communication and government who has observed Mr. Bush through the years. "But contrary to popular reports, he's an intelligent man."
In addition, Mr. Hart said, "he has some of that genial quality that President Reagan had in debates."
The debates in the primaries bear out that assessment. Some of Mr. Bush's best moments came when he relaxed enough to unleash a playful streak that made him seem accessible and smart and accomplished other goals as well.
In late January, in his eighth debate, he responded to several of Mr. Forbes's attacks on his Texas record by saying, "So many half stories, so little time."
It was the kind of Reaganesque, "there-you-go-again" line that is certain to be trotted out on Tuesday.
Toward the end of the last debate, on March 2, he drew laughter and applause when he answered a question about his familiarity with the Internet by saying that he "e-mailed my mother the other day."
"She told me to stand straight, by the way, when I was at your debate," he added. It was a quick, self-effacing and humorous way to work his family connections.
But this was also the debate in which Mr. Bush went a laugh too far, chuckling when one of his questioners mentioned that some death row convicts in Texas had had lawyers who slept during their trials.
A more persistent trait of Mr. Bush's responses was his tendency to talk about foreign policy in the most general, well-worn terms. When Mr. King asked about the appropriate occasions for military force, Mr. Bush lapsed into a kind of mantra.
"When it's in our national strategic interest," he said. "The Far East is in our national strategic interest. Our own hemisphere is in our national strategic interests. The Middle East, protecting Israel, is in our national security interest."
The answer, to many observers, was much safer than it was illuminating.

Chart: "VERBATIM: A Bush Debate Sampler
 
Gov. George W. Bush has a tendency to pivot from any question into a recitation of lines from his stump speeches. Here is an example from his first debate during the Republican primaries, in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2.
 
Q. Governor, you have said that you would always have people around you, as president, who would be able to fill in any gaps in your knowledge of the world and the players on the world's stage. Do you think that President Bush could have done the job he did, in assembling and holding together the gulf war coalition, composed of many very varied nations, had he not had the knowledge of the world that he had, from years of experience in diplomacy and politics at the U.N.?
 
BUSH -- In order to be a good president, when it comes to foreign policy, it requires someone with vision, judgment and leadership. I've been the governor of the second-biggest state in the United States. If it were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest economy in the world. I was overwhelmingly re-elected because the people in my state realized I know how to lead, and I've shown good judgment... My goal, should I become the president, is to keep the peace. I intend to do so by promoting free trade, which, in my judgment, promotes American values across the world. I intend to do so by strengthening alliances which says, America cannot go alone. We must be peacemakers, not peacekeepers...
 
Q. With all respect, sir, I don't think you answered the question.
Mr. Bush is perhaps fastest on his feet when it comes to humor, and by his fifth debate of the primaries, in Columbia, S.C., on Jan. 7, he had relaxed enough to show that.
 
Q. What is the biggest mistake you ever made as an adult, and what lesson did you learn from it?
 
A. Well, as you know, I've had a perfect background. After all, I was raised by Barbara Bush. As you may remember, I was in the business world at one time. I was the managing partner -- managing general partner -- of the mighty Texas Rangers. I signed off on that wonderful transaction: Sammy Sosa for Harold Baines.
 
Sometimes, Mr. Bush's short, declarative sentences and unadorned words can come across as signals of common sense and honest conviction, as in this brief answer in his eighth debate, in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26.
 
Q. According to population experts, within years whites will no longer be the racial majority in the United States of America. Should our national dialogue drop the words "minority," "majority"?
 
A. It's a great question. I'm from a state where over 50 percent of the kindergarten students are Hispanic, and we view each other as Texans. We view us all under the great flag of the Lone Star. Yeah, I think so. I would hope our country would get beyond group thought and we'd herald each individual, regardless of their heritage and regardless of their background. The ideal world is one in which all of us are viewed as Americans first and foremost.
In that same debate, there were good examples of the folksiness of his language as he took a position against tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to rising oil prices.
 
BUSH -- OPEC has gotten its supply act together and is driving the price, like it did in the past. And the president of the United States must jawbone OPEC members to lower the price... It's important for the president to explain in clear terms what our energy prices will do to the world economy. It is in the Saudis' best interests for the price of oil to mellow out.

HEADLINE: Economy Grew At 5.6% Rate In 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The economy grew faster in the second quarter than previously estimated without causing inflation to pick up, government figures showed today.
The gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced in the United States, grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate between April and June, the Commerce Department said in its final estimate. That compares with a first-quarter pace of 4.8 percent. 
 Exports grew more quickly and imports more slowly, the main reason the government revised second-quarter G.D.P. from the 5.3 percent rate reported last month. Consumer spending grew at the slowest pace in three years.
In a separate report, the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell by 24,000 last week, to a two-month low of 287,000. If claims continue at that level, with unemployment already near a three-decade low at 4.1 percent, companies could come under pressure to raise wages to attract workers and pass along the costs to customers.
The G.D.P. deflator, a broad measure of inflation tied to the report, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. That is slower than the previously estimated 2.6 percent rate and the 3.3 percent rate of the first quarter. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a measure watched by the Federal Reserve, rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace, down from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent and a 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
Exports rose at a 14.3 percent rate in the second quarter, compared with a 6.3 percent rate of growth in the first quarter. Imports grew at an 18.6 percent annual rate, up from a 12 percent rate in the first quarter.
The G.D.P. report showed consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product, grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter. While up from the 2.9 percent rate previously reported, it is still the slowest pace in three years.
Adjusted for inflation, G.D.P. totaled $9.32 trillion in the second quarter when measured at an annual rate. That compares with $9.19 trillion in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Has a New Formula For the Financing of Stadiums

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Efforts by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to champion grand new ballparks for the Yankees and the Mets took a fresh turn yesterday, with the mayor proposing a financing formula in which each team would pay one-third of the costs of new stadiums. He said the city and state should divide the remaining costs down the middle, resulting in an even three-way split.
"The city has the money to do it," Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. He said the Mets had been told of the proposed financial formula more than a year ago. 
 The mayor made his comments in response to a report that the owners of the Mets, long thought to favor construction of a new Ebbets Field-style ballpark, were now leaning toward renovating Shea, a far less expensive option.
"That is a possibility," said Fred Wilpon, the co-owner of the Mets, who is spearheading the team's negotiations with City Hall. But when asked last night if he had given up on the prospect of a new Mets stadium, he said, "Absolutely not."
The Mets' trepidation over new construction was more apparent yesterday in a report by The Associated Press, which quoted the Mets' other owner, Nelson Doubleday, as saying Shea Stadium "can be refurbished and made up to date." He added, "I don't see a great deal of taxpayer money to build the New York Mets a stadium."
Mr. Giuliani has already pushed through new stadiums for single-A minor-league franchises of the Yankees and the Mets, paid for entirely by the city and under construction on Staten Island and at Coney Island.
The impact on the Mets of Mr. Giuliani's public bargaining posture remained unclear yesterday.
But the idea may have come as a surprise to both the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3rd, and Gov. George E. Pataki.
"This is the first I've heard" of the mayor's proposal, said Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and Governor Pataki's chief adviser on economic development projects. But he said in an interview that the state was prepared to pay for road repairs and other infrastructure improvements necessary for new or renovated New York City stadiums, and that the mayor's formula might provide a reasonable division of costs.
A spokesman for the Yankees declined last night to comment on the mayor's financing proposal.
Although Mr. Giuliani has for years promoted the idea of a new domed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, which he said could serve as a home for the Yankees, the proposal has taken a back seat in recent weeks to City Hall negotiations aimed at luring the Jets as anchor tenants in the mayor's grand West Side stadium proposal.
Yesterday, asked if his three-way financing formula would be offered to the Jets, Mr. Giuliani said ways of paying for a football stadium "haven't been discussed yet."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Hillary Clinton's Surprise: She Supports Some Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign began broadcasting this 30-second advertisement in downstate New York yesterday. A similar ad, the campaign said, will be shown upstate. 

TITLE -- "Affordable"
PRODUCER -- Team Hillary
ON THE SCREEN -- Various images of Mrs. Clinton campaigning, including shots of her holding a baby, meeting with the elderly and talking with people at a diner. The main points appear in writing superimposed over the video clips. When Representative Rick A. Lazio is mentioned, the screen goes black and the written words appear alone.
THE SCRIPT -- "Hillary Clinton supports tax cuts. That's right. She has a plan for a $10,000 tax deduction to help pay for college, tax credits for long-term care and for child care, a reduction of the marriage tax and the estate tax, and Hillary's tax cut plan is affordable. We'd still be able to pay down the debt, and extend Social Security. Rick Lazio's tax plan costs more than a trillion dollars. And just like George Bush, Lazio's plans squander the whole surplus. Hillary. The right tax cuts. The right choice."
ACCURACY -- While opposing across-the-board tax relief, Mrs. Clinton has pushed for limited tax cuts, including those mentioned in the commercial, that promote certain social goals. With her proposal to place "debt-reduction caps" on tax cuts and new spending, it is true that her tax cuts would not get in the way of paying down the debt or continuing Social Security. Mrs. Clinton's claim about the high cost of Mr. Lazio's tax plan is grounded in an analysis by Frank J. Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany. The institute is independent, but is financed in part by labor organizations, and Mr. Mauro has worked for the Democrats in the State Assembly. Mr. Lazio's campaign says that the analysis is not objective and estimates that his tax cuts would cost about $776 billion over 10 years, not the $1.1 trillion suggested by Mr. Mauro. The ad's claim that Mr. Lazio's plans would consume the entire surplus is also based on Mr. Mauro's report; Mr. Lazio offers very different numbers. The ad does not make clear that Mr. Lazio's "plans" are not just tax cuts, as implied, but include new spending on such things as education and prescription drugs.
SCORECARD -- By its own admission, the ad surprises the viewer with its notion that Mrs. Clinton advocates tax cuts. She has not made cutting taxes a hallmark of her campaign, instead suggesting that far-reaching tax relief would be fiscally irresponsible. Her tax cut proposals are very modest, especially compared with those proposed by Mr. Lazio and other Republicans. Her approach to taxes is very similar to that of Vice President Al Gore, who began running an ad this week that mentions the same college tuition deduction. Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's spokesman, said, "Mrs. Clinton has told a number of fibs during this campaign; this ad is a whopper." More accurately, the ad presents a particular version of the truth, one that appears to be aimed at voters who like the idea of tax cuts but assume that Mrs. Clinton opposes them. It also seeks to steal the thunder from one of Mr. Lazio's major campaign initiatives. DEAN E. MURPHY

HEADLINE: Pollution Standards Tightened for Dumping Off Shore

 BODY:
Federal regulators announced yesterday that they had tightened pollution standards for some dredge materials to be dumped off the New Jersey shore.
The standards are critical because off-shore dumping remains the most viable way to dispose of dredge material, the soupy mud scooped off the sea floor to keep shipping channels open. 
 Advocates of tighter standards say they help reduce pollutants released into the ocean and ingested by sand worms, lobsters and other links in the food chain, but opponents fear that tighter standards could curb dredging and threaten the economy.
The standards involve a 15-square-mile area 6 miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., known officially as the Historic Area Remediation Site, or HARS, and commonly as the mud dump. The site was closed to most dumping in September 1997, following an agreement brokered a year before by Vice President Al Gore.
To cap highly contaminated material already dumped at the site, the agreement allowed some disposal of less contaminated material to continue. But elected officials and environmentalists, led by Representative Frank Pallone Jr. and by Clean Ocean Action, a Sandy Hook-based environmental group, were angered when specific pollution standards growing out of the agreement were issued. Critics said those standards allowed the dumping of materials that had higher levels of some pollutants than were present at the mud dump.
Yesterday, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced it was tightening its standard for PCB's to 113 parts per billion, down from 400. The agency also said it would review its standards for other pollutants in dredge materials until July 15, 2001, and that it could alter other standards by October 2001.
"We've decided to apply the revised PCB guideline now because PCB's were identified as a chemical of concern in the HARS designation," said Jeanne M. Fox, regional administrator for the E.P.A.. The agency made the announcement in conjunction with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which issues dredging permits and was also a party to the agreement.
Representative Bob Menendez, a Democrat, who has tended to emphasize the importance of the shipping industry in debating the dredging issue, issued a statement urging a decision based on "sound science and thoughtful review, not rhetoric."
Other supporters of dumping under the E.P.A. standards in place before yesterday include the International Longshoremen's Association and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The port agency issued a brief statement in response to yesterday's announcement, pledging to "continue to abide by the federal guidelines for the use of dredged material to remediate the former mud dump site."
But Mr. Pallone, also a Democrat, called the announcement "a major victory for the ocean and the New Jersey Coastline."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, also welcomed the announcement, and offered to allow qualifying dredge material from New York to be dumped in New Jersey, where some material might be used to cap polluted sites.
Cynthia Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, said the new PCB standard fell below the average level found in sand worms at the site, and is about at the average found in lobsters there.
"It's a step in the right direction," Ms. Zipf said of yesterday's announcement. "Mother always said it wasn't polite to say, 'We told you so.' But we are encouraged and feel some vindication in that the levels have been reduced."

HEADLINE: Danish Voters Say No to Euro; A Blow to Unity

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Denmark voted today not to join Europe's common currency, the euro, undermining an already fragile monetary experiment, and turning its back on the rapid European political integration championed by France and Germany.
In the first popular test for the euro, introduced last year without such democratic consultation in 11 states of the 15-member European Union, Danes voted to preserve the krone rather than join Europe's ambitious experiment with a shared currency. 
 Final results showed 53.1 percent of the electorate voting "No" to the euro and 46.9 percent in favor. The result was a severe blow to the Social Democratic prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who campaigned vigorously with a message that Danes should accept the euro or face isolation.
The rejection appeared to contain an ominous warning to European leaders that they may have raced ahead of their electorates in adopting the euro, pressing for the intensified political cooperation needed to support the currency and talking of European federalism. The phrase "democratic deficit" is now heard often in discussion of Europe.
"I am generally pro-European but I voted 'No' to register my protest at the lack of democratic openness in the way a united Europe is being built," said Ebbe Kloevedal Reich, a writer, as he stood in the misty rain in Copenhagen today. "It is simply not a democratic process at the moment."
The vote was in line with a broad political trend in Europe toward the rediscovery of national identity and away from supra-national Europeanism, at least in its current form. Pia Kjaersgaard, a nationalist Danish leader similar to Jorg Haider in Austria, has been a leader of the campaign against the euro. She will now be strengthened.
For much of the day the euro traded in a narrow range around 88 cents, but after the vote it dropped to about 87.5 cents in New York trading. Euros are not yet in general circulation, but individual currencies like francs and marks are locked to the new currency.
Today's relative stability of the euro reflected several factors: a rejection had already been factored in by many traders, recent European Central Bank intervention has demonstrated that monetary authorities will not let the currency slip much below this level and the Danish economy is small.
But just 21 months ago, at its introduction, the euro bought $1.17, and the Danish rejection suggested that the currency's chronic weakness is not about to end.
Confronting such weakness may require the support of something as big as a government for Europe, but the Danes have shown Europeans do not want that for now. A tension seems certain to persist between a common currency and the absence of common fiscal and other policies to support it.
The likelihood that Britain and Sweden will adopt the euro has receded as a result of the vote. These are the other two European Union states outside the euro after Greece's adoption of the currency earlier this year. In the case of Britain, one of the Union's largest economies, this absence is unsettling to European monetary authorities.
"With a 'No' from the Danes, there would certainly be a loss of confidence in the euro," Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, a member of the governing council of the German Bundesbank, said today before the final results were announced. He suggested further Central Bank intervention was possible.
A further sharp fall in the euro appears unlikely in part because its problems have begun to hurt the earnings of American corporations in Europe. Sales in euros now translate into fewer dollars. The Federal Reserve Board has joined in supporting the euro and a consensus appears to exist, for the moment, that the currency is near its tolerable floor.
The euro was always a political project, adopted in haste soon after German unification a decade ago as a means to tie a united Germany forever to its European neighbors and advance the vision of a United States of Europe, dear to the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl.
It is this vision, imposed over their heads, that is now being questioned by many of the 375 million citizens of the European Union who are concerned about the loss of national identity and national authority.
One of the questioners today was Louisa Jacobsen, a lawyer who said she had favored European integration. But recent developments -- particularly the imposition by 14 European Union governments of sanctions on Austria for including Mr. Haider's rightist Freedom Party in a governing coalition -- enraged her.
"What happened in Austria was a scandal, and that it why I voted 'No,' " she said, troubled, like many Danes, by the idea that "Europe" could punish a small country for its democratic choice. "We need a break, a pause, in a process of integration that is going much too fast."
The Austrian sanctions were lifted earlier this month, but not before damage had been done to the pro-euro campaign in Denmark, a nation of 5.3 million people. This small nation has long been divided over European integration, and swing voters like Ms. Jacobsen were always likely to have the final say.
In the end, a combination of the rightist nationalism of Ms. Kjaersgaard and a wide range of anxieties over the future of Denmark's welfare state and the nature of democracy in a united Europe clearly came together to produce the rejection. This odd coalition outweighed the solidly pro-euro sentiments of Denmark's business community.
The governing Social Democrats, by far the largest party with 35 percent of the vote, were unable to deliver their voters to the pro-euro cause because of widespread concern among them that pressure for lower taxes from European monetary authorities would eventually make Denmark's comprehensive welfare state unaffordable.
Tax cuts and deregulation are favored by the European Central Bank to spur European growth to a point where it can begin to compete with the vigorous American economy, making the euro more attractive.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE STRUGGLE FOR MICHIGAN;
Two Sides in Race Are Seeking an Edge in a State Mirroring the U.S.

SERIES: BATTLEGROUNDS -- Michigan

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich., Sept. 28

 BODY:
Last Feb. 22, Gov. George W. Bush lost the Michigan Republican primary to Senator John McCain of Arizona, thanks to a notably poor showing among independents, moderates and women.
Seven months later, in this same pivotal Great Lakes state, he is again having trouble attracting independents, moderates and women in his race against Vice President Al Gore. The race is close here, with Mr. Gore very narrowly ahead. Demographically very similar to the United States as a whole, Michigan has seen a Bush lead, a Gore bounce and now a bit of a Bush comeback. 
 Yet as Mr. Bush arrived in the state for a pair of fund-raisers tonight in Oakland County, just north of Detroit, and an appearance Friday in Saginaw, he was still searching for ways to ratchet his campaign up a notch.
Prominent Republicans have plenty of suggestions to offer him.
"He needs to cloak himself in McCain in this state," said Jerry Roe, a former executive director of the state Republican Party, who backed Mr. McCain in the primary. "The moderates and the independents were terribly disappointed when he chose Dick Cheney for vice president. A town hall meeting with McCain, maybe two, in crucial counties like Macomb and Oakland, might do the trick."
Other Republican officials said Mr. Bush should carry the fight more directly to the vice president by attacking him as a threat to the auto industry, which is still Michigan's lifeblood (although much of the action has switched from the Big Three automakers to dozens of small, innovative engineering outfits along the expressways fanning out from Detroit).
Anything that cut into Mr. Gore's union support here would be invaluable to the Texas governor. Almost a third of Michigan's likely voters live in union households, and Mr. Gore leads among them by 55 percent to 28 percent, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,145 registered voters between Sept. 22 and 25. Governor Bush leads among nonunion voters.
The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, showed Mr. Gore ahead by seven points among all registered voters, but only four points ahead, 45 to 41, among likely voters. If the numbers are adjusted to account for past turnout patterns, the race is even.
Bill Ballenger, who publishes "Inside Michigan Politics," a highly regarded newsletter, said that Mr. Bush's "character" campaign against Mr. Gore had failed, and that the focus of the campaign had switched to issues. On the most important ones, he asserted, the vice president has the advantage, with "a more understandable prescription drugs plan and a tax plan that's selling because it helps pay down the deficit and puts more resources into the kind of programs that people here want."
On the other hand, interviews with voters in the state suggest, Mr. Gore has been damaged by a tendency to exaggerate or even to fabricate, and his staunch advocacy of protecting the environment can cut both ways.
In his book "Earth in the Balance" Mr. Gore described the internal combustion engine as "a mortal threat to the security of every nation -- more clearly than that of any military enemy we are again likely to confront." Sensing a big opening for Mr. Bush, Rusty Hills, the Michigan Republican chairman, who is a close associate of Gov. John Engler, said on Wednesday: "That is just plain nutty. If we can tell every auto worker Gore said that, we can win this election."
One way to do so would be in television commercials, but 35 percent of Michigan voters, the Times/ CBS poll shows, already view Mr. Bush's advertisements as negative, compared with 21 percent who view Mr. Gore's as negative. Probably not coincidentally, 48 percent said the vice president's commercials had given them an improved image of him, while only 32 percent thought better of Mr. Bush after watching his commercials.
As in a half-dozen other states, voters here have been immersed in the campaign, though the effect is not yet clear. Well over three-quarters of respondents in the polls said they had seen commercials for the presidential nominees -- a surprisingly high figure more than five weeks from Election Day -- and the news is jam-packed with politics. Yet 4 out of 10 of each man's backers had reservations about their votes.
"The sheer volume of advertising, back to back, day after day, the constant political palaver, may have reached some kind of limit of influence," said Hugh McDiarmid, political columnist for The Detroit Free Press. "It may be a wash. At any rate, nothing is producing any marked changes so far.
"In this kind of situation, I think the debates could count a lot."
David W. Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, argued that this election differs from many in the last two decades in its fluidity. In 1980, with an unpopular incumbent, Jimmy Carter, the result was more or less foreordained, he said, as it was again in 1996, with a popular incumbent, Bill Clinton.
This time, he said, "with no incumbent and both candidates relatively moderate in relation to their parties, you get the feeling that nothing is locked in for the 10 percent that drifts back and forth -- exactly the kind of race where the outcome could be affected by a dramatic event like the debates, especially the first one."
That will take place next Tuesday in Boston, with two more later.
The uncommitted and uncertain voters in this state tend to be ticket-splitters, a phenomenon evident as long ago as 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, carried the state by a million votes, while George Romney, a Republican, was winning the governor's race by 300,000 votes. So local politicians would not be even slightly surprised to see Mr. Gore and Senator Spencer Abraham, a Republican, pulling off the same trick in November.
But in other respects Michigan has changed radically. The state is no longer singing the Rust Belt blues, and its population, 9.3 million in 1990, is approaching 10 million. Both its politics and its economy, long static, have entered a dynamic era, marked by widespread innovation and reform.
The change is particularly noticeable here in the belt of suburbs, exurbs and edge cities north of Detroit. Macomb County is no longer dominated by the party-switching Democrats who helped Ronald Reagan win a majority of the union vote in 1984, and Oakland County, the state's second largest, after Wayne (Detroit), is no longer as automatically Republican as it once was.
Mr. Bush's fate in Michigan may well depend on how he does in Macomb and Oakland, both of which were carried by his father in 1988 and 1992. Former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas lost both, and Michigan, four years ago.
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Democrat whose district includes parts of both counties, said he thought that Mr. Gore had "managed to hack his way through most of the thicket of negative Clinton associations, like Monica and Whitewater, which has allowed prosperity to pop through as the leading issue." In his area, he said, "virtually everything has gotten better for most people, though not everyone, over the last eight years, from better schools to better race relations to considerably better pay and conditions on the job."
Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Levin said, only 10 percent of the children in Macomb County went to college, and their parents felt left out of the American success story. Now, more than half get degrees, he said, and their parents "have joined the rest of us in the scramble of middle-income life."
Former Gov. William G. Milliken, a moderate Republican, said he thought that despite Mr. Bush's promise of "compassionate conservatism," he was having trouble fitting into the pattern of economic conservatism and moderation on social issues that seems to succeed best in the suburbs. Specifically, Mr. Milliken mentioned as problems Mr. Bush's opposition to campaign-finance reform, as espoused by Senator McCain, and his steadfast opposition to abortion.
Governor Engler ran Mr. Bush's campaign against Mr. McCain, promising to erect a firewall against the insurgent. He and the wall were torched. Now he is once again at the helm, with assistance from Warren K. Erdman, a former aide to Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who was sent into the state when Mr. Bush began slipping. But this time, Mr. Engler's profile is lower.
Professor Rohde of Michigan State said the best the governor could do for Mr. Bush in any event is "some small influence on the Republican turnout, roughly equal to the impact of the labor unions on the other side."
This week, Mr. Bush has promised larger public roles for, and better coordination with, Republican governors in two neighboring Midwest states -- Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Bob Taft of Ohio. But so far at least, there has been no evidence that he is planning to push Mr. Engler out front.
"George Bush doesn't want to turn this into another referendum on a controversial governor," said Mr. Ballenger, the newsletter publisher, "and pull the independents out to cast protest votes for Al Gore."
Already, a ballot proposal that would legalize the use of state funds for private and parochial schools through a system of vouchers has complicated the Michigan situation for the national Republican ticket. Mr. Engler opposes vouchers, which has split Republican ranks wide open; Elisabeth DeVos, who strongly supports them, resigned as the state party chairman in order to back the campaign for the ballot initiative, which is known as Proposal 1.
The Times/CBS poll shows two-to-one backing for vouchers. Private schools were explicitly prohibited from using them in a 1970 amendment to the state constitution. Television campaigns, pro and con, are just beginning, but the Roman Catholic Church, under Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit, is said to have set aside $1.5 million to support the proposal. Hundreds of thousands of yard signs have already been ordered by opponents of the proposal, so it seems inevitable that the issue will soon loom large in voters' minds.
But Mr. Cheney did not mention the subject in a speech in Troy on Wednesday, and Mr. Bush, an eager advocate of vouchers, is not expected to use the "v-word" here either.

HEADLINE: Number of Insured Americans Is Up for First Time Since '87

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
After rising relentlessly for 11 years, the number of Americans without health insurance declined last year, to 42.6 million, a reduction of 1.7 million from 1998, the Census Bureau reported today.
The proportion of people without insurance also declined for the first time since 1987 -- to 15.5 percent in 1999, from 16.3 percent in 1998. 
 The robust economy and an expansion of government programs contributed to the decline, economists and health policy experts said.
With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, a 30-year low, many employers have found that they must offer health insurance to attract and retain workers. In addition, low-income people are receiving coverage from government programs created or expanded in recent years.
Robert J. Mills, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said, "The driving force behind this improvement was an increase in the likelihood of people having employment-based health insurance."
The number of people with health insurance through their employers rose last year by 3.4 million, to 172 million. This change accounted for 85 percent of the increase in the number of people with health insurance.
Recent studies have found rapid increases in the cost of employer-paid health coverage, which could make it difficult to sustain the growth in the number of people covered by the plans.
For children, as for the population as a whole, coverage increased last year. The number of uninsured children declined to 10 million last year, from 11.1 million in 1998. The proportion of children without coverage declined as well, to 13.9 percent from 15.4 percent.
The plight of the uninsured has emerged again as a political issue, in Congress and in many of this year's election campaigns, including the presidential race.
President Clinton welcomed the new data, saying: "I am extremely pleased with today's announcement. I believe it validates our health care and economic policies."
The number of uninsured is still nearly three million higher than when Mr. Clinton took office in 1993.
Since Congress rejected his proposal for universal health insurance in 1994, Mr. Clinton has been advocating smaller steps to expand coverage. The White House, Congress and governors of both parties have been working to increase coverage for children, in particular, and today's data offered some evidence that the efforts were beginning to pay off.
The Census Bureau said that government programs, including Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program, had helped increase coverage among poor children and youngsters with family incomes just above the poverty level ($13,290 for a family of three).
But overall, the bureau said, in the last year, there was no change in the proportion of the population (24 percent) covered by government health insurance programs.
The number of people without insurance rose by an average of more than a million a year from 1987 to 1998. The trend puzzled and frustrated health care experts because it persisted in a strong economy with low unemployment.
For several years, the number of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance has been creeping up. But the changes received little notice because they coincided with the erosion of other types of coverage. For example, millions of low-income people, including former welfare recipients, were losing Medicaid. That erosion stopped last year. The number of people covered by Medicaid held steady around 28 million, the Census Bureau said.
Genevieve M. Kenney, an economist at the Urban Institute here, said, "The percentage of poor children without coverage has dropped back to where it was in 1996," the year Congress passed a landmark law limiting access to welfare.
Paul Fronstin, an economist at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan study center, said he was not surprised by the data.
"Small firms are more likely to offer health benefits today than two years ago," Mr. Fronstin said. "They need to do so to recruit and retain workers. At the same time, the strong economy puts them in a position where they can offer health benefits even though health costs are increasing."
In recent months, many employers have seen their health insurance premiums rise by 10 percent to 30 percent, mainly because of increased spending on prescription drugs.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said: "The new Census Bureau numbers are welcome news, but no cause for celebration. It's like a morning drizzle after a prolonged drought."
In its report, the Census Bureau made these points:
*More than one-fifth of all poor children, and nearly one-third of all poor people, are still uninsured. Nearly half of poor people who worked full time last year were uninsured.
*Households making less than $50,000 accounted for almost all of the increase in insurance coverage. Among those with incomes of $50,000 or more, there was no change in the proportion having coverage.
*Hispanics people were more likely to be uninsured than any other major racial or ethnic group. About 33 percent of Hispanic people, 21.2 percent of blacks, 20.8 percent of Asian-Americans and 11 percent of non-Hispanic whites were uninsured last year.
The Census Bureau found a notable increase in insurance coverage among poor children 12 to 17 years old. The proportion of such children without insurance declined to 25.7 percent last year, from 30.4 percent in 1998.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, an early proponent of the Children's Health Insurance Program, said he was pleased to see that it had contributed to the increase in coverage, adding that Congress should take the next step and let parents enroll with their children.
To compare states, the Census Bureau suggested using three-year averages of data from 1997 to 1999. By this measure, the proportion of people without health insurance ranged from a high of 24.1 percent in Texas to a low of 8.8 percent in Minnesota.
Arizona, New Mexico, California and Louisiana also had high proportions of people without insurance. The comparable figures were low for Rhode Island, Hawaii and Iowa.
The proportion of people without health insurance was slightly above the national average in New York, where 17.1 percent were uninsured. The figures were below the national average in Connecticut (11.5 percent) and New Jersey (15.4 percent).
Among people 18 to 64 years old, the Census Bureau said, workers were more likely than nonworkers to have health insurance. But, it said, the reverse was true among poor people. About 53 percent of poor workers were insured in 1999, compared with 59 percent of poor people who were not working. People who have low-wage jobs often cannot obtain or afford insurance from their employers.
People from 18 to 24 years old were less likely than any other age groups to have health insurance coverage in 1999, the bureau said. Twenty-nine percent of these young adults were uninsured.
One-third of the foreign-born population lacked health insurance, the Census Bureau found. But, it said, the probability that immigrants will be insured increases with the length of their residence in the United States.

HEADLINE: Civil Disobedience Is Planned To Try to Force Milosevic Out

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Serbia's democratic opposition thinks it has a president in Vojislav Kostunica. But it also has a problem: how to get the incumbent, President Slobodan Milosevic, out of power.
The problem is more than technical. Mr. Milosevic shows no signs of wanting to go. 
 So Mr. Kostunica and the leaders of 18 parties decided to call a rally for 2 p.m. Friday in Belgrade. The opposition insists that he won the first round of voting outright last Sunday, and intends to boycott the second round that the government has decided on.
At the rally they will ask the people of Serbia to perform "any act of civil disobedience they have at their disposal" until Mr. Milosevic leaves office, Zarko Korac, a party leader, said after Mr. Kostunica and the opposition met tonight.
Talking of rolling strikes, the closing of roads, cinemas, theaters, shops and schools, Mr. Korac said: "We know it's a high-risk game, but we know we have no alternative. Through the rigging of votes, Milosevic is clearly challenging us, and since we are being pushed into the street, we must accept it. It is Milosevic who has declared war. We'll start tomorrow and see how we end up and how far we have to go."
If Mr. Kostunica does not run, Mr. Milosevic may win by default -- unless the opposition can force him to recognize his election defeat in the meantime, through legal efforts in dubious courts or through popular pressure.
Speaking to some 3,000 people who had gathered spontaneously in the square tonight, Zoran Djindjic and other opposition party leaders said they would start at 2 p.m. and remain in the square until Mr. Milosevic leaves office.
"After 10 years, we have to show that we are ready to defend our will and overthrow one regime," Mr. Djindjic said. Another party official, Slobodan Orlic, said: "He can do nothing to us. He is broken."
Mr. Milosevic is clearly hoping that his special police, which he has built up and paid well at the expense of the army, will stand by him in the face of what could be widespread protests. But the decision to boycott has given him an opportunity, too.
Today, he met the main officials of his Socialist Party and those of his allies, and in his first appearance on television since Sunday's vote, announced that he would run in the second round.
Mr. Milosevic's Federal Election Commission, in an announcement early this morning, confirmed its preliminary results and declared that Mr. Kostunica, while running 10 percentage points ahead of Mr. Milosevic, had failed to win more than 50 percent of the votes in the election on Sunday, meaning he and Mr. Milosevic would have to face each other in a runoff on Oct. 8.
Mr. Kostunica and the democratic opposition, backed by the United States and the European Union, have cried fraud, and say that their count shows clearly that he won more than 52 percent of the vote.
Mr. Kostunica has ruled out a second round, saying that to take part would be to accept electoral fraud and betray the votes of the people. "If we bargained, then we would acknowledge a lie instead of the truth," he told a rally of more than 200,000 people in Belgrade on Wednesday. "If we bargained, we would admit that one man's will is greater than the will of the people."
Mr. Milosevic is clearly buying time. He is hoping to hold his party, his coalition and his security forces together, while dividing the opposition -- and the outside world -- with the idea that a second round is hardly undemocratic.
But Mr. Kostunica and other opposition leaders believe that the second round is a trap, and that Mr. Milosevic will have more time to prepare an enormous vote fraud or to find a pretext to cancel or annul a second round, and thus remain in power.
Asked in an interview on Wednesday whether he saw risks in his boycott strategy and might allow Mr. Milosevic to remain in power, Mr. Kostunica shrugged. "I won't exclude that risk," he said. "But risk is all round us. Living in a country with Slobodan Milosevic is risky. But he is buying time, and this is something that cannot last long."
Mr. Kostunica found moral support today from the Serbian Orthodox Church, which recognized his election victory and addressed him as "president elect." And the leader of the Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj, until recently a Milosevic ally, congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his election. In Montenegro, the anti-Milosevic prime minister, Filip Vujanovic, also recognized Mr. Kostunica as president.
The 18 opposition party leaders met twice today to discuss strategy, with some leaders more radical than others. They decided on following two tracks: first, a legal track -- which Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, insists upon -- challenging the findings of the Federal Election Commission in the courts; and second, people power -- pressure through a mixture of rallies, strikes and other demonstrations.
There was nothing except random gatherings today, with a few thousand people gathering in Belgrade and Uzice and more substantial spontaneous rallies in Novi Sad and Cacak. In Gornji Milanovac, high school students went on strike, saying they would not return to school until Mr. Milosevic left office. In Krusevac, which was a Socialist town, the local television and radio started showing news from independent Radio B2-92 and Radio Free Europe.
"People are angry, but our dilemma is how to organize their protests without burning people out," Mr. Korac said. He said leaders were discussing a mix of protests, rallies, strikes and encouragements to Mr. Milosevic's allies to abandon him.
Mr. Kostunica has been reluctant to provide an early provocation to the police, but he says he believes that in the end the police and the army will not act against the will of the nation.
A general strike in Serbia, suggested early this morning by Mr. Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party, is problematic, given the poverty of people and the high level of unemployment anyway. But the opposition is discussing general strikes in one city at a time.
To bolster its case before the courts and world opinion, the opposition says it has clear evidence of fraud, including the sudden disappearance from the rolls of 600,000 voters, the inclusion of invalid ballots to lower Mr. Kostunica's percentages and the counting of ballots from polling stations in Kosovo that apparently never opened.
To the opposition's outrage tonight, the election commission declared that its work for the first round was done, refused to hear opposition complaints and, in a final statement, took away four seats from the opposition in the lower house of the federal Parliament.
But opposition efforts to get large numbers of the government-appointed commissioners to resign apparently failed, although there were reports that Bojan Pudar, the commission's vice president, had quit.
Western diplomats said they thought that Mr. Milosevic would not succeed in holding on to power and that his government was already crumbling. But experts here said Mr. Milosevic appeared to encounter no dissent at the meeting of his party's main board or a second meeting of the leaders of his coalition.
"In the end, Milosevic can keep power only by killing Serbs," a diplomat said. "But the police and the army know that people voted for Kostunica, and many of them voted for him, too."
President Clinton today urged Mr. Milosevic to honor the results of the election. "The people of Yugoslavia have spoken loud and clear in support of democratic change," Mr. Clinton said in Washington. "It is time for Mr. Milosevic to heed the call of the Serb people, step down, and allow a peaceful democratic transition to take place."
The United States and the European Union, with France in its revolving presidency, are pressing the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to help make Mr. Milosevic yield. The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, was in Moscow today, and there were reports that the Milosevic government sent copies of its electoral material to Moscow -- where Mr. Milosevic's brother, Borislav, is the Yugoslav ambassador -- to try to convince Mr. Putin that a second round is necessary.
"The Russians will evaluate the evidence, and the opposition has the better evidence," a Western official said. "No one has a veto over the fact that change will come. There is an opportunity for the Russians to help this along more quickly and easily and leave fewer scars in Serbia."
But in a statement, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Moscow "stands firmly for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom to express their will without internal or external pressure."

HEADLINE: Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism, died yesterday in Montreal. He was 80.
Mr. Trudeau suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer and, more recently, pneumonia. 
 Throughout his career, Mr. Trudeau altered his country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen and women proud that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.
Mr. Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the Conservatives. Finally, in 1984, after a meditative walk in the snow, he chose to step down.
Mr. Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political equivalent of the paroxysms evoked by the Beatles. During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation. Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.
Mr. Trudeau supervised the process by which Canada replaced its ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his country at odds with the leadership of Canada's neighbor.
While firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Mr. Trudeau saw to it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.
Mr. Trudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with Socialist leaders like Olof Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of Germany and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
But for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won the support of most Quebec voters. They sided with him in a referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the independence movement.
"Reason before passion," was his personal motto, and he used it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should stay within the federation. The separatist challenge was a major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved Canada by defeating the movement.
In his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache that was aggressively and un-Canadianly immodest. He drove sports cars, flaunted his wit, dated celebrities like Barbra Streisand, toured the discos, married a former flower child much younger than himself and once, in an act of apparent insouciance, was photographed as he pirouetted alone in Buckingham Palace while other guests walked off to meet Queen Elizabeth.
Many years later James Coutts, one of Mr. Trudeau's aides, disclosed that far from being spontaneous, the pirouette, like many other attention-getting gestures, had been planned and even rehearsed by the prime minister.
As Michael Valpy, a political columnist for The Globe and Mail, noted in 1998 on the occasion of Mr. Trudeau's 79th birthday, the prime minister had become impressed early in his political career by an idea advanced by Marshall McLuhan, the philosopher of media. McLuhan believed that the public sees prominent figures as if they are wearing masks, and that it is the character of the mask that the public identifies with, not the person behind it.
Mr. Valpy, who is married to Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer who is also the mother of Mr. Trudeau's youngest child, a daughter, maintained that the mask Mr. Trudeau selected was that of the warrior chief.
He added: "It would require a Joseph Campbell to explain to Canadians -- the beaver people of peace, order and good government -- why they found magic in a warrior chief's mask. But magic they found, served up by a practiced and consummate magician."

Defining Canadian-ness Annoyed the Neighbors
Another Canadian commentator, Richard Gwyn, maintained that Canadians were fascinated with Mr. Trudeau precisely because his image was not the way they saw themselves but the way they wanted to be seen.
"He teases, taunts, inspires and bugs the hell out of Canadians because they know he is utterly un-Canadian -- but exactly what they want other people to think Canadians are like," Mr. Gwyn wrote in a collection of essays called "Trudeau's Shadow."
In a country so devoted to understatement, Mr. Trudeau's ascendancy marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the transformation of style and leadership that took place eight years earlier in Washington when John F. Kennedy was elected president.
Predictably, such a change drew complaints at home and abroad. In the United States, Mr. Trudeau's assertion of Canadian prerogatives frequently raised eyebrows and indignation.
There was the time, for example, when he referred to a Washington bureaucrat as "a pipsqueak." There were protests in America when he tried to limit American investments in Canada, particularly in the oil industry. And when he urged NATO to make a dovish retreat from its first-strike nuclear strategy, the Reagan administration thought him to be naive, dangerous and presumptuous.
Still, like all Canadian leaders, he remained preoccupied by his country's relationship with the United States and even charmed critics with comments like those he offered in 1969 after meeting President Richard M. Nixon in Washington: "Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt."
And when Mr. Trudeau retired 15 years later, James Reston wrote in his column in The New York Times: "Some of us down here think he was a good neighbor and a good friend. We liked his crusty arrogance and the rose in his lapel. He gave us his truth as he saw it, even if we didn't always like it."
Joseph Philippe Pierre Ives Elliott Trudeau was born on Oct. 18, 1919, in Montreal.
His father, Charles-Emile Trudeau, the son of French-speaking Quebec farmers, was a lawyer then on his way to wealth as the owner of a chain of gas stations. He also acquired profitable mines, the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Royals, the city's minor-league baseball team.
His mother, Grace, was of mixed Scottish and French descent.
The family spoke mostly French at home, but Mr. Trudeau could not remember a time when he did not also speak English.
At a Jesuit high school where he studied Latin and Greek, he systematically tested teachers in contrarian debate.
"I realized that I must never interrupt a teacher to make an impertinent remark, because that would be certain to infuriate him," Mr. Trudeau wrote in 1993 in a book he called simply "Memoirs." "But if I waited until he paused and then I slipped in a wisecrack, the class would burst out laughing before he had a chance to get angry."
He said the pleasure of such moments led him to a lifelong habit of "opposing conventional wisdoms and challenging prevailing opinions."
In 1940 he entered the University of Montreal, only vaguely aware that the war in Europe "might constitute the most dramatic adventure the men of my generation would ever confront."
But as he also observed, "If you were a French-Canadian in Montreal in the early 1940's, you did not automatically believe that this was a just war. We still knew nothing of the Holocaust, and we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers."
In any case, he did not enlist; he even rallied against conscription of French-Canadians. In 1943 he graduated with a degree in law, and after clerking in a law office he went to Harvard for graduate study in political economy. At Harvard, he recalled, he was made to understand the parochialism of Quebec, meeting professors, refugees from Europe, who did make him aware of "missing one of the major events of the century."
Until he was 30, he spent his time in study and travel. He left Harvard for Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris, where he roared across the city on a motorcycle and tasted from a rich and fashionable intellectual menu: the Christian left, the worker-priest movement, orthodox Marxism, classical liberalism, existentialism and particularly personalism, an attempt associated with the writer Jacques Maritain to reconcile the needs of individuals and society.
A year later he was studying at the London School of Economics, principally with Harold Laski, the eminent professor of political science who was also the chairman of the British Labor Party. Mr. Trudeau has written that his basic philosophy of government was established there, at a time when Britain was on the verge of instituting the welfare state.

Girdling the Globe To Learn About Home
In the spring of 1948, Mr. Trudeau set off on a slow voyage of discovery, ostensibly to do research for a doctoral dissertation, never completed, on the interplay of Christianity and Marxism in Asia. Actually, as he later explained, he was embarking on a different odyssey, eager to mix with local people and to see and sense the world.
He was arrested in Arab Jerusalem on suspicion of being an Israeli spy. He was detained when he crossed the new and tense border between Pakistan and India. He hitchhiked across an Indochina already rent by warring factions. He was in China during the 1949 revolution there.
His presence at a lawyers' meeting in Moscow led to instructions to American immigration officials in the anti-Communist 1950's to deny him admission if he tried to enter the United States.
After two years, Mr. Trudeau returned home dismayed that the authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis and the local ecclesiatical establishment that had ruled Quebec since his childhood were still in firm control. He committed himself to work for a "democratic revolution" in the province, seeking separation of church and state, electoral reform and educational changes. He founded an intellectual quarterly, Cite Libre, and used its pages to call for a coalition of democratic forces against the Duplessis regime.
In 1961 he became a law professor at the University of Montreal, which earlier had steadfastly shunned him for being too radical and anticlerical. By this time a quiet revolution was well under way in Quebec, with urban, cosmopolitan and secular values rising to challenge the old culture and the old politics.
In 1965 Mr. Trudeau joined the Liberal Party and won election to the House of Commons. In Parliament, he sympathized with many grievances of the French-Canadians, advocating support for their language and culture. But at the same time he steadfastly opposed any legislative action that would give them special status. He was a federalist, and he despaired of any separatist solutions that suggested ghettos.
"French-Canadians must refuse to be enclosed withhin Quebec," he wrote in one of his essays. "The die is cast in Canada: there are two main ethnic and linguistic groups; each is too strong and too deeply rooted in the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture to engulf the other. But if the two will collaborate at the hub of a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a form of federalism that belongs to tomorrow's world."
He was quickly singled out by Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who named him to his cabinet in 1967 as minister of justice and concurrently attorney general. He produced legislation expanding social welfare, tightening gun control and liberalizing laws relating to divorce, abortion and homosexuality.
When Mr. Pearson announced his intention to resign, Mr. Trudeau competed with 19 others for the post of party leader, which carried with it the prize of prime minister. Mr. Trudeau was victorious, and on April 20, 1968, he was sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister and its third of French descent.
Three days later he dissolved Parliament, calling for general elections. Mr. Trudeau campaigned on the promise of "a just society," urging the richer provinces to pay for programs in the poorer ones. He conceded that the expanded programs he wanted would mean higher taxes, but declared, "If you want pie in the sky, you'll have to vote for another party."
It all went over well with the voters, and on June 25, propelled by "Trudeaumania," the electorate gave the Liberals a comfortable majority.
But the euphoria was shattered in 1970 when a terrorist group, the Front de la Liberation de Quebec kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat, and a week later seized Pierre Laporte, a minister in the Quebec provincial cabinet. As a condition of their freedom, the Front demanded the release of members who had been imprisoned on charges or convictions of murder, bank robbery and bombings carried out in the pursuit of separatism.
While demonstrators rallied in support of the Front and nonviolent supporters of separatism called stridently for full appeasement of the kidnappers, Mr. Trudeau painfully and reluctantly invoked the War Measures Act to protect Canada from a "cancer of an armed, revolutionary movement."
Using provisions of the act, he sent thousands of troops to Montreal and canceled some civil liberties. Some 400 people were arrested and detained without charges.
Two days later, on Oct. 17, a message from the Front told authorities where they could find the body of Mr. LaPorte. Four men were eventually charged with his murder and imprisoned. Mr. Cross was then released, and his captors were allowed to leave for Cuba.
Mr. Trudeau's tough responses proved highly popular, and terrorism effectively ceased in Quebec.
But the issue of separatism for Quebec did not disappear. Indeed it kept growing, advanced no longer simply by terrorists but by popular politicians of the Parti Quebecois, notably Rene Levesque, an old friend of Mr. Trudeau who was to become his chief opponent on the issue. By 1976 the separatist party had taken control of the provincial government.
Paradoxically, it was the success of Mr. Trudeau's policies toward Quebec that led to his brief ouster from office in the elections of May 1979.
With the risk of Quebec's secession seemingly ended by his efforts, the western provinces were encouraged to lash out against Mr. Trudeau's party, which they viewed as favoring federal power at the expense of the authority of their provinces. The Liberals won no seats west of Winnipeg, and Joe Clark, the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, became prime minister.
But then Mr. Levesque inadvertantly came to Mr. Trudeau's rescue. Realizing that the elections had removed the strongest proponent of federalism from power, Mr. Levesque felt it opportune to prepare a referendum that would ask the people of Quebec whether they wanted to empower provincial officials to begin negotiations on independence.
But by that act he strengthened Mr. Trudeau's support throughout the country. Some of those who had voted against him, thinking the separatist danger had ended, now openly missed his voice.
And Mr. Clark quickly stumbled. He lost a vote of no confidence, and new elections were ordered. Mr. Trudeau rallied impressively, and by March 1980, he was once more prime minister. He immediately set off to challenge the Parti Quebecois in Mr. Levesque's referendum, scheduled for May.

A Bitter Debate On Canada's Meaning
The debate became personal and nasty, with Mr. Levesque, who was seeking a yes vote, at one point dismissing the prime minister's arguments against the proposition.
"His name is Pierre Elliott Trudeau. and this is the Elliott side taking over, and that's the English side, so we French-Canadians in Quebec can't expect any sympathy from him," Mr. Levesque said.
The prime minister counterattacked. He cited the Ryans, the Johnsons and the O'Neills -- who despite their Anglo-Saxon names were famous French-Canadian political families. Then he declared: "Of course my name is Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Elliott was my mother's name. It was the name borne by the Elliotts who came to Canada more than 200 years ago. My name is a Quebec name. But my name is a Canadian name also. "
It worked. On May 20, 1980, 59.6 percent of the electorate voted no. In the showdown over the destiny of Quebec, Mr. Trudeau's vision had overwhelmed Mr. Levesque's hope of pulling an independent Quebec out of the federal system.
Though only the foolhardy could claim that Mr. Trudeau's victory over the forces of separatism was permanent, none could dispute that it was profound.
There were other successes. In 1982 he succeeded in repatriating the Constitution by having the British Parliament pass an act that ceded full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter to Ottawa. He saw bilingualism and multiculturalism become national programs. And his vision of Canada as a compassionate and benevolent government open to the rest of the world yet different from the United States has survived his term of office.
There were setbacks over nuclear disarmament and over his attempts to limit foreign involvement in the economy. But it was in his private life he proved most vulnerable.
In 1970, at the Club Med in Tahiti, the 51-year-old Mr. Trudeau met Margaret Sinclair, 21, the daughter of a Liberal Party politician from British Columbia. They were married the next year and by 1975 they had three sons, Justin, Alexandre and Michel.
Soon after campaigning with her husband in the 1974 elections, Mrs. Trudeau suffered exhaustion and was hospitalized. When she emerged from the hospital, she became a photographer, following rock musicians and frequenting nightclubs, where she was often photographed in ways that were humiliating to her husband. Her friendship with Mick Jagger and other pop icons provided more grist for tabloid gossip columnists on several continents.
The couple separated in 1974 and were divorced in 1984, with Mr. Trudeau getting custody of the children.
After stepping down as prime minister, Mr. Trudeau moved to Montreal, where he kept largely to himself, avoiding interviews or public appearances. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, but even before the symptoms of his illness intensified, he kept close to home. He was always considered an aloof, insular man, and his former wife had once said that he "destined for eternal solitude."
His public mask, the one he had designed and shaped, seemed to have slipped away and friends who had known him for years described him as an increasingly unhappy man. In 1998 his youngest son, Michel, a 23-year-old microbiologist who worked as a ski instructor, was swept to his death in an avalanche in British Columbia. Mr. Trudeau grieved privately. He was close to his surviving sons and until his last illness frequently visited his daughter by Miss Coyne, the lawyer, whom he had first met professionally. The girl was born when Mr. Trudeau was 71.
Nonetheless, despite the aloofness of his last years, memories of the warrior chief persisted in Canada.
Fourteen years after he left office, when a sampling of Canadians were polled about which public figure they would most want to have dinner with, Pierre Trudeau came in a close second. The only Canadian who was more popular was the hockey star Wayne Gretzky.

HEADLINE: Fujimori in Surprise Visit to Washington

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
As tensions deepen for him at home, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru flew to Washington today to seek support from the United States and inter-American countries and organizations for his plan to transfer power to an elected successor, officials said.
Mr. Fujimori's trip stunned Clinton administration officials, who last week were acutely worried that he might be ousted by military officers loyal to his fired intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. 
 Those fears eased somewhat after Mr. Montesinos took refuge in Panama. But American officials said that Mr. Fujimori's hold on power remained precarious and that Mr. Montesinos remained capable of influencing events in Peru.
Ten Peruvian lawmakers have withdrawn their support from Mr. Fujimori, and an 11th has been expelled from his Peru 2000 coalition since the president announced on Sept. 16 that he would call elections.
The lawmakers' departure has cost the autocratic Mr. Fujimori his majority in the Congress and confused a political climate that was for nearly a decade anchored by him and his rarely photographed but ubiquitous spy chief, Mr. Montesinos. The Congress did, however, accede to Mr. Fujimori's request to abolish the National Intelligence Service, which Mr. Montesinos led.
In several areas of Peru, a transportation strike gained ground. The affected zones included the second-largest city, Arequipa. Dozens of Peruvians were arrested in protests in coastal cities as demonstrators called for an end to high fuel prices, lower unemployment and Mr. Fujimori's immediate departure.
After a round of hurried calls to Washington late Wednesday, Mr. Fujimori arrived and met Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the Organization of American States. Since denouncing Mr. Fujimori's re-election in May as fraudulent, the 34-nation hemispheric forum has pressed him to hold a new vote.
A senior administration official said Mr. Fujimori, after having spurned the O.A.S. for months, was now seeking its embrace to thwart political or military challenges at home as he arranged a transition. Mr. Fujimori's aides have indicated that he is considering holding elections in March, with the inauguration of a president in July.
"He's coming to the O.A.S. to lift his standing and to show he's in control," the official said. "It's very gutsy."
Among Mr. Fujimori's challengers is the democratic opposition, which includes Alejandro Toledo, the candidate for president who withdrew from the race in the spring as signs of electoral fraud developed.
There is also a small but powerful group of army leaders who owe their careers to Mr. Montesinos.
"Fujimori is trapped between the military, which wants Montesinos back or wants a coup, and the opposition which wants an immediate transition," said Eduardo Gamarra, an Andean expert at Florida International University.
Last week, the army leaders sent menacing signals to bolster their demand that Mr. Montesinos be granted permanent haven in Panama. Panamanian authorities are considering his request for asylum, a status that would make it harder to prosecute him for political extortion, murder and other abuses attributed to him by human rights groups.
American officials and Mr. Gaviria, a former president of Colombia, had pressed President Mireya Moscoso of Panama to admit Mr. Montesinos in the first place. The officials said it would be up to Peruvian and Pananamian officials to determine whether he should be prosecuted.
Administration officials said Mr. Montesinos, who reportedly has vast files on Peruvians, including Mr. Fujimori, has long had an informal relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Fujimori is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Friday morning. American officials privately said he appeared determined to protect a mixed legacy. It has weakened democratic institutions, but it has also neutralized threats posed by guerrilla groups, fought the narcotics trade and opened up the Peruvian economy.
A spokesman for the State Department, Philip T. Reeker, said, "We will, of course, when we do meet with President Fujimori, emphasize our support for a peaceful, democratic, constitutional transition of power for the continuation of that O.A.S. dialogue that has been going on and which we very much supported."

Electric Utilities Ask U.S. Agency for Help

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities urged federal energy regulators yesterday to reform New York State's wholesale electricity market to reduce energy prices.
The utility companies, blamed by many of their customers for this summer's high electricity bills, contended that they were not responsible for the higher charges, which they called the result of excessively high wholesale energy costs in the state's deregulated electricity market. 
 The utilities' request came in papers filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a proceeding involving the New York State Independent System Operator, which administrates the wholesale energy market in the state.
Among the changes the two utilities urged was revision of Independent System Operator "market rules and procedures that discourage economically efficient imports" of electricity from other regions, like New England. They also called for changes in rules power generators must follow, to avoid severe day-to-day fluctuation in electricity prices. Joseph P. Fried

HEADLINE: Savings Rate Hits 4-Decade Low As Consumer Spending Increases

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The nation's savings rate fell in August to the lowest rate in at least four decades as spending grew faster than incomes for the second consecutive month, the Commerce Department said today.
The department said consumer spending rose 0.6 percent, keeping pace with the increase in July. Personal income, including wages, salaries, benefit payments and other sources of income, gained 0.4 percent in August after a 0.3 percent rise in July. 
 With spending outpacing income, the amount of after-tax income left over after spending fell to a negative 0.4 percent, the lowest rate since the Commerce Department began tracking such data in 1959.
Despite the strong consumer spending, the report held some good news for the inflation-wary Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan.
The price index for personal consumption expenditures, one of Mr. Greenspan's favorite indicators of inflationary pressure in the economy, was unchanged during the month after a gain of 0.2 percent in July.
"One concern I have," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis, "is that consumers are highly leveraged and when the economy slows and interest rates spike some day, it's going to really hurt consumers." The savings rate, he added, is "quite worrisome."
The strong level of consumer spending runs against the grain of most recent economic indicators, which have suggested a slowing economy. The Federal Reserve is hoping to rein in consumer spending and to slow the economy from the torrid growth seen earlier in the year to a more sustainable pace.
The Fed next meets to debate interest rate policy on Tuesday and is expected to leave rates unchanged.
James Annable, chief economist at WingspanBank.com, said consumer spending growth fell sharply in the second quarter and has now rebounded in the third quarter. "The economy is rebounding," Mr. Annable said.

Airbus Wins $8 Billion Deal For Its New Jet

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In a major defeat for Boeing, Airbus Industrie won an $8.6 billion order today for 25 superjumbo aircraft from Singapore Airlines.
The airline, whose profitability, service and modern fleet have made it an industry benchmark, said it was placing orders for 10 Airbus A3XX's and was taking an option to buy 15 more. It said it would use the aircraft, which seats 555 passengers, for flights to London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia. The first airplanes are expected to be delivered in 2006. 
 The decision ends months of intense lobbying by the two rival manufacturers and brings Airbus within sight of the orders it needs to justify producing what would be the largest aircraft ever built. The company said it must have 40 to 50 firm orders by the end of the year to make the $11 billion A3XX project feasible.
Airbus said Singapore Airlines, though only the fourth company to order the new plane, would be the first to operate it.
"Our decision to be a pioneer for this latest aircraft type is further evidence of S.I.A.'s determination to stay ahead of the field in product and service," said the deputy chairman and chief executive of Singapore Airlines, Cheong Choong Kong.
Because the latest order comes from such an influential airline, it puts pressure on other carriers to consider whether to add the A3XX to their fleets, analysts said.
"Once someone starts this process, everyone has to follow," said Jean-Louis Morisot, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in Singapore. "This is an aircraft that allows airlines to completely redefine the airline experience."
The order appeared to deliver a rebuke to Boeing, which has derided the new aircraft as unnecessary in an industry striving to become more versatile. Boeing has instead offered a larger version of its 747, the plane whose familiar profile has dominated air travel for the last 30 years.
In the end, said Airbus's commercial division chief, John J. Leahy, Singapore Airlines was swayed by the chance to own the latest technology. "The 747 is a very fine airplane, but it's built on 1960's technology," he said.
The message to Boeing was clear, Mr. Leahy said: "Spend the money, start out with a clean sheet of paper and build yourself a new airplane."
But Boeing said it remained committed to its 747X family of airplanes.
Alan Mulally, the president of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said that the new 747X would be equipped with the latest technology and would be more economical to operate than the A3XX, especially by airlines that already own 747's.
Mr. Mulally added that Singapore Airlines was still interested in buying the freighter version of the 747X. The airline is already a major Boeing customer, with more than three dozen 747's and 18 777's in its fleet. Last year it agreed to buy 12 more 777's after Boeing agreed to buy 15 of its older Airbus A340-300's.
Mr. Mulally also left open the possibility that Singapore Airlines might eventually buy the passenger version of the 747X despite yesterday's announcement. "If they want to change their fleet plan, if new news comes out and commitments can't be made, we are going to be there for them," he said.
Airbus envisions its A3XX as a flying cruise ship, capable of accommodating bars, restaurants and even a casino. Even with the extravagant options, the company said its new aircraft would be able to fly more people farther for less money than a 747.
Mr. Leahy said Singapore Airlines had yet to decide just what amenities to put in its A3XX's and was planning to devote years of research to customer preferences.
Mr. Leahy said each plane was priced at $220 million to $240 million. Singapore Airlines arrived at its $8.6 billion total for the deal by factoring in adjustments for inflation customary in such long-term purchases. But the airline is likely to have received a steep discount from the list price for being one of the first customers for the plane.
Though the Singapore order does not immediately clinch the A3XX's feasibility, it raises the ante for the airlines' competitors. Though it is by no means one of the world's largest airlines (Alaska Airlines flies more passengers), Singapore Airlines is a leader in the market for international air travel. And despite hailing from a country of less than four million people, the airline has earned a reputation for expanding without something common to most airlines: debt.
Singapore's flag carrier is sitting on almost $600 million in cash. "It's got more cash than any other airline," said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Center of Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney.
Analysts said it was possible the airline could pay for its giant new airplanes without borrowing any money, which gives the airline's endorsement even more impact.
"A larger aircraft also means a lower operating cost per seat," Mr. Cheong said today. "This confers a competitive advantage to the operator, enabling it to earn higher profits with the same or even more attractive fares."
Mr. Leahy said Airbus was confident of meeting its sales target. So far, it has won 32 firm orders, including earlier commitments from Air France, Emirates Airlines and the International Lease Finance Corporation, a unit of the American International Group. Other airlines are already seriously considering adding their name to the aircraft's list of future owners, Mr. Leahy said. They include Cathay Pacific, Qantas Airways, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Lufthansa.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Says Bush Plan Will Cause Lasting Damage to the Environment

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: CHEVY CHASE, Md., Sept. 29

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore today sharply criticized his opponent's proposal to open Alaska's protected wilderness to oil drilling, saying it would bring "decades of environmental damage to reap just a few months of increased oil supply."
Mr. Gore delivered his stinging critique from the wooded 40-acre grounds of the Audubon Naturalist Society, soon after Gov. George W. Bush unveiled a $7.1 billion energy plan in Michigan. 
 Eager for a face-off with the Republicans over oil and the environment, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, changed their schedules today to react to Mr. Bush's plan. Mr. Lieberman even journeyed to Houston, to attack Mr. Bush's environmental record in his home state.
From a lectern set up in a glade on a glorious fall day, Mr. Gore called the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge one of the nation's "greatest treasures" and said that allowing oil drilling on its coastal plain would be "bad environmental policy and bad energy policy."
"The other side now proposes to misuse high oil prices as an excuse to let oil companies invade precious natural treasures like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge," the vice president said. "If you entrust me with the presidency, I will not let that happen."
Mr. Gore called the preserve a "fragile" area and said, "It would take years and years of development, which would cause decades of environmental damage, to reap just a few months of increased oil supply. I oppose it."
He defended his call last week to use oil from government strategic reserves to try to stabilize oil prices. A day after Mr. Gore made his proposal, President Clinton ordered the release of 30 million barrels of oil, prompting charges from Mr. Bush that the nation's national security was being jeopardized for short-term political gain.
Mr. Gore, who had spoken out against tapping the oil reserve over the winter when oil prices were lower than they are now, defended his recommendation as an example of the kind of leadership needed to be steward of the strong economy.
"A spike in oil prices can have the potential to set off inflationary pressures, lead to slower growth and impose higher production costs on business," he said. "Strong economic leadership demands swift and decisive action to deal with emerging threats to our prosperity -- even when that action is controversial."
He said President Clinton's decision to release the oil had already lowered oil prices about 20 percent, or $6 a barrel. But he also said the nation must cut its dependence on oil.
"We don't have to build our lives around a fuel source that is distant, uncertain and too easily manipulated," said Mr. Gore, who has long been interested in environmental issues. He called for investments in light rail and mass transit, in the development of cleaner cars and in new energy technologies.
"If we do things right," he said, "if we make responsible choices, if we invest in the job-creating, environment-protecting technology of the future, then we can have cleaner air, more reliable energy and a more prosperous economy all at the same time, with millions of good new jobs for Americans."
It was left to Mr. Lieberman to play the attack dog, in Houston's Hartman Park, a ball field in the shadow of the Valero company oil refinery where the air was thick with the smells of industry.
"To me the refinery behind us represents, unfortunately, what Governor Bush has done for the air and water in the state of Texas," the Connecticut senator said. "No child in America should be forced to play in a park like this with air that is hard to breathe."
He pointed to the past ties of Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, to the oil industry, as well as Mr. Cheney's recent attendance at an $8 million fund-raiser that drew oil company executives. And he pointed to Houston's standing as the nation's smog capital. The city had 38 days this year in which smog levels exceeded federal standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency is threatening sanctions.
Mr. Lieberman added, "I want to ask the American people to ask themselves, 'Does Governor Bush now want to do for America's environment what he's done here in Texas?' "

HEADLINE: Talking to Oprah Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By Cheryl D. Mills; Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer who represented President Clinton and was deputy White House counsel in his administration, is a senior vice president at Oxygen Media.

 BODY:
It really was a beautiful thing: presidential candidates making nice to a black woman and meaning it. You don't see that every day in America. But when Oprah calls, even would-be presidents answer.
Appearing on "Oprah" gave George W. Bush and Al Gore the chance to reach out to the oh-so-important-but-only-at-election-time women's vote. Only during campaign season do you hear this many pundits and politicians talking about the "power of women." Especially about the power of black women. Our 15 minutes are here -- we'd better grab them before it's lights out until 2004. 
 For candidates, black women are a logical constituency to pursue. Of 2,500 Americans polled from April through July for the Markle Foundation and Oxygen Media, whose programming is aimed at women, black women expressed the highest interest in politics of all the women. Thirty percent said they were "very interested," with 43 percent agreeing with the statement: "I have a moral responsibility to be involved politically." For all women in the survey, conducted by Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates, the comparable figures were 25 percent and 38 percent.
Because black women are more likely than American women generally to be at the economic and social margins, many have compelling needs to be addressed. In focus groups of black women organized after the survey, participants spoke of the need for schoolbooks without missing pages, health care beyond the emergency room, affordable housing that is habitable and jobs that pay living wages. Indeed, 27 percent of black women surveyed counted the economy and jobs as among the top concerns they want candidates to talk about, compared with 17 percent of white women.
Some 76 percent of black women also reported their intention to vote, putting them just ahead of white and Hispanic women. And while their turnout in the 1998 elections was about 42 percent -- the same as for voters generally -- that figure may well be in higher in November: According to the Census Bureau, black voters were the only demographic group to defy the trend of declining turnout from 1994 to 1998. The black vote increased in the same period.
But if Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore want to capitalize on this, they must focus on developing trust. Only 9 percent of black women in the survey agreed that "most people who run for office are committed to what they think is right," compared with 17 percent for white women and 20 percent of all respondents. Black women also said they see little difference between Republicans and Democrats once they're in office. Come time for governing, they said, compromises too often come at the expense of what is important to black women.
Perhaps it's those feelings that explain another survey finding: Some 40 percent of black women -- almost twice the portion in any other group (of women or men) -- said they "prefer a politician who will keep his campaign promises no matter what," over one who "will do what's right for the country, even if it means breaking a campaign promise." Asked why in focus groups, black women made it clear that when politicians talk about the "greater good," they usually don't include what's good for black Americans.
And herein lies part of the reason for black women's considerable interest in politics: We don't have the luxury of ignoring it.
The message for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush? Concentrate on a greater good that includes black women. Starting with Oprah is great. Just don't end there.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: AN ILLINOIS RACE;
2 Moderates in a Close (and Polite) Race for an Open Seat

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: WAUKEGAN, Ill.

 BODY:
This town about 40 miles north of Chicago is prime territory for Democrats. Economically downtrodden and racially diverse, it has problems including pollution in Lake Michigan and crime in the streets.
But Waukegan happens to be part of one of this year's closest Congressional elections, so on a crisp day recently the Republican candidate, Mark Steven Kirk, opened a satellite campaign office here and talked about environmental cleanup and poverty in ways that sometimes made him sound like a candidate from the other side. 
 "Waukegan is not a dumping ground," Mr. Kirk told a small crowd. "It is our home, and we are going to make it better. We are going to go into the public housing projects and talk about community renewal."
In a district with some of the state's wealthiest suburbs as well as several poor communities, Mr. Kirk is in a dead heat with the Democrat candidate, Lauren Beth Gash. They are seeking the seat that has belonged, for the last 21 years, to John Edward Porter, a moderate Republican who always won re-election easily but decided not to run this year.
Mr. Kirk, who is on leave as counsel to the House International Relations Committee and was Representative Porter's chief of staff from 1987 to 1990, has never held elective office. He is running on the idea that he knows Washington and will uphold Mr. Porter's legacy.
Ms. Gash, a four-term state representative known as a moderate, independent Democrat, is emphasizing her legislative experience and the fact that she has lived for years in the district, in Highland Park, not in Washington.
For a race that both parties consider one of the most critical in the country, there have been remarkably few fireworks. Even some longtime political experts say they see only a few significant differences between the candidates.
"I don't think you're going to get, quite frankly, dramatically different policy outcomes no matter who is elected, Republican or Democrat," said Alan R. Gitelson, a political science professor at Loyola University in Chicago. "That district is not going to allow for somebody who's going to be either extreme to the left or the right. Right now no one's taking bets about who's going to win."
But if no one is putting money on the race, plenty of people are putting money in it, with Ms. Gash having raised about $1.3 million and Mr. Kirk close to $1 million.
Both Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, and John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said they would contest the seat vigorously.
For two decades, the 10th District, which includes towns like Wilmette, with the highest level of postgraduate education in the country, has been comfortable with Representative Porter, a fiscal conservative and social moderate. But in recent years, it has become more hospitable to centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton -- and Ms. Gash.
"When Porter was first elected, the district wasn't growing the way it is now," said John Pelissero, another Loyola University political science professor. "You have younger, more active families in which women are part of the work force, have significant views about politics and are going to be a significant part of the election."
Professor Pelissero thinks that could give Ms. Gash an edge, along with her record on issues like suburban sprawl and health insurance, and her occasional breaks with her party to support Republican bills.
"My voting record is very moderate," Ms. Gash said. "On a regular basis people tell me they're Republicans and I'm the only Democrat they vote for."
Ms. Gash, 39, suggested that being a mother of two teenagers and Jewish in a district with a large Jewish population helped her identify with many voters here. Mr. Kirk, 40, who is engaged to be married, said his advantages included being a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserves and his background in foreign affairs. He now lives in the district, in Wilmette.
Ms. Gash, whose campaign manager left last month amid concerns that she was not getting enough exposure, has a new manager who has helped Democrats win open seats, and a new press secretary on loan from Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, the chairwoman of the House women's caucus.
Mr. Kirk, who won a hotly contested 10-way primary, is distancing himself from Gov. George W. Bush, his party's nominee for president, whom polls show losing ground in Illinois.
While both candidates favor abortion rights and gun control, they differ somewhat. Mr. Kirk opposes late-term abortions and public financing for them, while Ms. Gash supports abortion rights in all cases. Ms. Gash opposes a flat income tax, while Mr. Kirk said he would support one if taxpayers could deduct mortgage payments and charitable interest.
Ms. Gash supports using the federal surplus for Social Security. Mr. Kirk proposes that Social Security be held in individual accounts. He says the funds would not be privatized and people would not be allowed to invest the money, but the government would have to ask their permission to borrow it.
"I do not believe the government should be able to borrow against Social Security," Mr. Kirk said. "The average African-American man is a net contributor to Social Security but passes away before he sees any of it. I want him to have an estate to pass on to his family."
Ms. Gash called that proposal odd. "His response to the mortality rate of African-American men is not to fix the health care system, but to establish a risky scheme for Social Security," she said.
That is about as close as the race has come to a bare-knuckled brawl.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Apple and UAL Lead Market Downward as Quarter Ends

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stocks closed a shaky third quarter shakily yesterday, as negative earnings warnings from Apple Computer and United Airlines pulled down a wide swath of companies.
The profit warnings from Apple and the UAL Corporation, the parent of United, were merely the latest in a string of red flags hung out over the last two weeks by big high-profile businesses. And since companies are not scheduled to actually start reporting their results for another 10 days to two weeks, market strategists said, the possibility of additional bad surprises has investors on edge. 
 "What the market told us in September is that investors are beginning to get concerned that even though the rate of economic expansion is still above trend line, it is decelerating, and may produce more earnings disappointments than analysts expect," said Byron R. Wien, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "As the quarter developed, that suspicion increased."
Major market averages did an about-face yesterday after a sharp rise on Thursday. For the quarter, two of the three declined, and all three are down for the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 173.14, or 1.6 percent, to 10,650.92. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 21.78, or 1.5 percent, to 1,436.51. The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50, or 2.8 percent, to 3,672.82.
For the quarter, the Nasdaq fell 7.4 percent and the S.& P. 500 was down 1.2 percent. The Dow, by contrast, rose 1.9 percent.
But through the first nine months, all three averages are trading below their closing levels on Dec. 31, 1999: the Dow is down 7.4 percent, the S.& P. down 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq down 9.75 percent.
As it was the previous three years, the summer quarter this year proved difficult for stocks. Concerns about rising energy prices, a weak euro and, ultimately, how the two would affect profits, caused stocks to yo-yo throughout the period.
"July was down; August was up, and September was down," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "In July, the reality of slower earnings started to feed into the market. In August, those earnings concerns were overwhelmed by joy that the Federal Reserve Board was done raising short-term interest rates. And in September, earnings concerns have re-emerged."
Investors aggressively sold shares of companies that said they would not meet profit expectations.
Intel, which a week ago came out with a negative earnings report, has fallen severely. The semiconductor giant closed at $41.56 yesterday, down $2.88. For the quarter, the stock fell 37.8 percent, the biggest percentage drop of any Dow 30 stock.
Lucent Technologies is another example. Back in July, the telephone equipment manufacturer said that earnings would fall short of expectations. Since then, the stock, one of the most widely held, has declined more than 48 percent.
Finally, there is Apple. Its warning, which came after the market closed Thursday, generated a torrent of sell orders yesterday.
By the close, Apple's stock stood at $25.75, down $27.75 on the day. The one-day move made the stock the second-worst performer in the Nasdaq 100 for the quarter.
In the last two weeks, 23 companies in the S.& P. 500 index have forecast profit or sales shortfalls. Sixty-four percent of the forecasts that companies have made for their third-quarter results have been negative, according to First Call/ Thompson Financial.
"The third quarter is always the heaviest period for downward earnings revisions," said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Part of that is that as companies get into August and September, they have to get more realistic and share it with analysts."
But there have been bright spots.
Utility stocks, widely seen as the safest investments, were stars in the third quarter, continuing a yearlong advance.
In the quarter, the Dow Jones utilities average rose 29.7 percent. For the year, it is up more than 40 percent. Homebuilders, consumer finance companies and property and casualty insurance companies also had a good quarter.
Boeing was the best-performing Dow stock, its shares rising more than 50 percent. J. P. Morgan was next best. The stock gained more than 48 percent, largely on the strength of its agreement to be bought by Chase Manhattan Bank.
Among the stocks in the S.& P. 500, Manor Care, the assisted-living company, did the best in the third quarter, gaining 124 percent. Owens Corning did the worst, falling more than 71 percent.
Attention -- and hope -- now shifts to the fourth quarter. In recent years, the market has performed best in the final three months.
"Over the last five years, the S.& P. has risen an average of 10 percent in the fourth quarter, and the Nasdaq an average of 15 percent," Mr. Galvin said. "As a percentage of full-year gains, the fourth quarter has represented nearly half of all the annual performance of the market, as measured by the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq."
But Mr. Cliggott said history would have a difficult time repeating itself this year, if only because the Federal Reserve is not likely to prove helpful to stock investors.
Last year, the Fed flooded the banking system with liquidity to ward off potential computer problems associated with the end of the century. At the end of 1998, the Fed eased monetary policy to minimize any damage from Russia's default. And the year before, it did the same because of Asia's financial crisis.
"That is a huge difference," Mr. Cliggott said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATIC RUNNING MATE;
The Lieberman Method of Dismantling Opponents: Subtle as a Ton of Brickbats

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman came here today to deliver a blistering assault on Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record, depicting him as hellbent on ravaging the Alaskan wilderness, and Texas as choking in smog.
John Cobarruvias came away pleased at how positive it had all been. 
 "He talks about the record and sticks to the facts," Mr. Cobarruvias, 44, a computer engineer at NASA, said of Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president. "I'm a rocket scientist, but it doesn't take one to see that it's the other side that's going negative, not this guy."
In fact, Mr. Cobarruvias and 150 others, standing in a forlorn little park in the shadow of an oil refinery, had just heard Mr. Lieberman attack Mr. Bush and belittle Texas for a full 20 minutes.
"Houston, where we are today, is now the smog capital of America," Mr. Lieberman said. "Texas is our most air-toxic-polluted state. Texas is No. 3 in water pollution and, sadly, No. 1 in air pollution."
He derided Mr. Bush's program that emphasizes self-policing by industrial polluters, and said the governor's proposal to drill for oil in an Alaskan wilderness "would cause irreversible damage to one of God's most awesome creations."
But Mr. Lieberman has a rare talent for making attacks that do not come across as attacks. His criticisms, often prefaced by phrases like "I'm sorry to say," or "sadly," and delivered with a litany of supporting detail, sound less like those of an aggressive politician than of a concerned neighbor leaning over a back fence, sharing a troubling bit of gossip.
"He can deliver these pretty hard-hitting messages without any sense of rancor," said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, "and have the listener walk away feeling like he was throwing garlands of flowers. It's a tremendous asset at a time when people are clearly tired of strident attacks."
Critiques of Mr. Bush's policies are a regular part of Mr. Lieberman's pitch, in keeping with the traditional role of the No. 2 man on the ticket, going on the offensive while the presidential candidate tries to float above the fray. He routinely says that Mr. Bush would wreck the economy, return the government to deficits and endanger Medicare; that his record on children's health care in Texas has been disastrous; and that the Republican nominee's promises are hollow because he cannot pay for them.
In the last week, the senator has stepped up his attacks, twice accusing the Republican ticket of trying to deceive voters, and attacking the Congressional voting by the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, against programs like Head Start and subsidized school lunches.
Mr. Lieberman often delivers barbs that his running mate, Vice President Al Gore, avoids, as when he suggested that Mr. Bush was evading debates and coddling the oil industry.
"Governor Bush and Dick Cheney, as you know, have spent most of their professional lives in the oil business," Mr. Lieberman said today. "In fact, within the last 48 hours, I gather that Dick Cheney attended a fund-raiser mostly among oil executives that raised $8 million. That's an awful lot of $2-a-gallon gasoline."
In surveys, voters often say they do not like negative campaigning, but of course, whether it is perceived as negative or just a recitation of the facts can depend on the listener and the way the gibes are phrased.
Where Mr. Cheney, who has taken the lead in attacking Mr. Gore, comes across as reserved on the stump, even dour, the main impression Mr. Lieberman leaves is that he is enjoying himself. Even on the offensive, his relaxed tone never varies, his voice never rises, no hint of distaste crosses his face.
And even Mr. Lieberman's recent, more charged remarks have lacked the sharp, sometimes personal, edges wielded by some other vice-presidential nominees, in a long, bloody, bipartisan tradition. Last week, for example, Mr. Cheney charged that Mr. Gore "simply makes some things up out of whole cloth."
In 1988, Senator Dan Quayle said of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, "He's taken off his Halloween mask" and "exposed" himself as a liberal, while Senator Lloyd Bentsen called Vice President George Bush's campaign "a carnival sideshow of nonsense and negativism." Eight years earlier, Vice President Walter F. Mondale said, "At least when Ronald Reagan rode off in the movies into the fiery sunset, he didn't take us with him" -- a not-so-subtle play on fears that Mr. Reagan would drag the country into war, while George Bush accused President Jimmy Carter of "inciting hatred and division among Americans" by running a "low road, hatchet road" campaign.
The low point for vice-presidential vitriol in modern campaigns may have been reached by Spiro Agnew in 1968, when he accused Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey of being "squishy-soft on Communism," a comment that even Mr. Agnew's fellow Republicans denounced as echoing McCarthyism.
Mr. Lieberman, who has made a point throughout his career of working with Republicans, has a reputation as a gentlemanly, relatively nonpartisan politician, though he won his Senate seat in Connecticut in 1988 with relentless attacks on the record of the Republican incumbent, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
This campaign does not appear to have dented Mr. Lieberman's positive image, much to the frustration of the Bush campaign, which has accused him of hypocrisy in assuming the mantle of bipartisanship while going on the attack.
His aides say Mr. Lieberman can pull it off because he sticks to substance, and his criticisms are well grounded. The candidate himself suggests as much, saying repeatedly, as he did last week at a rally in Fresno, Calif., "Al Gore and I are not going to say a negative personal word about our opponents, but we are going to talk about their policies and where they're wrong."
At stop after stop on the campaign, people who encounter Mr. Lieberman say they do not believe he engages in negative campaigning, even when he has just done so in front of them.
"He's so upbeat," Audrey Kaufman, a retired teacher who said she is not wedded to either party, said after hearing Mr. Lieberman on Tuesday at a center for the elderly in Union, N.J. "I haven't heard anything negative from him."
Actually, she just had. Mr. Lieberman had sought at some length to tear apart, piece by piece, the Bush and Cheney plans for Medicare.
"Their plan is not a real plan, it's a real problem for real people and particularly for real seniors," Mr. Lieberman had said, mocking Mr. Bush's campaign slogan "Real plans for real people."
"America deserves, Al Gore and I believe, better than a plan that takes the care out of Medicare, and the trust out of the Medicare trust fund," Mr. Lieberman said.
When asked about such darts, Ms. Kaufman said: "Those are just the facts. He doesn't exaggerate or say anything personal."
As disputes have arisen in this contest, the harshest words out of the Democratic camp have often come from Mr. Lieberman -- a pattern repeated in today's responses to Mr. Bush's energy plan.
Mr. Gore has said little publicly about Republican criticism over the last week that the Democrats should not raise money from the entertainment industry while attacking it. But last week, Mr. Lieberman said the attacks smacked of desperation by a losing campaign, noting that while he and Mr. Gore had a plan to address violence and vulgarity in popular culture, the Republicans did not.
"I'm looking forward to the day when I see George Bush and Dick Cheney stand up to their friends in the oil industry," he added, "or stand up to the tobacco industry or the N.R.A."
Earlier this month, when Mr. Bush balked at the proposed presidential debates, Mr. Lieberman implied that Mr. Bush was afraid of facing Mr. Gore on national television, and he likened the governor's stance to a football team trying to change the location and rules of the Super Bowl just before the game. Mr. Bush eventually agreed to the debates, though with some changes in format.
In the last week, Mr. Lieberman has taken to poking fun at the many slogans Mr. Bush has used. "He says that we should leave no child behind," Mr. Lieberman said in Albuquerque. "But I am sad to say that in Texas, the fact is that he has left more than one million children who need health insurance behind. That's Governor Bush's real record, what that real record has meant to real people, real children, in the state of Texas."
Professor Baker spent time in close quarters with Mr. Lieberman early this year, when he joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation that traveled to Russia and Germany.
"He has almost a pastoral quality to him," even when expressing an opinion strongly, Professor Baker said. "If he were Roman Catholic, he'd be a great parish priest."

HEADLINE: More a Loop Than a Knot

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, Sept. 29

 BODY:
There have long been two competing visions of Europe's future. The first envisages a loose association of democratic nations; the second dreams of a federal United States of Europe, a power that the French see balancing American "hegemony."
In the last week, two seemingly disparate events -- the Danish rejection of Europe's common currency and the new challenge to Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power in Yugoslavia -- appear to have shifted the balance away from the "deep" European federation dear to many German and Gallic hearts, and toward a "wide" quilt of democracies. 
 For if Mr. Milosevic is removed from power, as now seems more likely than at any time in the last decade, the last major obstacle to a Europe of democracies and market economies from the Atlantic to the Urals would disappear. Such liberty, for the whole continent, would be unprecedented, and would effectively achieve what former President George Bush called "a Europe whole and free."
At the same time, the Danes have given a clear signal by their vote that "deep Europe" -- the idea of eventually forging a federal European government and parliament with real authority, as suggested this year by the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer -- faces severe problems because attachment to national identity is resurgent in some areas.
Most ministers from the 15-nation European Union tried today to put a brave face on the Danish vote, pointing out that the Danish economy is small. The euro held steady at its low level of 88 cents, reflecting the fact that a Danish rejection had already been factored in. But Karl-Heinz Grasser, the right-wing Austrian finance minister, put the situation bluntly: "This is certainly a step back for European integration."
Five years ago, Helmut Kohl, as German chancellor, made clear his determination to compel Europe toward that integration. "We will make the process of unifying Europe irreversible in the next two years or so," he declared in 1995.
His chosen weapon was the euro, and the "Europe" he referred to was the narrow Europe of the European Union. Throughout the 1990's, Western European governments focused on the creation of the euro even as a "velvet curtain" was quietly established keeping post-Communist states like Poland and Hungary outside the European Union.
That policy had several consequences: post-Communist states joined NATO before linking with their European neighbors; the European Union long paid scant attention to the violent upheavals that swept southeastern Europe; and signs of suspicion began to emerge between Western Europe and its cold-shouldered Central European neighbors.
In an article titled "Who will defend the cause of an enlarged Europe?" four European intellectuals asked that question in Le Monde this week: "Why, more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have Western European leaders done so little to convince their populations that the extension of the the European Union to the center, east and southeastern Europe is in their long-term interest?"
After the Danish vote, a shift of focus toward answering that question seems inevitable. European "deepening" has been battered. At the very least, as Jonathan Eyal, a British strategic analyst, observed, "the Danes have ensured that those European countries that want rapid political integration will be obliged to do it alone."
In other words, if Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium want a single European defense, a single foreign policy, a single economic policy and ultimately some sort of pan-European government behind the euro, they will probably have to go ahead and do it without Denmark, Britain and other states more suspicious of the "unification" that was always the political project that the euro masked.
A "two-speed" Europe would result, one potentially more attractive to the likes of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, countries daunted by the budgetary and other demands of joining the euro and suspicious of any abandonment of the sovereignty they have only just recovered from the defunct Soviet Union.
But there are problems in the path of a victory of European "widening" over "deepening." Some of the very forces propelling a reaction against European federalism are nationalist movements suspicious of immigration and of what they portray as a potential "invasion" of cheap labor from the east if countries like Poland, let alone Balkan republics, are allowed into the European Union.
Pia Kjaersgaard in Denmark and Jorg Haider in Austria are among the politicians who have won a strong following with such a mesage. Their appeal is likely to be accentuated if Europe's current upbeat economic mood sours.
Another obstacle to Europe looking east rather than inward is the euro's problematic path. Markets see a common currency unbacked by the coherent fiscal policies that a single government provides, so pressure exists for more political integration. "A politically weak Europe produces a weak euro," said Dominique Moisi, a French political analyst. "It's as simple as that." What is not simple, especially after the Danish vote, is to know what to do about that conundrum.
Far clearer, in recent days, is the European conviction that Mr. Milosevic must go. The governments of the European Union, which long compromised with Mr. Milosevic, have been swift and trenchant in backing the Yugoslav opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, in his electoral victory. A "Europe whole and free" seems to have become a realistic goal.
For the United States, this "wide" Europe is appealing. Although the Clinton administration has always said European unification is in America's interest, and formally supported the euro, the strategic attraction to Washington of a federal United States of Europe has never been entirely clear.
But a democratic Europe at peace, cooperating economically without integrating politically, heterogeneous rather than monolithic, poses no such problems. For it offers the United States a vast and stable market, without the European political cohesion that might one day counter or offset American strategic dominance.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CHRISTIAN COALITION;
Bush Will Address Christian Group After All

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
After some prominent Christian conservatives grumbled about Gov. George W. Bush's decision to skip the Christian Coalition's annual conference this weekend, the Bush campaign reversed itself today and announced that the governor would address the convention by videotape on Saturday.
The announcement of Mr. Bush's change of heart came after Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition chairman and founder, had complained earlier this week, and again today, that Mr. Bush was "taking a risk" by not speaking before the group. 
 "I think it's up to him to encourage this base to come out and work," Mr. Robertson told reporters this morning. "We'll do what we can. But if he doesn't, then he's taking a risk."
Responding to questions about whether Mr. Bush, who has tried to avoid being labeled as too conservative, was trying to distance himself from the evangelical organization, Mr. Robertson replied, "He's not distancing himself, but he's taking a risk. He thinks that he has the Christian base all locked up."
Asked if he thought that Mr. Bush indeed had the Christian conservative vote in hand, Mr. Robertson smiled and said, "We'll find out the first week of November."
Mr. Robertson's remarks echoed concerns he raised when aides to Mr. Bush said he would not attend the convention because he would be preparing for the debate with Vice President Al Gore next week.
The Christian Coalition has been considered a powerful ally of the Republican Party and its presidential nominees since it was created in 1989. In 1992, President George Bushspoke before the group. In 1996, Bob Dole made a surprise appearance at the conference -- though only after coming under sharp criticism for initially turning down an invitation.
One presidential candidate who wanted to address the convention but was not invited was Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party nominee. An aide to Mr. Buchanan, a popular figure among Christian conservatives, said his campaign made repeated overtures to Christian Coalition officials seeking an invitation, but never got a response.
Critics of the coalition said that snubbing Mr. Buchanan showed that the group had become an appendage to the Republican Party.
There was little doubt in the convention hall today that Mr. Bush had the group's overwhelming support. The featured speakers included most of the Republican Congressional leadership, all of whom promoted Mr. Bush's campaign agenda.
Lynne Cheney, wife of Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, used her afternoon speech to challenge the honesty of Vice President Al Gore. Mrs. Cheney accused the Democrats of duplicity for criticizing the entertainment industry for marketing adult materials to children, and then accepting its campaign contributions, and of trying to mislead voters about their views on abortion.
"They try to make it seem as though they want abortion to be rare," Mrs. Cheney said. "But they celebrate when the Food and Drug Administration approves RU-486. They want to make it seem as though they are reasonable people, and then they support one of the most horrendous outrages against life, partial birth abortion."
Most of the speakers warned that a Democratic president would appoint federal judges that would tolerate abortion rights. But to an unusual degree, many of the speakers avoided the kind of heated words on contentious social issues that had typified past conventions. That is in keeping with the tone of Mr. Bush's campaign, which has focused on education and economic issues.
Even Mr. Robertson, who in 1996 complained that Mr. Dole seemed to be running for "chief accountant" by emphasizing economic issues over moral ones, devoted much of his speech to advocating tax cuts and smaller government.
Many people here said that they would like to hear Mr. Bush talk more about his opposition to abortion, as well as other moral issues. But most said they understood that he might have to minimize those views to win centrist voters.
"This way he won't offend people who are pro-choice," said Jeffrey P. Schneider, the chairman of the Christian Coalition in Kankakee County, Ill. "He's making a smart political move."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush, in Energy Plan, Endorses New U.S. Drilling to Curb Prices

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: SAGINAW, Mich., Sept. 29

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush outlined a wide-ranging energy plan today that called for more domestic fuel production, better relations with foreign oil suppliers and opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, all of which he framed as potential remedies for rising oil and gas prices.
Mr. Bush said the plan, which also included incentives for developing alternative energy sources and clean-burning fuels, reflected his determination to limit the country's vulnerability to the international oil market and to avert escalating prices and energy shortages. 
 But it also gave Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, an opportunity to attack Vice President Al Gore on the heels of Mr. Gore's call last week for the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Bush characterized this step, which President Clinton indeed took, as proof of how shortsighted the Clinton administration had been.
"They have had seven and a half years to develop a sound energy policy," Mr. Bush said. "They have had every chance to avoid the situation that confronts us today. And now they have nothing but excuses, bad ideas and -- as the clock runs out -- one last ploy."
In a sign of the issue's sudden potency, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, rearranged their schedules so they could deliver their own remarks on energy and the environment. Both said Mr. Bush's plans for the Arctic refuge would cause irreversible environmental damage. Page A13.
The political cross-fire was intense. Mr. Bush, in a speech to workers at a plant here that produces machinery for car manufacturers, cast Mr. Gore as a liberal extremist -- and a slightly loopy one at that. The terms he used were tailored to Michigan, a swing state economically dependent on the automobile industry.
"The administration seems never to have concerned itself with the domestic energy supply, except to tax, regulate and therefore diminish it," Mr. Bush said. "The vice president likes electric cars -- he just doesn't like making electricity. In speeches, he calls autoworkers his friends. In his book, he declares the engines they make an enemy."
Although Mr. Bush had drawn the contours of his positions on energy issues before, he filled them in with new details today, and he put the price of his proposals at $7.1 billion over 10 years.
Of Mr. Bush's proposals, the most contentious is the opening of the Arctic refuge, about 19 million acres of wilderness in northeast Alaska that is home to caribou, bears, musk oxen and migratory birds.
Mr. Bush specified that he wanted to allow oil exploration in only 8 percent of this federally owned land and insisted it could be done in an environmentally sensitive manner.
Environmental watchdog organizations vigorously disagreed, and said the polluting effects of drilling would spread wide and far.
Adam Kalton, the Arctic campaign director of the Alaska Wilderness League, likened the opening of the refuge for oil drilling to "damming the Grand Canyon for hydroelectric power or capping Old Faithful in Yellowstone for geothermal power." And Mr. Kalton said it would not produce a significant amount of oil for American consumers for more than five years.
While portions of the wildlife preserve are spectacularly beautiful, the coastal plain -- the 1.5 million-acre section along the Beaufort Sea where the drilling would take place -- is flat, largely featureless and frozen much of the year. But to environmentalists, its unspoiled desolation, and its role in the complex ecosystem of the North Slope, argue for leaving it untouched.
Mr. Bush also said he would instruct the Department of Energy to identify other federal lands that could be opened to oil and natural gas exploration, which many environmentalists also oppose.
He did not call for more offshore oil drilling and had previously indicated his opposition to new leases for such drilling along the coasts of Florida and California, two states with many electoral votes and pockets of strong opposition against the practice.
Mr. Bush repeatedly alluded today to the administration's move to release 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserve, a resource usually seen as a fallback during times of war or major supply disruptions. Mr. Bush called the current release "a calculated political move" and noted its timing "just weeks before an election."
But his speech and plan were much broader than that accusation. They criticized what he said was an increasing dependence in this country on foreign oil, forecast rapidly rising demands for energy and delineated a variety of ways to meet those demands.
"This administration tries to take credit for our economy," Mr. Bush said. "But they seem too have forgotten what makes it run. Even today -- in our new, high-tech economy -- America runs on oil and gas and coal gained from the earth and water held behind our dams."
Continuing a weeklong effort to wrest the issue of prosperity from Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush warned that the absence of a comprehensive energy plan, which he said the Clinton administration had never developed, was an invitation to economic gloom.
"Our nation has had three recessions in the last generation," Mr. Bush said, "and each one was tied to an energy shock."
His plan also contained an array of other proposals intended to please a variety of constituencies. Mr. Bush called for an additional $1 billion over 10 years for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income people with their heating and cooling costs. He also called for $1.4 billion over 10 years in additional federal financing for federal and state programs that encourage energy conservation.
Expressing a concern for clean air, Mr. Bush proposed an investment of $2 billion over 10 years for research into "clean coal" technologies; tax credits of $1.4 billion over 10 years for companies that produced electricity from renewable and alternative fuels, and legislation requiring electric utilities to reduce harmful emissions.
Mr. Bush said he would channel the billions of dollars the federal government would receive from the oil companies that went into the Arctic refuge toward land conservation efforts and research into alternative energy resources.
One advocacy group, Environmental Defense, even while voicing opposition to drilling in the Arctic refuge, praised Mr. Bush for suggesting steps to cut down on pollution.
Mr. Bush also sought to tailor his plans to the high-tech world. He said the equipment needed to power the Internet consumes 8 percent of all the electricity produced in the United States, and he pledged to promote the production of more electricity to meet that demand.
But he also promised to use diplomacy to persuade OPEC to pump more oil and to increase oil imports from other areas of the world. He also called for an annual meeting of the energy ministers of the leading industrialized nations to "encourage international energy cooperation."
Democrats have characterized both Mr. Bush, a former oilman in Texas, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, the former chief executive of the world's largest oil-fields services company, as pawns of the oil industry.
Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, charged today that portions of Mr. Bush's plan were "of big oil, by big oil and for big oil."
But in an interview today, Mr. Cheney said that his experience in the oil business convinced him that it was possible to explore for oil without harming the environment.
"For us to fall into the trap that either we develop energy resources or you have a clean environment -- I think is a mistake," he said in an interview on Political Points, a Webcast produced by ABC News and The New York Times.
"One of the things I learned during my time in the private sector over the course of the last several years," Mr. Cheney said, "is that technologies have become very good at allowing us to develop resources that we couldn't have developed a few years ago, in ways that are environmentally safer than they were a few years ago."
And part of what Mr. Bush was trying to accomplish today was the portrayal of his and Mr. Cheney's professional backgrounds in a positive light.
When Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, introduced him to the crowd in Saginaw, she said that because he had grown up in Midland, Tex., and later worked in the oil business there, he had an especially keen understanding of the energy industry.
 
In His Own Words
 
GEORGE W. BUSH
Remarks in a speech in Saginaw, Mich., yesterday outlining his energy policy:
"So America must have an energy policy that plans for the future, but meets the needs of today. Here, as elsewhere, the voters have a clear choice. Here, as elsewhere, the contrast is stark. My plan opens the door to more energy to fuel a growing economy and a new economy. We take the path of exploration and innovation and national self-reliance.
My opponent takes a different path. In a long Washington career, he has supported higher energy taxes and higher energy prices, more regulation and more central controls. In 1993, my
opponent cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to raise gasoline taxes.
He is proud of that vote and everything else he has done to place limits on energy. That year, he wanted an even greater tax -- the so-called B.T.U. tax -- one that his own administration figured would cost the typical consumer $320 a year.
All this comes from a certain view of the world.
See, my opponent believes the consumption of energy is the problem and must be discouraged -- by taxes and regulations. It helps explain why he has never made energy production a priority. It is the reason he views American oil producers as adversaries and the automobile as a threat."
