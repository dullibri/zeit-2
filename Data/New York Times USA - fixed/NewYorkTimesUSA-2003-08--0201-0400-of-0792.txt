HEADLINE: After a Break, Verizon Talks To Split in Two 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
After more than a week of intense negotiations with the assistance of a top federal mediator, Verizon and its two main unions said yesterday that they would take a break from contract discussions until Tuesday.
 When the talks resume, the two sides plan to meet at two regional bargaining sites, and will not -- for the time being -- continue to negotiate in Washington with the direct assistance of the mediator, Peter Hurtgen, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. 
 So far, the negotiations have forestalled a strike, with the mediator playing a significant role in keeping the sometimes contentious discussions from falling apart. 
Late yesterday, the two sides declined to characterize their progress in the talks or discuss the plan to split them, after being instructed by Mr. Hurtgen not to discuss the negotiations publicly. The move seems to reinforce the unions' contentions on Thursday that Verizon had made proposals on job security that the union felt needed to be addressed at a regional level.
Workers represented by the two unions have worked without a contract since last Saturday. They were poised to strike last Sunday at midnight but suspended the walkout because they said the progress in the talks had been encouraging. Since that time, the union has expressed varying degrees of optimism about the discussions, while the company has been more consistent in saying that they were making progress.
The two sides remain divided over health care benefits and job security, union officials said. The company has said it needs more flexibility in laying off and transferring workers. 
When the two sides resume talks on Tuesday, they plan to do so at two locations, in Rye, N.Y., and Washington. Union officials have said the split talks are needed because the latest company proposals would affect 26 local agreements in different ways, and therefore require more detailed bargaining. In moving to the regional bargaining structure, the discussions are in fact returning to the setting where they began, before the mediator became involved in late July.
Some people close to the talks said the mediator felt the parties were tired, needed some days off and could use a different framework for continued discussions. 
A strike of the 78,000 operators and technicians represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers could affect service in the District of Columbia and 13 states in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. During a strike by those unions in 2000, consumers had trouble getting through to operators and faced delays in installation of new phone lines. 
Some industry analysts said they had not expected talks to go on this long without a strike. "It's surprising it's gone this smoothly, though seemingly there are still snags," said Patrick J. Comack, an analyst with Guzman & Company, an investment bank.
Union officials say their decision not to strike is part of a deliberate strategy to force the company to pay two work forces -- the current union workers and replacement workers who have been retained by Verizon to take their places in the event of a strike. The union estimates that the company was paying $1 million a day for strike preparation even before a walkout.
Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon, who declined to comment on the cost of the preparations, said, "Our commitment is to serve customers irrespective of what the union does."

HEADLINE: Utopia's $500 Million Repair Bill; 
Co-op City, Once a Working-Class Dream, Is Crumbling

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Co-op City, the cooperative apartment complex built for working people in the Bronx, no longer cooperates nor works quite the way it used to.
 The parking garages are collapsing. The balconies are falling apart. Many of the 80,000 windows are broken. The power plant is crippled. The elevators shudder. The roofs leak. 
 The sprawling complex, which sits on more than 300 acres between Interstate 95 and the Hutchinson River Parkway, is home to more than 50,000 people. If it seceded from the borough, it would form the 12th largest city in the state.
Its financial problems are equally immense. It faces an emergency repair bill of nearly $500 million. Meanwhile, its tenant corporation runs a deficit of $7 million every year.
"So where are we now?" asks the narrator of a video its managers recently made to publicize the crisis. "In a mess."
The mess is everywhere in Co-op City. The crumbling garages have forced the residents to turn their largest park into a parking lot. The crumbling balconies have forced them to erect wooden fences in front of every building, lest chunks of concrete fall on someone's head.
"We carom from crisis to crisis," said Herbert D. Freedman, a representative for Marion Scott Real Estate, Inc., which was brought in four years ago to manage the 15,000-unit complex. "There's just no time for preventative action. Crisis is all we do."
The roots of Co-op City's crisis stretch back to 1968, when the first of 35 apartment buildings was erected on the old site of the Freedomland amusement park. New York State oversaw construction under its Mitchell-Lama housing program, devised to create housing for low- and middle-income families by providing tax exemptions or low-interest mortgages.
From the beginning, construction work at Co-op City, everybody agrees, was shoddy. The heating pipes were poorly laid, the concrete badly poured. Some buildings were built without the reinforcing bars needed to make them safe.
Ever since, the residents and state officials have been arguing over who should pay for the repairs. Last month, the squabble intensified when Riverbay Corporation, the tenants' group, stopped all mortgage payments to the state.
It is this discord between the residents and state officials, as much as poor construction, that has led to Co-op City's current crisis.
The residents have said the state must give them money, but they have refused to pass an increase in maintenance fees since 1995. The state has offered more than $200 million for repairs, but residents and managers claim it is not enough. They worry that if they take the money, they will not get any more.
Co-op City occupies a special place in the imagination of New York. It is not only the country's largest cooperative apartment complex, it is a sort of working-class utopia where -- at least according to its original ideals -- firefighters, postal workers, plumbers, carpenters and clerks could buy affordable apartments in which to make their homes.
Even now, a three-bedroom apartment there costs little more than $12,000. The monthly maintenance fees range from $450 to $1,050. The rich do not live in Co-op City; apartments are sold only to families earning less than $100,000 a year.
Since Co-op City was founded for the working class, the fight to fix it has taken on the unsavory odor of class warfare. "We're not politically important," said Al Shapiro, president of Co-op City's board of directors. "We're the elderly and the minorities. No one loves us. The upscale areas get all the attention."
Mr. Shapiro, 63, happily describes himself as a humble plumber from the Bronx. He is a rough-edged, grouchy type, but still believes in the ideals of Co-op City.
"This is the last decent bastion of affordable housing left in New York City," he said. "We have all races here and all religions, and everyone gets along. The rest of America should work like this."
The problem with the last decent bastion of affordable housing is that it is completely broke. Co-op City owes the state more than $100 million in arrears on its mortgage. Moreover, it narrowly avoided a maintenance strike on Thursday by a staff that has long complained of being underpaid.
For more than 20 years, Co-op City ran itself; carpenters and housewives had to negotiate complicated service contracts in their spare time after dinner or at lunch. In 1999, the board hired Marion Scott, which has managed Co-op City ever since.
Although the managing agents have maintained a pleasant face in public, privately they say that even with money from the state, there is no way for Co-op City to survive without an increase in maintenance fees. 
State officials say they want to continue working with Co-op City in order to resolve the crisis.
"What we want to do is recapitalize Co-op City and provide them with the funds to get it done," said Sally Crockett, a spokeswoman for the state Housing Finance Agency. "Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to move forward and, yes, that is frustrating for us."
Nearly a decade ago, there were murmurings that Co-op City ought to privatize. The argument was that, if apartments there were allowed to float to market rates, some residents would sell and a cut would go to Riverbay's account.
Mr. Shapiro, initially a critic of privatization, has grudgingly come around. Although he said that it was repugnant that a young family might one day have to pay far more for an apartment than he once did, Co-op City needs the cash. "It's morals versus economics," he said.
Even with Mr. Shapiro's reluctant support, there is little chance that Co-op City will soon go private. In a recent vote, 80 percent of the shareholders said they did not want to privatize. In a separate vote, nearly half the residents refused to create a committee that would simply explore the issue.
In the meantime, concrete falls from balconies. A back-up generator keeps the hot water flowing in winter. And sometimes, when the up button is pressed on certain elevators, they go down.
In a few more days, Co-op City's largest open space, the Greenway, will be covered in asphalt. With six garages closed for repairs, the space is needed to park hundreds of stranded cars.
"It used to be beautiful here," said Crissa Skarimbas, Co-op City's director of community relations, as she stood near the Greenway the other day. Steamrollers lumbered across the torn-up sod. The stink of tar was in the air.
"People used to come here and picnic, chill. It was nice," she said. "You know what we all are going around singing these days? That old Joni Mitchell song: 'They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.' "

HEADLINE: Drawing Stares and the Police but Not Many Buyers 

BYLINE:  By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
Robb Woldman was driving his new electric vehicle on a Los Angeles sidewalk when a police officer tried to ticket him. But Mr. Woldman was acting in compliance with California law, and the law in 44 other states, which allows his vehicle, the Segway Human Transporter, to be driven on the sidewalk. 
 "The officer had to make four phone calls before he found out that I wasn't doing anything wrong," Mr. Woldman said. "He had never seen a Segway before." 
 That's not surprising given how few Segways have been sold since they became available to consumers last November. 
When it was developed and financed during the heady technology boom, the Segway seemed like a sure thing with its ingenious technology. Since then many dot-com era ventures have failed. And Segway, though it survives, has to prove that it can last as a real business, and not just as a cool idea. 
With 5 gyroscopes, 2 tilt sensors, dual redundant motors and 10 microprocessors, the transporter, which can travel at up to 12.5 miles an hour, is a diminutive object of envy in an age of Hummers and Lincoln Navigators. Ride one, and neighbors gather to try it and drivers pull over to watch.
But despite the device's appeal, industry observers and Dean Kamen, Segway's inventor, agree that Segway L.L.C., which is privately held and does not release sales figures, is not anywhere near selling the 40,000 units that the company's factory in Bedford, N.H., is capable of turning out each month.
The company began commercial production of the vehicle in April 2002 and started taking orders from the public late last year. By then, the economy was shrinking, unemployment was up, and technology spending of all sorts was down. 
In the last year, the company has sharply lowered its sales expectations, hoping the market will grow eventually.
The almost $5,000 price tag is a factor in modest demand. A somewhat cheaper, scaled-down model is due out shortly, but its currently undisclosed price is expected to remain high for most consumers. 
And it is not just price that is keeping sales low, critics argue. Rather, they say, while the machine is elegant and fun, it does not providea real nonpolluting transportation alternative for the masses.
"I think of the Segway like a "Jeopardy" question. What is the question to which Segway is the answer?" said Herman B. Leonard, a professor of public management at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. For the Segway to be a success, he said, riders need room to maneuver and confidence that the battery will not die on the return trip. "Unless you are elderly or have limited mobility, why wouldn't you use a bike?" he asked.
Yet the fact that bicycles have not flooded American cities is a good indication that a new technology is needed, Mr. Kamen argues. "People now use cars because they don't have viable options," he said. "The Segway gives people an alternative to contributing to a polluted environment cluttered with automobiles."
Early on, investors whose expectations were driven by boom-era optimism believed that the transporter would be a huge seller almost instantly.
John Doerr, a venture capitalist, said in 2000 that the Segway was "as big as the Internet, as far as making a difference," Steve Kemper recounts in his book "Code Name Ginger: The Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World" (Harvard Business School Press, 2003). Mr. Doerr predicted the company could earn $500 billion three to five years after sales began, Mr. Kemper was told. 
Segway received $88 million in private investment, with Mr. Doerr's company, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Credit Suisse First Boston Equity Partners, each investing $38 million and other private investors putting in $12 million, according to Mr. Kemper.
But the company incorrectly positioned the product, said Karl Ulrich, associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of a textbook on product design.
"By putting Segways on sidewalks, the company is saying their transporter is just like walking, but better," said Mr. Ulrich, who founded an electric bicycle and scooter company that is now defunct. "That implies the device is for one-to-two-mile trips. That is not a great market niche." 
"To feel safe, people will travel half the stated range of a device, and users won't stand more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time," Mr. Ulrich said. "There could be a good market for the product if it cost $1,000, but there is so much technology in the device that that could be impossible."
Using redundant computing and sensing systems to drive and balance each wheel independently means that Segway's parts alone cost the company at least $1,500, Mr. Ulrich contends. "I don't see how they can charge customers less than $3,000 for this design," he said, noting that simpler alternatives like electric scooters could cost a third that price. 
While not commenting on his costs, Mr. Kamen agrees that a substantial price drop is not imminent. The public should think of the cost of Segway technology akin to that of a car, rather than, say, that of personal computers. "Electronics prices drop, but cars do not get cheaper," he said. "Could we design and engineer a lower price point? Sure, but this could take years."
Mr. Ulrich believes that considerable time will be needed for success. "With the exception of Viagra, there are zero instances of new technologies taking off in just three or four years," he said. 
Even with the company's modest sales, it can continue to develop a less-expensive model for a worldwide market, said Michael Schmertzler, a Segway director and chairman of the Credit Suisse investment committee. "No one sees this generation of product as a solution for emerging markets," he said. "Can we wait for several years for Segway to be a financial success? Within reason, we can wait."
For now, early reports indicate that the Segway is well received in some government agencies. Seattle water meter readers have been testing 10 Segways since September. Based on fuel prices and other factors, the cost-benefit ratio of using a Segway compared with a standard gasoline-powered vehicle is greater than two to one, according to Matt Rathke, an engineer at the city's Fleets and Facilities Department. "We do see benefits to using a Segway, and we will buy five more," he said. "But we won't just throw money to the wind by buying a fleet of them."
Since mid-July, the New York City Police Department has had 30 officers sharing 10 Segways to cover foot-patrol beats in Coney Island, Central Park, Times Square and other locations. "When it's not raining, it's ideal for the park. The officers have been very positive about using them," said Inspector Michael Coan, a police department spokesman.
Segways are not legal on the sidewalks of New York for private citizens. 
In Los Angeles, the police of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have found the Segway useful. "It's good for officers; standing on the Segway makes them look eight inches taller, and they can cover two to three times the area they could otherwise," said Robin Blair, a transportation planner. "This is the first- generation Segway; like the first PC, it's a nice toy and it can solve some problems."
Later this year, the California Department of Transportation will sponsor a rental test in Pleasant Hill, a city in the San Francisco Bay area. Commuters will be able to rent a Segway to ride to the BART train station in the morning, leave it at the station for a commuter getting off the train to use, with the process reversing at night. 
Mr. Kamen says he continues to believe that his device will eventually become a major part of the answer to transportation problems, even if it takes longer than he and others thought a few years back, when new technologies and ventures seemed to be blessed by the gods. 
"I'd like to think that the Segway will become a piece of our infrastructure," he said. "Every new technology starts out as a novelty, and then things usually turn out differently than expected."

HEADLINE: SoHo-Inspired Lofts With Views of Houston 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Weathered red brick exterior? Check. Concrete floors? Check. Nineteen-foot-high ceilings? Check. Throw in some gargoyles and voila, a "faux loft."
 Developers here are tearing down perfectly good buildings or acquiring empty lots to make room for what look like century-old factories. Inside are loft-style apartments that try to mimic the faded mystique of Manhattan neighborhoods like SoHo or TriBeCa. 
 The trend is taking root in several cities without much of a loft tradition, including Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington. But its most active and creative proponents are here in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, where migration from the suburbs to areas closer to downtown has become increasingly fashionable in recent years. 
All the activity has produced red-brick developments like the Manhattan, a new building in the high-end Galleria shopping district. Described by its creators as "reminiscent of the historic buildings that flanked New York City's Fifth and Park Avenues in the late 19th and early 20th centuries," it has 63 loft-style residences and 22 different floor plans.
The lofts in the Manhattan building have their own evocative names, like the Met, Brooklyn and Times Square. (One of the largest and most expensive is Astoria.) They come with features like terraces and whirlpool tubs and have buildingwide amenities like a concierge, resort-style pool and wine cellar.
The Manhattan and other buildings like it, with names like Gotham, Metropolis and Renoir, have caught on mainly with young professionals and retiring baby boomers seeking more of an urban lifestyle and quicker commutes. The trend has also touched off a lively discussion among urban planners and architecture critics here.
"I think the faux lofts are atrocious," said Stephen Fox, a professor of architectural history at Rice University. "They're an expedient, unimaginative and opportunistic way to capitalize on the desire for the urban experience. They're also in keeping with the Houstonian ethos of borrowing styles from everywhere."
Houston, of course, has long been home to an amalgam of styles, like the intricate play between the unassuming Menil Collection museum, designed by Renzo Piano, and the simple gray bungalow houses surrounding it; or the ornate Mediterranean campus of Rice University, an oasis tucked away within the city's seemingly endless collection of low-slung, nondescript neighborhoods. Just a handful of historic buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries remain.
Some residents of the old neighborhoods in which faux loft developments are being built, like the traditionally black Third Ward area south of downtown, view the new apartments with skepticism and even disdain. Madgelean Bush, a longtime resident of the Third Ward and executive director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, said the faux lofts were an example of how Houston does not believe in rehabilitating what it already has.
"I view it as a takeover where the poor are pushed out to make room for rich folks who want to live a kind of fantasy life," Ms. Bush said.
Genuine loft projects have been developed here since the early 1990's, with investors renovating old hotels and warehouses in and around Houston's futuristic downtown. One prominent real estate developer, the Randall Davis Company, branched out into faux lofts after converting an Art Deco building that once housed the Armor Automobile Company into a loft-style community called Hogg Palace. 
The developer's first faux loft building was Metropolis, with large balconies, sweeping views of downtown and five rooftop gargoyle guardians staring down at passers-by. Next came an inspirational shift with Renoir, an edifice with 82 one- and two-bedroom loft apartments intended to evoke Baron Haussmann's 19th-century Paris on the exterior. The Renoir has a resort-style pool, reached through a stepped travertine terrace.
Most of the faux lofts are not cheap, whether sold as condominiums, or rented. Apartments in the Renoir, for example, were priced from $200,000 to more than $800,000, and have nearly sold out. Randall Davis, owner of the development firm of the same name, said "an attention to detail when building from scratch allows you to take it to a higher level." 
"Anyone can expose an air-conditioning duct and call it a loft," Mr. Davis said. "People like something luxurious on the inside that looks on the outside like it's been there a while."
There are many reasons faux lofts are catching on here. Houston, the center of a metropolitan region of more than four million people, remains the only major city in the United States without significant zoning regulations, making it easier for developers to build in any style wherever they please. Houston has few taboos about tearing down old buildings to make way for new structures -- even faux lofts built to look old.
"There's an impulse to reconstruct the past to suit the city's needs," said Stephen Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University.
An aversion to zoning also enabled Houston in recent years to grow in several directions at once, begetting the sprawl that now defines the city. Motorists here drive more miles per capita each day than residents in any other American city, according to a study released last month by the Surface Transportation Policy Project in Washington. The study said each Houstonian drives an average of 37.6 miles a day, a 53 percent increase from the early 1990's.
With more people in Houston seeking to live closer to where they work, apartment construction has recently skyrocketed. Houston led the nation in apartment building in January, with the number of units under construction climbing 73 percent, to 10,436, from 6,043 in the month last year, according to MP/F Research, a real estate analysis company.
"I don't think the faux lofts would go over well in a place with a lot of historical buildings," said Paul Sternberg, a lawyer and native of New Orleans who moved to a loft in the Renoir building after leasing his home to an energy company executive. "But here it just seems natural to want something that feels a little old. The high ceilings are also a plus."
Most faux lofts come with details like separate bedrooms, granite countertops, high arched windows, hardwood floors and Romeo and Juliet balconies. Some are as large as 4,200 square feet and even include Corinthian-style columns and on-site health clubs. Few ever appear as barren as genuine lofts.
The appeal of faux lofts has begun to extend beyond urban areas near downtown, with one faux loft project in the Woodlands, a large suburban enclave on Houston's northern fringe, under development by Threshold Interests, a company that had already converted two downtown buildings into lofts.
Coming amid a broad building boom, this burst of loft-building has added to concern that Houston may be on the cusp of an apartment glut if the economy remains soft. Even some of the faux lofts have started offering special deals to lure tenants, like a month's free rent on a 12-month lease. Some faux lofts already throw in extras like a cafe on premises with free fast Internet connections and espresso or cooking lessons with a gourmet chef.
The faux lofts have generally been able to keep charging relatively high rents for Houston, although they still may not approach the prices of lofts in Manhattan. Sabine Street Lofts, a new building on the edge of downtown that looks like an old factory, charges about $1,700 for a one-bedroom unit and roughly $2,450 for a two-bedroom loft. The average rent for an apartment in Houston is $611 a month, according to Apartment Data Services, a company that tracks rental rates.
It is hard to quantify exactly how many faux loft buildings have been built across the country, because they form a relatively new category. But traditional loft projects are growing in popularity. Sharon Park, who runs a National Park Service program providing tax credits to companies for rehabilitating historic buildings, said the number of projects approved by her office had grown 5 to 10 percent a year since the late 1990's. Nearly half of the projects involved some form of housing, including lofts, she said.
Though the arbiters of taste may frown on the faux lofts, urban theorists are mostly welcoming them as a healthy example of repopulating an urban center that had been left to decay. One such believer is David Crossley, president of the Gulf Coast Institute, a Houston group encouraging greater use of public transportation and improved air quality.
"I don't care about the style of the things," Mr. Crossley said. "If it helps us feel like we're living in a city again, then I'm all for it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: COSTS; 
Deficit Projected at $401 Billion

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said today that tax cuts and big increases in military spending were the biggest reasons for the federal government's huge budget deficit this year, but predicted that this year's deficit will be slightly smaller than the Bush administration predicted last month.
 The Congressional agency, which tracks the government's cash flow every month, predicted that the deficit for this fiscal year would reach a record $401 billion. Last month, the administration estimated a $455 billion deficit. Still, the agency's estimate would be more than twice as much red ink as in 2002, and a large reversal from the government's $127 billion surplus in 2001. 
 The main difference between the two predictions is that Congressional analysts say military spending has been lower than expected.
The Congressional agency estimated that President Bush's recent tax-cutting package would reduce government revenues by $53 billion in fiscal 2003. In July alone, the treasury mailed $4.5 billion in tax refund checks, and reductions in federal withholding rates cut revenue by a similar amount.
The biggest surprises in the Congressional report were that military spending were running about $18 billion less than the White House estimate and that spending for domestic security and international programs appeared to be lower than the administration estimated.
The Congressional and administration predictions both anticipate a budget deficit of more than $400 billion, up from $246 billion in 2002 and a budget surplus in 2001.
Though this year's federal deficit would be a record in actual dollars, it is still far less than shortfalls in the 1980's when measured as a percentage of the nation's total economy.
The Congressional analysts predict that this year's deficit will amount to slightly less than 4 percent of the gross domestic product. It was equal to about 6 percent in 1986.

HEADLINE: SWIMMING; 
Backstroker Won't Allow Age To Curtail His Olympic Dream

BYLINE:  By FRANK LITSKY

DATELINE: COLLEGE PARK, Md., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Jeff Rouse had a glorious swimming career: a silver medal in the 100-meter backstroke and a gold in the 4x100 medley relay at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics; a gold in each event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics; and induction into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at age 31.
 He also had an itch. As he said in an interview this week: "In the summer of last year, I wanted to lose weight. I was 210, which was 20 pounds extra. I had been totally out of the water for six years except to do clinics. 
 "So I got back in the water in September and it felt good, which made me start thinking: 'Could I swim again? How fast? How fast is everyone else doing? Could I make the Olympic team again?' "
Rouse decided to find out. "I knew making the 2004 Olympic team was possible," he said. "I was not getting away from something. I just felt pulled to swimming again."
Today, at 33, he is the oldest swimmer at USA Swimming's summer national championships, and he has made the dream continue. In his only event of this five-day meet, the men's 100-meter backstroke, he had the fastest qualifying time and the fastest time of his comeback, 55.66 seconds. In the final tonight, he was three-hundredths of a second faster, but he finished second, behind one of his training partners, Randall Bal (54.63).
Only two Olympic berths are available in each event. Rouse's path to these championships was made easier because Aaron Peirsol and Lenny Krayzelburg, considered the best backstrokers in the world, stayed home. They are the only backstrokers who have ever beaten Rouse's best time of 53.86. He held the world record in the 100 backstroke from 1991 to 1999.
Krayzelburg, who won the 100 and 200 backstrokes in the 2000 Olympics, is recovering from shoulder surgery. Peirsol is recovering from last month's world championships, where he won the 100 and 200 backstroke titles.
Rouse said that when he retired after the 1996 Olympics, he meant it.
"I was so tired, and it was time to move on," he said. "I worked for my sponsors for a couple of years, doing clinics and motivational speaking. Then I worked for Stafford County in Virginia as an economic developer and tourism manager."
In 1992, Rouse earned an economics degree from Stanford. He is training there with Skip Kenney, his college coach. His workouts cover 6,000 meters a day, a light load for a top-level swimmer.
"When he said he was thinking about a comeback," Kenney said, "I told him, 'If you feel it in your heart, go for it; follow your dream.' He's doing that, and he's doing well. Guys who swam with him before say his stroke is flawless in practice."
The 6-foot-3 Rouse, who grew up in Fredericksburg, Va., lives in Menlo Park, Calif., not far from the Stanford campus. He works part time in sales and marketing for a medical information company in the San Francisco Bay area. He flew here earlier than expected when his mother's health deteriorated. She died July 31 of liver cancer.
"I was ready to swim fast," he said before his trial heat. "The last two weeks have been such a roller-coaster mentally and physically, I don't know what's going to happen in the race."
Kenney said he thought Rouse had a good chance to make the Olympic team. John Collins, who coached the backstroker Rick Carey to three gold medals in the 1984 Olympics, was not as optimistic.
"The odds are not in Jeff's favor," Collins said. "He has to get back to his lifetime best or better. He's back, but he's not back yet."
Rouse refused to make a definitive prediction. "I don't know if I'll make the team," he said. "That's what I'm trying to find out. I wouldn't be swimming if I thought I couldn't make it."
And if he does make it?
"I'll really retire after the Olympics," he said.

SPLASHES
MICHAEL PHELPS, the 18-year-old sensation from Baltimore, won his fourth title in three days with a victory in the 400-meter freestyle at the University of Maryland's Campus Recreation Center. His time of 3 minutes 46.73 set an American record, beating the 3:47.00 by Klete Keller in 2000. It was the third-fastest time in the world this year. Phelps finished five seconds ahead of JUSTIN MORTIMER (3:51.74), who edged Phelps in a morning qualifying heat, 3:50.98 to 3:51.03. His previous best of 3:54.12 ranked him 42nd in the world this year. Mortimer, a 21-year-old from Milton, Mass., had never finished higher than fifth at the nationals.

HEADLINE: Can a Barrier Bring Mideast Peace? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "An Israeli Barrier That Could Have Reduced Conflict Is Increasing It," by Ethan Bronner (Editorial Observer, Aug. 8): 
 As Mr. Bronner points out, the construction of the Israeli barrier was prompted by terrorists who infiltrated into Israel to conduct suicide bombings and other murderous attacks. But in calling for removal of Jewish settlements as "the solution" to the barrier, he puts the onus on the wrong party.
Yes, the barrier is making Palestinian life more difficult. But Israel is taking measures to attenuate these difficulties. And responding to its road map obligations, Israel has begun to dismantle new settlement outposts. But the barrier will be needed as long as Palestinian leaders fail to carry out their road map responsibilities by not dismantling Hamas and other terrorist groups.
Horrific murders of Israeli civilians should not be equated with greater discomforts and economic hardships on the Palestinian side.

HEADLINE: Federal Land Managers Ordered to Ease Limits on Gas and Oil 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has directed federal land managers to begin removing obstacles to oil and gas development in parts of five Rocky Mountain states.
 Directives issued last week to state directors of the Bureau of Land Management give them the tools to put into effect the administration's longstanding goal of opening the Rocky Mountain West to increased oil and gas development. Offices in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, have until Dec. 31 to decide on removing the limits. 
 "Our overall objective is to ensure the timely development of these critical energy resources in an environmentally sound manner," the director of the bureau, Kathleen Clarke, said in a statement.
Environmentalists say the policies are another step in White House efforts to give energy development priority over conservation.
"This policy shifts the land management equation in favor of drilling and automatically assumes that oil and gas production is the top value of public lands," said Dr. Pete Morton, a resource economist with the Wilderness Society. 
The bureau manages 261 million acres of federal land, most of it in 12 Western states. In April 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney's energy panel made a goal of removing limits on energy development in the Rockies. A month later, President Bush ordered federal agencies to accelerate the completion of energy projects while maintaining safety, health and environmental protections.
A deputy director of the bureau, James M. Hughes, said the policy directives aimed to use new oil and gas figures from the United States Geological Survey. Mr. Hughes, who sent out the directives, said: "We're saying, 'We've got that report, folks. Let's use it in our land-use plans.' " 
Jim Sims, the executive director of the Western Business Roundtable who was on the staff of Mr. Cheney's energy panel, said the new policies should give managers the flexibility they need to address energy needs in an environmentally sensitive way.
"You can have environmentally sound energy development, and that's what we need to have more of," Mr. Sims said. "A lot of these restrictions and lease stipulations are outdated. Some of them are very, very old, and in the intervening time, production technology has grown by leaps and bounds."
The geological study released this year found 3.9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 139 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in five Rocky basins. The report stated that there were no significant restrictions on drilling for 57 percent of the oil and 63 percent of the gas.
The changes focus on regions in the five states with the highest oil and gas concentrations. They include parts of the Green River and Powder River Basins in Wyoming, where the administration has proposed drilling 39,400 coal-bed methane wells; the Montana Thrust Belt; the Uinta Basin and the Ferron Coal Trend in eastern Utah; the Piceanace Basin in western Colorado; and the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico.
Gail Abercrombie, executive director of the Montana Petroleum Association, said the changes could save time by avoiding duplicate environmental studies and other reviews.
The directives instruct state directors to consider environmental rehabilitation away from drilling as helping the environmental effects.
"They're prepared to sacrifice these areas where they want to go in and drill," Sharon Buccino, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said. "The whole purpose of mitigation is to try to limit the impact of the project you're doing."

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
A New European Keeps a Wary Eye on America

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: UCCELLINA NATIONAL PARK, Italy 

 BODY:
SITTING on a hilltop overlooking the sun-yellowed Tuscan countryside, Romano Prodi, the most visible representative of the European Union, can almost see the future for which he has worked long and hard -- a day when Europe speaks with one voice on world affairs and is listened to by Washington. 
 But for the clouds. 
 There are gathering ones like a brewing accounting scandal at the European Union's statistics bureau in which more than 900,000 euros, or just over $1 million, have disappeared.
Distant ones like Turkey, whose proposed membership in the European Union could make unity on foreign policy difficult to attain. 
Finally, dark ones: the fact that the United States shows little interest in a Europe united behind a common foreign policy, and today often seems to work against it.
Mr. Prodi, 64, has come to Tuscany to relax and reflect before beginning the final year of his five-year term as president of the union's European Commission. He sat, sipping water and talking outside an ochre villa where he and his wife, who have two grown sons, were staying.
The Italian press has nicknamed him "the mortadella," after the bland sausage (known as baloney in the United States) made in Bologna, where he was an economics professor before entering politics. Born in Reggio Emilia, 50 miles from Bologna, he has little of the stiff formality of many Italian politicians -- he is known as an enthusiastic bicyclist -- and was dressed on this occasion in a wine-colored polo shirt and pale-green linen pants. 
But he is a man of sharp opinions, given to emphatic Castro-like enunciation when speaking on subjects about which he feels passionate. European unity, and its importance not only to this continent but also to America, is one of them.
"In this complex world, nobody alone is able to dictate a policy, even a country so strong and so powerful like the United States," he said, his voice alternately gruff and purring. "The great risk of great powers is overstretching."
A unified Europe as America's partner would only increase global stability, he argues. But Mr. Prodi worries that Americans understand neither the value of a united Europe nor the difficulty in securing that unity.
"Their prevalent doctrine today is to have a divided Europe," Mr. Prodi said of the United States, adding that he sees the doctrine as part of a "deep wave" in American history that goes beyond the current administration and is driven by the nation's self-confidence, particularly after its post-Sept. 11 victories in Afghanistan and Iraq. "It is so strong that I don't think that this wave will stop in a short time, remembering that in American history there have always been alternate periods of isolationism and international cooperation."
Meanwhile, Mr. Prodi says, Europeans are building something new and different.
"From our side there is a deep feeling that no European member state can have any voice in the future staying alone," he said sitting in the shade of a parasol pine beside a statue of a wild boar. "But, how to aggregate, this is the challenge of today."
MR. PRODI, a former Italian prime minister, likens 21st-century Europe to 15th-century Italy, whose component nation-states, though individually powerful, had no significant impact on the world after the European discovery of the New World. "The nation states didn't merge, they were divided, and Italy disappeared from the world map," he said. Today's Germany and France "are like Florence or Venice or Milan at that time." 
That may suit the United States just fine, he acknowledged, because internal bickering keeps Europe from presenting a unified challenge to Washington's foreign policy, as in the months before the recent Iraq war. 
But Mr. Prodi argues that it is in the Americans' long-term interest to have a united Europe that can share the political and economic costs of world affairs. "Look how difficult it is to invent a new policy for the postwar Iraq."
In any case, Mr. Prodi said, it will be "decades, not years" before Europe has a totally united foreign policy because "it will be the last piece of sovereignty the member states will pool together."
EUROPE is set to establish a European foreign minister when it ratifies the union's recently drafted constitution. That minister may not have much power for now, but "he will give a symbol and a reference point to build up a foreign policy," Mr. Prodi said.
In the nearer term, he argues, his hope for European unity -- already complicated by competing national interests -- could be difficult if Europe decides to include Turkey, a Muslim country that would be one of the largest members.
He says American pressure to accelerate Turkey's application for membership -- on the basis that having Turkey in the European Union will enhance regional security -- overlooks the longer-term consequences of bringing the country into the union. 
"When they said the process is too slow, I told them, 'Look, I was born in a country where when you were a kid to describe something frightful, you said, 'Mama the Turks!' " Mr. Prodi said, adding, "We have to fight against this deep prejudice."
Last year, the European Union decided that Turkey had not yet met the standards to begin formal membership talks but promised to make another assessment by the end of next year. Mr. Prodi said he would deliver a "complete, fair and objective" opinion before his term as president ended on Nov. 1, 2004.
He said he accepted the strategic importance of Turkey as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East, but worried that the country's size, the peculiarities of its political institutions and its cultural ties to the Middle East could complicate European efforts to forge a common policy.
Mr. Prodi recounted listening to a group of European Parliament members discussing the challenge Turkey presented because its representatives would be the largest group in the Parliament. "It's not a problem of being Muslim but of being so big," he said.
He said the matter of Turkey's membership was too politically sensitive to rush into because it would require approval from all of the union's member states -- 25 after the addition next year of 10 more countries.
"You have to reassure Turkish public opinion, but also reassure European public opinion that you have been serious, because otherwise there will be no ratification, and without ratification the slap in the face of the Turkish people would be terrible," he said.
As for his own future, Mr. Prodi dismisses talk that he is already planning to lead Italy's center-left opposition in the country's next general elections against his political rival, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is serving a six-month stint as the head of the European Union's European Council.
"It's not time to make a decision," Mr. Prodi said. "I want to finish my job in Brussels. I have one year, and one year in politics is an eternity."

HEADLINE: Belated Help for Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Twenty-one months after American-backed forces drove the Taliban from Kabul, Afghanistan remains a long way from recovery and stability. The Bush administration, distracted by Iraq and dismissive of nation-building, initially failed to provide Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, with the help he desperately needed to rebuild his country's economy and institutions, undermining one of America's first and most important accomplishments in the war on terrorism. Fortunately, the White House is now considering a more generous approach. 
 Mr. Karzai's power barely extends beyond Kabul, the only part of Afghanistan patrolled by international peacekeepers. Elsewhere, warlords maintain their own security forces, collect their own taxes and otherwise undermine the government's authority. The rebuilding of vital roads, including the main road between Kabul and Kandahar, has still not been completed. Thousands of students are still studying outdoors in tents. 
 The Pentagon spends $10 billion a year on the 9,000 American troops fighting Taliban remnants, mainly in the east and south of the country. The administration has spent less than $1 billion on reconstruction so far, although Congress has authorized much more. 
Ambassador William Taylor Jr., the State Department's coordinator for Afghan reconstruction, has been developing plans to provide greater support for government ministries. The White House is soon expected to announce a much needed acceleration of reconstruction aid that some reports say could double current spending levels. More money from Washington should prompt additional contributions from Europe and Japan as well. Europe can also make an important contribution to security by agreeing to extend international peacekeeping forces beyond Kabul when NATO takes over command of the mission next week. That will take several thousand additional troops and a new mandate from the Security Council. 
On Sept. 11, America paid a terrible price for not doing more to stabilize Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal in the late 1980's. It cannot afford to repeat that mistake.

HEADLINE: Mayor Bloomberg and the Hispanic Pulse 

 BODY:
In recent days, Mayor Michael Bloomberg marched in parades with Puerto Ricans in the Bronx and with Ecuadoreans in Queens. He went to the Dominican Republic and danced the merengue. The mayor typically begins remarks before Hispanic audiences with a smattering of Spanish, which he has studied for years. The fact is, Mr. Bloomberg has a personal history of engaging Hispanics, dating back to his establishment of a Spanish-language arm of the media empire he ruled before becoming mayor. But little of this seems to have impressed those voters. 
 Hispanics stand out among the New Yorkers most disenchanted with Mr. Bloomberg. A New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 74 percent disapproved of the job he was doing. The ranks of the disenchanted were even higher among the city's largest Hispanic faction, Puerto Ricans. 
 A lot has happened since 2001, when Mr. Bloomberg won about half of the city's Hispanic votes. Working-class Hispanics have been hit hard economically. While the rate of unemployment citywide is 8.8 percent, it runs in double digits in some Hispanic neighborhoods. Off-the-books, low-level jobs that many immigrants depend on, like housekeeping and construction, have become harder to get. College tuition is up, as are sales and property taxes. Those immediate problems weigh more heavily on people than the long-term efforts the mayor has undertaken that address Hispanics' concerns, like planning for more affordable housing and struggling to improve city schools. 
A lot more can happen before the next election -- last time, Mr. Bloomberg may have benefited from anger against his opponent, Mark Green, who had beaten the only Hispanic mayoral candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, in a contentious Democratic primary. Mr. Ferrer has not yet indicated whether he wants to run in 2005, and no one knows who will wind up as Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic opponent. In the meantime, though, the mayor will need to address the fact that nearly half of the New York Hispanics polled said he did not care at all about their needs. To do that, he will need to show that beyond dancing, he is not out of step with them.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: WHITE HOUSE; 
Bush Sees 'Good Progress' In Iraq but With Work to Do

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the United States was making "good progress" in Iraq as the White House released a 24-page report asserting that the American-led occupation had improved the lives of Iraqi citizens and the safety and security of the rest of the world.
 Mr. Bush's comments and the release of the report, titled "Results in Iraq: 100 Days Toward Security and Freedom," represented an aggressive new push by the White House to counter months of American deaths and increasingly grim news out of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. 
 The report said that most of Iraq was calm and that "only in isolated areas are there still attacks." It did not mention the car bomb that ripped through the Jordanian Embassy in the heart of Baghdad on Thursday. 
It said that Iraq's water supply was at prewar levels, that electricity was more stable and that a $53 million program to rehabilitate more than 100 schools was under way.
"I am pleased with the progress we've made, but fully recognize that we've got a lot more work to do," Mr. Bush said in a brief question-and-answer session with reporters, asVice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld stood at his side. They were joined by Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser.
The president made his comments 100 days after he declared major combat operations in Iraq over in a celebratory ceremony off the California coast on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. In his remarks today, delivered in inferno-like heat on the front lawn of his central Texas home, Mr. Bush did not reprise his proud phrase then that "in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed." 
Instead, he spoke in the more practical language of an occupier who was trying to rebuild a country from scratch.
"In a lot of places, the infrastructure is as good as it was at prewar levels, which is satisfactory, but it's not the ultimate aim," he said. "The ultimate aim is for the infrastructure to be the best in the region."
The report was prepared by the White House Office of Global Communications and the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-run administrative organization in Baghdad. It focused on 10 areas where it said the occupation had improved the lives of Iraqis. 
The 10 chapter titles included "Ten Ways the Liberation of Iraq Supports the War on Terror," along with "Ten Signs of Economic Renewal" and "Ten Signs of Cultural Rebirth."
The report did not mention the 56 American troops who have died in Iraq since Mr. Bush declared major combat over.
Under "Ten Signs of Economic Renewal," the report said that banks were open in Baghdad and that the American administrative organization was working to open other banks across the country. In the "Ten Signs of Cultural Rebirth" section, it said that the Baghdad Symphony was performing and that satellite dishes were the most popular items for sale in the Iraqi capital.
But the introduction noted that "the steps toward sovereignty and democracy will be difficult and require patience and time."
In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Bush dismissed the criticism by some Democrats, including Al Gore, that he had misled the public about the threat posed by Iraq. In a speech in New York on Thursday, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of promoting "false impressions" about the need for attacking Baghdad.
"It's just pure politics," Mr. Bush said. "We've got a lot of people running for president, and it's pure politics."
He did not answer a question about whether he agreed with the commander of forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, who said on Thursday that American troops would be in Iraq for at least two more years. Mr. Bush only repeated that "this administration will do what is necessary to win the war on terror."
In additional comments to reporters, Mr. Rumsfeld appeared to acknowledge an article today in Newsday reporting that Pentagon officials had met with Manucher Ghoreanifar, a major figure in the 1980's Iran-contra scandal, in order to push for a change of government in Iran.
"My understanding is some, one or two people were approached by some people who had information about Iranians that wanted to provide information to the United States, that a meeting did take place," Mr. Rumsfeld said. Mr. Bush said only that "we support the aspirations of those who desire freedom in Iran."
Concerning the Middle East, Mr. Bush elaborated on why he is opposed to the construction of a barrier in the West Bank to separate Israelis and Palestinians.
"I've said the fence is a problem because the fence is, you know, kind of meanders around the West Bank, which makes it awfully hard to develop a contiguous state over time," he said, referring to a future Palestinian state.
Mr. Bush met this morning with Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Cheney, Ms. Rice and General Myers about military matters, which included a discussion about whether the number of American troops in Iraq was sufficient to meet the continuing threat of violence. 
When the president was asked if he was satisfied that American troops were not stretched too thin in Iraq, he turned to Mr. Rumsfeld and said, "I'm satisfied."
Mr. Rumsfeld added that he was working to reduce stress on American troops in Iraq, but that he did not see the need "at the present time" to increase the number of American troops in the country.

 Re "Movie Star In, Senator Out for Recall Race in California" (front page, Aug. 7), about the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger's entry into the California gubernatorial recall election: 
 While Mr. Schwarzenegger's profession may dissuade some people from supporting his candidacy, his attributes are evident. He is an Austrian immigrant who came to the United States with little, hoping to fulfill the American dream.
Speaking very little English, as his early films attest, he entered the acting and body-building arena, working hard and aiming for the top.
In the end, he was successful, and this is exactly the type of person we need running California. Mr. Schwarzenegger is the man who can take California from its recession to the top.

 BODY:
Several months before our defense secretary downgraded France to the "old Europe" and our restaurateurs started pouring French wine into the gutters, I was talking with Marc Veyrat, a French chef whose two restaurants have received top scores from the Michelin and Gault-Millau guides. To my surprise, Veyrat told me that the most creative cooks in Europe were no longer French; they were Spanish. Had my source been located in the Pentagon and not in a sumptuous auberge on the shores of Lake Annecy, I would have taken the assertion with several fistfuls of gros sel. However, this declaration of Spanish creative supremacy came from one of the most forward-looking chefs in France. I paid attention. 
 After a trip to Spain this summer, I'm convinced: the effervescence that buoyed French nouvelle cuisine in the 1970's has somehow been piped across the Pyrenees. Nor am I alone in feeling that way. A cover article in The Wine Spectator in June proclaimed that Spain is "the new source of Europe's most exciting wine and food." Many prominent American chefs agree. "Spain is where the zeitgeist has shifted," says Charlie Trotter, Chicago's most celebrated chef. "In Spain, they're pushing the envelope." David Bouley, who oversees two distinguished restaurants in Lower Manhattan, told me: "The Spanish don't have this rigor where they have to cook a certain way. They seem to be totally free. Something happened in France -- they ran out of gas. I don't hear about youthful passion as I used to in those kitchens. The real explosion is with all the young guys in Spain." Even Thomas Keller of the much-honored French Laundry, north of San Francisco, who has some qualms about new-wave Spanish cuisine, remarks that "the French work ethic has deteriorated over the last few years" and that compared with Spain, "you have in France a much more traditional, fundamental-based cooking." 
 You can still eat very well in France, as you did 20 years ago. The problem is that almost everywhere you eat in France, it could still be 20 years ago. Nothing has changed. The French nouvelle cuisine revolutionized the culinary world in the 1970's. Consolidating and advancing, the next generation of chefs maintained France's pre-eminence. But over the last decade, French innovation has congealed into complacency. With the advent of the Internet, as chefs scan the globe for new ideas, France is no longer the place they look. "Everybody on eGullet wants to know what is happening in Spain," says Grant Achatz, the young chef at Trio, a foodie favorite in Evanston, Ill. 
The two epicenters of the Spanish groundswell are both in the northern part of the country -- Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, and the Basque country around San Sebastian. And while there are many exciting chefs throughout Spain, the name on everyone's lips, the man who is redefining haute cuisine into alta cocina, is a prodigiously talented, self-taught Catalan. Like Elvis or Miles, he is usually known by his first name alone: Ferran.
Ferran Adria's restaurant El Bulli in the Catalan seaside town of Rosas, a two-hour drive north of Barcelona, is a gastronome's once-before-you-die mecca. It's not merely the three Michelin stars (although only three other Spanish restaurants boast that distinction) or the top rating in Spain's most influential food guide. The accolades from other cooks are dazzling. He is "the best cook on the planet," the quintessentially French Joel Robuchon, who has garnered similar reviews himself, told the press a decade ago. (When I spoke with Robuchon, he backpedaled a little, saying carefully, "Ferran is the best cook in the world for technique.") Juan Mari Arzak, a three-star chef who is considered a father of new Spanish cuisine, told me, "Ferran is the most imaginative cook in all history." 
Visiting El Bulli for the first time last fall, I discovered what they were talking about. Adria was celebrating his 20th anniversary at the restaurant with a seasonlong retrospective of his greatest hits. The menu included 30 tapas-size dishes, each identified by the date of its introduction. Indicative of Adria's accelerating creativity, most were from the previous three years. Welcoming cocktails of a frozen whisky sour and a foam mojito were accompanied by popcorn that had been powdered and reconstituted as kernels and a tempura of rose petals. The Catalan mainstay of pa amb tomaquet, which is grilled bread rubbed with tomato and drizzled with olive oil, was deconstructed into a white sorbet made from skinned tomatoes and topped with a dry cracker that was filled with olive oil. A chicken croquette contained liquid consomme. A "Kellogg's paella" consisted of puffed Rice Krispies, to which the waiter added an intense seafood reduction; on the side were a small, flash-fried shrimp, a piece of shrimp sashimi and an ampule containing a thick brown extract of shrimp heads that you were instructed to squeeze into your mouth. I vividly recall a cold, grainy heap of foie-gras powder on one side of a soup bowl that contained a hot chicken consomme. "Don't mix," the waiter warned. "Eat a little of one, then the other." (Who would have guessed?) Perhaps the most sublime dish was an array of seven warm gelatin blocks that resembled watercolor paints, each a vivid hue that proved to be a pure essence of a vegetable. I was handed a fresh vanilla bean to smell while eating vanilla-scented whipped potatoes. And so on, for three and a half hours.
Although Adria stands alone -- "he is stratospheric, a Martian," says his acolyte, the Madrid restaurateur Sergi Arola -- he also rides the crest of a wave. "It is a movement in Spain," Adria says. "It is not only me. In a culture with a very strong traditional gastronomy, there is a cuisine for the first time with new techniques and concepts. It is a new nouvelle cuisine." Many of these chefs seem like comrades-in-arms, working together to advance their country's cuisines. By contrast, the few French chefs who are pursuing innovative cooking are far-flung and relatively isolated. "In France, who is doing creative cuisine?" says Jordi Butron, a 35-year-old new-wave cook who runs Espai Sucre, a fascinating dessert school and restaurant in Barcelona. He names four, then says: "In Catalonia and the Basque country, there are 12 or 15 restaurants that do creative food on a high level. If you compare all restaurants, France is superior. If you take the 12 or 15 restaurants in France and compare them with the Spanish, I do not know." Many Spanish chefs have adopted particular Adria techniques, but what the best young Spanish cooks value most is Adria's fearlessness. "El Bulli has been able to dare," Butron says. "It is easier to do that if you come after the one who did it first." For his part, Adria says, "The important thing in Spain is there is a lot of passion among the young." 
Spain rising, France resting. The more attention I paid, the more I noticed everywhere this invidious comparison, between smug, stagnant France and innovative, daring Spain. It seemed, as Trotter suggested, a shift in the zeitgeist, and one that is not confined to the kitchen. The outstanding Spanish cultural figure of our time is the ebullient filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, who finds humanity in the most despised groups and optimism in the most hopeless situations. His French counterpart? The misanthropic novelist Michel Houellebecq, whose retinal cones register nothing but despair, ugliness and shame.
In this admittedly tinted light, I went to this year's blockbuster art shows in New York: "Matisse Picasso" at the Modern and "Manet/Velazquez" at the Metropolitan. They were magnificent exhibitions, overstuffed with paintings of thrilling quality. It would be terribly crass to think of either show as a mano-a-mano (or, to use the linguistically neutral American term, a bake-off). And yet. . . . For me the great revelation of "Matisse Picasso" was seeing Picasso's 1930 "Acrobat" and realizing that, two decades before Matisse created his cutouts of "Acrobats" and "Blue Nudes," the Spaniard issued a template for them. Similarly, at the Met it was enlightening to come upon Manet's large full-length portraits (in which the mid-19th-century French artist set his subjects in spatially indeterminate but color-graded fields) immediately after walking through a breathtaking array of the Velazquez paintings, created two centuries earlier, that inspired them. Or, having examined a roomful of Goyas, to take another look at Manet's self-conscious models (who are so patently aware of the painter's presence), his realistic genre scenes of life high and low and his loose, bravura handling of paint, and wonder if it doesn't all seem a little . . . derivative. Don't get me wrong. The Manets and Matisses are ravishing, masterly paintings. However, in a chronological record of innovation, the works of Velazquez, Goya and Picasso take precedence.
There is a cook who reminds me of Matisse, that supreme colorist who dangerously harmonized reds, oranges and mauves that shouldn't be capable of coexisting on the same canvas. His name is Pierre Gagnaire, and he is the most out-there Michelin three-star chef in France. On route to Spain, I invited a college friend, Whit Stillman, to join me for lunch in Paris at Gagnaire's eponymous restaurant. I was hoping Stillman could give me another American perspective on Spain versus France, or more particularly, on Barcelona versus Paris. The writer-director of the film "Barcelona," which follows the fortunes of a few Americans based in the Catalan capital, Stillman hails from New York, but he moved to Barcelona in 1991 and lived there for two years, with his wife, Irene, who is a native of that city. In 1998, the Stillmans, who had returned to New York, once again pulled up stakes and relocated to an apartment in a 17th-century hotel particulier in the old heart of Paris. 
"The only great American I knew in Barcelona was on the lam from the F.B.I.," Stillman said as the food arrived in clusters of small dishes. Gagnaire's menu is poetically composed around products, regions or seasons. To start, I ordered "the Catalan country" and was brought four different items, beautifully arranged on porcelain plates. It was a flavor reverie of the region I was about to visit, and along with some of the seafood for which the Costa Brava is famous (tiny squid, large shrimp, cod) and Spanish hot and sweet peppers, the dishes contained strange ingredients, like a minuscule sea cucumber called "espardeigne." There were too many flavors for me to focus. The food shimmered in my mind, like an exotic dream. "The other interesting person was Marc Rich," Stillman was saying. "The interesting Americans in Barcelona were there because they couldn't be extradited. In Paris, the people who come from all over tend to be excellent. They're coming from achievement or a positive factor. In Barcelona, it was the dregs."
Raffish, scruffy Barcelona, with its seedy Gothic quarter and its Gaudi buildings that rigorously eschew right angles. Compare that with monumental Paris, a bourgeois heaven, where Haussmann's boulevards radiate clearly, the Notre-Dame cathedral has been scrubbed tan and our lunch cost a bit over $500 for two. If you want to stay out all night in Paris, of course you can -- but in Barcelona, you pretty much have to. The restaurants don't start filling up for dinner until around 10, so a meal segues smoothly into a post-midnight round of clubbing. In the gentrifying El Born district, which has the energy of New York's Lower East Side poured into Barcelona's gracious Modernismo architecture, you can toss down a few drinks with some Sichuan-pepper yucca chips at Santa Maria, pop in to Comerc 24 for the Adria alum Carles Abellan's onion tempura with soy foam and stumble over to the dessert restaurant, Espai Sucre, where my five-course menu culminated in a smoky lapsang-souchong-tea cream served on a plate with a chocolate-coffee cake, a black sesame-seed wafer, a scoop of chocolate ice cream, a few grapes and a puddle of sour yogurt. Then it's time to go dancing! 
Maybe I should confess that my own stodgy predilection is for early-morning Barcelona, particularly a stroll through the Boqueria, the old market on the Ramblas, to ogle some of the most beautiful fish in the world. Once upon a time, you could have had a similar experience in Paris, but that was before the fresh-food markets were banished to the suburbs and Les Halles was converted into a place to buy fast food and cheap clothing, or to log on at an Internet cafe.
I wanted to get Stillman's take on one of the summer's most talked-about independent movies, "L'Auberge Espagnole," but for reasons of aggrieved proprietorship, which I completely understand, he had avoided seeing a successful movie about young foreigners living in Barcelona. Cedric Klapisch's film follows a Parisian youth named Xavier to Barcelona, where he is learning Spanish in preparation for a career in business. The Paris that we see in the movie is the Paris that has sprung up in the last two decades and now encircles the historic quarter: massive, generic office blocks looming over vast soulless plazas. In insouciant contrast, Barcelona in "L'Auberge Espagnole" is all palm trees and mosaic-tiled rooftops and late-night music bars. It is young and transgressive, like the Paris of the 50's and 60's that we fell in love with in Truffaut's "Shoot the Piano Player" and Malle's "Zazie Dans le Metro" and Godard's "Breathless." (Klapisch's Paris is what Godard, back in 1967 in "Two or Three Things I Know About Her," warned was coming.) When a beautiful fellow citoyenne says to Xavier, "What an awful smell; Barcelona is such a dirty city," it is a tip-off that she is horribly repressed. Barcelona embodies freedom, Paris corporate lifelessness. 
At the end of the film, having completed his language course, Xavier returns to his mother's home for a celebratory meal before taking up his white-collar drudgery. One look at the conventional steak au poivre sizzling grimly in a skillet and you feel in your gut Xavier's panicky sauve qui peut impulse to escape Paris at all cost. He must stay true to Spain, a country where creativity, exuberance and personal style are valued over money and status. For this American viewer, Klapisch's film came as the clincher. Spain has become the new France.
Standing in Ferran Adria's kitchen at El Bulli, it is easy to believe that you have slipped down the rabbit hole. Adria, who would have been the caterer of choice for the Mad Hatter, invents food that provokes all the senses, including the sense of disbelief. His success is almost as amazing as his food. Snaring a table at El Bulli is an extreme sport of the international gourmandoisie, akin to getting a 3-year-old into the nursery school at the 92nd Street Y. Open for only six months a year, solely for dinner, the restaurant can accommodate 8,000 diners in a season. Last year, more than 300,000 callers requested a table.
When I visited in late June, Adria was refining a new pet concept, which he calls "liquid ravioli." During the six months that the restaurant on the Costa Brava is closed, he works on new recipes in a "laboratory" near the Barcelona market with his younger brother and collaborator, Albert, and with Oriol Castro, one of his two chefs de cuisine. A stylish duplex in an 18th-century mansion, the "Taller el Bulli," as it is called, has an ultramodern kitchen that is frighteningly well equipped -- the spice rack holds 720 jars. During the summer season, however, the laboratory is moved to the restaurant kitchen in Rosas. There Adria convenes in the afternoon (lunchtime at more traditional establishments) with Albert and Castro. 
On the day I watched, Adria and Castro (Albert was traveling) began by spooning pea puree into a plastic tray that was filled with a clear liquid at room temperature. Like invisible ink, the green puree in the magic solution began to take solid form. When it had cohered satisfactorily, Castro scooped it out and rinsed it in a second tray, which I guessed held water. (No one was saying: "It's a game to see how long it can stay in our hands," Adria said, and laughed. Later, he e-mailed the recipe. The mysterious element in the first bath was calcium chloride, which reacts with alginate, a kelp extract, in the puree.) Castro put the bright green "ravioli" into a little dish and handed it to me. I cut it open with a spoon, and the ravioli dissolved into soup. "It is a revolutionary technique, and there are thousands of things to do with it," Adria said enthusiastically. 
Adria, who is 41, is a compact, dark-haired man, who speaks a raspy and guttural Catalan, Castilian Spanish and (in our case) French, in a voice that hisses and sputters like a severed electrical line. "You know 'chaud-froid,' the classic technique of Escoffier?" he asked. In the late 19th century, Auguste Escoffier, the chef at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, codified and refined the recipes of French cuisine, including one -- chaud-froid -- in which meat is first cooked, then chilled, to be served with a cold aspic. "This is like chaud-froid."
As we spoke, Castro was peeling a quail egg, then placing it in a spoon, which he dipped into a consomme. Carefully, he slid the contents of the spoon into the mysterious bath. "It's the new poached egg," he said, laughing. The new technique is indeed very adaptable. When a liquid is squeezed into the bath from a pipette, the droplets form kernels with the consistency of salmon roe. Instead of ravioli, you have caviar. "It is not ravioli; it is not caviar," Adria said. "It is something different." He was coating individual salmon eggs with the pea puree. "It's caviar of caviar," he said. Wouldn't that be awfully difficult to serve to the 50-odd nightly diners who consume a tasting menu of some 30 small courses? "Afterward, we will devise a production system," he said. "Now it is anarchy."
Albert Adria came up with the concept of "liquid ravioli" or "liquid caviar" in March, after sampling a popular Asian drink made with tapioca pearls. The Bulli creative team has been developing and honing the technique ever since. As I watched, Castro sprinkled black droplets of squid ink into the solution. "This will be eggs of squid," Adria said. "You understand? It is not creativity -- blah, blah, blah. It is a lot of work." As the eggs congealed, Adria flash-cooked a few tiny octopi under a high-heat salamander broiler. Then he arranged each grilled creature with a dollop of the faux caviar and added salt. "It's magic," he said, beaming at his creation. "For us it's magic. You close your eyes, you're eating little squid with its eggs. If you eat the squid first, then the caviar, you do not get the emotion. That's why it's important that the servers tell the clients how to eat." While Castro experimented with different-size droplets, Adria absent-mindedly popped the remaining baby octopi into his mouth,
"Liquid ravioli," aka "caviar," is only one of Adria's new notions this season. As he and Castro worked, a young man in preparation for dinner was boiling milk in low flat pans, then skimming off the skin that formed on the top and storing it between plastic sheets. Adria took inspiration from the soy-milk tofu wrappers in Chinese dim sum. "The concept is milk as a pasta," he said. "That leads to incredible things -- ravioli, cannelloni." He took a milk skin and wrapped it around a little chopped basil and garlic. We each ate one -- a pesto ravioli. He smiled. "The aftertaste," he said. He swabbed another milk skin with some melted Idiazabal cheese. "I am making a crepe Idiazabal," he said.
Castro brought over a handful of fresh almonds. "Four almonds, very simple: sugared, salted, acid, bitter," Adria explained. "The four basic tastes. For me, it is very sensual, this dish."
Castro said: "It is very simple, and it is also very complex." He dipped an almond in a coating of sugar and handed it to Adria. One bite, and Adria shook his head. He wanted more sugar. "I don't like light tastes," he said to me. "I like tastes. . . . " He snapped his fingers. Then he bit into a newly doctored almond that Castro gave him. "No," he said. "More, more." The third rendition satisfied him. We cleared our palates with a little glass of clear tomato extract, and Castro began salting almonds. "It is either magic or it isn't," Adria said. He added some salt to his almond. "It makes you reflect, and cuisine should do that. The most important thing is to make people happy, but the second sometimes is to give them something to think about." He drank a little juice and tasted a very sour almond. He nodded vehemently. "That is the limit," he said. "We are seeking the limit." He suggested to Castro that they serve the dish with ice water, rather than tomato extract, so that people will not be distracted from the concept. The four almonds will be presented on a black block. "White and black, very minimal," Adria said. "Four little things -- four basic tastes -- and just cold water. People will remember this all their lives."
Adria, the son of a Barcelona house painter, is entirely self-taught. He was working in the kitchen at El Bulli 21 years ago when the executive chef quit, and Juli Soler, the farsighted manager, promoted him. Back then, El Bulli (the name means "bulldog") was merely a good seaside roadhouse. Adria began cooking classic French cuisine. In the archives at the Taller Bulli, I saw an old menu: saffron-mussel soup, entrecote with morels and cream, roast leg of lamb for two. "I was a conventional, traditional cook," Adria told me. "I made langouste salad in many ways." During the off season, he would travel in France, often with Soler, to critique the leading restaurants. He credits his conversion to a day in Nice in 1986 when he attended a cooking demonstration by Jacques Maximin, a brilliant and influential chef renowned for respecting no boundaries. Adria recalls that someone in the audience asked, "What is creativity?" and Maximin replied, "Don't copy." The words became Adria's mantra. With Soler's support, he transformed El Bulli into a restaurant unlike any other. Since 1990, they have owned it jointly.
With Adria, I walked across the huge kitchen (at 3,000 square feet, it is the same size as the two dining rooms combined) to the cold section, where frozen packages of commercial mandarin-orange juice were slowly thawing. The thin liquid that rises to the top would be discarded, leaving an intensely flavored residue. "Everyone mixes it, but they are not looking," Adria said. He had observed the separation late last summer but waited until this season to make something of it; inspirations that strike after July are postponed a year. "It's not a concept -- O.K., it's a concept, reducing the essence of tangerine -- but it's a little path," Adria said. "The caviar is a big path." Castro appears with some spring onions and a canister of powdered green tea, and they discuss what else to add. The discussion consists of Castro making suggestions and Adria rejecting them, until the idea of walnut oil finds favor. However, when Castro returns with some, Adria shakes his head. Too heavy and strong. Castro fetches hazelnut oil.
Adria delicately brushes a spring onion with hazelnut oil and places it alongside a puddle of tangerine essence that is the color of egg yolk. He tastes. Like the No. 2 wolf in the pack, Castro takes the second taste.
"It needs something," Castro says.
"It needs a little more onion," Adria said. "I love this dish. There is nobody who will ever have eaten something like this before." He turned to me. "There are clients who look at things, and those who don't look at anything," he said. "There are those who think, This is magic, this mandarin, and those who will not notice. Our work here is to make new things. That simple. No one makes a plane trip to eat classic cuisine. It is very good, a tournedos Rossini, but it is another emotion."
On the plate, he sprinkled a mixture of granulated sugar and green-tea powder. He tasted it. Then from the canister, he added a little of the bitter green-tea powder and tasted again. He was satisfied.
The other starring concept to make its debut this season is something Adria calls "air." I had encountered air earlier, on my previous visit to El Bulli, in September of last year. At that time, I talked with Adria about some of his more celebrated and influential creations, including "foam," in which he aerates sauces with a nitrous-oxide siphon that is ordinarily used to whip cream, and "warm gelatin," in which he adds a seaweed powder called agar to stabilize beef gelatin without chilling it. "April 14, 1994, was the day of the first foam," he said last September. "Hot jellies date from June 20, 1998." His dark restless eyes looked tired, as if oppressed by the weight of all this history and the responsibility of maintaining his position as the world's most creative chef. Then he smiled. "Another day is Sept. 18, 2002," he said. I looked at him quizzically; that was just two days before. "Foams are out -- for us," he said. "I have created something
five times lighter than the foams. The new texture that I create is air. In the bathroom there is the bath foam. This is the same texture."
A few more questions and his discretion dissipated. "You will be the first journalist to see it," he said. He asked Castro to make preparations in the kitchen. "It is only done with the product, nothing else," he explained. "For example, the carrot is only carrot juice, nothing else." When Castro was ready, we went into the kitchen. Like a magician, Adria had me taste a bowl of celery juice to verify that it contained nothing else. Then he applied an electric mixer. Within a minute, the liquid had turned into bubble bath. He brought it out onto the patio. He beamed happily, his cares temporarily evaporated. I couldn't decide whether he looked more like a father whose child had uttered a first word or a little boy who finds a bicycle under the Christmas tree. In my mouth, the new "air" lacked almost all substance, but embodied the essence of celery.
On my visit in June, Adria served a carrot air with mandarin-orange concentrate -- an intensified, gossamer version of chilled carrot-orange soup. The next day, we repaired to the small apartment and office that he keeps on the hill above the restaurant. (His wife lives in Barcelona, where she is an aquarium administrator. They go back and forth between Barcelona and Rosas on their days off.) Pulling photographs out of shoebox-size files, he showed me some of the "airy" dishes he had made earlier this season. Baby artichokes with pumpkin-seed oil drops on a mandarin-orange coulis with vinegar "air" looked especially appealing. "Now that is over," he said. "No more little artichokes." When he says over, he means it. Next year's menu will consist entirely of new plates.
Adria has every dish photographed, dated, archived and numbered. (There are now 1,200.) Using the archive, his team has been able to realize oneof his most ambitious schemes: a huge three-volume work, with an even more complete CD-ROM, that describes each dish. Volume 1, cataloging the most recent dishes, appeared in Spanish late last year; the next volumes, as well as an English translation, are in the works. The tome is organized like Adria's mind -- methodically. It has copious cross-references and charts that resemble genealogical trees. "There must be a great deal of order -- and then you can be an artist," he says. "With anarchy, there is not artistry." Charlie Trotter told me of a dinner he had with Adria at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Washington. Adria ordered eight different steaks to be presented at 10-minute intervals, then took a few bites of each one, studying the difference between a porterhouse, a tenderloin, a New York strip.
In the kitchen of El Bulli, I browsed through the loose-leaf book in which Adria records ideas to explore. Recorded in a minuscule, penciled hand, the notes are organized in categories. Under the label "Products," for example, he has jotted "Ventresca pescados." The ventresca is the most prized belly meat of the tuna; wondering whether he might find its counterpart in other fish, Adria has written "salmon, sardine, mackerel." The subhead of "Combinations" listed honey-potato, coffee-tarragon, salmon-coffee and wasabi-roses. Other main categories in the notebook were "Techniques and Concepts" (quinoa risotto, chestnut couscous) and "Elaboration," which went on forever, with such subcategories as waters and infusions; juices; consommes and soups (there were about 40 of them); liquid creams; purees; gelatins; and cheese and other milk products (the milk skin was here, with sub-subheadings of "filled or "plain," and different variations on crepes and stuffed pasta). 
The aspect of the published book of which Adria seems proudest is its historical preciseness. "It is important to talk about an evolving analysis," he said. In his office, he picked up a worn copy of Michel Guerard's 1978 cookbook, "Cuisine Gourmande," a bible of nouvelle cuisine. "For me, Michel Guerard's book is the main one," he said. He leafed through the pictures and recipes. "What year is this dish? What year is this?" he said. "It's as if one were talking of art and they say, 'Picasso, what year was that painting?' and you say, 'I don't know.' If we want to talk seriously of creativity, it is necessary that all cooks make a catalog for people a hundred years from now. People ask: 'Where did nouvelle cuisine come from? Bocuse, Guerard?' No one can say. Fredy Girardet, for me one of the great cooks, has this book. . . . " He pulled it off the shelf. "One looks at it and doesn't know if this dish is from '83 or '96." In other words, who could tell if the recipe was ahead of its time? "It is like the cinema. If you see 'Terminator 1,' you think it is amazing, but when you see it after 'Terminator 2,' the special effects don't seem so fantastic. When you talk of cuisine relatively, you must know when it is done."
While much culinary history may be murky, the birthdate of nueva cocina in Spain is not. At the end of 1976, Paul Bocuse visited Madrid to speak at a conference. The chef-proprietor of a restaurant outside Lyon, Bocuse was the most exuberant exponent of nouvelle cuisine, the renaissance that transformed French cooking by making it lighter (more olive oil, less butter and cream), fresher (local and seasonal products), broader (ingredients from Asia and other exotic lands) and prettier (plate dressing as elegant as a Japanese flower arrangement). In Bocuse's audience in Madrid were two young Basque chefs working in San Sebastian who were exhilarated by what they heard: Juan Mari Arzak, who was cooking at the restaurant Arzak, established by his grandfather, and Pedro Subijana, who had just started working at Akelarre. When they introduced themselves to Bocuse, he invited them to come stay with him in Lyon for 10 days. "He is the best ambassador France has ever had," says Subijana, a charming, courtly man with a big handlebar mustache.
The timing was auspicious for a new culinary movement in Spain. One year earlier, the death of Generalissimo Franco had released the country from a repressive dictatorship. Everything new was welcome -- and the fresh wind that stirred up Spanish film, literature and design also swept into the kitchen. Although the Basque country had a rich gastronomic tradition and an unsurpassed supply of seafood, meat and vegetables, chefs in the restaurants were backward compared with their counterparts across the border in France. "There were grand traditional restaurants," says Subijana, whose Akelarre now has two Michelin stars. "All the menus were the same. They were lies." Back in San Sebastian, he and Arzak organized a group of a dozen chefs, who met regularly to discuss how to create menus that would renovate forgotten traditional dishes and invent new ones, all based on regional products. Every month or two, each cook invited four progressive customers to attend, free of charge, a group dinner of new Basque cuisine at one of the restaurants. Before the chefs realized what was happening, they had created a movement. Subijana knew the new cuisine had arrived when other cooks in the area began asking if they could join up.
Blessed with proximity to the sea (and, as that patriotic French chef Robuchon emphasizes, "profiting from being near the best cuisine in the world"), the Basque country and Catalonia have nourished the new Spanish cuisine from the start. Behind Arzak and Subijana came Hilario Arbelaitz of Zuberoa, near San Sebastian, and Santi Santamaria of El Raco de Can Fabes, near Barcelona. In the next generation, the leaders are Adria and the Basque three-star chef Martin Berasategui. The ranks grow larger among the young. Two Basques -- Andoni Luis Aduriz of Mugaritz and Isaac Salaberria of Fagollaga -- struck me as most impressive, but I also had several remarkable meals cooked by young chefs in Barcelona. 
Going to Spain now evokes the excitement I felt in the 80's, dining in France at the nouvelle cuisine restaurants of Alain Chapel and Alain Senderens. Can you still get that frisson in France -- the sense that you are eating something both new and authentic? Olivier Roellinger and Pierre Gagnaire both create delicately spiced, artfully constructed, personal dishes, but without providing for me any real thrills. Marc Veyrat is, if anything, too flashy: the Adria influence is very evident in his recent plates, such as a coddled egg that a waiter injects with a syringe full of sour oxalis extract; or an "Irish coffee" of duck bouillon topped with corn foam that you sip through a straw while sucking on little bon-bons made of wild caraway. It is usually delicious, but it can get a little forced and exhausting. Only Michel Bras, in his Zen-like restaurant in the remote Aubrac, maintains the tradition of originality and purity that animated nouvelle cuisine. Tellingly, so many of the best young Spanish chefs cite him as their hero that I suspect he may have more acolytes in Spain than in his native France.
It's hard to explain what happened to nouvelle cuisine in France. Maybe it just got old. Certainly, French cooking rests on an enviable base, with more solid, midlevel restaurants than exist in any other country. There is also a French public that has been eating in fine restaurants for centuries, ever since the Revolution forced cooks out of their perches in aristocratic residences. Even the irascible and powerful Spanish food writer, Rafael Garcia Santos, who is scathing about the quality of contemporary French cuisine, respects the taste of the French populace. "They have the best public," he says. "But they haven't got cooks who want to change the world."
Culinary bravado is essential in Spain, where most of the public appears to be baffled, not unreasonably, by the restaurants that have captured the critics' approbation. Jordi Vila, the talented 29-year-old chef at Alkimia in Barcelona, says that he offers "two lines -- one for the great public, with mutton, monkfish, artichokes, and one with gastronomic dishes." The best thing I ate at Alkimia was a clear green-apple gazpacho, which contained a perfect briny oyster, cockles, green-bean puree and yogurt dots. "Gazpacho with oysters, two or three will like it, and two or three won't," Vila explains. "I am very happy with the experimental things; the public is not always. You have to do it slowly." 
There were not many other people in the dining room the night I ate at Fagollaga, near San Sebastian, but there should have been. Isaac Salaberria is a post-Adria chef with a style of his own. As part of the movement toward lightness that began with the emulsified blender sauces of nouvelle cuisine and continues with Adria's foam and air, Salaberria, 32, a large man with a small voice, has taken the sauce off the plate entirely and reimagined it as a shot glass of juice or soup. Most memorable was a small slab of fatback from an Iberian pig, served with almond milk, in a brilliant marriage of richnesses. "I like to have the original flavor of the product," Salaberria says, in a credo I heard from other chefs of his generation. "I am looking for the maximum lightness and the maximum flavor."
If it is true, as Garcia Santos claims, that unlike their Spanish counterparts, young French chefs are primarily looking for money, the reason may be a social problem, not a character flaw. Taxes and labor benefits make France a very expensive place to run a restaurant. It is hard, for proprietor and customer alike, to disregard money. A dinner for two chez Marc Veyrat, with modest wines, will easily exceed $800. "The social charges are too heavy," Veyrat says, as an explanation for his nosebleed-inducing checks. In addition to the benefits that the proprietor provides for his staff, which the customer pays indirectly, the state slaps on a blatant 19.6 percent value-added tax to the bill. The comparable Spanish tax is 7 percent. Furthermore, France in 1998 legislated a mandatory 35-hour work week as an antidote to an unemployment rate that had exceeded 12 percent. Not implemented until 2000, the 35-hour rule has enraged restaurateurs, who traditionally work long hours. In France it would be unthinkable to have a labor-intensive establishment like El Bulli -- even if it weren't closed for lunch. For its one daily service with about 50 customers, El Bulli employs 30 or more cooks (a number that includes many unsalaried short-term apprentices, as is the custom throughout the high-end dining world).
How can a French chef turn a profit? Robuchon addressed the challenge this spring by opening simultaneously, in Tokyo and Paris, a new concept: L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. Behind a handsome rosewood bar (I ate in Paris, but the Tokyo restaurant is reported to be identical), either Robuchon personally or one of his distinguished fellow chefs prepares and serves the food to the patron, as in a sushi or tapas bar. There are 20 people working in the kitchen, with 200 people showing up daily for a seat at the counter. (By comparison, at the three-star restaurant that Robuchon closed in 1996, a kitchen staff of 25 fed 45 clients at each meal.) The food I ate at the Atelier de Robuchon was delicious, but it was hardly innovative or particularly creative. How could it be otherwise? The Atelier concept is designed to be rolled out profitably in big cities around the world. And the average bill, it should be noted, comes to about $75 a head.
Adria and Soler charge about $150 a person, without wine, for dinner at El Bulli. Not cheap, but once you see what goes into it, you realize it's not overpriced. Adria observes that he could follow the law of supply and demand by doubling or tripling the price, but he doesn't want to limit the restaurant to obscenely rich people. As it is, El Bulli just breaks even. Adria supports the operation with product lines, consulting projects and a nascent group of El Bulli Hotels. (So far there is just one hotel, in Seville.) "I don't want to be a millionaire, but I want to be able to live," he says. "I have 60 employees. It is impossible without the businesses. Here at El Bulli, I do not think of money. I make zero. If tomorrow the lottery gives me $10 million, I close the businesses."
The belief that cooking is more than a means to nourish the client and enrich the cook -- that it can be an art form -- propels the best chefs in Spain. Unlike such surviving grand old men of nouvelle cuisine as Paul Bocuse and Michel Troisgros, the founding fathers of nueva cocina have continued to reinvent their styles. At Akelarre, I ate a mollusk soup that bubbled when hot broth was poured over a white foam in the bowl. Arzak's restaurant was closed for vacation when I was in Spain, but where was the chef taking his holiday? In Rosas, where he could hang out in the kitchen of his friend Adria. There I met him -- an infectiously jolly man of 61. I had eaten at his San Sebastian restaurant, but that was years ago, and in the meantime, his daughter Elena had moved into the kitchen alongside him. "I began by evolving the cuisine of my mother, very gently," he told me. "My evolution forte began four years ago. I was looking for a new path." He and Elena now serve such avant-garde dishes as smoked tuna with warm tomato-licorice-pistachio gelatin triangles and a fig-pine nut garnish. They espouse the tradition of inventing new traditions.
A year ago, Ferran Adria's younger brother, Albert, told me: "For me, Andoni Luis Aduriz is the future of Spanish cooking." So I cannot say I went to Aduriz's Mugaritz restaurant, in the countryside a half-hour from San Sebastian, with no expectations.
My lunch companion was the food critic Rafael Garcia Santos, 48, who along with writing a weekly column for the national newspaper group Correo, publishes the best restaurant guide to Spain and coordinates an annual food congress in San Sebastian. He has been instrumental in the rise of the best Spanish chefs, and he is not bashful about letting you know it. Aduriz is one of two former El Bulli chefs who have gone off to make a great success. The other, Sergi Arola, runs the Michelin two-star La Broche in Madrid. My meal at La Broche had disappointed me. A carpaccio of scallops, shrimp and duck liver, with a dollop of green apple puree and a ring of smoked aioli, typified the problem. "When you eat this in your mouth, the texture is raw," explained Arola, who is 35. "But at the same time, I trick your brain with the flavor of the mayonnaise that is roasted." My brain was not tricked. The mushy textures of the three components trumped any suggestion that they had been roasted. 
"It is like an exception in Spain that he is not doing something better," Garcia Santos said harshly, when I mentioned my meal at La Broche. "He wants too much to be in every place. He is not in the kitchen. That is the illness of modern chefs." Arola cooks in a style that is recognizably Ferranista. He says that he is most influenced by the cooking of El Bulli from 1985 to 1993, when Adria was deconstructing traditional Spanish dishes. Like Picasso, one of whose fertile periods could spawn an entire career for Henry Moore, Adria keeps changing. Chefs who cook in his style are not cooking in his spirit. Adria speaks fondly of both of his proteges, but he distinguishes between them. "Sergi makes his own cuisine, but in this style," Adria says. "He is very honest. He says, 'My cuisine makes a reference to El Bulli.' I am very content with him." As for Aduriz? "Andoni wants to create a style of his own," Adria says. "He is a great, great cook, with great possibilities. It is difficult to create a new style, very difficult. He is trying."
When Santos and I arrived at Mugaritz, which is a handsome modern dining room in a pretty, rural setting, Aduriz, a shy, boyishly handsome man of 32 who looks about half his age, came to greet us. He recited the menu he had prepared to Garcia Santos, who knitted his brow, rubbed his beard and scowled. "And the bacalao, no? It is very good," he said. Aduriz nodded. He would substitute salt cod for another fish on the menu.
From the outset, it was evident that Aduriz had not been oversold. Most of the dozen items on the menu were presented in a shallow bowl, into which the waiter poured a hot soup. "I try in every dish to have something that envelops it," the chef explained. "I love the feeling of an integral taste. And there are two different smells -- one when it comes, and then different when they drop the liquid on it." A slow-cooked piece of beef rested in a clear broth redolent of roasted peppers. "This is a revolutionary way of doing a rustic taste," Garcia Santos said. "Roasted pepper is a usual taste here, it is in all dishes -- but not in this form." 
Aduriz worked both for Adria and for his major rival, Martin Berasategui, the Michelin three-star chef of the same generation, whose restaurant is in a suburb of San Sebastian. Another self-taught chef, Berasategui cooks in a style that is more identifiably French, making use of cream, for example. He is less revolutionary than Adria, but also very influential. On the new menu of the well-regarded young American chef Wylie Dufresne, at WD-50 on the Lower East Side, I spotted two dishes -- a foie gras terrine topped with anchovies and a thin sheet of pounded oysters -- that were modified renditions of Berasategui plates.
Aduriz has been cooking at his own restaurant for five years. "The first two years I had to decontaminate, in a positive sense," he told me. "I come from two places with a very strong identity, El Bulli and Martin Berasategui. Sometimes you think, What would he do? You have to take that off, to start doing your own cuisine." In his cooking, the radical breakthroughs in technique that are so obvious at El Bulli are less apparent. What he has taken from Adria is a guiding philosophy. "I met the most passionate people I ever met in the kitchen," he says. "In '93, when I was first in El Bulli, the real important thing was the gastronomy. They were losing a lot of money, there were no customers, but people were every day thinking the most important thing was how to do a foam."
That idealism is what I find so compelling at the best Spanish restaurants, and so sadly missing in France. The nouvelle cuisine movement burgeoned at the end of the hopeful 60's, nurtured by a belief that honest cooking -- mindful of culinary tradition, natural products and individual creativity -- could make a better world. That optimism has curdled. Besieged with soaring costs and smothering regulations, French chefs think more imaginatively about brand extension than about recipe invention. They cling to past glory, to a tradition of nouvelle cuisine that is becoming as hoary as Escoffier. In Spain, as Garcia Santos says, young chefs still touchingly believe that they can change the world.
Aduriz realizes that most of his patrons fail to recognize his ambitions. "If I thought people were just coming to eat, as 95 percent of people do, I wouldn't do this," he admits. But a creator cannot think that way. "The Spanish cooks understood they have to do an artistic cuisine, whether or not people understand," Garcia Santos says. He is the Ortega y Gasset of the food world: like the Spanish essayist, he loathes the mass taste that predominates around him. "Picasso would never have painted as he did if he cared whether people liked his painting," he continues. "There are only a few people who know about food. Do you think there are more than 10,000 people who like Ferran Adria's food? The difference in Spain is, nobody likes or understands what El Bulli does, as nobody understands the way of painting of Picasso, but nobody says it is just nothing. In Spain, a minority cuisine can convert the ideology of a country and become the dominant ideology." He looks around the Mugaritz dining room. "Tell me, how many restaurants are there in France where you can eat this way? There are seven or eight in Spain. In France, there are one or two. But in Spain there are a lot of young cooks who want to do this, and that is the important thing." He shakes his head. "It's a great shame what has happened in France, because we love the French people and we learned there. Twenty years ago, everybody went to France. Today they go there to learn what not to do."

HEADLINE: Where History Lines the Streets 

BYLINE:  By LUBA VANGELOVA; LUBA VANGELOVA is a freelance writer.

 BODY:
IT'S a "crowded" weekend in Staunton. Or so a downtown shopkeeper -- one of the few open for business on this springtime Sunday afternoon -- has just told me. It seems our visit coincides with a local high school's alumni shindig. I glance out at the nearly empty streets and sidewalks and try to picture the downtown area on a "slow" weekend.
 Yet this drowsy town of 24,000, some three hours southwest of Washington, was once a cutting-edge place. After Virginia's backcountry was opened to white settlement at the turn of the 18th century, the Shenandoah Valley became the California of the Colonial imagination, a fertile land in which to make a fresh start. 
 A wagon road running between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountain ranges funneled settlers from the north, many of them recent immigrants from Germany and Northern Ireland. They were joined by colonists of English descent who'd grown up in eastern Virginia. 
Together they formed a distinctly American frontier culture whose influence spread as the more restless eventually moved on in search of greener pastures.
Others found the valley to their liking and put down roots in communities such as Staunton. The town was founded in 1747, which is roughly how far back you have to be able to trace your local lineage to be considered a native, the same shopkeeper says, only slightly tongue in cheek. Change comes slowly to these parts, where the "new wing" of a house might predate the Civil War.
Yet therein lies much of Staunton's charm. Five of its neighborhoods are listed as National Historic Districts, and last year the town earned a Great American Main Street award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Its streets are lined with distinctive buildings from three centuries. Modernity, though evident here and there, has largely bypassed the town core. Many structures date from the boom years of 1870 to 1920, after the railroad came to town (the 1854 rail link to Richmond also helped make Staunton an important Confederate supply depot during the Civil War).
These churches, private homes and businesses reflect a gamut of architectural traditions, from log cabin (the only one with exposed log walls dates from 1869), to Colonial Revival, to Italianate. Diverse styles sometimes coexist on the same block.
Yet their survival was not always assured. In the 1960's, more than 30 downtown buildings were demolished in the name of urban renewal. Citizens eventually woke up to the fact that they were destroying their irreplaceable heritage, and in 1971 founded the Historic Staunton Foundation. The group has published self-guided walking tour brochures and organized regular guided walks to cater to the increasing number of tourists.
But it is an example of foreign architecture that has recently earned the town widespread notice. In September 2001, a reproduction of the Blackfriars Playhouse, an indoor theater partly owned by Shakespeare (the original no longer exists), opened in downtown Staunton. The new Blackfriars Playhouse -- financed by private citizens, corporate donors and state and local government --is the home of Shenandoah Shakespeare, dedicated to making Shakespeare as accessible to today's public as he was to Elizabethans, with performances by either the resident company or touring professional companies throughout the year. The 300-seat replica is as authentic as possible (fire codes precluded making it as big as the 500-seat original).
Its two-level, white-oak interior remains illuminated during performances, as it would have in the 16th and 17th centuries, when candle-holding chandeliers couldn't be dimmed. The lighting helps bridge the divide between performers and audience, as does the U-shaped seating plan. The backless benches are another authentic touch (seat backs and cushions can be rented).
Expecting to be tired after driving down from Washington, my friend George and I opted instead for padded, front-row Lords' Chairs at a Friday evening performance of "Coriolanus," one of Shakespeare's last tragedies.
The audience was unusually small -- only a couple dozen casually dressed people. A similar informality defined the entire production: the stage was nearly bare, and the costumes included long-sleeve T-shirts and jackboots. The low-key atmosphere (food and drinks are allowed inside the theater) recalls the intimate pleasure of attending a college or community playhouse. And in case we had trouble following the tale of a Roman general who becomes too big for his tunic, turns on his friends, and receives his inevitable comeuppance, there was a handy cheat sheet, titled "Stuff That Happens in the Play." It neatly summed up the finale: "Begging, betrayal and butchery ensue."
The next morning as we were having breakfast at the Thornrose House, an elegant yet relaxed B&B, our hosts, Otis and Suzy Huston, told us that Shakespeare hasn't generated much business for them. At least not compared with the Statler Brothers.
It turns out we're staying next door to the former Statler Brothers complex, the country music quartet's offices and museum until the group retired from touring last fall. Since then, the only place to pay homage to Staunton's best-known current residents has been a local gift shop. 
Otis regaled us with tales of Statler groupie exploits. He recalled one gaggle of middle-age women from Wisconsin who staked out the museum's parking lot from their guest room so they could rush downstairs to wave to one of their heroes as he left the complex. "Those days are long gone," Suzy said wistfully. Indeed, the only spectacle that morning was the odd sight of two ducks sitting on the edge of the inn's front lawn that appeared to be watching the passing cars.
Hoping to be a bit more productive than the resident waterfowl, we decided to explore downtown.
It boasts some variety, although houseware and bric-a-brac shops (one even announces its specialization in "kitsch") clearly predominate. There are also several cafes and a wine and chocolate store. The shoppers appeared to be mostly locals.
By the end of the afternoon, when we ducked into the Beverley Street Galleries to check out an exhibition of Maine landscape paintings, we had already started to recognize some of the faces around town. I asked the shopkeeper if any stores would be open on Sunday. "The downtown pretty much shuts down," he said, reclining in his chair in the spacious gallery. "I don't know how we expect to become the big tourism destination we want to be if everyone closes on Sundays." On my way out, I noticed that the gallery would not reopen until Monday.
We passed the evening at the casually elegant L'Italia restaurant. After our meal, we nipped upstairs for a look at the funkier Pompei Lounge, packed with a young crowd listening to live jazz. Already as relaxed as we could hope to be, we called it a night.
The next day we decided to pay our respects to Staunton's most distinguished native son, Woodrow Wilson. Though the president's family moved to Georgia when he was less than a year old (in 1857), Stauntonites have embraced him as their own. The Woodrow Wilson complex on the edge of downtown comprises four small buildings, including his birthplace and a presidential library and museum.
The museum tells the story of Wilson's rise from small-town minister's son to world leader. The birthplace -- a handsome two-story Greek Revival mansion with a colonnaded porch -- with its period furnishings, including some originals, and artifacts such as Wilson family portraits and jewelry sheds light on how a local family would have lived prior to the Civil War. Our guide pointed out how the rail link to Richmond transformed the once-isolated town, giving residents easier access to such novelties as barrel-type butter churns.
Later that afternoon, we saw even older homes and farm equipment at the Frontier Culture Museum, an odd juxtaposition of centuries-old farmhouses within earshot of an Interstate. The four farms -- the German, Scots-Irish and English ones were shipped from Europe and reassembled; the American one is from the Shenandoah Valley -- are designed to illustrate how the various immigrant cultures gave birth to the American frontier traditions that became an integral part of the country's mythology. (Research has begun to incorporate information about the area's Africans and Native Americans into the museum). Interpreters in period costume answer questions about their alter egos' lives as they weave fabrics, bale hay and do other farm chores. Late in the day, a handful of visitors walked around and leaned on fences to gaze at the unusual old-fashioned livestock breeds. 
As we were leaving, we paused at the tiny tourism center near the entrance.
The woman behind the counter told us that last year she'd noticed Staunton was beginning to get tourists from the West Coast. "We were tickled pink," she said.
Perhaps these tourists aren't so different from the settlers who once flocked to this frontier outpost. They may arrive on Interstates, and from different compass points. But like their predecessors, they seek the good life, if only for a weekend. They look for it in the past rather than the future. But in Staunton, these may amount to one and the same.

It serves pasta, veal, chicken and seafood, and there is also a good selection of regional, domestic and international wines. The Pompei Lounge upstairs features live music on Thursday and Saturday nights through the fall. A three-course meal with wine for two costs about $70; closed Monday.
 The Mill Street Grill, 1 Mill Street, (540) 886-0656, is a casual, very popular but rather loud restaurant. Our steak was so-so, but the tortilla crusted opah fish with roasted tomato- cilantro cream sauce was delicious. A two-course meal for two is about $45. LUBA VANGELOVA

Guides to an Anything-but-Staid Retirement

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE'S little question that the traditional concept of retirement -- a k a being on vacation for the rest of your life -- is rapidly changing to reflect the more proactive mind-set of the baby boomers, as well as the economic realities of shrinking pensions and paltry savings.
 Tomorrow's retirees are going to be anything but on a permanent holiday, and two recent books aim to provide some emotional and psychological guidance for a time of life that for many may become known as a postwork career. 
 The first, "Too Young to Retire: An Off-the-Road Map to the Rest of Your Life" (The Writers' Collective, $13.95) by Marika and Howard Stone, is an offshoot of a Web site the authors run for retirees and those with aspirations to retire. The site, www.2young2retire.com, includes stories about ordinary people who, instead of accepting traditional retirement, have made transitions to new and what they consider more interesting careers and lives.
This little gem of a book offers sage advice on everything from downsizing to diet and exercise. One of my favorite chapters -- "101 Opportunities for the Open-Minded" -- contains a list of new career opportunities that includes activities as diverse as astrology, dog walking and teaching. In many cases, a Web address is provided to help you start.
The Stones practice what they preach. Mr. Stone, 68, left a marketing career at a publishing company to start the 2young2retire Web site in 1998; Mrs. Stone, 61, is a former freelance business writer who now teaches yoga.
The other book, "Second Acts: Creating the Life You Really Want, Building the Career You Truly Deserve" (HarperResource, $22.95) by Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine, is described by the authors as a "guide to reinventing your life." They call America a "land of second acts," buttressing that notion with biographical snippets of famous people -- like Tom Clancy and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who have reinvented themselves.
Mr. Pollan and Mr. Levine, who also wrote "Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Personal Financial Plan," say that we live in a transitional period and that there has never been a "better time to revolt against external standards and be true to yourself." They argue convincingly that we can change our lives and live our dreams -- and be the better for it -- by rejecting traditional concepts of retirement and concentrating on what is really important: fulfilling our inner life and desires.
The authors don't view life reinvention as a one-shot event. They urge readers to start second acts, and third and fourth ones -- as many as they can dream up. "By expressing your hopes and wishes, and pursuing them for as long as you live, you'll experience a rare freedom, both materially and spiritually," they write. "Life will cease being a trip toward mortality and instead will become a never-ending journey. Keep on reinventing yourself and death becomes nothing more significant than the period at the end of this sentence."
Both "Too Young to Retire" and "Second Acts" contain some general financial advice, but that's not their main thrust.
"Retire Sooner, Retire Richer: How to Build and Manage Wealth to Last a Lifetime" (McGraw-Hill Trade, $14.95), by Frank L. Netti, offers solid nut-and-bolts advice for dealing with the financial aspect of retirement. It is clearly written and is illustrated with easy-to-understand charts.
When we think beyond retirement to the endgame of life, many of us try to avoid the topic of nursing homes. Not Karen Shoff, the author of "There's No Place Like (a Nursing) Home: Four Powerful Steps That Will Change Your Life" (Invisible Ink, $12.95).
Ms. Shoff, a social worker and gerontologist, tackles the issue head-on with an unvarnished look at nursing homes and advice on how to avoid them altogether.
She argues that with proper planning, you can spend your last years in your own home instead of a nursing home without becoming a burden on your family. The goal, she says, can be reached through long-term care insurance, hiring a geriatric care manager and establishing a system of allies, including your doctor. She also recommends having a living will and putting your wishes into writing with specific instructions, along with explanations of how things are to be paid for.
Ms. Shoff builds a strong case for avoiding nursing homes, which she calls "the McDonald's of the health care world -- employing a roster of unskilled individuals for the lowest possible wage." Nursing homes also employ as few workers as possible, she says, and a result is substandard care, especially for bedridden patients.
This is a very helpful and ultimately optimistic book that makes it easier to deal with a difficult subject.
IF you like bargains and deals, a couple of other books should be of interest:
* "Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50" (McGraw-Hill/Contemporary Books, 14th edition; $14.95), by Joan Rattner Heilman. Dealing mainly with travel bargains, this book has been a favorite since the late 1980's.
* "Free Stuff and Good Deals for Folks Over 50" (Santa Monica Press, 2nd edition; $12.95), by Linda Bowman. It looks at a wide spectrum of deals, from travel to bank services to medicine.

The Perils Of Cutbacks In Higher Education

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
THE e-mail message from the chancellor warned David Card that if the California Legislature failed to adopt a budget by Sept. 1, his salary, and those of all the other tenured professors at the University of California at Berkeley, would shrink to the minimum wage.
 The alarming wage cut did not happen. The legislature reached agreement on a budget in late July. Rather than shrink professorial salaries -- from six figures, in many cases, to less than $6 an hour -- the budget froze them, eliminating the annual raise, usually around 3 percent. 
 "Surprisingly, people did not pay much attention to the e-mail," said Professor Card, who teaches economics. "I guess they thought that if things got that crazy, there would be some kind of relief."
For tenured professors, maybe, but not for students at public colleges and universities. The chancellor's vivid e-mail warning fit right into the spirit of the times. Forced to cut spending to balance state budgets, legislatures are coming down hardest on higher education, an odd move for a nation that believes its special advantage in global competition is its "knowledge workers," who are billed as so well educated that they are capable of turning out products and services other nations cannot match.
More than seven million students are enrolled as undergraduates in four-year colleges and universities in the United States, and nearly 70 percent of them attend public institutions, which depend on taxpayer money doled out by legislatures for the majority of their funds. The percentages are similar for the 1.8 million graduate students; 60 percent attend public universities. 
The combination makes public higher education a pillar of the nation's competitive advantage. That is as it should be. How else can bright young people from lower-income families afford a first-rate education? Tuition is usually too high for them at private colleges, and now it is shooting up at the state schools as they struggle to get by with smaller subsidies in a weak economy.
Higher education, it turns out, comes under the rubric of discretionary spending, easier to cut than outlays for kindergarten through 12th grade or programs like Medicaid. And states are taking this easier path, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. During most of the 1990's, outlays for higher education in the 50 states rose substantially. They even inched up 0.7 percent, to $58.2 billion, in the 2003 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, although that was the first year of drastic cutbacks in many states. 
This year, the downward pressure is unmistakable. So far, 43 states have approved budgets for the 2004 fiscal year, the National Conference reports, and higher-education outlays have dropped by 2.8 percent, to a total of $37.7 billion, from $38.8 billion last year. The final tally for all 50 states may be slightly higher than last year's, but by a minuscule amount. "In all the cutting, higher education is suffering a disproportionate amount," said Arturo Perez, a policy specialist at the National Conference.
To make up some of the shortfall, tuition is rising at a number of schools. Students returning to University of California campuses this month will find that it is up by as much as 30 percent. This is happening as enrollments rise, pushed up in part by young people who can't find jobs and are going to college to acquire knowledge-worker status.
THE University of Massachusetts at Amherst is among the most drastic cost-cutters. Over a three-year period ending next June, expenses have either been cut or will be cut by a total of 30 percent, much of it in this fiscal year. To shrink the staff of tenured professors, a special retirement package reduced by five years the age at which they could retire with full benefits. In response, a third of the English and music department professors retired. Physical education was canceled for the fall semester. And more than 100 full-time employees other than teachers have been laid off. To a lesser degree, these are familiar measures on many other state university campuses.
When such cuts are made, quality inevitably suffers, along with affordability and access, not to mention global competitiveness. Many factors determine national winners in the complex global struggle, but education is undoubtedly one, and it is clearly being hurt in America as the gains of the 1990's are whittled away.
We are not, for example, making high-speed Maglev trains, the magnetic-levitation system that the Chinese are buying to serve as a commuter system for towns around Shanghai. Knowledge workers at Siemens and ThyssenKrupp are bringing Germany $5 billion from that sale. The industry does not exist in the United States and the technology is not high on the agenda, if it is there at all, at the nation's shrinking public universities.

THE WAY WE WORE
Styles of the 1930's and 40's and Our World Since Then.
By Marsha Hunt.
Fallbrook Publishing Ltd., 1993. $49.95.
 MARSHA HUNT began working in 1936 when she was 17, one year out of Horace Mann in Manhattan. Fifty-four films later, her career came to a quiet halt, as Roger Memos, associate producer of a documentary about the Hollywood blacklist put it, when she and 25 other film workers, including Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, flew to Washington to attend hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee and lend their support to the Hollywood 19, a group of screenwriters, directors and an actor. For this gesture, and for refusing to sign an affidavit saying the trip had been organized by the Communist Party, Ms. Hunt became unemployable, as she writes in "What We Wore," a picture book of film stills, publicity shots and newspaper clippings that details, with poignancy and humor, the workaday life of a film star through clothes. The book, published in 1993, is being reissued and distributed by Ms. Hunt (818-994-9695). 
 After 1951, Ms. Hunt made just eight films, so this raft of photographs reflects a time when the studios emitted blizzards of publicity shots ("Marsha Hunt, Paramount player in 'The Accusing Finger,' wears here a smart two-piece frock of beige jersey with padded shoulders."). The last photos coincide with the midcentury mark, a line in the sand for the blacklisted. Ms. Hunt describes a trip to Paris, where she bought an outfit in silk that looked like a watercolor, and a Gres original -- it was a "full, hard-working, intensely eventful year," she writes, "just before the Dark Ages set in."

A Path to Helping the Poor, and His Investors

BYLINE:  By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
"THE typical New York billionaire is always asking me the same question," Alexandre de Lesseps says. " 'Why do you want to lend money to poor people?' "
 Mr. de Lesseps, 54, an international businessman whose great-great-grandfather developed the idea for the Suez Canal, has a ready answer. "The only way to solve the problems of poverty and terrorism in the world today," he said, "is through investment." 
 He is no ordinary investor. As a co-owner of BlueOrchard Finance in Geneva, he is one of the leading figures in the world of microfinance, an idea that is taking on renewed popularity in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Microfinanciers and allied institutions typically make loans in amounts of $1,000 or less to poor people in poor countries who are ignored by commercial banks. The concept can be traced to Prof. Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976 and became known as a "banker to the poor." 
Investors in microfinancing ventures make profits in the form of interest payments on the order of two to five percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, the international benchmark known as Libor. As a rule, microcredit loans are not backed by collateral, leaving no means of financial recovery for the lender if they are not repaid. But Grameen and other leading microcredit institutions claim loan loss rates of less than 5 percent, compared with 5 to 10 percent in the subprime consumer finance industry, for borrowers with income problems or flawed credit histories. 
Just less than $500 million is committed to microcredit loans worldwide, according to BlueOrchard's estimates. But Mr. de Lesseps said he believed that the total market for such loans may be near $3 billion.
He acknowledges that the aims of his microfinancing ventures are not purely philanthropic, at least not in the traditional sense. "The reason we lend money to poor people is not only so that they can make money," he said, "but also so that our investors can make money."
Until recently, microfinancing initiatives, because of their profit-making orientation, have failed to win support from international organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations. But last month, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations announced a new commission aimed at overcoming the institutional, legal and cultural barriers to private-sector participation in fighting world poverty. The co-chairmen of the commission are Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico who now directs Yale University's Center on Globalization, and Paul Martin, a Canadian Parliament member and former finance minister.
"Whatever else we do to help the poor, local entrepreneurs have the power to create the greatest change for their countries," Mr. Martin said at the United Nations when the new commission was announced on July 25. "The entrepreneurial spirit does not have to be imported. Visit the smallest town in the poorest country on market day and youwill see the private sector at work."
Microfinancing is just one of several international business interests in Mr. de Lesseps's private-sector portfolio. He is completing a five-star hotel in Havana that will be operated by the South African hotel magnate Sol Kerzner. Mr. de Lesseps also has investments in Myanmar, including an upscale housing development with a golf course designed by Gary Player and a 258-bed hospital in Rangoon. But he says he is proudest of a recently completed orphanage and maternity ward in the Shan state of Myanmar, both not-for-profit projects. 
Mr. de Lesseps traces his entrepreneurial bent and interest in social causes to his great-great-grandfather, Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French diplomat who supervised the construction of the Suez Canal in 1879 and then made an unsuccessful attempt to build the Panama Canal. As head of the Franco-American Union, Ferdinand de Lesseps presented the Statue of Liberty to the United States.
A British-born ancestor on the maternal side of Mr. de Lesseps's family, Noel Sampson, was a pioneering investor in India who played polo with the maharajahs. "It's in my blood to discover new trends," Mr. de Lesseps said. 
Alexandre de Lesseps was raised in Khartoum, Sudan, the son of a former French ambassador, and was educated at Northwestern University. There, his capitalistic instincts were tempered by a flirtation with the antiwar movement and the radical left-wing Students for a Democratic Society. 
He began his business career as a film producer in Hollywood, then bought and sold a modeling agency in Paris. In the late 1980's, he decided that Asia was "the place to go," he said, and made a fortune investing in companies based in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region. "I sold all my holdings in 1993, and in 1994, the Asian market collapsed," he recalled. "I was very lucky."
His involvement in microfinancing began a little over two years ago, when a Swiss banker and friend, Melchior de Muralt, approached him about investing in BlueOrchard. Founded by the former United Nations microfinance specialists Cedric Lombard and Jean-Philippe de Schrevel, BlueOrchard manages a mutual fund that currently makes about $50 million in short-term loans to microcredit lending institutions in more than 20 poor countries around the world, from Peru and Nicaragua to India and Indonesia. 
The BlueOrchard Fund is open to retail investors willing to commit a minimum of $10,000. The fund returned 6.8 percent, net of fees, in 2001, and 4.1 percent last year, according to Mr. de Lesseps.
Besides being an investor in BlueOrchard, Mr. de Lesseps is a fund-raiser for the firm in New York (he has a home in the Hamptons), Hong Kong and Europe, and a kind of roving international cheerleader for the microfinancing concept.
"You're not going to get rich investing in microfinance," he conceded. "But at the same time, it's safer than the stock market and offers a much better return than a typical money market account. If you're a blue-chip investor sitting on a lot of cash, it makes sense to put up to 4 percent of your net worth into this type of fund. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that your money is doing good for the poor people of the world."
Mr. de Lesseps has seen BlueOrchard's money at work firsthand on trips with his colleagues. When they arrive in a country they regard as a potential investment area, they visit the central bank or leading aid institutions to learn who is doing micro-financing. Later, on-site research often takes them to interior villages where families may live on less than $10 a month. 
"I visited a village in Cambodia where the people used microcredit loans to buy irrigation equipment and seed, which they use to grow vegetables," Mr. de Lesseps said. "They are now selling the vegetables to exporters and to a local hotel. The whole village has been transformed from dust to being productive. You don't ask for collateral on the loans because they don't have it. But they will die to pay you back because you are giving them a first-time chance. It's a matter of pride.'
BlueOrchard typically charges two to seven percentage points more than Libor for loans to local microcredit institutions, which then charge rates to their borrowers based on assessments of risk factors. In countries like Nicaragua, local lending rates can be up to 22 percent above Libor.
"I know that sounds pretty high," Mr. de Lesseps said. "But you have to remember that other forms of locally available credit are five times higher, and that loan sharks sometimes charge 10 percent a week or even 10 percent a day. If you want to rid the world of poverty, you have to kill loan sharking."
BUT microfinancing is still far from a sure thing. Although Mr. de Lesseps says BlueOrchard's due diligence has so far kept its loan losses near zero, a microcredit subsidiary of South Africa's leading retail bank lost $87 million last year because of bad loans. And Grameen Bank, the granddaddy of microfinance, has come under attack from critics who contend that the actual repayment rate on its loans is much lower than the 95 percent it claims, and that the bank routinely reschedules many overdue loans to keep them from being classified as delinquent.
More generally, skeptics of microfinancing say administrative costs of making small loans can be 25 cents on the dollar or higher, which makes it difficult for lenders to eke out a profit without charging exorbitant interest rates.
Nonetheless, Mr. de Lesseps said he believed that 80 percent of the potential for microfinancing worldwide remained untapped and that the industry would easily be able to absorb more than $10 billion in the next decade. He said he hoped that in light of the recent United Nations initiative, central banks in both poor and developed countries may soon see fit to guarantee microcredit bonds.
"For me the only way to make a difference," he said, "is to make sure that the money going to poor countries is properly managed and not just thrown away."

In Tokyo, a Summer Thriller That Might Last

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
LIKE the latest installment in the "Godzilla" series, Japan's stock market has tried to storm back with a vengeance.
 Long considered graveyards for equity investors, Japanese stocks have risen again, taking many investors by surprise. After falling to two-decade lows in April, the benchmark Nikkei 225 climbed more than 30 percent by early July, not bad for a market that many people considered on the verge of collapse. 
 The big question, though, is whether the market will ignite again after investors return from summer vacations, or whether, like the latest Godzilla flick, it will soon fade. After a lull in trading, the market is now up just 8.7 percent for the year in dollar terms, more than a percentage point behind the Dow industrials. But during this rally, unlike those that fizzled in 2001 and 2002, optimists clearly outnumber the pessimists. 
The reasons are as varied as they are familiar. Household names like Toshiba and Honda Motor, as well as top-notch makers of steel and machinery, are still trading well below their all-time peaks. Most of them are exporters and are benefiting from a pickup in the American economy and from China's booming expansion. Their products continue to hold their own against foreign competition in important markets.
Hit by years of slow growth and deflation, many companies have also been closing factories,trimming payrolls and cutting other costs. This has increased profit margins for nonfinancial companies on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange to 5.1 percent, on average, a record high, according to JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management. The profit margins, though below levels in the United States and Europe, should continue rising as sales grow.
"The level and scale of the restructuring is impressive and has a long way to go," said Peter Kirkman, chief investment officer at JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management in Tokyo, who helps manage $12 billion in assets. "What people have forgotten is that many of Japan's manufacturers are still world class."
Japan's stock indexes, at least when compared with other major markets overseas, are also cheap. After years of brutal losses, many foreign fund managers that track Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes had sold all their Japanese holdings. But as some investors saw the Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 indexes becoming frothy in the spring, they turned their sights to Japan, where the Nikkei 225 had hit a low of 7,600 yen at the end of April. 
"A lot of people had thrown in the towel on Japan," said Robert Sasaki, managing director of the derivatives department at Bear Stearns here. "In a bear market, you can only sell down to zero. Now, it looks like things in the U.S. are looking up and the U.S. will continue to lead Japan."
The absence of bad news has even been cause for celebration. Since last October, investors have been waiting to see whether regulators would allow the country's banking industry to spin out of control and wreck the economy.
Instead, the government spent 2 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) to bail out Resona Holdings, Japan's fifth-largest lender, in May. Many investors interpreted that move as a signal that lawmakers would do everything possible to forestall a crisis.
As these stars aligned, foreign investors who often drive rallies here piled back in. Foreigners have now been net buyers of Japanese stocks for 16 consecutive weeks, and trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange has surpassed a billion shares a day for most of the spring and summer, a level of activity not witnessed since the 1980's.
Strategists have long assumed that United States economic growth will accelerate, but some are now encouraged by signs in Japan, as well. Consumer spending, new-home starts and industrial production have started to surpass expectations, always a bullish sign. Business confidence has also improved, suggesting that the tepid recovery under way will pick up steam.
Some analysts also point to the growth of entirely domestic industries, like health care, education and telecommunications, which are helping to wean the economy from its reliance on exports. Not coincidentally, these industries are also getting a boost from government deregulation.
"Japan has to develop an alternative engine for growth which is not exports but domestic demand," said Kathy Matsui, a strategist in Tokyo for Goldman Sachs who expects the market to rise an additional 30 percent in the next 12 months.
 GIVEN the collapse of many mini-rallies during the past few years, a heavy dose of skepticism is not unwarranted. The biggest time bomb remains the banks. Financial regulators have demanded that lenders clean up their balance sheets faster. That may well be a positive factor in the long term but will likely lead the banks to sell more of their stock holdings before the fiscal year ends next March, depressing the market.
Critics also say the government did not demand enough in return for bailing out Resona,leading some to contend that other banks and shareholders will be treated less favorably in the future.
"A lot of this rally is based on the belief the government will be as generous to shareholders of other banks as it was to Resona," said Zuhair Khan, an equity analyst at Citigroup Asset Management in Tokyo. "That won't necessarily be the case."
There is also the risk -- confirmed in years past -- that corporate Japan will slow its restructuring efforts once sales pick up. If that happens again, profit growth may weaken and companies will be unprepared for any slowdowns. And there is the chance that foreign investors will flee if stock markets fall elsewhere. Global fund managers often sell shares in one market and use the profits to offset losses accumulated elsewhere. If the stock rally in the United States fades, Japanese shares might follow suit.
All of which makes Japan's stock market a wobbly bet, but still one worth reconsidering.

HEADLINE: Familiar Face at the Hard Times Hotel 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
IAN SCHRAGER, a man who has ruled New York night life twice, sat in his large loftlike offices on 10th Avenue at 9 a.m. Thursday, dressed in a white shirt and a pair of bluejeans and displaying the pugilistic charm that has bounced him off the ropes before.
 Mr. Schrager's company, Ian Schrager Hotels, which he owns with a New York investment firm, Northstar Capital, was at that moment waist-deep in debt -- $355 million of which was coming due three days later. At the worst, he faced losing control of the Royalton and Morgans in New York, the Delano in Miami Beach and the Mondrian in West Hollywood. A week earlier, the company had announced the refinancing of another $16 million loan in California -- just a portion of what he needs to get his stalled renovation of the Miramar resort in Santa Barbara off the ground. And the company's 400-room Clift in San Francisco is also having debt problems -- a loan administrator has been called inby the lender. 
 "We're dealing with it," Mr. Schrager said of the company's fortunes with the kind of bravado that can walk you past doormen at the kinds of clubs and hotels he has made himself famous for. "I'm not concerned about it." You could have sliced the lack of concern with a knife. 
Seven hours later, he was back off the ropes: lenders agreed in principle to extend their loans on the Royalton, Morgans, the Delano and the Mondrian for two years, temporarily rescuing his investments. 
But Mr. Schrager, 57, is also back in the furious center of the ring. Industry experts predict that the travel market won't recover for several years, during which time his debts will come due again. And Mr. Schrager's concept -- a high-style, high-profile, or "boutique," hotel with at least as much hipness as hospitality -- is facing a new generation of competitors and a new generation of guests, including a fashionable world eager to move on to the next big (or small) thing.
Mr. Schrager, who was leaving the next day for a vacation that included stops in Croatia and Poland, appeared as adept at creating spin as he has been at creating buzz -- a quality that has been integral to his past successes and that even his detractors call brilliant. It was hard not to suspect that his holiday travel and his financial rescue had been planned at the same time, with an eye to catching his plane.
At his hotels, well received for the originality of their design, the rates on the rooms have stumbled. They are down as much as 40 percent at the Royalton, the Paramount, the Delano, the Clift and the Mondrian. Last week, several of the hotels were on discount Web sites like Freenewyorkhotelguide.com or Hotels.com. On Friday, the Royalton, which pulled in over $350 a room in better days, was asking $209.95.
That fall in room rates has left Mr. Schrager's hotel company in a bind. Now that guests have grown accustomed to getting his rooms for less, some industry observers wonder whether they will tolerate higher rates even when the market recovers. "His product is pitched at a price point that may not be available for a long time," said a travel industry consultant who asked not to be named.
To what extent are Mr. Schrager's difficulties his alone? Beset by the weak economy and the travel anxieties that followed the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, the entire hotel industry is suffering its worst years in recent memory, with boutique hotels hit particularly hard. According to Smith Travel Research, a leading travel information company, the standard industry benchmark for room and occupancy rates at boutique hotels in general has dropped 18 percent since its peak in 2000.
But Mr. Schrager also has problems of his own making. Hotel operators and lodging consultants observe that in the 1990's he and his partners expanded rapidly and borrowed heavily, banking on Mr. Schrager's ability to deliver publicity, an instant reputation for a new hotel as a hot spot and a cachet that could be translated into high room rates.
"The guy got caught" as a result of the unpredictably tough post-Sept. 11 market, said Thomas McConnell, a senior vice president in the hotel group at CB Richard Ellis Worldwide, a real estate firm. "He was stretched out. Timing killed him."
As rates fell, the real estate values of the properties did too, until outstanding mortgages were larger than the hotels' combined appraised value, according to Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency, which downgraded some Ian Schrager Hotels bonds to junk status in June. (A spokesman for Mr. Schrager's company said that independent appraisers had found that the properties were worth more than the mortgages, adding that the company is also negotiating with its lenders on the Clift and does not consider the loans troubled.)
Ira Drukier, a co-owner of the competing Mercer, Chambers and Maritime hotels in New York, characterized Mr. Schrager's temporary rescue last week as breathing space, but not a pair of lungs.
"If the market goes down from here, it's only going to get worse," Mr. Drukier said.
Mr. Schrager talks of taking his vision to the next exciting level -- last week he and a partner made an investment that could give them control of the 350-room Gramercy Park Hotel, according to a person familiar with the deal. Yet others in his industry talk of a "post hip," post-Sept. 11 customer who favors a return to the more fundamental values of the business, including old-fashioned service and amenities. The yellow escalators and plastic Louis XV furniture might be ready for a rest.
With rates low, visitors have their choice of many hotels and many types of experience, and Mr. Schrager is not the only game in town anymore. From exclusive addresses like the Mercer or 60 Thompson in SoHo to fast-growing chains like the W hotels of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, the boutique hotel -- Mr. Schrager's baby since 1984, when Morgans opened on Madison Avenue -- has grown into an independent-minded young adult with loads of rivals.
For every Royalton or Delano, there are direct competitors with reputations of their own, like the small, serene Mercer, with its A-list house party of well-heeled regulars. There are also dozens of boutique hotels that have never been the setting for a fragrance kickoff or a model's birthday party but that offer the same basic stylish alternative to conventional hotels. With their new-age soaps and wenge wood cabinetry and Philippe Starck-like lighting, they amount to a new hip homogeneity, as uniform in their own way as any standard hospitality chain.
Mr. Schrager is dismissive of many of the copycats. "I'd rather stay in the originals," he said. "I think there's a very fine line between Coca-Cola and Royal Crown Cola. And I'd rather have the Coca-Cola."
But for many younger guests who missed the sonic buzz-boom of Mr. Schrager's entrance into the field, with its flashy event planning, that fine line is too fine to see. The colleagues who helped create the bright lights have departed -- among them Rande Gerber, who ran the bars, and Brian McNally, who ran the restaurants. Mr. Gerber's trademark Whiskey bar is now a feature of the W hotels. Mr. McNally works for himself.
Mr. Schrager's more serious problem is that core boutique hotel customers are, by nature, shoppers who identify themselves by fashion, and the latest is always going to be the best.
On Wednesday evening at the Maritime in Chelsea, which was opened last month by a pair of night-life entrepreneurs (sound familiar?), Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson, the people in the lobby and on the terrace were a portrait of fresh attitude, as wet as the hotel's paint: tiny martial-arts pigtails, cargo Capri pants, one-shoulder back bags, fatigue T-shirts and bell-bottom jeans with macrame belts, underscored by a subtle self-importance that left the impression of a picnic tent after a celebrity softball game.
"I've stayed at all of Ian Schrager's," Dirk Denison, an architect from Chicago with a shaved head who was a guest at the Maritime, said as he left with two friends. "But I always try the newest. Something new -- mix it up."
"The rooms are tiny, but beautiful," he added. "We thought the Royalton's were small. . . . " Style never sleeps.
At another competitor, 60 Thompson in SoHo, Adrian Joffe, general director of Comme des Garcons in Paris, chatted with colleagues in the lobby one balmy night last week. Upstairs, on a private roof deck, an invitation-only crowd sipped Champagne and martinis against a skyline view of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings.
Mr. Joffe said he had decided against checking into a Schrager hotel.
"I used to like them a lot," he said. "I've stayed at them all, but they've lost their soul." The Hudson, Mr. Schrager's and Mr. Starck's 1,000-room statement on West 58th Street, turned the tide for him.
"It was the worst hotel experience of my life," Mr. Joffe said, recalling that business faxes were mislaid and the staff was unfriendly. "There was a total absence of service, and the rooms were terrible."
Mr. Schrager acknowledged that "we haven't been as good on service as I would like to have been," speaking of the hotels' reputation for being "exclusionary" in the bars and restaurants and the inhospitable attitudes that can attend that. "And we get a little bit of a black eye. We're in a service business."
Much is in play in the hotel industry right now, and there are certainly other boutique players, as well as four-star hotels, facing hard truths, like how to spend money and how to make it.
The Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group in San Francisco, which owns 38 boutique hotels and is in the midst of a $19 million renovation of the Doral Park Avenue Hotel as a 205-room boutique in New York, sold one of five hotels being offered several weeks ago. Though the Four Seasons in New York was reported to have spent $1 million on each room when it opened in 1993, a more typical cost for even expensive boutique hotels is likely to be safely under $200,000. Mr. Schrager would not disclose the costs on his hotels, though he described them proudly as lower than average because of design decisions, like the use of floor-to-ceiling tile instead of marble in bathrooms at Morgans, that pushed his visions forward as they eased his expenses.
This certainly isn't the first time Mr. Schrager has been in a tough spot. In the 1980's, he went to prison for 13 months after being convicted of tax evasion at Studio 54, his best-known nightclub. He lost Morgans and the Royalton, with which he introduced the boutique hotel concept, to lenders in the early 1990's. He later bought them back. Now, he has nine hotels and 5,000 rooms in five cities.
To his credit, Mr. Schrager's kindest audiences are his competitors. Few are willing to contend that he is down for the count -- some with a nervous defensiveness that could be based on the belief that they are all, to a degree, in the same boat.
"If there is anyone who is going to survive the market conditions it is certainly going to be him," said Jason Pomeranc, one of three brothers who own 60 Thompson.
Mr. Drukier, of the Mercer and Maritime hotels, agreed. "If I was betting, I'd bet with Ian, not against him," he said.
Mr. Schrager, who has a fighter's spring in conversation and returns frequently to his favorite themes of innovation, distinctiveness and subversion, said the rise of competition proves only that he was right in the first place -- after a long period of skepticism that he suffered in solitary, like the weight of a king's crown. "Starwood comes in and does W, and all of a sudden gives me instant credibility," he said.
Even his troubled properties still show that Mr. Schrager's name and style can draw guests. One nightlast week at the Clift, the San Francisco hotel that opened in 2001 -- and was hit shortly thereafter by Sept. 11 and the technology collapse that deprived hotels of some of their best customers -- a smattering of guests in the lobby gave the usual reasons for choosing a hotel: it was close to their business meetings, it offered a cheap rate or it was recommended by a travel agent.
But others said they were attracted by the Schrager imprint. "I love his hotels," said Lisa Tortora, a market researcher from Connecticut. "They're very eclectic and contemporary and chic."
Her friend Emil Morales, who said he was unfamiliar with Mr. Schrager's hotels, relaxed on a low couch framed in huge tusks, a setting that any self-respecting Surrealist might have found a safe harbor.
"It's very artsy," Mr. Morales said. "It's a high-energy crowd. It's not your typical Hyatt or Marriott."
But, he added, "I like it a lot. "

HEADLINE: What Investors Should Do Now 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and ALEX MARKELS

 BODY:
DOROTHY O. MULVI has developed something of a following at Golden West Manor, a high-rise retirement home overlooking the Rocky Mountains in Boulder, Colo. When other residents are thinking about how to stretch their savings to pay for retirement, they often come to Ms. Mulvi, an 82-year-old former bond trader, for investment tips. These days, however, she tends to have only one piece of advice, and it is not very comforting.
 Sit tight, she told one friend recently. Don't tie up your money quite yet in long-range interest-bearing investments. Just because long-term interest rates have ticked up over the last month or so, she pointed out, they are still near the 40-year lows. 
 This may well be the most confusing time for investors in more than 20 years, and not only for those like Ms. Mulvi who are more dependent on the returns from their investments to live day to day. Short-term interest rates are below inflation for the first time since 1980. Many investment advisers consider long-term bonds a poor choice despite the recent climb in their return, with the rate on a 10-year Treasury note now at 4.27 percent, up from 3.1 percent in June. 
Stocks remain more expensive than they have been for much of the last century, relative to corporate earnings. Real estate values in some regions are considered excessive, making housing in some cases a potentially risky investment.
"There is just no easy answer," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Mulvi has even taken to advising some friends to do as she has done and dip into their investment principal.
"That pains me," she said, tightening the grip on her cane as she sat in Golden West's lobby. "I'm a conservative person."
Amid all the uncertainty, however, there is also room for many people to fare better than they are now. Doing so requires thinking about investing as something that encompasses more than cash flows and tax implications and extends to far more basic concepts, financial experts say. In a strange way, that might offer a little relief from all the uncertainty.
With short-term interest rates near zero, economizing has become more lucrative than it was in the 1990's. People who cut $50 from their monthly expenses -- by switching to a less expensive Internet service, say, or quitting a gym they never use -- are adding the same amount to their after-tax income as the interest on a $100,000 money market fund might.
Index funds, which generally have the lowest expenses among mutual funds, have become attractive for the same reason. So are investments that do not force people to tie up their money for years at the current level of returns. Many households could more than double the return they are getting on a C.D. or money market fund by moving the cash to inflation-indexed government bonds, which are paying 4.66 percent a year and must be held for just 12 months.
Of course, investing never looks free of peril at the time when the decisions are made. Many of the clairvoyant people who pulled their money out of technology stocks in early 2000, for example, worried at the time that the bubble was still inflating. The home buyers who brilliantly bought real estate amid the 2001 recession received no assurances then that housing prices were still on the rise.
But the current situation is nonetheless unusual. It has created vexing questions for retirees, baby boomers preparing to follow them soon and even Generations X, Y and Z, who should care almost exclusively about the long term and will usually do best by diversifying their investments.
There is no low-hanging fruit, said Martin Barnes, managing editor of the Bank Credit Analyst, an investment publication based in Montreal. It was easier in the 90's, even before the run-up in stocks, he said.
After the recent jump in interest rates, as investors have become more confident about economic growth but more concerned about the federal budget deficit, long-term bonds offer the latest temptation. But buying these bonds could ultimately feel like buying the best apple in a barrel full of rotten ones.
A few years from now, the 4 percent return now available on a 10-year note could look far less attractive than it does today, particularly if the economy picks up and takes inflation with it.
"You've got to be patient in the expectation that rates will rise," said Marshall B. Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates, an investment counseling firm in Chicago. "Then you can tie your money up."
People who buy long-term bonds now are likely to suffer the same fate as those who bought long-term Treasuries a month ago, Mr. Front added. As interest rates have risen, those investors have seen the principal value of their bonds fall about 8 percent.
Ms. Mulvi agrees: "We've got a $450 billion deficit now, and it's going to be financed through the issuance of additional Treasury securities," she said. "That's going to bring interest rates up."
In fact, economists can make a credible argument, grounded in history, that bonds or stocks or houses are so far ahead of themselves that they will be to the coming decade what Japanese real estate and General Motors shares were to the previous one. Based on earnings over the last 12 months, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is more expensive than it has been at any time since 1950, outside of the late 90's.
Money market deposit accounts, meanwhile, are paying an average annual return of about 0.5 percent, down from about 2 percent during most of 2001, according to the research company BankRate.com. Against that background, some investors find that they have more financial decisions to make, because some municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities have recently been called in before their due dates, unable to continue paying 5 or 6 percent a year.
Ms. Mulvi and other people trying to live on investment income face the hardest choices. Many already live on tight budgets, offering little chance at easy savings, and they cannot simply abandon low-risk, low-return investments to put their faith in the stock market's unmatched long-termrecord.
In Boulder, 20 percent of the apartments are now vacant at Villas at the Atrium, a retirement home that costs $2,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment, meals, housekeeping and other services. That is more than twice the rent across town at Golden West. Three years ago, Villas at the Atrium was full.
"People are moving out of here because they can't afford it anymore," said Elizabeth Pahlke, who moved to the Atrium four years ago with her husband and has continued to live there since he died six months ago. "I'm having to dig into the principal of my investments," she added, "to pay for it."
To conserve principal, she has made small spending cuts. She no longer eats out, as she did with her husband, and avoids buying souvenirs on trips, like a vacation last month in Minnesota with grandchildren. As is the case for many of her peers, however, one big cost is going in the other direction: health care.
Although Medicare covered most of a recent ambulance ride to the hospital, her share of the $800 bill was more than twice as much as it was the last time she needed an ambulance, four years ago. "And it's not like it's something I could have done without," Mrs. Pahlke said.
Overall medical costs having risen 10 percent since the start of 2001, according to the Labor Department, while the Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark federal funds interest rate to 1 percent, from 6.5 percent. That divergence has become a frequent subject of complaints to AARP, the lobbying group.
"We get calls from seniors asking us to lobby Alan Greenspan to raise interest rates," said David M. Certner, AARP's director of federal affairs. "But the truth is, there's not an easy solution to the problem right now."
When Mr. Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, testified before Congress last month, Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, questioned him sharply about the problems that low interest rates create for retirees. Mr. Greenspan replied that the Fed had no choice but to keep its benchmark rate low and to encourage business investment, home buying and other activity that would help the still-weak economy.
"We can't have it both ways," Mr. Greenspan said. In other words, we cannot have both high interest rates, which give significant incomes to those who hold interest-paying investments, and low interest rates, which will stabilize the economy and expand it.
INVESTORS can do better than a 1 percent annual return by handing over their money for longer stretches of time. Five-year C.D.'s still yield about 2.7 percent, on average, compared with 0.85 percent for a three-month C.D. and 0.26 percent for an interest-bearing checking account, according to BankRate.com.
But these present some of the same problems as long-term bonds. At today's low interest rates, tying up money for long periods rarely makes sense, financial planners say. Despite their puny yields, money market accounts and C.D.'s remain better options for many people who need income because of the flexibility the investments offer. If rates rise, as many economists expect, better opportunities will become available.
For investors who are just looking for a safe, decent return without immediate income, meanwhile, the inflation-indexed bonds remain attractive. They are still paying a better return than a 10-year note, even though they require just a small time commitment and do not put the investment's principal at risk.
The bonds -- which are known as I-bonds and should not be confused with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, whose underlying value varies -- will nowpay about 1.1 percentage points a year over the inflation rate for up to 30 years, and they can be redeemed anytime after one year. For the first five years, investors who redeem them must forfeit their last three months of interest.
The stocks in the S.& P. 500 are also paying more income than money market funds, and their current dividend yield of about 1.7 percent could increase soon. The yield is now far below its 50-year average, and the most recent tax cut included a reduction in dividend taxes for investors, potentially increasing the incentives for companies to pay them.
Citigroup has increased its dividend to 35 cents a share, from 20 cents. Viacom has said it will pay its first dividend in 16 years.
BUT the more basic -- and perhaps creative -- solutions to the challenge of investing in a low interest-rate world present much less risk than stocks.
Coletta and Bill Davis of Carlsbad, Calif., did not come to the strategy by choice, but they have been converted. They entered retirement with a bulging stock portfolio, then watched as their life savings deflated in the last three years. "We lost so much principal when the stock market went down," said Mrs. Davis, 66, who had been a vice president at a large bank, "that the thought of spending even a penny more of it just panicked me."
But they decided that they had no alternative -- and have set aside some of the money for living expenses while putting most of it in long-term investments. By going to fewer movies and restaurants and canceling some trips they had imagined, the Davises estimate that they spend about $300 less each month than they had expected. A money market fund with a typical yield would need to have a balance of $350,000 before it could produce that much income a month -- and that income would be taxed.
Investors can also create their own returns by moving money out of high-cost mutual funds. The average annual expense for a domestic stock fund is 1.49 percent, while the average cost of an index fund is 0.78 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. In other words, the difference between the two is a good bit larger than the yield on a typical money market fund.
For people with outstanding credit card debt, the opportunity is even better. "If somebody is making 1 percent on a money market fund and paying 18 percent on a credit card, there's a spectacular investment to be made by paying off the credit card," said Andrew Tobias, author of "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" (Harcourt, 2002).
Where else are spectacular investments available these days?

Awaiting the Iraqi Framers, A World of Constitutional Lessons

BYLINE:  By JOHN D. THOMAS; John D. Thomas is the editor of Playboy.com and a contributing editor at Playboy magazine.

 BODY:
IRAQ is an ancient land, but it is also a new country. And what does every nascent nation need first and foremost? A new constitution, which is exactly what the recently formed 25-person Iraqi Governing Council is in the process of writing. 
 "The Iraqi Governing Council is meeting regularly," President Bush said in a White House speech two weeks ago. "Soon representatives of the people will begin drafting a new constitution and free elections will follow. After decades of oppression, the people of Iraq are reclaiming their country and are reclaiming their future." 
 Codifying that future will be no easy task, and the Governing Council will obviously look to the American Constitution for inspiration. But the world is full of constitutions new and old -- some eloquent, some terse -- that guarantee a citizen's right to everything from life and liberty to a living wage and a clean environment. These, too, might serve as guides for the Iraqi framers. 
An Internet site at The University of Bern in Switzerland features English translations of many of the world's constitutions (www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl
/home.html), from which the following excerpts were gathered. JOHN D. THOMAS
One reason the United States gave for invading Iraq was to end the government's torture and killing of its citizens. Such behavior is outlawed by Article 46 of Azerbaijan's Constitution, "Right to Defend the Honor and Dignity":
Nobody must be subject to tortures and torment, treatment or punishment humiliating the dignity of human beings. Medical, scientific and other experiments must not be carried out on any person without his/her consent.
The Algerian Constitution seeks the same end, but takes a blunter approach in Article 22, "Abuse of Power":
Power abuse is repressed by the law.
Most constitutions are liberal and progressive in doling out rights. In some instances, however, as with China's Article 41, "Freedom of Speech," the rights are amply qualified and, given the country's track record, appear to be more for show than anything else.
1. Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to criticize and make suggestions to any state organ or functionary. Citizens have the right to make to relevant state organs complaints and charges against, or exposures of, any state organ or functionary for violation of the law or dereliction of duty; but fabrication or distortion of facts for the purpose of libel or frame-up is prohibited.
2. The state organ concerned must deal with complaints, charges or exposures made by citizens in a responsible manner after ascertaining the facts. No one may suppress such complaints, charges and exposure, or retaliate against the citizens making them.
Protecting the environment is becoming a more important concern around the world, and that is reflected in a number of constitutions. In Section 41 of Argentina's Constitution:
All inhabitants are entitled to the right to a healthy and balanced environment fit for human development in order that productive activities shall meet present needs without endangering those of future generations. . . . The entry into the national territory of present or potential dangerous wastes, and of radioactive ones, is forbidden.
The language of some constitutions can be more poetic than practical, although something is surely lost in the translation. Consider Article 24, "Right to Honor and Reputation," of Ethiopia's Constitution:
Everyone has the right to recognition every where as a person.
Many constitutions deal with the prospect of war and the protection of the state. On this topic, the exiled government of Tibet takes a decidedly pacifist approach in Article 7, "Renunciation of Violence and the Use of Force":
Future Tibet shall remain a zone of peace and shall strive to disengage itself in the production of all destructive weapons, including nuclear and chemical; and, currently refrain from the use of all offensive methods as a means to achieve the common goal of Tibet, or for any other purpose.
In the United States Constitution, the right to a living wage is not explicitly addressed, unlike in many other constitutions. In India's, Article 43 is clear on the matter: 
The state shall endeavor to secure, by suitable legislation or economic organization or in any other way, to all workers agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities and, in particular, the state shall endeavor to promote cottage industries on an individual or cooperative basis in rural areas.
The South Korean Constitution, however, reminds would-be complainers that with rights come responsibilities. From Article 32, "Work": 
All citizens have the duty to work.
The concept of work and compensation is handled in an entirely different fashion in Iran's Constitution. From a section of its preamble, titled "The Economy Is a Means, Not an End": 
In strengthening the foundations of the economy, the fundamental consideration will be fulfillment of the material needs of man in the course of his overall growth and development. This principle contrasts with other economic systems, where the aim is concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit. In materialist schools of thought, the economy represents an end in itself, so that it comes to be a subversive and corrupting factor in the course of man's development. In Islam, the economy is a means, and all that is required of a means is that it should be an efficient factor contributing to the attainment of the ultimate goal.
While the Equal Rights Amendment never passed in America, the topic of women's equality is a subject other nations have formalized, including Italy, in Article 37, "Equality of Women at Work": 
Working women are entitled to equal rights and, for comparable jobs, equal pay as men. Working conditions have to be such as to allow women to fulfill their essential family duties and ensure an adequate protection of mothers and children.
Unlike the United States, many international constitutions contain specifics about national symbols, as in Article 7 of Nepal's Constitution:
The rhododendron arboreum shall be the national flower, crimson color shall be the national color, the cow shall be the national animal and the lophophorus shall be the national bird of Nepal.
Privacy is covered in many constitutions. In Russia's, however, it seems as if the document protects it in a way that is almost impossible to enforce. From Article 24, "Data Protection":
It is forbidden to gather, store, use and disseminate information on the private life of any person without his/her consent.
Opponents and proponents of abortion in the United States have long debated adding something to the Constitution on the topic. In Madagascar, the Constitution makes it very clear where the state stands on the issue in Article 19, "Health, No Abortion":
The State shall recognize every individual's right to protection of his health, starting from conception.
In the end, religion will probably be the most prickly area for Iraq's framers. The American advisers, presumably in favor of some semblance of separation between church and state, may well hope that Fiji remains off the Governing Council's radar. In Section 5 of their Constitution, the Fijians try to have it both ways:
Although religion and the state are separate, the people of the Fiji Islands acknowledge that worship and reverence of God are the source of good government and leadership.

When the Laws of Supply and Demand Don't Apply

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD and JENNIFER 8. LEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AFTER consumers complained about natural gas prices, which reached frighteningly high levels over the last few months, many Republicans and the drilling industry proposed a solution: open up the land and offshore areas now closed to exploration because of environmental regulations.
 "It's fairly simple," said Representative Richard W. Pombo of California, the chairman of the House Resources Committee. "If you look at the geological studies as to where natural gas is, a lot of it is under public lands in the West. And that is simple because most of the West is public land. It has become increasingly difficult to do gas exploration under public land because of the regulation that the government has adopted over several years." 
 The argument relies on the basic law of supply and demand. A cold winter lowered inventories of natural gas, but suppliers are not rushing to drill new wells, because, they say, the best areas are off limits. Remove the environmental regulations, the industry says, and it will drill wells, raising supplies and lowering prices. 
If only it were that simple. The truth is, rising prices are the result not of rising demand but of the structure of the natural gas market -- and solutions for that aren't readily apparent.
Natural gas is not a garden-variety commodity, like, say, lettuce. If prices for romaine rise rapidly, consumers can easily switch to arugula, and prices for romaine will eventually stabilize. But most consumers of natural gas -- electrical generators, chemical manufacturers, other industries and homeowners -- cannot easily switch to oil or another fuel. They have furnaces designed for gas, or they must abide by clean-air rules, which favor natural gas. 
The same phenomenon works in reverse if prices decrease, as they did in most of the 1990's. When prices are low, consumers do not use more, and producers do not shut down existing wells. So the price crashes -- a problem for the producers. 
Prices are also destabilized because the market is an island. Of the natural gas used in the United States, 85 percent is produced in the lower 48 states, and the rest is almost all imported from Canada.
The domestic crude-oil market, in contrast, is not as volatile because it is part of an open global market. When Venezuelan production shut down last fall, refiners were able to buy their oil from Europe, Asia and the Middle East instead. Even during the war in Iraq, prices settled down because there were alternate sources.
While it would seem logical to increase the sources of natural gas domestically or internationally, it cannot be easily done. The supplies that can be easily and cheaply drilled have been exhausted. The industry wants to look farther afield, but there are the inevitable environmental and political problems. Environmentalists point out that the Interior Department's own study found that only 12 percent of the reserves on land and 20 percent of off-shore reserves are in places in which drilling is restricted or banned. Producers counter that too many other areas are effectively off limits, because of seasonal restrictions based on environmental concerns, like the mating season of endangered birds.
Even if these reserves were readily available, domestic drilling is unlikely to solve the problem in the long term, because of a geological fact of life: the United States has about 3 percent of the world's natural gas reserves, but accounts for a quarter of worldwide consumption. That problem was made obvious last winter, when it was extremely cold; the amount of gas in storage was lowered by about 20 percent.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and others look to imports for a solution. "If North American natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility exhibited by oil, unlimited access to the vast world reserves of gas is required," Mr. Greenspan testified last month. "It's not that we are looking at a world shortage of natural gas. It is a domestic problem." He noted that consumers and businesses in Britain and Europe pay only half as much for gas because recent discoveries in Russia and the North Sea have made it more plentiful there.
But opening up the market won't be easy. Only 1 percent of the nation's gas supply comes from outside North America, because natural gas is hard to transport. It must be chilled until it liquefies and hauled in special tankers. Recently, the technology has improved, and international trade is growing. But energy companies would still have to make a huge investment in tankers, terminals and factories to liquefy the gas.
The industry is wary. While the price is relatively high now, there is no way to predict the price in 20 years -- or two years or two months. Only two decades ago, companies invested heavily in the equipment needed to import gas. But after the price collapsed, the owners had to watch their equipment sit idle.
So the market has been caught in a self-perpetuating cycle: prices are volatile, which deters companies from investing in the equipment needed to import gas, which keeps prices volatile.
In the end, importing natural gas might be smarter than importing oil, because two-thirds of the oil is in the Middle East, but only one-third of the gas is there.
"We will be more secure with natural imports than with oil imports because the natural supply is spread out more evenly around the world and not as concentrated in the Middle East, which is our challenge with oil," said Pete Morton, an economist with the Wilderness Society.
Nearly two-fifths of the world's natural gas reserves are in the former Soviet Union. And many other countries also have reserves: Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. Thus natural gas has another advantage. It does not have the cartel equivalent of OPEC -- at least not yet.

School Basics: Paper, Pencils and Perfume

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
Back-to-school spending. Hmmm. A few pens and pencils, a ream of lined paper, perhaps a new pair of jeans, right? Uh, no.
 A third of parents plan to spend more than $500 this time around, with 10 percent topping $1,000, according to an NPD Group survey. For what, exactly? Well, it's "back to basics," NPD pronounces. But those "basics" include things like perfume and cellphones, for which spending is expected to stay at last year's level, in addition to clothing and school supplies, for which outlays will rise. 
The 2,795 parents who completed the online survey, though, will spend less, often "much less," on MP3 players, portable CD players and electronic organizers. Ouch. HUBERT B. HERRING

Who Said Anything About Rice? Free Trade Is About Cars and PlayStations

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ

DATELINE: TSUKIDATE, Japan 

 BODY:
All of the 250 or so members of the 1971 class at Kurihara Agricultural High School in Miyagi prefecture -- three hours north of Tokyo by bullet train -- went into farming upon graduating, but by now, fewer than a dozen are still doing it full time.
 "Early on, I was so excited to be producing rice for all those people in Tokyo and other cities. And they in turn felt a connection to the land, because people's roots, no matter where they lived, were out here," said Koushi Seiwa, one of the few remaining full-time farmers from his class, in a recent chat in the cafe his wife runs. He pointed emphatically out the window as he spoke, toward the tidy, perfectly irrigated rice paddies. 
 Farmers here are determined to remind anyone who will listen that the sense of order in the Japanese countryside isn't Mother Nature's doing. "Time was when people felt a responsibility to care for the land you received from your parents and they from their parents, and this was central to Japanese culture," added Hiko Hisamitsu, a friend and Kurihara High classmate of Mr. Seiwa. 
This equating of agriculture with land stewardship lies at the heart of Japanese and European reluctance to meet developing countries' demands that they lower their barriers to farm imports. Japan's exorbitant rice tariffs, hovering near 500 percent, are Exhibit A of such reluctance. Yet farmers like Mr. Seiwa worry about the incessant international pressure, combined with younger generations' lack of interest in agriculture.
"Now, younger people in Tokyo wouldn't know how to grow rice if their life depended on it, and a lot of consumers probably wouldn't think twice about buying imported rice," he complained. 
Not that they are able to do so. For the Japanese government, which continues to spend billions of dollars each year supporting its farmers, rice protectionism is as much a matter of cultural policy as it is an agricultural matter. The Japanese word for rice, gohan, is also used as the generic term for any meal. Besides being the staple of the traditional Japanese diet, rice is also used to make candies and provides the national drink, sake, or rice wine.
Still, recession-weary consumers here are tired of paying three or four times more for food than people do elsewhere. And Japanese industry resents the fact that the country's farm policies have stymied any number of potential free-trade deals with resentful agricultural exporters. The farmers' aversion to regional and bilateral trade agreements has hurt Japanese manufacturers in dealing with countries like Mexico, where European and American competitors enjoy duty-free privileges. Over the long run, it could affect Japan's critical relationship with China, which is eager to sell Japan cheap rice.
Japan now uses a quota system to import less than 10 percent of all rice consumed, tariff-free. The rest runs up against that whopping 500 percent wall. If the tariffs were abolished or significantly reduced, Japan would find itself importing more than half the rice it consumes, according to Keijiro Otsuka, an economist at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo and a leading proponent of liberalization.
An open Japanese market would probably create a trickle-down effect for other rice-producing nations. Farmers in California, Australia and China, where producer prices are one-tenth those in Japan, would be the biggest beneficiaries. They produce the short-grain, stickier Japonica rice that Japanese consumers prefer. Poorer tropical countries unable to produce such rice would, in turn, probably sell more of their own rice to China, which would most likely shift some of its production over to Japonica for export.
Japanese farmers equate that kind of change with the end of Japanese agriculture, but Mr. Otsuka and other economists here don't agree, especially if trade liberalization led to a restructuring of the farming sector. Ever since the implementation of American-prescribed land reform after World War II, farming has been organized around small-time producers. Corporations are literally banned from farming. An end to the current massive protectionism might mean that farms of tomorrow would be larger and more efficient.
Mr. Seiwa sadly views the future in pretty much the same way. "You should wait a few years and once this generation of farmers has all retired, you can then have a few companies here run everything, as they do in America," he said.
For Japan, the question of how much to protect its farmers, and at what cost to its international interests and obligations, is a matter that straddles competing national identities. One is of Japan as an island striving for self-sufficiency, shutting out the rest of the world until well into the 19th century and Commodore Matthew Perry's arrival.
Then there is the more contemporary idea of Japan, the world's second-largest economy and a nation that owes its prosperity to its exporting prowess. This outward-looking Japan believes it has the right to unfettered access to global markets, even if it means that a lot of people elsewhere -- including plenty of factory workers in America -- lose their livelihoods. 
The apparent double standard is always resolved by Japanese officials with an assertion that agriculture is different. The view that farm goods should not be regulated by trade rules covering other products is still widely held here -- as it is in many other developed nations whose attitude toward their farmers is equally protective, although often more flexible than Japan's. 
Tokyo knows it can no longer openly demand to have it both ways, and professes to want progress in the World Trade Organization's so-called development round of trade liberalization talks. At the same time, it is making common cause with the European Union to oppose meaningful concessions before the Cancun W.T.O. meeting next month. The worst nightmare for Japanese officials is that Washington and the Europeans might still come to an understanding on how to go about reducing tariffs and subsidies before Cancun, leaving Tokyo totally isolated in its opposition.
Japan owes it to the world's poorest to alter its negotiating stance, but it also owes it to itself. Nobody stands to lose as much as Japan in the event that the developing world leads a global backlash against free trade.

HEADLINE: Paraguay Mennonites Find Success a Mixed Blessing 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: FILADELFIA, Paraguay 

 BODY:
On Avenida Hindenburg, the dusty main street running through this farming town founded over 70 years ago by zealous, hard-toiling German Mennonites, the traffic signs are also signs of the times.
 Where a few years ago "Vorsicht Schuler" would have been enough to warn drivers passing the Benjamin Unruh elementary school to watch out for children, the town needs bilingual signs now. The Spanish "Cruce de Alumnos" has been added. 
 This town 300 miles north of the sleepy capital, Asuncion, is deep in the heart of the sparsely populated Chaco -- Paraguay's vast, inhospitable scrubland, where the thermometer regularly hits 120 degrees. 
But its booming farm economy is attracting economic migrants from across this landlocked South American nation the size of California. That, according to many residents here, means trouble.
On one hand, the Mennonites need the labor to keep their successful farming cooperative growing. On the other, the outsiders inevitably dilute the colonizers' German-language culture and religious traditions that have been unaltered for decades.
The forefathers of Filadelfia's Mennonites fled Russia in two waves. The first went to Canada in the 19th century, when they lost their exemption from military service, and then to Paraguay, while a second wave fled Stalin's collectivization program via Germany and China. The Mennonites now make up less than half the town's population of 8,000.
"We are victims of our own success," said Gundolf Niebuhr, curator of the town's tiny museum, which is filled with Mennonite memorabilia and stuffed wild animals. "The Mennonites' highly successful work ethic and commitment to build a functioning society attracts others and ends up fragmenting our own social structure." 
Mr. Niebuhr speaks German with a faint trace of Plattdeutsch, the guttural dialect that the Mennonites have preserved ever since they were hounded out of the Low Countries in the 16th century for following a radical Anabaptist reformer. He reflected that, given the harsh conditions in the Chaco, it was surprising that the settlers had survived here at all.
When the first 350 German families arrived in 1927, they found a drought-plagued wilderness.
In the first years, the settlers' cotton and peanut crops failed repeatedly. It was only with grit and discipline that homesteads took root.
The settlers came both because of anti-German sentiment in Canada after World War I and because Paraguay wanted to populate the Chaco, fearing the territorial ambitions of neighboring Bolivia. The Paraguayan government passed a law in 1921 giving Mennonites the right to organize their own churches and German-language schools and exempting them from military service.
Bolivia did invade in 1932, but at the end of the war in 1935, Paraguay kept the territory and the Mennonites continued their hardscrabble existence.
In 1937, some colonizers broke off to set up a new colony in a more clement region in east Paraguay. In 1944, two factions -- one pro-Hitler and hopeful of reoccupying their farms in the Soviet Union, one pacifist and anti-Nazi -- clashed violently. The pro-Hitler faction left.
But today the Mennonites' large cooperative farms are successful, providing dairy products consumed across the country. While Paraguayans' income slumped to $950 a year from an average of $1,750 in the decade after the last military ruler, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, went into exile in 1989, Filadelfians' average yearly income is about $10,000.
On a recent visit, Luiz Augusto de Castro Neves, Brazil's ambassador to Paraguay, told the people at the cooperative, "I'm fascinated by what I have seen -- a Paraguay that works!"
The town has spent $300,000 yearly for wages and education and health services for 9,000 Indians settled on 370,000 acres outside town bought by the Mennonites. But many people here consider the indigenous people lazy or drunkards and blame them and other outsiders for rising crime.
The town is also split over whether Mennonites should get involved in politics beyond electing a community leader. Generally, the older generation clings to the centuries-old tradition of steering clear of statecraft.
In general elections in April, however, Orlando Penner, 40, formerly a rally driver and governor of Boqueron, Filadelfia's province, became Paraguay's first Mennonite senator. Elected on the slate of Beloved Homeland, an anticorruption, grass-roots movement that became a political party, Mr. Penner says that Filadelfia's Mennonites should integrate more and that their success could serve as an example to the rest of the country.
"If we want to keep ourselves caged inside orthodoxy, we will be chasing around the world forever looking for new, empty, isolated lands," he said. "I'm sure that if we can't preserve our identity as Mennonites while still opening up to and living alongside others in this country, then it doesn't make any sense to be a Mennonite."

HEADLINE: Princeton Stands In for Beijing: Studies of China Adapt to SARS 

BYLINE:  By KATHERINE ZOEPF

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
By now, Anne Kaenel and her classmates are used to the sidelong looks. Even in a university town where eccentric behavior is broadly tolerated, their ethnically diverse crew, joking and gossiping exclusively in Mandarin Chinese, attracts puzzled stares.
 The self-consciousness fades quickly, Ms. Kaenel said. But there is still some disappointment that they are not in China, where, before SARS, they had planned to spend their summer in the Princeton-in-Beijing Chinese language immersion program. 
 "It's impossible to pretend you are in Beijing," Ms. Kaenel said in Mandarin, through an interpreter. Then, after a furtive look around to make sure no administrators were within earshot, she lapsed briefly into English. "You don't have the daily life exposure to the language, the Chinese soaps, the conversations on the street. We have some really qualified, great teachers here, but it's just not the same." 
As far as the World Health Organization is concerned, the SARS epidemic is safely contained. Yet side effects are still being felt in places like Princeton, Beaufort, N.C., and the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where hundreds of American college students who had planned to attend China-based summer study programs ended up instead.
When the SARS crisis stretched into May, the directors of many of these programs were forced to cancel their plans. But others scrambled to make alternative arrangements on American soil.
That is why, on the Princeton University campus, there are 79 students who have spoken almost nothing but Mandarin Chinese for the last seven weeks. Everything is as it would be in China, at Beijing Normal University: students are asked to sign pledges to speak only in Mandarin to their teachers and to one another. Their days include four hours of grammar and vocabulary drills each morning, two and a half hours of one-on-one Chinese tutorials each afternoon, up to five hours of homework each night, and, occasionally, calligraphy workshops and early-morning tai chi. Students who break the language pledge face expulsion.
The program's co-director, Perry Link, a professor of East Asian studies at Princeton, conceded that adjustments had to be made. "We have had to make a little exception for those times when they absolutely have to order a hamburger from someone who doesn't speak Chinese."
The Duke Study in China Program, which also requires students to speak only Chinese, has made similar adjustments. The eight-week summer language program, normally held at Capital Normal University in northern Beijing, is being held at two of Duke's campuses, in Durham, N.C., and Beaufort, N.C.
Mavis Mayer, the program's coordinator, said more than 60 students had accepted places in the program, but only 22 attended once the SARS crisis forced her to relocate it. 
"A lot of the students just said, 'I'll try again next year,' " Ms. Mayer said. "But for the students that came out this summer, we've done our best to maintain the experience. The staff at the campus in Beaufort is very friendly and chatty, and we had to warn them: 'These students aren't allowed to speak any English to you. It's not that they're being standoffish.' "
For administrators of study-abroad programs, the timing of the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome -- just as the American academic year was winding down -- could not have been worse. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not lift its warnings against nonessential travel to Hong Kong and Beijing until June 25, far too late for the summer programs to go ahead.
The shift to the United States has made everything from dorms to hiring faculty members more costly.
"In Beijing, you can buy the time of Chinese graduate student tutors very cheaply," said Professor Link of Princeton. "We paid them well by Beijing standards, and it was very good for our students to have the one-on-one attention. This summer, we've kept the individual sessions, but we're losing money at the rate of about $1,000 per student."
Relocating the programs has also meant financial hardship for the Chinese partner universities, administrators said.
"I'm sure they've felt the pinch, too," Professor Link said. "Beijing Normal University normally gets about $100,000 per summer from us. They were reluctant to cancel it."
Professor Link said that, through the worst days of the SARS crisis, he had held out hope that the epidemic would abate in time for students to go to China. But Princeton administrators were concerned about the safety of students and potential liability issues.
The 26 students at the Tufts Institute for Leadership and International Perspective were to spend this summer in Hong Kong, interning at businesses and cultural institutions there and, later, traveling in mainland China. Instead, they are in New York City, living at the 92nd Street Y, and working at internships at city businesses and nonprofit groups, not all of them Asia-related. They do, however, get lectures on Asian history and politics and try to cook Asian food in their dorm kitchens. 
Katie Reynolds, a Tufts senior from Paxton, Mass., said she was disappointed to lose her summer abroad, but had tried to make the best of the situation. "In terms of recreating the experience of Hong Kong, I don't think it's the same," she said. "But this is my first time in New York City, too. It's such a special city. Every day, we have the same conversation about whether New York is really an American city.
"We go into Chinatown a lot. We're definitely trying to tune in to the China in New York City," she added.
Administrators at all of the programs said they were doing what they could to give their students an authentically Chinese experience. Students in the Duke program have attended workshops on martial arts and Chinese herbal medicine. Besides visiting New York's Chinatowns, students in the Tufts program have also gone to the Chinese Scholar's Garden on Staten Island. Students in the Princeton program learned about the Chinese operatic tradition from a former member of the Beijing Opera, Yiqi Fan, who is one of their Chinese teachers. 
Since the early 1990's, overseas study specialists say, American students have been flocking to Asia in rising numbers. Recent economic and social reforms have made China an increasingly popular destination.
Le-Ning Liu, the director of Columbia University's summer Chinese language program, said that 20 years ago the few students who enrolled in Chinese classes tended to do so because of a serious academic interest in Chinese culture. "Now China is opening up," Dr. Liu said. "Students realize that Chinese is practical. They're studying Chinese because they want to become businessmen and journalists."
Nancy E. Chapman, the executive director of the Yale-China Association, which runs several work, study, and cultural-exchange programs in China, said that over the last decade she had seen remarkable increases in interest in studying in China. (Yale-China's summer internship program was suspended this year; Columbia's program was moved to its campus.)
"Today's students were small children during the Tiananmen demonstrations," Ms. Chapman said. "College students don't remember what was happening three years ago, so there's no real memory of that time. China is much more accessible now. It's become a safe, viable study-abroad option for a variety of students, where it used to seem very distant and very exotic."
Administrators from all of the summer programs say that, barring a fresh epidemic, they intend to return to China next summer. And most universities have given the green light to fall programs in China.
"If SARS turns out to be a continuing problem, obviously that would have a negative effect," Ms. Chapman said. But she does not believe that most students will be so easily scared away.
Perhaps only Professor Link of Princeton will watch his students return to China with any tinge of regret. He has been banned from China for his criticisms of its government. His work includes translating and publishing "The Tiananmen Papers," classified Chinese government documents related to the suppression of the Tiananmen uprising.
"I'm still on a blacklist," he said. "This is the first time since 1994 that I've been able to be the administrator of the summer program, and to teach Princeton-in-Beijing students."

HEADLINE: SOAPBOX; 
River Views Worth Viewing

BYLINE:  By WARREN P. REISS; Warren P. Reiss is the general counsel for Scenic Hudson Inc.

 BODY:
GREAT strides have been made in recent years in reclaiming Westchester County's Hudson River waterfronts for the use and enjoyment of its residents. A great deal of public and private investment has been made to clean up old industrial sites, build parks and appropriately scaled development projects. Communities that for decades turned their backs to the river have rediscovered its beauty. 
 In view of this river renaissance, people should be aware of a new proposal by a private company, Conjunction, LLC, to construct a 2,000-megawatt transmission line along the railroad right of way on the river's eastern shore. The project is called the Empire Connection and would bring 2000 megawatts of power from upstate, Canada and New England to New York City and the metropolitan region. It would likely displace some power generated at aging plants in New York City and in the Hudson Valley, and, the project sponsor claims, reduce energy costs for consumers. 
 And while this project, if built, may provide some benefits in energy reliability, generation and cost, some concerns about its siting and ultimate design must be addressed before it is allowed to proceed. 
As with many promising ideas, the devil really is in the details. And what is not yet clear is how many of the transmission lines would be underground and how many would be strung along the river on 80-foot-tall poles, hundreds of feet apart. The idea of adding visually intrusive high-voltage power lines along one of the nation's most scenic river corridors has ordinary citizens, environmentalists and historic preservation advocates throughout the valley deeply concerned. 
Indeed, recent conversations between the project proponents and various environmental groups have raised the possibility of routing much of the line along the Thruway, though it would still run along the railroad tracks from the Tappan Zee south to Riverdale. 
 The scenic beauty of the Hudson River Valley has been cherished and fought over for generations. It would be a mistake to allow an otherwise worthy project to diminish those views. We at Scenic Hudson Inc. believe that with some modifications, it will be possible to bury the lines along the entire route, thus bringing needed power to the metropolitan area while preserving our beautiful valley. 
Scenic Hudson and other groups have been meeting with the project sponsors to discuss our concerns and will continue to remain vigilant as more details of the project design emerge. 
The ultimate approval of the design of the project will soon be before the New York State Public Service Commission for its decision. If necessary, we will intervene in those proceedings to safeguard the valley's scenic beauty, a key resource for an environmentally and economically sustainable region.
Scenic Hudson's position is that the entire length of the lines should be underground. It's the only way to go.

Birthday Efficiency

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH DANSON; Elizabeth Danson is a freelance writer who lives in Princeton.

 BODY:
A NEW VARIETY of gift-giving is flourishing in the suburbs of New Jersey. It is a low-profile version of the potlatch, that ostentatious and cyclical exchange of gifts among the Native American family groups of the Northwest that so fascinated anthropologists a century ago.
 Here is how the new version works: 
 Joe has a birthday. He is 12, but this gift exchange has been happening, with growing consistency, since he was about 10. At his party, the pile of gifts takes up very little room on the table. It is packaged in envelopes. As each one is opened, a card appears and is glanced at, mainly to find out who brought it, never mind the jolly rhyme or the primitive pun carefully chosen by the giver's parent at the card shop. Inside the card is a newish $20 bill. In the pile are cards from Jason, one from Josh, and Jon, and James. Joe cleans up. 
Over the course of the year, he will go to the birthday parties of Jon and James and Jason and Josh, in their suburban homes, or in bowling alleys, ice rinks, swimming pools or movie theaters. To each, he will take an envelope containing a card and a $20 bill. Any variation in the size of the haul for the birthday child resides in the parents' tolerance for pre-teen children left in their charge for two hours or more. A dozen guests is not at all uncommon.
Ideally, this could be an entirely closed system, run with complete efficiency and saving many hours of trailing around shopping malls, wondering about the tastes and possessions of semi-strange children.
Here is my concept, which I hereby offer to the over-programmed parents of Joe's friends and anyone who identifies with them:
In each home office stands a row of locked cash boxes, labeled with the names of the children in the family and the designation "birthday money." Joe's box by now has four $20 bills in it, and he is prepared for the birthdays of Josh and James and Jon and Jason. Multiply the numbers according to the social circle involved. As new friends issue invitations, or old ones move away, the number of bills in the box will vary slightly, but more or less insignificantly. Perhaps there will come a time, when Joe and his friends are 15 or so, when one of them will decide to add a $5 bill to the $20, in acknowledgement of inflation or the passage of time.
(You will notice that I choose not to venture into the realm of motivation -- social anxiety, generosity, self-aggrandizement, even anticipatory greed.)
Soon, all the envelopes will contain $25, and each cash box will hold a sizable hoard. In an era of stock market disasters, employment uncertainty and suburban homes crammed beyond their storage capacity with clothing, toys, bicycles and sports equipment, the appeal of holding a stash of cash outside the swirl of earning and spending must be apparent.
I admit to a certain vagueness about the way in which the system will break apart. As the friends go away to college, the round of birthday parties will surely cease. Perhaps the money accumulated by then will pay for the laptop that Joe's college requires him to bring to his dorm, and he can fill any down-time in his first year away from home with e-mail messages to and from Jon and Jason and Josh and James.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OCCUPATION; 
Ex-Official and Tanker Seized

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Officials of the occupying powers in Iraq today announced the apprehension of the former Iraqi minister of interior and a ship accused of smuggling diesel oil out of southern Iraq.
 At the same time, troops coped with crowds angry over shortages of fuel and power in Basra, the southern city that had been one of the more peaceful parts of Iraq. 
 Mahmud Dhiyab al-Ahmad, the former interior minister now in custody, was No. 29 in the occupying powers' list of 55 most-wanted Iraqis. He surrendered on Friday, the United States Central Command said. 
The American military had announced his capture in July, but officials said today that announcement had been wrong.
 Late Friday night, British and American naval forces off the southern coast of Iraq boarded and seized the M/V Navstar I, a tanker carrying more than 1,100 metric tons of diesel oil stolen from Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority said today. 
"The coalition is cracking down on this smuggling, which was encouraged and protected under Saddam Hussein," L. Paul Bremer III, the civilian administrator for the occupying powers, said at a news conference in Baghdad today. 
"The crew will be turned over to the Iraqi police for vigorous prosecution for violating Iraqi law," Mr. Bremer said. "The ship and its contents will be confiscated and become the property of the Iraqi people." 
Because of the high price for diesel oil on the black market, the officials said, quantities of the oil intended for dealers in Iraq were being diverted by smugglers out of the country, either by ship or on an overland route to Kuwait. In recent weeks, the occupying officials announced, 74 trucks carrying stolen fuel were seized and impounded. 
Temperatures reaching 120 degrees and frustrations over shortages of electricity and fuel including gasoline led to "widespread unrest" in Basra today, the occupying officials said, without giving other details. Witnesses in Basra said crowds angry at the shortages had set fire to cars and thrown stones at British soldiers trying to maintain order. 
Near the northern town of Kirkuk on Friday night, two American soldiers were wounded in a rocket-propelled grenade attack, occupation officials said today. They said that four soldiers were also wounded Friday night by an explosion near the PX at their base in Tikrit.

HEADLINE: Partners, Horse and Man, in Prison Pasture 

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE

DATELINE: WALLKILL, N.Y., Aug. 7 

 BODY:
About nine years ago, a chestnut thoroughbred named Creme de la Fete was assigned a new groom, Efrain Silva. He gave the horse antibiotics, scrubbed his mane and forelegs, dewormed him and, in Mr. Silva's estimation, prolonged his life for about three years.
 But when Creme, as he affectionately called the horse, grew old and weak, Mr. Silva was not ready for it. Creme had become his second family, the only living being he had any meaningful relationship with on many afternoons. 
 Told that Creme, a former racehorse, had been euthanized while he was at lunch one afternoon, Mr. Silva wept openly in front of his fellow inmates in the mess hall at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, themedium-security state prison here. 
"I fell in love with that horse," said Mr. Silva, who was sentenced to 15 years to life for shooting a man to death while intoxicated in front of a Bronx liquor store in 1981. "The day I met him, I looked into his eyes. I says: 'I'm going to take care of you, Creme. You watch.' "
Through a partnership with the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, the nation's largest and oldest thoroughbred-rescue operation, the prison has operated a work program for the past 18 years for inmates to care for the former champions, runners-up and perennial losers. Most of them no longer have practical economic value -- other than the $600 a meat buyer might pay -- before they come to a pasture in upstate New York to live out their years. 
Some of the horses had been discarded, left for dead in their stables before being rescued by the foundation and turned over to the program's director, Jim Tremper, and his 18-inmate crew.
"If we didn't get to them, they would be pet food or on someone's plate in Europe," Mr. Tremper said. 
He said he had seen the thoroughbreds change the prisoners' lives as much as they changed the horses'.
"Especially the more violent guys," Mr. Tremper said. "A lot of them have intimidated people with their size in their lives, and they seem to respect the power and strength of the animal. It humbles many of them."
The program is less rehabilitation therapy than hard labor on many afternoons. Still, the inmates who care for the horses need to exhibit good behavior, usually for two years, and have three years or less before their earliest release date to be assigned to the program. Wallkill is their last or next-to-last place of incarceration before parole.
At Wallkill, amid meadows strewn with clover and dandelion and the looming guard tower of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility, an adjacent maximum-security prison, men who had never seen a horse now feed and wash Quick Call, a well-mannered Saratoga favorite who won at least one race two hours north of Wallkill every year from 1987 through 1990. In 86 starts, he won 16 races and earned $807,817.
"Yo, Quick got to be tired of all this fame," said Lorenzo Parker, tugging gently on the stud shank by which the horse is led. "We did Reader's Digest last week." Mr. Parker, who is serving time for an attempted robbery conviction, walked the horse toward a burbling hose on a humid, sticky afternoon, stroking Quick Call's chin. "If you never make a million in life, at least you can stand next to a million," he said.
Promised Road, the first horse rescued by the foundation in 1984, is still at Wallkill -- a gentle, regal bay at 27 years old. 
Klabin's Gold, son of Strike the Gold and Splendid Launch, resides up the hill. Few horses represent the unseemly side of the industry more than he does. Klabin's Gold was found 100 pounds underweight with three fractured legs in December in his stall at Suffolk Downs, a minor track in Boston. His hooves were so long that the horseshoes had imbedded themselves in the bottom of his feet.
"When the farrier came to take the shoes off, he had to gradually work the foot back to a normal shape," said Diana Pikulski, executive director of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation. 
None of the prisoners knew of Klabin's Gold's past, just as the horse has no conception of the inmates' past.
"Neither of them care," Mr. Tremper said. 
Klabin's Gold had won the 1998 Hirsch Jacobs Stakes at Pimlico and ended up with career earnings of $346,179. In 55 starts, he won 11 times, finished second 13 times and finished third 7 times. He last raced in March 2002, finishing last of seven in a $6,250 claimer.
His story is like most of the horses here who stopped winning, placing or showing.
Banker's Jet, who earned close to $1 million, was found standing up to his knees in manure at a riding ranch in upstate New York before he was rescued and found a better life in a pasture of inmates.
Concerns about the fate of retired thoroughbreds grew last month when it was reported that Ferdinand, the 1986 Kentucky Derby and 1987 Breeders' Cup Classic champion, was slaughtered last year in Japan, where his carcass was most likely used for pet food.
Exceller met a similar end. He outran Affirmed and Seattle Slew to win the 1978 Jockey Club Gold Cup, becoming the only horse to defeat two Triple Crown winners. But after a failed breeding career, Exceller was killed in 1997 and sold for horse meat in Sweden.
In 2002, a federal bill that would ban the sale, transportation and slaughter of horses for human consumption was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill has been assigned to an Agriculture Committee subcommittee, where it remains under consideration.
According to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, the number of horses of all breeds slaughtered in the United States has been steadily declining for more than a decade -- from nearly 350,000 in the late 1980's to about 60,000 in 2001, the last year for which figures are available. But the federal government keeps no records of equine abuse.
"Nobody in this business wants to treat their horses badly, but there is an economic low point at these smaller tracks and fairs," Ms. Pikulski said. "In the case of Klabin's Gold, the fact that the guy held on to the horse so that we could take the horse from him is to his credit."
About 30,000 thoroughbreds are born each year, but the racing industry does not keep an accurate count of horses retired. The foundation estimates the number to be 3,000 to 5,000 in any given year. Only the famous are likely to get comfortable retirements.
"John Henry and any horse that made someone $6 million are fine on some farm in Kentucky," Mr. Tremper said. "Do they have a horse that made $140? They're not going to take any old cripples that don't race anymore."
Wallkill's facade looks more like a gothic monastery than a prison. Eleanor Roosevelt, with the help of an architect, designed the prison, which was completed in 1932. Canada geese, fox and pheasant were its most unpredictable animal life until the thoroughbreds arrived in 1984.
The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation was founded by Monique Koehler, who owned an advertising agency in New York before moving it to New Jersey. She persuaded the breeders and owners of Secretariat, Kelso and Forego to contribute to a fund for less-fortunate retired thoroughbreds. Seed money came from a $200,000 fund-raiser at Belmont Park in 1983.
When the foundation began looking to buy land, Ms. Koehler learned that prison systems owned thousands of lush and sometimes unused acres. From there, the marriage of inmates and retired racehorses seemed perfect: rundown souls in need of a second chance.
The foundation also has partnerships with the Blackburn Correctional Facility in Lexington, Ky., and the Marion County Correctional Institution in Lowell, Fla.
The inmates in the program at Wallkill earn 95 cents a day -- or $9.50 every two weeks -- to take care of the thoroughbreds. Inmates working Wallkill's dairy farm, which produces milk for the prison, can make up to $65 every two weeks -- and that rankles those in the horse program.
Four former inmates have gone on to work at racetracks and a few went to private stables, Mr. Tremper said.
Mr. Tremper said he had not had many problems with inmates in the program, although he said two squared off with pitchforks several years ago. Most of the time, he sees connections made that he was not sure were possible in this environment. Most of the inmates who care for the horses are from the inner cities.
Mr. Silva stood in a pasture Wednesday afternoon, massaging iodine shampoo into the infected hoof of Extended Forecast, a horse with one victory in his career. He and other inmates gently bandaged the horse.
Mr. Silva said he used to be a drinker who had no control over his rage. About 6 a.m. one day in 1981, after he had been up all night drinking, Mr. Silva said, he fired at least three shots into an unarmed man waiting for a liquor store to open. Mr. Silva said the man kept fidgeting and reaching into his pocket, and in his drunken state he convinced himself the man had a gun. 
"That was 22 years ago," Mr. Silva said. "I look back, I wish he would've shot me."
Now he is 66. The young man whose life was drowning in alcohol is now an elderly man stroking the underbelly of a horse.
When Creme de le Fete was near the end, with a tumor in his thyroid, Mr. Silva spent more time with the horse. "I used to take him out, bathe him, whatever he needed," Mr. Silva said. "I knew he knew me. I still miss him."

HEADLINE: A Few Rays of Light Pierce New York City's Economic Fog 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
It was sometime this summer, when New York City's budget crisis appeared to have been settled and when the plans for the World Trade Center site redevelopment were falling into place, that Rosemary Scanlon's mood about the city's economy metamorphosed quietly into something resembling hope.
 The unemployment rate, though still high, had inched downward for three months in a row. Jobs were still vanishing, but the rate of loss had slowed. Real estate values remained afloat; there was infrastructure rebuilding downtown; even the hotel market seemed to have turned around somewhat. 
 "So on a muggy, soggy day in August, I'm relatively optimistic," Ms. Scanlon, a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said last week. "I think we're seeing enough to note that we're on the cusp of change. And the change is upward." 
If that sounds like less than an unqualified vote of confidence, it is. But it goes far beyond what many economists and others were saying just six months ago. In recent weeks, there have been what some say are signs that the city's recession may finally be bottoming out.
In addition to the slip in the unemployment rate and the slowing of the job-loss rate, the stock market has taken a turn for the better, securities industry revenues are up, construction is thriving, apartment sales and commercial leasing are on the rise and tourism is doing better than some had expected.
"So there's definitely some signs that we're feeling out a bottom, let's say," said Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the State Department of Labor. "We won't know we hit a bottom until we're looking back at it from several months down the road -- at least."
There are other questions. Is this a turning point, or simply a detour -- a few good months in a 30-month recession that has robbed the city of 242,000 jobs? Is the city's economy on the brink of recovery, or has the topography of New York's distress simply flattened out?
"I have to say, it's a difficult call to make," said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate firm, and the author of a monthly newsletter on the city's economy called The New York Stat. "It really is too ambiguous for me."
Within the securities industry, which lost one of every five jobs between December 2000 and May 2003, employment is finally inching up, said Frank Fernandez, a senior vice president of the Securities Industry Association. Revenues have begun growing, profitability is up over 2002 levels and some forms of compensation have begun to rise.
"If the recovery is under way, and we believe it is, then the future of New York City is starting to brighten," he said. "These things tend to feed on themselves. As optimism starts to pick up, as all types of businesses are starting to see marginal improvements, it's a better climate and consumer spending begins to improve."
But at Chanterelle, a restaurant in TriBeCa, Karen Waltuck, who owns it with her husband, David, was unwilling to credit any economic improvement for a summer that she said has been "fabulously good." Instead, she said, Chanterelle is flourishing because the recession has deprived New Yorkers of the money to travel overseas.
"I think the economy is in absolute disarray," Ms. Waltuck said. "I really, really don't think that things are going to get better for a long time." At best, she said, the recession is hitting bottom. "People are getting used to being miserable. Out of stability comes a certain amount of confidence. But I don't see any growth happening."
There remains plenty to be gloomy about.
Although the city's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped in late spring to 8.1 percent, it is still well above the state rate of 6.1 percent and the national rate of 6.4. While the current city rate is down from a high of 8.8 percent in February, it remains nearly 3 percentage points above where it was in January 2001.
Similarly, while the cascade of job losses has slowed, the city comptroller's office reported in July that after seasonal adjustment the number of public and private jobs had dropped by 9,000 in June. There were job losses in some areas of finance, manufacturing, the information sector and trade, transportation and utilities, among other fields.
City, state and federal employment is falling, said Mr. Brown, of the State Department of Labor. Manufacturing remains weak; the employment services field has flattened but is not growing. The technology industries remain in poor shape. There are continued losses in computer services. And the airline industry, after layoffs this spring, is doing little rehiring, he said.
"However Wall Street's profits turn out this year, no one's saying they're going to rehire the 40,000 to 50,000 people they got rid of any time soon," Mr. Brown said. "These various forecasts have changed a lot in a short period of time. Forecasting Wall Street profits is probably even riskier than forecasting Wall Street."
Late last month, the Federal Reserve Board reported, in a survey of economic conditions it conducts eight times a year, that retail sales improved in the New York region in June and July. In real estate, the market for downtown offices and for Manhattan co-ops and condominiums strengthened. Bankers were reporting more demand for home mortgage loans.
At the same time, the Securities Industry Association reported what it called its first meaningful increase in employment in a year, though the overall level was still below that of July 1994. The report said revenue growth had resumed and broadened. With profits recovering, compensation was rising. Further gains were expected by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which publishes its own monthly report on business conditions in the city, reported that while the local economy was still contracting, the rate had slowed. The report stated that the growth of financial industry profits was lifting spirits in related industries like printing, advertising and commercial real estate.
"The New York City economy may be about to take a turn for the better, especially if the financial markets continue to improve," Marc M. Goloven, a senior regional economist for J. P. Morgan Chase, was quoted as saying in the report. "While the Big Apple is much more than the Dow Jones industrial average, trends in the latter often determine the general health of the former."
Other parts of the region are doing far better than the city.
In the first half of this year, New Jersey began gaining jobs at a rapid rate. It added 39,000 jobs while the country as a whole lost 236,000, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. In the past 30 years, New Jersey's economy has grown by an average of 50,000 jobs a year; at the current rate, the gain for 2003 would be 78,000.
"Graphically, it's almost like jaws opening up, with New Jersey going up and the nation still sinking," Professor Hughes said. "It's entirely possible that New Jersey is leading the nation. Somebody's got to lead it out of the recession. That may well be New Jersey's role this time."
Similarly, when one compares monthly employment figures with monthly figures from the previous year, the Hudson Valley region of New York has had 11 consecutive months of year-over-year job gains, said Sean MacDonald, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor. The year-over-year unemployment rate has been declining for six months.
Ms. MacDonald traced the growth in part to large commercial and residential development in Westchester and Rockland Counties and to home construction in Dutchess and Orange Counties. The activity in the housing market had spawned demand for legal and accounting services, she said. Banks are opening new branches, and mortgage companies are leasing space.
In Manhattan, Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan residential real estate appraisal company, said sales and prices for two-bedroom apartments had increased. The inventory of available co-ops and condominiums declined slightly in April, May and June after rising almost every month for a year and a half.
Cathy Paige, the vice president and general manager for the Northeast region for Manpower Inc., a large temporary-help service, said business in New York had been "perking up a tiny bit." There has been a slight increase in orders for temporary help and in "temp to perm" -- the hiring of temporary workers as permanent employees, often a harbinger of an uptick in permanent hiring.
Ms. Scanlon, now an associate professor of economics at the Real Estate Institute at New York University, said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's willingness to "take such a firm hand on the fiscal situation" would prove important in helping the economy recover. So would the recent progress toward rebuilding the World Trade Center site, she said.
Another economist, Christopher Jones, the director of economic programs for the Regional Plan Association, said: "I would probably put myself in the camp of cautious optimists that the city's economy has at least bottomed out. I am not optimistic that we're about to enter a period of rapid growth."

HEADLINE: Business Spending Helps to Offset Lag in Refinancing 

BYLINE:  By Louis Uchitelle and Jennifer Bayot

 BODY:
 The economic recovery is switching gears. Even as mortgage refinancing fades, curtailing consumption, business spending on the tools of production is picking up, sustaining a tenuous upturn. 
 In Salt Lake City, the England brothers, Dan and Dean, are doing their part. They are purchasing a thousand new cabs for tractor-trailers this year for the family trucking company, C. R. England Inc., although freight traffic has yet to increase.
 Actually, the brothers surprised themselves. They made a last minute decision to spend $90 million to replace 40 percent of their tractors on the normal three-year cycle, rather than drag things out for another year. 
 "The manufacturer, Freightliner, made the purchase irresistible," Dean explained, with a deep discount on the $100,000 tractors and the guarantee of an attractive value on future trade-ins.
 " They were aggressive; they wanted to keep their assembly lines busy," Dean England said. "The deal they offered was too good, and the longer you hold equipment the higher the maintenance costs. We have not seen an upturn in our business, but we wanted to stick to the three-year replacement cycle and we are optimistic about the future."
 It is on such mixed motives and uncertain optimism that the economy is riding. Almost on cue, as if business spending and mortgage refinancing were coordinated, refinancing applications have plunged. They are down nearly 60 percent since May, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported last week. Business spending, in contrast, rose in the second quarter at an annual rate of 6.9 percent, the strongest showing in three years. 
 "This early investment is not for expansion; its for replacement to bring in new technology and lower costs, said Lawrence H. Meyer, an economic consultant and a former Federal Reserve Board governor. 
"It is spending that had been postponed.
 Whatever the reason, business spending is a powerful force. It can lift an economy when companies invest in machinery, computers, software, office buildings, factories, trucks, aircraft and all the other tools used in the production of goods and services or sink an economy when companies cut back. Indeed, a cutback in business spending when the Internet and stock market bubbles burst brought on the recession of 2001 and the prolonged weakness that has existed since then.
 During all those months, consumers kept the economy above water. With interest rates falling and home prices rising, consumers raised huge amounts of spending money through home sales and mortgage refinancing. Now that mechanism is weakening as interest rates rise and homeowners are holding off on refinancing.
 Michael Prescott, an electrician in Redwood City, Calif., is one of them. He refinanced his home 15 months ago, increasing his mortgage but not his monthly payments while pocketing $45,000 in cash. That paid for a Dodge Dakota, new fencing for his home and an upgraded sprinkler system. He had planned to refinance again, expecting to extract $17,000 more from the rising value of his home.
 But with mortgage interest rates rising at 6.34 percent on average, the rate on 30-year mortgages has risen a full percentage point in two months, to its highest level in a year Mr. Prescotts plan is now on hold. Im not going to settle for these rates, he said.
 The question is whether business investment, typified by the England brothers fingers-crossed truck purchases, can grow in a sustained fashion, supplanting consumer spending as the economys main source of growth.
 The beginnings are there. An improvement in the spring and early summer turned a weak economy into a passably growing one.
 But the upturn will not be solid and enduring, economists say, until the England brothers and their counter-parts at thousands of American companies take the next step spending not only to replace aging equipment and improve efficiency but also to expand.
 That is not in the cards yet for the England brothers. Nor is it in the cards for other executives interviewed last week. "Frankly, orders have been soft," Dean England said, "but we are hearing more positive comments from our customers, more talk of the need for us in the future."
 The executives still have a bit of time to muster their confidence enough to increase their spending. The mortgage phenomenon has not played out yet; it is still helping to support the economy. Homeowners, taking advantage of steep increases in home prices, are still pocketing profits by selling their homes, then moving into smaller quarters. A high level of applications for new mortgages reflects this activity. Or homeowners continue to cash out, taking on larger mortgages at interest rates that are still below what they had been paying. 
Edward Christensen, an associate dean at Monmouth University, in West Long Branch, N.J., and his wife, Ruth, have locked in a 30-year mortgage at 6 percent on their Cape Cod-style home. That is not as low as the rate they would have received if they had had the foresight to act sooner but better than the 6.5 percent the Christensens are paying on their current mortgage, which they refinanced in 1998.
 "I figured that even if I couldnt get the lowest rate, I would be better off in the long run," Mr. Christensen said.
 Lower rates mean lower monthly payments for millions of homeowners, and this savings endures.
 "Its like an ongoing annuity," said Richard Berner, chief domestic economist for Morgan Stanley."But to the extent there was a refinancing benefit, it is going away."
 This gradual departure passes the torch to business spending -- to chief
 executives like Alexander Cutler at the Eaton Corporation, which is based in Cleveland. Eaton is a giant manufacturer of truck transmissions, hydraulic equipment, circuit breakers, electrical control panels and the like.
 Eaton's customers are other companies, not consumers. Their purchases often show up in government data as capital spending. "These sales are higher for Eaton," Mr. Cutler says, "but not because of an improving business climate. We are taking customers away from competitors, not benefiting from an expanding market," he said.
 Eaton has stepped up its capital spending, to $110 million in the first half, from $87 million in last years first half. But dont read enthusiasm into that. The $110 million represents a return to Mr. Cutler's norm of devoting 4 to 4.5 percent of Eaton's sales revenue to capital spending, which dipped to 3.2 percent last year.
 Virtually all of the spending, this year and last, went into product development, including machinery to make the new products, so that Eaton could take market share away from competitors. None was for expansion. Mr. Eaton underscores that point.
 Like many manufacturers, Eaton expanded in the 1990's, often to fill orders from companies caught up in the bubble, and Mr. Cutler has been dealing with the aftermath.
 "We closed 30 plants over the last two-and-a-half years and laid off 20 percent of the work force roughly 9,000 employees," Mr. Cutler said. "It was a lot. It was very deep. But we've really finished most of it. We don't think our markets will pick up until the end of next year. But the elements are in place. It is a ponderous recovery."
 Setting off enthusiasm about recovery based capital spending was a Commerce department report that the economy's growth rate had risen in the second quarter to a nearly respectable 2.4 percent annual rate, from a weak 1.4 percent over the previous six months. Consumer spending on vehicles and government spending on the military made handsome contributions. So did mortgage refinancing.
 But these are uncertain stimulants. The potential for a more enduring upturn lies in business spending, and that rose after many months in the doldrums. The increase was large enough to contribute seven-tenths of a percentage point to the economys growth rate; without it, second-quarter growth would have been a meager 1.7 percent.
 Increased oil and gas exploration, in response to the potential for profit from higher energy prices, contributed to the increased business spending, the Commerce Department reported. But mainly the spending was for computers and software, to replace aging equipment.
 "A significant replacement cycle is kicking in," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting and data gathering firm.
 Companies as varied as the Burlington Coat Factory, a retail chain based in Burlington, N.J., and Providence Health Care, which operates clinics and doctors offices in the West from a Seattle headquarters, report increases in capital spending to upgrade aging computer systems.
 Burlington is completing the installation of a point-of-sale network that has put new electronic cash registers in each of its 350 discount clothing stores, and linked them to an inventory database, now updated with each sale.
 "We held on to our technology base so long it was not adequate anymore," Michael Prince, a Burlington spokesman, said, adding: "It looks like things are starting to point up a little, even though retail is still soft over all."
 Providences new computer system also upgrades the old one. The goal is to make billing, payroll, record keeping and inventory management more efficient and less costly. "Industry pressures are causing us to use technology more in our core business," said Michael Spinner, the chief information officer.
 At United Parcel Service, the investment strategy is mostly replacement, but with an element of expansion. Having pulled back spending last year to $1.7 billion, U.P.S. is returning this year to a more normal $2 billion, using the biggest chunk 40 percent of the total to purchase larger aircraft. Boeing MD11 jet freighters, for example, are replacing smaller 727's on international routes.
 "They carry more over a longer route and that makes them more efficient," said Kurt Kuehn, a U.P.S. vice president. While traffic in the United States is basically static, it is rising abroad, and that helps to justify the larger aircraft, Mr. Kuehn said.
 But over the last six months, U.P.S. has also taken delivery of six Airbus 300's, retiring an equal number of Boeing 727s used mainly on domestic routes.
 The reasoning is very much like that of the England brothers. Replacement is primarily to achieve efficiencies from new aircraft.
 "The expansion is overseas," Mr. Kuehn said. "Here in the United States, we have been a little watchful of the economy."

HEADLINE: Dinner With the Sayyids 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
The best thing about being in Baghdad these days is that you just never know who's going to show up for dinner.
 Take last Wednesday night. I was invited to interview a rising progressive Iraqi Shiite cleric, Sayyid Iyad Jamaleddine, at his home on the banks of the Tigris. It was the most exciting conversation I've had on three trips to postwar Iraq. I listened to Mr. Jamaleddine eloquently advocate separation of mosque and state and lay out a broad, liberal agenda for Iraq's majority Shiites. As we sat down for a meal of Iraqi fish and flat bread, he introduced me to a small, black-turbaned cleric who was staying as his houseguest. 
 "Mr. Friedman, this is Sayyid Hussein Khomeini" -- the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Mr. Khomeini told me he had left the Iranian spiritual center of Qum to meet with scholars in the Iraqi Shiite spiritual centers of Karbala and Najaf. He, too, is a progressive, he explained, and he intends to use the freedom that the U.S. invasion has created in Iraq to press for real democratic reform in Iran. Now I understand why his grandfather once threw him in jail for a week. He has Ayatollah Khomeini's fiery eyes and steely determination, but the soul of a Muslim liberal.
The 46-year-old Mr. Khomeini said he's currently advocating a national referendum in Iran to revoke the absolute religious and political powers that have been grabbed by Iran's clergy. But in other interviews here, he was quoted as saying that Iran's hard-line clerical rulers were "the world's worst dictatorship," who have been exploiting his grandfather's name and the name of Islam "to continue their tyrannical rule." He and Mr. Jamaleddine told me their first objective was to open Shiite seminaries and schools in Iraq to teach their ideas to the young generation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have no idea whether these are the only two liberal Shiite clerics in Iraq. People tell me they definitely are not. Either way, their willingness to express their ideas publicly is hugely important. It is, for my money, the most important reason we fought this war: If the West is going to avoid a war of armies with Islam, there has to be a war of ideas within Islam. The progressives have to take on both the religious totalitarians, like Osama bin Laden, and the secular totalitarians who exploit Islam as a cover, like Saddam Hussein. We cannot defeat their extremists, only they can. This war of ideas needs two things: a secure space for people to tell the truth and people with the courage to tell it. That's what these two young clerics represent, at least in potential.
Mr. Jamaleddine, age 42, grew up in Iraq, sought exile in Iran after one of Saddam's anti-Shiite crackdowns, tasted the harshness of the Iranian Islamic revolution firsthand, moved to Dubai, and then returned to Iraq as soon as Saddam fell. Here is a brief sampler of what he has been advocating:
On religion and state: "We want a secular constitution. That is the most important point. If we write a secular constitution and separate religion from state, that would be the end of despotism and it would liberate religion as well as the human being. . . . The Islamic religion has been hijacked for 14 centuries by the hands of the state. The state dominated religion, not the other way around. It used religion for its own ends. Tyrants ruled this nation for 14 centuries and they covered their tyranny with the cloak of religion. . . .When I called for secularism in Nasiriya (in the first postwar gathering of Iraqi leaders), they started saying things against me. But last week I had some calls from Qum, thanking me for presenting this thesis and saying, 'We understand what you are calling for, but we cannot say so publicly.'
"Secularism is not blasphemy. I am a Muslim. I am devoted to my religion. I want to get it back from the state and that is why I want a secular state. . . . When young people come to religion, not because the state orders them to but because they feel it themselves in their hearts, it actually increases religious devotion. . . . The problem of the Middle East cannot be solved unless all the states in the area become secular. . . . I call for opening the door for Ijtihad reinterpretation of the Koran in light of changing circumstances . The Koran is a book to be interpreted by each age. Each epoch should not be tied to interpretations from 1,000 years ago. We should be open to interpretations based on new and changing times."
How will he deal with opposition to such ideas from Iraq's neighbors?
"The neighboring countries are all tyrannical countries and they are wary of a modern, liberal Iraq. . . . That is why they work to foil the U.S. presence. . . . If the U.S. wants to help Iraqis, it must help them the way it helped Germany and Japan, because to help Iraq is really to help 1.3 billion Muslims. Iraq will teach these values to the entire Islamic world. Because Iraq has both Sunnis and Shiites, and it has Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. . . . If it succeeds here it can succeed elsewhere. But to succeed you also need to satisfy people's basic needs: jobs and electricity. If people are hungry, they will be easily recruited by the extremists. If they are well fed and employed, they will be receptive to good ideas. . . . The failure of this experiment in Iraq would mean success for all despots in the Arab and Islamic world. That is why this is a challenge that America must accept and take all the way."
Mr. Jamaleddine, Mr. Khomeini; these are real spiritual leaders here. But if the U.S. does not create a secure environment and stable economy in Iraq, their voices will never get through. If we do, though -- wow. To the rest of the Arab world, I would simply say: Guess who's coming to dinner.

HEADLINE: As Campaign Tightens, Kerry Sharpens Message 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: BARTLETT, N.H., Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts had just finished a walking tour through Littleton, a small town near here in the White Mountains, when he paused to take questions from local reporters outside a candy store. There was one subject this day: Howard Dean.
 Again and again, Mr. Kerry was asked his views of Dr. Dean. Again and again, Mr. Kerry, who had passed a half-dozen Dean placards on his walk, demurred. When a television reporter taunted Mr. Kerry to at least utter Dr. Dean's name, Mr. Kerry, who is rarely at a loss for words, grinned and pinched his mouth shut. 
 This is Mr. Kerry's world these days. Three months after many Democrats and Mr. Kerry himself thought he was rolling to the Democratic presidential nomination, he is frequently stuck in the shadow of an opponent who has moved from small-bore annoyance to potential threat. By all appearances, the changed atmosphere in the early battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire has forced Mr. Kerry to recalibrate his approach to the crowded race for the nomination. 
By his own account, Mr. Kerry's campaign message -- which even some supporters described as toothless and themeless back when the fight seemed simpler -- has become sharper, more focused and more compact. A candidate who has a reputation for circular speaking and windy orations is invoking Teddy Roosevelt and Harry Truman ("I'm going to tell the truth and they'll think it's hell."), and sounding campaign notes from John McCain, Paul Wellstone and, well, Dr. Dean.
Mr. Kerry is denouncing corporate chieftains for "looting America," and proclaiming the economy under President Bush the worst since the Great Depression. He is attacking Mr. Bush's credibility and competence on issues as different as tax cuts and the postwar cleanup in Iraq to large and enthusiastic crowds in New Hampshire and Iowa.
"This is the greatest say-one-thing-do-another administration that I've seen in all the time I've been in public life -- since Richard Nixon was president of the United States," Mr. Kerry said in Minneapolis.
After what many Democrats, including Dr. Dean, described as vacillation on the subject, Mr. Kerry is now standing by his decision to vote for the war in Iraq, arguing, "I didn't take the easy road, but I took the road that I thought was correct." He is seeking to claim the mantle in 2004 for expanded health care coverage, an idea that was pioneered in this campaign by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Dr. Dean.
He is also following Dr. Dean into the campaign computer age. Last week, he began his own campaign Web log, or blog, to provide a digest of his travels, modeled after the blog Dr. Dean has used with great success to rally supporters and contributors.
And more than ever, Mr. Kerry is invoking his stature as a Vietnam veteran as he challenges the stature of his Democratic opponents -- none of whom, he frequently points out, have "worn the uniform of our country" -- to withstand a debate with Mr. Bush on national security. When an Iowan asked if he had thefortitude to endure a nasty campaign, Mr. Kerry responded: "Listen, man, I fought in Vietnam and I know how to do mud. I'm ready for them." 
Mr. Kerry said any changes in his style and campaign -- which he said would become even more vivid as he approaches the official announcement of his candidacy next month -- were not in response to the ascendancy of Dr. Dean. Rather, Mr. Kerry said over the roar of a private jet flying him through the Midwest last week, any such changes were testimony of his evolution as a candidate, the natural rhythms of a campaign, and the increasing vigor he has felt in the months since he had cancer surgery.
"Look, I had a prostate operation in February and I'm feeling energized again," he said. "I'm feeling fully healthy and well and energetic and focused. I think there's a greater intensity. I'm stronger, back in full mettle and ready to go."
Whatever the reason, the change is bracing, and suggests that the fall campaign will be lively, if polls continue to show Mr. Kerry and Dr. Dean battling for support in states like this. Speaking to New Hampshire teachers at a resort here, who were upset with Mr. Kerry's support for the Bush administration's education bill, Mr. Kerry offered an attack on Republican senators for resisting increased education spending that would have seemed incendiary even from the mouth of Dr. Dean.
"You've got 52 troglodytes on the other side," Mr. Kerry said of his Republican colleagues, before abruptly stopping himself. "I take that back -- I'll take that back. You have 50 people who believe something else on the other side of the aisle."
In an interview this week, Mr. Kerry spelled out some of his differences with Dr. Dean that he said would become clear as the campaign progresses, and he emphasized that he would seek to draw those contrasts more systematically in the fall.
"We have some differences in opinion, obviously, and those will become more clear as we go forward," Mr. Kerry said, picking at a grilled chicken salad and kicking off his shoes as his plane banked through the clouds over Iowa. "I'm not for taxing middle-class Americans and reinstating the marriage penalty and taking away the child care credit and raising the tax burden on people we tried to help -- we Democrats. These are people Democrats helped. And I think it would be folly for Democrats to turn around and say, sorry, we didn't mean to help you."
"I think I'm stronger and more capable of protecting the security of our country," Mr. Kerry said. Asked to assess Dr. Dean's position on the war, Mr. Kerry, who has been lambasted by his opponents for appearing to equivocate in his views on Iraq, responded: "I don't know his position. He's all over the place."
For the most part, Mr. Kerry's reception these days has been warm, and he is clearly benefiting from a lowered expectation created by the portrayal of him out of Washington as cool and aloof. As he campaigns, Mr. Kerry is very big on physical contact, throwing his arm over every shoulder he sees, grabbing elbows and hands as he moves in close to ask, "What is your name?" And he has learned the value of telling a joke on himself, which inevitably charms and surprises his audiences.
"He seems to be pretty genuine," Eric Dyer, 21, the president of the Minnesota Student Association at the University of Minnesota said after hearing Mr. Kerry speak in Minneapolis last week. "I was probably going to go for Dean. But I came here and I was impressed."
Mr. Kerry's focus on Dr. Dean reflects the fact that each views the other as his biggest threat in New Hampshire because they live in adjoining states. And if advisers to Mr. Kerry and Dr. Dean agree on anything, it is that they would like to see this sprawling nine-candidate race reduced to a two-way contest.
Which is not to say that Mr. Kerry is ignoring his other opponents. For example, he frequently criticizes those who, like Dr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt, would roll back all of the tax cuts passed under President Bush. Asked if he agreed with the accusation by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut that Dr. Dean was leading the Democrats into the political wilderness, Mr. Kerry responded: "I'm focused on my message, my campaign. If Lieberman wants to lash out on a political basis, that's his judgment."
There are, inevitably, still signs of the preternaturally cautious front-runner in Mr. Kerry. While Dr. Dean announces, "I want our country back," Mr. Kerry is more apt to explain that he is running because "this is a critical historical moment for our country and we deserve strong leadership that moves the country in the right direction."
And while he regularly invokes his foreign policy experience in the Senate as a contrast to his opponents, his 19 years in the Senate seem an almost incidental part of his candidacy, particularly when compared with his four years in the military. If anything, like the other members of Congress in the race -- including Mr. Lieberman and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina -- Mr. Kerry seems to struggle with the challenges of trying to run for the White House from the Senate.
"The Senate presents inherent difficulties," he said. That said, Mr. Kerry rejected the notion that any voter would view him as a Washington insider.
"The question is, are you offering a vision of leadership, and do you stop talking Washingtonese," Mr. Kerry said. "And I ain't talking Washingtonese."
As Mr. Kerry was moving through the White Mountains here today, a reporter asked if he was worried that Dr. Dean had been on the cover of Time and Newsweek magazines -- a platform Mr. Kerry would presumably have liked to have had. 
"Campaigns have cycles," Mr. Kerry responded, "It's early. It's very early."
The senator, who has spent the better part of two years preparing for this, continued: "I haven't even announced yet. We have some time to create some energy here."

HEADLINE: Gephardt Gets Endorsement Of Teamsters For President 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential hopeful Richard A. Gephardt accepted the Teamsters union's formal endorsement today in the union stronghold of Michigan before moving on to rally Teamsters in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 Mr. 
Gephardt, a congressman from Missouri, told several hundred union members holding Gephardt signs and American flags near the Teamsters Joint Council 43 headquarters here that he was the best candidate to bring back jobs lost under President Bush. 
 "The president has made the economy a mess," Mr. Gephardt said. "In 24 months, he's turned everything on its head."
Mr. Gephardt said he had worked in the House with former President Bill Clinton to balance the federal budget and help create 22 million jobs. Now, he said, "America's working families are in trouble."
Mr. Gephardt unofficially won the Teamsters' endorsement on Aug. 1 and used today's rallies in an effort to gain some ground in the nine-way fight for the Democratic nomination for the 2004 presidential election.
The Teamsters' endorsement enables Mr. Gephardt to tap into 1.4 million Teamsters members. With the other unions that have endorsed him, he now has the support of unions with more than 3 million members, a major stride toward the 8.8 million needed for the endorsement of the nation's largest labor confederation, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. probably will hold a special endorsement meeting on Oct. 15.
Although Iowa and New Hampshire lead the 2004 presidential selection process, the Feb. 7 Democratic presidential caucuses in Michigan make it an important target for Mr. Gephardt and the other Democrats in the race. 
None of Michigan's other major unions have issued endorsements.

HEADLINE: Declaring War On Corporate Greed 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As I was reading Bob Herbert's Aug. 7 column, "Despair of the Jobless," I was reminded how far I have fallen from the ranks of the Americans who are getting ahead. 
Three years ago (when Bill Clinton was president) my life was great. I was making $100,000-plus a year in a job with great benefits, and my financial -- and personal -- future looked rosy. 
 Then along came President Bush and his voodoo economics. I was laid off in a companywide cut, and I was unemployed for almost 18 months. I had to sell my condo and use all my savings and 401(k) money just to survive. I am now working in the same type of position making $40,000 a year with no benefits, including no health insurance. Please count me in among the millions of Americans who are living in middle-class poverty and despair -- and I am angry. I am looking forward to Election Day in 2004!

HEADLINE: Fight Club 

BYLINE:  By Matt Bai; Matt Bai is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
"I always say politicians are cowards, and they really are," Stephen Moore told me recently. "We say we're going to run someone against them, and they start wetting their pants."
 Moore, the president of a group of zealous economic conservatives known as the Club for Growth, was talking about Arlen Specter, a giant of the United States Senate and the only Republican moderate in the Senate leadership. Specter is running for a fifth term next year in Pennsylvania, but he now finds himself facing an unexpected, potentially serious primary challenge from the party's right flank. That challenge, from a brash conservative congressman from industrial Allentown named Patrick Toomey, is being engineered by the Club for Growth, whose 10,000 members, most of them gray-suited bankers and businessmen, seem to be on a mission to banish taxes from the earth. Moore has vowed revenge on Republican incumbents who don't worship at his antitax altar -- he calls them "Republicans in Name Only," or "Rinos" -- and unseating Specter, he says, is his top priority. 
 Although Specter is a powerful committee chairman and can count on the strong support of the White House, he is clearly anxious; he is already spending much of his time shaking hands back in Pennsylvania, and he has called some members of the club himself to plead his case. A few months ago, Specter even invited Moore over to his Capitol office for a chat. A masterly politician, Specter gave it all the charm he could muster, graciously showing Moore his trove of family photos before launching into a defense of his voting record, which, he rightly pointed out, is broadly more conservative than Toomey's, according to National Journal's ratings. Specter is, after all, the man who got Clarence Thomas confirmed, and he has long supported the balanced-budget amendment and, for that matter, the flat tax.
To Specter's astonishment, however, Moore, a nerdy 43-year-old economist with an affable, self-mocking laugh, didn't seem to care much about Specter's record. It was simple, Moore said: even though Specter eventually voted for President Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut, Moore could not forgive him for first voting to trim the president's original, bigger tax-cut proposal by $250 billion so that the money could be spent on education. 
For his part, Specter came away from his meeting with Moore feeling somewhat bewildered by what was happening inside his own party. He took note when Moore later told a reporter that he wanted to beat Specter because having "a major scalp on the wall" would make the Club for Growth more intimidating to other Republicans. (Moore said the same thing to me when I interviewed him in his office, motioning to a spot near his desk, as if Specter's scalp might actually hang there someday.) "I have been in public life since I became an assistant D.A. in 1959," Specter told me. "And I've never heard talk like that."
Outside of Washington, only Stephen Moore's relatives have ever heard of him -- and even some of them would probably have to think on it a while. But in this era after campaign-finance reform, as the fund-raising dominance of the two parties diminishes, it's the people you've never heard of who will change the course of politics, and Moore seems bent on taking a hammer to George W. Bush's carefully sculptured majority party. Last spring, Moore attacked two Republican senators who were resisting the latest tax cut: George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe of Maine. He ran ads in each of their states in which he compared them with the French president, Jacques Chirac. That was too much for Karl Rove, the president's political enforcer, who called the ads "stupid" and "counterproductive." 
Moore was unimpressed. "Whether I'm pals with Karl Rove is not really of interest to me, to be honest with you," he told me. 
This kind of open rebellion is unheard of in Bush's Washington, where party loyalty gets confused with moral rectitude, and where Republicans generally speak with a kind of bland, Orwellian unanimity. The criticism is especially surprising since it comes from activists on the party's economic fringe, at what looks for all the world like their moment of triumph, having just won the largest tax break since Reagan. You could understand if religious conservatives were the ones agitating, given their discontent over the recent Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and gay rights. But what could the radical supply-siders possibly have to complain about?
Back in the early 1980's, a group of about 30 wealthy money managers in Manhattan, all of them Reagan-loving, tax-hating conservatives, began holding a monthly political meeting that they fashioned on a venture-capital model. The "investors" would invite a political candidate running for state or national office in to explain why he or she would be a strong fiscal conservative, and if they liked what they heard, they would write checks on the spot. Bravely casting aside the obvious hair-transplant jokes, they called themselves the Political Club for Growth.
As years passed, however, the club's members began to see that candidates would say anything to get a pile of checks, only to ignore their promises to the club once they got elected. The supply-siders needed a new approach.
One of the club's regular attendees was Stephen Moore. He wasn't rich, but as a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute and a former Republican aide on Capitol Hill, he was considered an expert on the federal budget. Moore was intrigued by the success of Emily's List, a pro-choice group that had developed serious clout among Democrats by helping female candidates in primaries, where a relatively small amount of money could have a huge impact. Emily's List amassed power by "bundling" individual donations and passing them on to selected campaigns. In 1998, Moore persuaded his wealthy backers -- they included the philanthropist and financier Richard Gilder and Thomas L. Rhodes, president of The National Review -- to let him remake the Club for Growth in the same mold.
The club's agenda hasn't changed much since those formative days of the Reagan administration. Like all good supply-siders, Moore and his members hold that the best way to stimulate economic expansion is for government to drastically reduce the amount of money it collects from its citizens. This practice, as recent history shows, has a tendency to create budget deficits, but the supply-siders say that's all right, because deficits force government to scale back spending on inefficient programs. 
"Growth is the answer to all our problems," Moore told me over lunch at Morton's, a favorite Republican hangout. "Poverty, income disparity, disease -- all of these things can be alleviated through rapid income growth."
For a guy who talks like a professor, Moore has proved himself to be a talented and ruthless self-promoter, establishing the Club for Growth as an irrepressible presence in Washington. Moore has intervened in open primaries to help elect several current congressmen -- Patrick Toomey among them -- who are now fiercely loyal to his agenda. His close relationship with these congressmen and a handful of senators has, in turn, enhanced his power on the Hill. He's a regular visitor in the office of Tom DeLay, the Republican house majority leader, whose political-action committee has also contributed heavily to the club.
Republicans who disdain the Club for Growth are quick to point out that for all Moore's chesty threats, the club has yet to actually beat an incumbent, and its overall won-lost record is decidedly mixed. "At the end of the day, these guys have more dollars than political sense" is the way Scott Reed, a Republican strategist, put it. 
In politics, however, there are times when the facts aren't as relevant as the perception. The club may not, as yet, have unseated any Republicans, but the looming certainty that it could -- and will go to any length to succeed -- terrifies vulnerable incumbents. A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for moderates in both parties to talk of a $350 billion tax cut at a time of deficit spending as a "compromise," and yet that is precisely what just happened in Washington. Moore's tactics have helped tilt the terms of debate in the Capitol.
During the 2002 campaign cycle, in addition to spending several million dollars on polling and ads, the Club for Growth collected at least $3.2 million in "bundled" checks for its chosen candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. One of the lucky recipients was David Fischer, a Maryland lawyer the club backed in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Congressman Wayne Gilchrest. Fischer described to me how the club sent him about $225,000, roughly three-quarters of the total cash donated to his campaign.
"I felt like one of those congressman back in Abscam, when they used to get those packages of money," Fischer told me. "We were taking in 25 or 30 grand a day."
To be the target of the Club for Growth is a different experience altogether. Just ask Sherwood Boehlert, an 11-term moderate congressman from New York who was singled out by the club last year and barely survived. "What we didn't see coming was the last 10-day onslaught of money, manpower and mailings," Boehlert says. "And those mailings -- if I believed that about a candidate, I wouldn't have voted for me either."
Like some other Republicans at whom the club has taken aim, Boehlert isn't really sure why. He voted for both Bush tax cuts, along with rollbacks of the marriage tax and the estate tax. When I mentioned this to Moore, he was unmoved. "He's been one of the most liberal Republicans in the House," Moore said, adding that conservatives consider Boehlert to be a big spender. 
"We're not only about tax cuts," Moore reminded me, and it's true: the club claims to judge candidates not just by their commitment to tax cuts, but also by their determination to rein in government waste. (The club is "agnostic" on social issues, to such an extent that Moore has banned "the A word" -- abortion -- from its meetings.) 
But for an organization that claims to be so ideologically pure, the club doesn't always apply these principles consistently. As Moore readily admits, spending has multiplied like a virus in Washington under Bush and the Republican Congress, but while the club gleefully goes after Boehlert and other moderates on taxes, it has yet to take aim at a single conservative for going soft on spending. Sometimes, in fact, the club isn't at all concerned with a candidate's fiscal ideology -- like, for instance, when that candidate's name is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Earlier this summer, Moore held an event with the Terminator as he considered entering the California governor's race on the recall ballot. A few weeks later, at a staff meeting, Moore and his deputies discussed the actor's potential candidacy.
"Where is he on policy?" one staff member wanted to know.
"Oh, he's terrible," Moore said. "Horrible. He says he's a fiscal conservative, but. . . . " He trailed off in laughter. If Schwarzenegger would just agree to back a flat-tax proposal and to rule out any new taxes, Moore said, the club would get behind him anyway.
This kind of inconsistency -- "hypocrisy" would be the less charitable word -- has led critics of the club to conclude, not unreasonably, that its talk about cutting taxes and slashing spending obscures a less lofty agenda. Moore wants that scalp on his wall, and the easiest way to get it is to single out moderates like Specter and Boehlert, because moderates are always vulnerable in Republican primaries.
"They go after the low-hanging fruit," says Sarah Chamberlain Resnick, who runs the Republican Main Street Partnership. Resnick's group, a coalition of Republican moderates, is vowing to raise at least $5 million to fight Moore in critical states next year -- which suggests, incredibly, that a president poised for coronation could instead find his party drawn into civil unrest.
The Bush White House has created such an aura of discipline that Republicans in Washington often behave as if their offices are bugged, faithfully mouthing the message of the day. And so the most intriguing question about the Club for Growth, one that divides Republicans in Washington, is whether Moore is the pest that the administration just can't seem to exterminate, or actually a secret ally of the White House. Put another way, if Karl Rove is really so angry at Moore's antics, why does the club still exist?
For much of the first two years of the administration, Moore was part of the right-wing cabal that administration officials would consult on a regular basis. But Moore proved himself disloyal by publicly criticizing Bush and opposing some of his appointments. "I don't really like the Bush people very much," Moore says. "I was never part of a fraternity or anything like that, and the Bush White House is like a club." 
Rove has good reason to wish the Club for Growth would go away. It will be hard to achieve his goal of expanding the G.O.P.'s margin in the House and Senate if Republicans face divisive primary fights in critical swing states. It's not surprising, then, that Rove and his deputies have called some of Moore's backers to complain about the club's tactics. And Rove has made it clear that the White House intends to provide Specter with the muscle he needs to fend off Toomey's challenge.
At the same time, however, the club serves a useful purpose for the Bush administration by driving vulnerable moderates into the warm embrace of the White House. This makes it much easier for the administration to make deals on the Hill. Think about it: if you're a moderate congressman, you might be inclined to vote against the latest Bush tax cut. But then here's Steve Moore, announcing that he won't rest until you're retired and teaching civics at a community college. You have a choice: you can either vote against the tax cut and take on a club-backed opponent all by yourself, or you can cut a deal with Rove, who will send in the president to campaign for you, as long as you give him your vote on the tax cut. In this Machiavellian way, the club is the perfect foil for the White House, creating leverage where it might otherwise not exist.
The one thing Rove won't tolerate, apparently, is Moore's taking credit for the president's legislative victories. I sent Rove an e-mail message with several questions regarding the Club for Growth. He ignored every question except one -- when I asked if the Club for Growth had, in fact, helped secure Senator Voinovich's vote on the tax cut with its vicious ad campaign, as Moore said it did. "The ads were completely ineffective," Rove wrote back, "and what won Voinovich's support was the constant lobbying and cajoling of his Senate colleagues, his Ohio constituents and the president of the United States."
On any given day in the Club for Growth's K Street office, another smartly dressed, little-known Republican congressional candidate may come traipsing through to beseech Moore for his support. These meetings often have the feel of job interviews, with the eager candidate sunk into a beaten office chair while Moore, seated at his paper-strewn desk, flips lazily through the applicant's resume.
The first time I visited the offices of the Club for Growth, in June, Moore was just wrapping up a conversation with Virginia Foxx, a matronly state senator from North Carolina who is now running for a seat in Congress.
"Is it Foxx with two x's?" Moore asked absently. The candidate nodded and pointed to her two earrings -- an x in each ear. 
"Now, someone called me this past week and said all this stuff about you voting for all these tax increases," Moore said.
"No, no," Foxx replied quickly, shaking her head. "It was just that one I told you about already. The occupancy tax."
"You sure?"
"Yes, yes," Foxx assured him. She left with a check for $1,000 but no guarantee of support. 
That candidates are willing to endure Moore's obvious contempt for them -- "Aren't politicians loathsome?" he asked me once with a pained expression, as if we were discussing head lice -- indicates that Moore is becoming something of a kingmaker inside the party. And this, ultimately, is what the Club for Growth is after: to be the interest group that controls Republican politics.
"The only group that has been jealous of us -- I don't know if 'jealous' is the right word, or maybe 'resentful' -- is the party itself," Moore said. "They think we're replacing the party, and that is our goal. We want to take over the party's fund-raising. We want it to be, in 10 years, that no one can win a Senate or a House seat without the support of the Club for Growth."
It may sound Napoleonic, this business about taking over the nation's dominant party, but it might not be as delusional as it sounds. Moore understands, shrewdly, that the old order of political power is fast eroding. Party loyalty has been declining for years, and voter turnout remains strikingly low, meaning that elections increasingly revolve around the kind of single-issue voters that give interest groups their power. And under the new McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, the two parties can no longer spend unlimited amounts of soft money, which takes away their chief fund-raising advantage over outside groups like Moore's.
While it's pretty unlikely that the Club for Growth will be running Republican politics anytime soon, it's not a stretch to suggest that in 10 years it will be one of several groups, each with its own extreme agenda, that will dominate the business of campaigns. 
To that end, Moore keeps looking for the one big score. On the day he met with Foxx, Moore giddily waved a rubber-banded stack of envelopes at me. It was the week's accumulation of checks for Toomey, soon to be sent over to his campaign in a Federal Express envelope. "This will shatter all our records," Moore said. It's a long way to next year's election, and despite the club's best efforts, most political experts think Arlen Specter will emerge with his Senate seat. Sooner or later, though, Moore will most likely have somebody's scalp hanging on that wall. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 24, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 10 about the Club for Growth, a conservative political organization, referred erroneously to a comparison between the voting records of Senator Arlen Specter, who has courted the group's support, and Representative Patrick Toomey, who is challenging him in Pennsylvania's Republican primary for the Senate. According to ratings in National Journal, Specter's record is less conservative than Toomey's.

HEADLINE: Ratings Hurt South Korean Leader Before Talks 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
President Roh Moo Hyun's approval rating is plummeting, his private secretary has resigned because of a bar hostess scandal, and prosecutors are questioning the president of his party about bribery allegations. But Mr. Roh says he has identified the real problem: the press.
 "What does it mean, 'engaging reporters?' " Mr. Roh shouted when a press aide suggested recently that he reach out to the nation's newspapers and broadcasters. 
 "Where do you do that?" he asked. "Wouldn't it be at bars? You buy them drinks and meals? What do you get for being friendly with them, for sharing a bottle of rice wine? A story the next morning that is pitch-black."
To get around what he calls South Korea's "tyrannical media," Mr. Roh has vowed to set up his own Internet newspaper.
The collisions between Mr. Roh, a liberal, and the nation's three largest newspapers, all conservative, could be written off as colorful bumps along the road of South Korea's evolving democracy. But Mr. Roh's troubles come at a delicate time.
Within one month, the United States is to sit down with South Korea, Russia, China and Japan in an effort to talk North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons program.
But South Korea, an American ally long seen by the Bush administration as wishy-washy on North Korea, may be even more of a weak link now. When Mr. Roh was inaugurated in February, he floated on an outsider's aura that kept his approval rating in the 75 percent range. Six months later, the latest poll figures place his approval rating at 23.4 percent.
"If you want a negotiated solution, a weak South Korean government is probably not in your interest," said Marcus Noland, a Korea expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
With Mr. Roh's government hoping to win control of the National Assembly from conservatives in parliamentary elections next April, it is trying to please everyone, but pleasing no one, many experts say.
"He is tanking because he has no direction," said Victor D. Cha, a Georgetown University expert on Korea who is visiting here. Referring to the presidential offices, he added: "At the Blue House, everybody's focus right now is on the National Assembly elections. If they lose, he'll be a lame duck for the rest of term. But he will have three years left."
While Americans worry about North Korea, South Koreans tell pollsters they worry about the economy.
Mr. Roh inherited an economy that stumbled in the first half of this year, contracting slightly in South Korea's first recession in five years.
A series of strikes this summer have unnerved many South Koreans who believe that Mr. Roh, a former labor mediator, gave a green light for strikes by bowing to labor demands in a bank privatization. 
South Korea's labor relations are "unstable," according to two-thirds of 1,000 respondents to a poll released by the Korea Labor Institute, a government entity.
Editorial pages inveighed against the recent settlement of a 47-day strike at Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest automaker. The workweek is to be shortened by eight hours, workers are to earn 8.6 percent more, and layoffs are only to be allowed with union consent. The wage increase will bring Hyundai wages to $21.05 an hour, 82 percent of the American union average.
Employers and many workers fear that such settlements will scare away foreign investment and will speed a shift of South Korean investment into neighboring China.
"By all accounts, Hyundai's management made one of its worst deals ever with the union and set a deplorable precedent, for which the nation and the automaker will pay the price," the JoongAng Ilbo, one of the big three conservative newspapers, said in an editorial. In retort, Hyundai said it had to settle because the strike had cost the company $1.1 billion.
The Chosun Ilbo, another conservative newspaper, wrote skeptically in an editorial of Mr. Roh's new goal of attracting enough investment to double national incomes in five years. "It's hard to imagine President Roh leading the way to an era where we've got a per capita gross national income of $20,000, when his approval numbers are sunk in the 20's," the editorial said.
Kim Hye Na, a 23-year-old university student who voted for Mr. Roh, said wistfully this week: "Truckers, the bank workers, the teacher's union, they all benefited from Roh's earlier unsettlement. I really wish he could settle down as soon as possible before the country gets plunged into more confusion."

HEADLINE: Glen to Glen, No Smoking At the Pub 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
At The Duke pub, just off busy Grafton Street in the heart of this jovial city, smoke shimmies through the air as customers indulge in a cherished but seemingly doomed ritual: a sip from a pint, a drag on a cigarette, a sip, a drag.
 On Jan. 1, Ireland is expected to become the first European country to ban smoking in pubs. The move is so bold and contentious in a country so devoted to pub culture that few in Europe, and even fewer in Ireland, believe it will succeed. Customers will be asked to step outside to light up; pub owners, most of whom oppose the ban, will risk prosecution if they fail to comply. 
 "It's a bad idea," said David Turner, the bartender at The Duke. "Cigarettes and alcohol are synonymous, at least in Irish culture." 
It is a radical assault on smoking, especially for a European nation, but Ireland is not the only place it is happening. In a sign that the antitobacco movement is gaining ground in Western Europe, where smoking is as much a statement as a personal habit, a number of countries are passing strict laws to battle it.
"There is momentum on this issue," said Tom Power, the chief executive officer of the Office of Tobacco Control in Ireland, an independent government agency.
Although Europe still lags far behind the United States in persuading smokers to give up the habit or to bypass it altogether, governments are beginning to address the hazards and costs of smoking more aggressively than ever.
Two other countries -- Norway and the Netherlands -- have approved prohibitions on smoking in bars and restaurants. Norway's will take effect in the spring; the Netherlands, which is in a furor over the law, will put its ban in place in 2005.
Some countries, including nicotine-loving France, have increased taxes on tobacco in the past year, a move that hurts tobacco sales and fattens treasuries at the same time.
France is also close to approving a law that would stiffen penalties on selling cigarettes to minors by year's end. It has even started a lawsuit against tobacco companies. A local state-run insurance fund in St. Nazaire, in western France, is now in court after filing a lawsuit against four tobacco companies, the first action of its kind by a public authority in France. The fund is seeking to recoup the $37.8 million it has spent to treat smoking-related illnesses.
Even Greece, with one of the highest smoking rates in Europe, is expected to extend restrictions on smoking next year, lest athletes at the Summer Olympics be forced to wade past noxious clouds.
In some respects, Europe is already tougher on tobacco than the United States.
All over Western Europe, black-and-white warnings -- required by a European Union law -- have cropped up this year on cigarette packs. The blunt messages, which cover 30 to 40 percent of the package, read, "Smoking Kills" or "Smoking May Cause a Slow and Painful Death."
The European Union, led by David Byrne, its health commissioner, passed a law in December banning tobacco advertising from radio, television and print by July 2005, something that several European countries have already done. Britain carried out its ban earlier this year. The law also outlaws tobacco sponsorship of sporting events, like Formula One racing, beginning in 2005.
"Nonsmokers are becoming more aware of their rights," said Dr. Fenton Howell, the spokesman for Action on Smoking and Health in Ireland. "They are articulating that much more and we are seeing changes."
Tobacco companies are tracking many of the initiatives in Western Europe, and in some cases taking governments to court. But they do not seem worried about European sales. British American Tobacco, the world's second-largest tobacco company, recently announced it was buying Ente Tabacchi Italiani, Italy's state-owned tobacco company, for an estimated high bid of $2.6 billion.
"I think some fundamentals don't change," said Dr. Chris Proctor, director of science and regulation for British American Tobacco. "And those are that there are a lot of people who like cigarettes. Some governments are starting to forget that."
Writing a law is one thing; enforcing it is something else entirely, Mr. Proctor said. Many European countries have antismoking laws that are widely ignored. France and Greece are supposed to provide no-smoking areas in restaurants, for example, but they almost never do.
Mr. Proctor also noted that most Europeans object to anything smacking of what they consider American extremism. New York City's recent ban on smoking in bars and restaurants has prompted widespread ridicule in parts of Europe, especially Germany, a country with a complicated history of smoking laws. Hitler was virulently antismoking and banned public smoking.
Antitobacco forces acknowledge an uphill battle in Europe, particularly in Central Europe, where old habits die hard, and in Southern Europe, where a rebellious seize-the-day attitude is more the norm. Smoking in front of "No Smoking" signs there is especially tantalizing.
About one-third of European adults smoke. In some places, like Sweden and Britain, the percentage is lower. In others, like Greece, Hungary and Spain, it is higher. About a quarter of adult Americans were regular smokers in 2001.
But antismoking groups said the fact remains that most Europeans do not smoke and that most dislike drinking, eating and working in smoky surroundings.
"There has been a shift in public opinion," said Trudy Prins, executive director of Stivoro, a Dutch antitobacco group. "Politicians are never the trend setters."
Politicians may be reacting to constituents, but they are also responding to the high cost of smoking-related illnesses, which is why ministers of health and ministers of finance often work hand-in-hand to raise taxes on cigarettes.
It is in Ireland, though, that smoking faces its most immediate threat.
Despite the outcry from pub owners, which make up a politically powerful group, the health minister, Micheal Martin, reiterated this month that he would not back down. Mr. Martin has the power to extend the smoking ban under a 2002 law, and he has made the issue a linchpin in his career. All that is needed is Parliament's approval, which looks all but certain.
Unions representing pub employees have pushed for the ban, arguing that bartenders are hurt by second-hand smoke. Pub owners, though, are lobbying vigorously against the measure, saying it would be financially and culturally disastrous and that they would prefer to install ventilation systems.
"This is one of the more horrible things exported from the United States," said Tadg O'Sullivan, chief executive of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, which represents 6,000 pubs outside of Dublin. "The economic impact is simply incalculable. And there is a huge social impact. There are some places where the only social outlet is a pub."
Mr. Power, of the Office of Tobacco Control, said surveys indicated that most people in Ireland supported a smoking ban in pubs and restaurants, perhaps because only 20 percent of the population consider themselves hard-core smokers.
Smokers vow to stay home and drink, though they admit that they cannot stay home forever. "People will get bored of drinking at home," said David Sexton, 31, a car dealer and a smoker. "Everything revolves around the pub here."

HEADLINE: AN UPDATE; 
Selective Public School Helps a Family Stay Put

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
On an August day so muggy it seemed to have dawned in the exhaust vent of a 24-hour Laundromat, Sal Infante unloaded boxes of napkins and San Pellegrino water from the back of a beat-up van double-parked on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. It was hot and heavy work, and he was tired, but he did not complain. He had gotten only a few hours of sleep that morning, after he and eight friends -- most of them customers of his business, Caffe 2000 -- had taken a limousine to Giants Stadium to watch a match between two Italian soccer teams. 
 For Mr. Infante, 54, running Caffe 2000 is more than a business; it is a way of life, and one he is reluctant to give up. But that is what he said he was forced to consider earlier this year after the property taxes doubled on his two small buildings on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park, in Queens. 
 In an earlier article in this series, which is tracing the effects of New York City's economic troubles on a single block, Mr. Infante had all but decided to head for the suburbs. He had even made a house-hunting trip to Long Island. Although he is a successful entrepreneur who came from Italy 27 years ago, the money squeeze was getting to him, especially with his daughter, Roseanne, ready to start high school in September.
Mr. Infante and his wife, Phyllis, said they were unwilling to send Roseanne to any of the crowded and chaotic local public high schools, and they were afraid the $7,000 to $8,000 annual tuition for a parochial school -- roughly the property tax bill on each of his buildings -- would drain them. And in two years their son, Anthony, will also start high school. 
They looked at suburban houses costing about a half-million dollars, with big yards and good schools. Mr. Infante dreaded the idea of being so far from his businesses and the old neighborhood. But what could he do?
Then he caught a lucky break. Roseanne was accepted into the special high school she most wanted to attend: Leon Goldstein High School for the Sciences, a well-regarded public school in Brooklyn with selective enrollment. 
"It's like we won the lottery," Mrs. Infante said. 
Then, in June, Mr. Infante sold the Fursi Ravioli and Catering Company, next door to Caffe 2000. 
He bought the deli two years earlier, when its owner suddenly decided to close it. Mr. Infante had never run a deli; he just wanted to preserve the old neighborhood. He enjoyed running the deli, but when he found a Brooklyn businessman who seemed quite likely to run it better, Mr. Infante did not hesitate to sell. 
Mrs. Infante, who used to live on Long Island, said she was a little disappointed that they would not be moving there, but she said her daughter would be thrilled to attend Leon Goldstein, and her husband would be quite happy to remain where he knows nearly everyone. 
Mr. Infante said he was a little relieved. But he said he did not believe Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's assurance that the rise in property taxes that caused him such distress would probably be temporary, a statement the mayor's aides tried later to qualify.
"In my memory," Mr. Infante said, "whenever anything went up, it never went down again."

HEADLINE: What the U.S. Owes Liberia 

BYLINE:  By Ellen Johnson Sirleaf; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, an economist and former finance minister of Liberia, was the runner-up in the presidential election of 1997.

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana 

 BODY:
When Liberians got their first chance to vote in multiparty elections, old women walked from their villages in the scorching heat to stand in long lines at the polling places. My party's symbol at the time was the rooster, and I remember the crowds lining the road to cluck and flap their elbows as a sign of support. Anyone who saw their enthusiasm, like me, could have no doubt that Liberians yearn for democracy.
 That was 1985. Sadly, the military stuffed ballot boxes and burned ballots, and Samuel Doe, a sergeant who had seized power in a 1980 coup, declared himself the winner. Liberians' hopes were dashed by American recognition of the results. It is hard to imagine that Chester Crocker, the Reagan administration's assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was not being deeply ironic when he praised Doe at the time for claiming only 51 percent of the vote. It was, he said, "unheard of in the rest of Africa, where incumbent rulers normally claim victories of 95 to 100 percent." 
 I have been pondering that betrayal recently as I attend peace talks for my troubled country here in Accra. Founded by emancipated American slaves in 1847 as a beacon of democracy for Africa, Liberia has degenerated into a violent free-for-all. As the battle rages for our capital, Monrovia, politics has been reduced to an extended street fight among gun-toting boys. Had the United States respected the will of Liberia's voters in 1985, we would not be in the desperate straits we are today. The failure to challenge Doe's electoral fraud discredited the democratic process and paved the way for an increasingly brutal competition for power.
But we can still dare to hope. President Charles Taylor, who displays an almost psychopathic will to power and has been indicted by a United Nations-backed tribunal for war crimes in Sierra Leone, says he will step down from office today. West African states have sent peacekeepers and the United States is considering a military role. The peace talks include not just the government and the two rebel factions, but also 18 political parties and five civil society organizations.
After six frustrating weeks in Accra, I can say that the peace talks are flawed and unstructured. The process is under the direction of a mediation team from the Economic Community of West African States, and meetings take place haphazardly in ad hoc groups, with only the occasional plenary. Yet I remain optimistic that an agreement will emerge on a future transitional government. I have to, because the talks are our only way out.
Unfortunately, the UnitedStates has steadily downgraded its diplomatic presence at the Accra discussions and is now represented by a relatively junior official. This is a mistake. As the Bush administration should already have learned in Iraq, military intervention is often the easy part. The political process that follows -- call it "nation building" if you will -- can be much tougher.
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, recently appointed Jacques Klein as his special representative for Liberia. Because he is a former United States Foreign Service officer and a retired major general in the United States Air Force, he is seen among the Liberian parties as a virtual American envoy. Senior State Department officials are also paying increasingly frequent visits. But that is not good enough. The Bush administration should immediately dispatch a full-scale mediation team to Accra to see the process through.
If the administration does not get the politics right, any military intervention will be doomed to failure. Up to now, Washington's policy has been largely reactive. Liberia has fundamental problems to tackle if it is ever to live up to its founders' dreams of freedom and political participation. First, we need to restore hope and confidence to people subjected to despair, particularly to the thousands of young boys and girls who have been press-ganged into combat. Then we need to rebuild our institutions to ensure accountability and transparency; restructure the economic system so that it is no longer dominated by a small elite; conduct a national dialogue; and then hold elections that bring to an end our tragic tradition of rule by strongmen.
We need Washington's help to construct a credible transitional government that is interested in more than its own greed. After the betrayal of 1985, the United States owes us that much.

HEADLINE: LAWYERS PRESSED TO GIVE UP GROUND ON CLIENT SECRETS 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Impelled by a wave of corporate scandals, tax evasion and concerns over terrorism, government regulators and prosecutors have taken a variety of steps that seek to limit what some lawyers say is a core principle of their profession: the ability to protect their clients' confidences.
 Many lawyers have reacted to the new restrictions by arguing that the lawyer-client privilege is not only a traditional tool in their arsenal but a critical one in the proper functioning of the legal system. 
 But even the American Bar Association seems prepared to cede some ground on the issue. The association, which began its annual meeting late last week in San Francisco, will consider changes to its model code of conduct, which state judiciaries draw on in defining lawyers' responsibilities. The changes would recommend permitting lawyers greater discretion to disclose client confidences, although lawyers would not be required to do so, as the regulators are insisting. 
Still, many lawyers said they could not remember such a broad encroachment by the federal government on how they practice. 
"In my experience, since the early 60's, there's been nothing like this," said Stefan F. Tucker, a tax lawyer in the Washington office of Venable, who said that he was worried about the impact of new rules from both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. "You can do something that is perfectly kosher, it's perfectly above board, and someone can come in after the fact and say it wasn't proper."
Earlier this year, the S.E.C. adopted a rule requiring lawyers to report potential fraud to corporate boards and this fall it may well propose additional rules; the Federal Trade Commission has filed suit to force law firms to comply with a 1999 law on disclosing privacy policies to clients; the Internal Revenue Service is trying to make law firms disclose which clients bought questionable tax shelters; and the Justice Department, which has already said that conversations between lawyers and terrorism suspects are subject to eavesdropping, is also pressing corporate defendants harder to waive their confidentiality privilege in order to avoid prosecution.
The government agencies do not appear to be working in concert and very different kinds of clients are affected by each new policy. Each agency is reacting to a different crisis but the overall result is worrying to many lawyers and law professors. 
"The tradition has always been that lawyers were the protectors and were most concerned with a client's rights, trying to achieve for them through the legal system the best results they could," said Timothy Terrell, a law professor at Emory University. "The twist is, lawyers also have duties."
Just how worried lawyers are became apparent to Dana Welch, a lawyer in the San Francisco office of Ropes & Gray, when she led a presentation in June on the S.E.C. rules on reporting potential fraud. "All the tables were filled," Ms. Welch recalled, adding that the visibly tense attendees peppered her with questions. "People were very concerned about the rules and the effect on their life."
Supporters of some of the new government rules argue that lawyers should not stand idly by when a client does something wrong. And, while some lawyers are trying to turn the debate into one about client confidences, they say the real issue is less about the administration of justice and more about lawyers' desire to avoid regulation.
"Prestige, autonomy and money -- all these are at stake," said David Wilkins, a law professor at Harvard. Lawyers traditionally have not been heavily regulated, Mr. Wilkins said, and they are reluctant to see that situation change, "especially in a way that could drive clients away." 
Two years ago, the bar association rejected changes to its model code of conduct to permit lawyers more latitude in disclosing client confidences to prevent fraud. But the association seems to be more open to the idea now that the government may impose more stringent responsibilities on the profession. 
Alfred P. Carlton Jr., president of the bar association, also pointed to the influence of recent financial scandals and the terrorism battle.
"We are facing the gravest threat to our internal security in over 60 years, and we are facing the greatest crisis of confidence in our capital markets in over 70 years," said Mr. Carlton, who supports the proposed changes in the code of conduct. "The confluence of those events is what is causing all this. It is a new day."
If the changes are approved, the code would permit, but not compel, a lawyer to disclose client confidences to prevent or to mitigate "injury to the financial interests or property of another," when the lawyer's services were used to further a client's crime. In 2001, the delegates approved a narrower change, permitting a lawyer to breach client confidentiality "to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm," but even that change was controversial. 
In late July, the chief justices of all 50 states adopted a resolution in favor of the current proposal, putting pressure on the bar association. Ronald M. George, chief justice of the California Supreme Court, said the changes were necessary at least to make clear to lawyers that they would not be disciplined for disclosing client confidences to prevent fraud. But adopting the change might serve another purpose. "To the extent the legal profession polices itself, it makes itself less susceptible to outside regulation," he acknowledged.
Several government agencies have recently demonstrated their willingness to take a tougher stance by pursuing law firms directly. The I.R.S. is weighing a lawsuit against Jenkens & Gilchrist, a law firm based in Dallas that has refused to give up the names of clients who invested in questionable tax shelters; Jenkens & Gilchrist has said it will fight the I.R.S. in court, if necessary.
The F.T.C. is battling the American and the New York State Bar Associations in federal court over whether law firms are subject to a 1999 law requiring financial institutions to send privacy notices to clients. Lawyers argue that they are subject to state codes of conduct that, they say, are more stringent than those in the legislation.
The S.E.C. has gone further, adopting rules that took effect last week requiring lawyers to report "up the ladder" to top executives or the board of a public company that is a client if they find "evidence of a material violation" of securities laws. Several New York lawyers said that big firms were sending out memos to partners and associates, advising them of what their new responsibilities were -- even though no one, lawyers say, is sure precisely what might be evidence of a material fraud, let alone what kind of response by a client told of such evidence would be appropriate.
The S.E.C. will probably consider whether to require lawyers or their clients to report to the agency as well, said Harvey J. Goldschmid, one of the commissioners. "We expect to revisit that sometime in the fall," Mr. Goldschmid said.
The focus on lawyers is appropriate, he added, because "lawyers are critical gatekeepers, and asking them to bear certain burdens to protect shareholders and investors, and separate themselves from loyalty to managers in appropriate circumstances, just makes sense."
Some lawyers say they will fight further reporting requirements that the S.E.C. is considering, which they say would lead clients to withhold information from outside legal advisers. Mr. Carlton, the bar association president, said his group stood "united in our opposition" to such possible S.E.C. rules.
"The client wants assurance that what he or she discusses with an attorney, something that's happened, that the attorney will not make a judgment that can be made public," said David Bernstein, a corporate lawyer in the New York office of Clifford Chance. More clients might ask their lawyers to sign confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bernstein said -- something he regarded as unnecessary in the past.
The confidentiality privilege belongs to a client, Mr. Bernstein said, and only the client can waive it. Besides, it is rarely a black and white question whether a client's plan is illegal, and it is not the lawyer's job to make that determination, he said.
The Justice Department has taken two steps that affect very different kinds of clients when they talk to their lawyers. The department announced shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that its agents might eavesdrop on conversations between lawyers and terrorism suspects "for the purpose of deterring future attacks."
The department also has increased the pressure on corporations to effectively waive the privilege by sharing information on potential fraud with the government, lawyers say. That means the lawyer has to decide very quickly to fight or to cooperate, even before a full investigation of potential fraud may be completed, said Michael J. Shepard, a lawyer at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco. 
The decision whether to cooperate with regulators has already made conversations with clients that much more stressful, Mr. Shepard said. "The stakes are much higher, because there are a bunch of people running around with their knives out, looking to cut off the heads of corporations and their executives." 
If lawyers are duty-bound to report to the government when their clients have or will commit some kind of crime, Mr. Terrell, the Emory professor, said, lawyers will have to tell clients not to share confidences with them -- in effect, to lie -- a perverse result of efforts to improve the justice system, he said. "The lawyer will have to say, 'I cannot hear you say, "I did this crime" -- that's something I can never know.' "
Some lawyers say the bar association's proposed changes would only catch up its model code, which serves as a template for states' regulation of lawyers, to what exists in the vast majority of states. While some states prohibit disclosure of client confidences except to prevent crimes that would cause death or serious bodily injury, codes of professional conduct in 42 states already permit disclosure in cases of economic crime or fraud, legal scholars say.
"All of these issues, when they arise, they try to turn into, 'This is snitching on clients and it will fundamentally affect the lawyer-client relationship,' " said Roger C. Cramton, a law professor at Cornell University who supports the proposed changes to the model. "They will never affect an honest client who is going to an honest lawyer."
Besides, Mr. Cramton said, lawyers who have been defrauded by clients have the right to disclose client confidences to defend themselves, and it is not clear why others victimized by fraud should not have access to the same information. "They don't really think much of the sanctity of the relationship if it's a self-defense situation," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about new restrictions on lawyers' ability to protect the confidences of clients referred incorrectly to a dispute involving the Federal Trade Commission. The American Bar Association and the New York State Bar Association have sued the commission, challenging whether a 1999 law on disclosing privacy policies to clients applied to lawyers. The commission did not file suit to force law firms to comply.

HEADLINE: Napoleon's Bittersweet Legacy 

 BODY:
Hubert Duez, a successful French farmer, has the English Navy to thank for his good fortune. In response to an English blockade two centuries ago, Napoleon pushed French farmers to replace imported cane sugar with beet sugar. And to this day, a passion for this homegrown, temperate root crop remains a cornerstone of the European Union's protectionist agricultural policy, much to the detriment of farmers in the developing world.
 Mr. Duez, who farms in the Picardy region near the Belgian border, acknowledges that the arrangement today is hard to justify on economic grounds. "It is more a political choice for Europe," he said in a recent interview on his tidy farm, a patchwork of ruffled green (those would be Napoleon's beets) and gold, punctuated every so often by islands of poplars. 
 In a fully liberalized global marketplace, Mr. Duez knows that Europe would produce no sugar whatsoever. It would be far cheaper to import the sweetener from tropical climates that Europeans once colonized precisely because they were rich in things like sugar cane. Poor countries where sugar is one of the few crops capable of bringing in money on the international market would be deliriously happy if that occurred. But in a perverse reversal of traditional trade patterns, Europe ranks among the world's leading sugar exporters. To protect its sugar growers, the European Union mandates that farmers like Mr. Duez get paid 50 euros per ton of harvested sugar beets, or five times the world market price, up to an allotted quota. Mr. Duez runs a well-diversified farm, but the 1,600 tons of sugar beets he sells every year at an inflated price is by far his most profitable crop.
The European Union's extravagant contortions to remain in the sugar business may be the hardest of all its farm policies to defend, much like the United States' irrational protection of its cotton growers. (An official at the French Agriculture Ministry, the most zealous champion of the protectionist status quo within Europe, candidly referred to sugar as "Europe's cotton" when discussing farm policy.) Yet so powerful is the sugar lobby in Brussels -- representing not just farmers, but also monopolistic processing companies -- that the crop was excluded from the European Union's recent modest reform of its $50-billion-a-year common agricultural policy. 
European trade and agriculture officials are sensitive to powerful criticism by the likes of Oxfam and the World Bank, on behalf of farmers in the developing world. They are quick to note that in an effort to even things out, the E.U. does import some cane sugar at its own inflated internal price from developing nations. That is a bit disingenuous. Not all poor countries get this special access and those that do are subject to strict quotas.
Meanwhile, European farmers, eager to profit from the inflated price, produce far more sugar than European consumers can use. The rest is dumped on the international market, depressing commodity prices for farmers elsewhere. (The United States, which has its own politically connected sugar producers, is Europe's co-conspirator in this indefensible system.) 
Mr. Duez's good fortune, in other words, comes at the expense of farmers in countries like Mozambique, Brazil and Guatemala, who are being denied their chance to reap the benefits of globalization. Europeans' sympathy for the travails of farmers in poor countries creates a kind of split political personality when coupled with the desire to see their historic -- and picturesque -- rural communities stay just the way they are now. Mr. Duez himself has traveled to Burkina Faso to teach farmers in that poor West African nation how to build wells. But he believes that Europe needs to protect its agriculture from unfettered free trade. In his view, a prevalent one in France, agricultural trade should be managed between regional blocs, with an eye toward promoting self-reliance .
This view is at odds with free-trade orthodoxy, not to mention proven development strategies in which countries benefit when they focus on what they do best. It also creates an impossible situation for countries that have little to sell but farm products, and a desperate need to keep rural residents from migrating en masse to the cities.
Fixing, or at least mitigating, the worst effects of rich nations' farm subsidies is supposed to be the central effort of the ongoing "development round" of World Trade Organization talks. In advance of next month's critical W.T.O. gathering in Cancun, European and Japanese resistance to an aggressive easing of agricultural protectionism is threatening to derail this effort. (Although Congress might ultimately have something to say on the matter, right now American negotiators are pushing for serious subsidy reductions that would prove painful to American farmers.)
Europeans should not allow their farm lobbies to hijack the union's policymaking and obstruct a new trade deal that could bring hope to poor countries living in despair and strengthen the credibility of a global trading system that has helped Europe prosper. Lifting farm subsidies will surely be a gradual process, but Europe must start reining them in and stop dumping its surplus harvests below cost on world markets. Kicking the sugar habit, Napoleon's bequest, would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: On Knife Edge, Liberia Awaits Taylor's Move 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
"Gateway to Liberia's Economy," reads the billboard at the entrance to the Free Port of Monrovia.
 Inside, rebel soldiers emptied office furniture from one of the last full shipping containers this weekend, stopping only to bark at journalists who stumbled upon their enterprise. Empty cartons of high-protein biscuits, French-made evaporated milk and mounds of cornmeal littered the grounds in front of the hollowed-out World Food Program warehouses. A body bobbed in the water. 
 This wrecked port, a strategic prize of unsurpassed value to the rebels who hold it now, could either be Liberia's gateway to fresh bloodshed or its portal to peace after 14 years of on-and-off civil war. 
The test will come Monday, when President Charles G. Taylor has promised to step down, and his actions could be the turning point in determining whether Liberians will eat or go hungry, whether they will get a fresh start or continue to dodge stray bullets.
In an internationally televised farewell address this evening, Mr. Taylor called the rebels a "surrogate force" of the United States and blamed the Americans for his ouster. "This is an American war against the republic," he said. "They can call off their dogs now."
"I can say I am being forced into exile by the world superpower," he said. "I challenge George Bush: With due respect, Mr. President, please, you are man of God, do something for our people."
The American Embassy in Monrovia had no comment on the speech tonight.
The rebel group controlling the port, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, enjoys the blessings of neighboring Guinea, which receives military aid from the United States.
The port is the pot of gold that has given the advantage to a ragged band of rebels who wear basketball jerseys and women's wigs and describe their sole objective as the ouster of Mr. Taylor.
For more than three weeks, the rebels have held onto the port, doling out cheap rice and free gas to the people on their side of the divided capital. Meanwhile, they are squeezing the life out of the side controlled by Mr. Taylor, who has also been sapped by an arms embargo and cornered by diplomatic pressure from Africans and Western countries alike. On his side of Monrovia, ordinary men and women are lucky to find a cup of cornmeal for their one daily meal.
The president's own radio station, KISS-FM, had to hunt for fuel this afternoon to turn on its generators and broadcast his final speech. 
Cornered by this fierce, well-armed insurgency, Mr. Taylor, a warlord for seven years and president for six, has promised to give up his office. He has been offered asylum in Nigeria.
But as Liberians peer over this historic precipice, they face an abyss of unanswered questions: how soon Mr. Taylor will leave Liberia, as his rebel enemies demand; and whether the rebels will cede control of the port, as American diplomats urge. There is the matter of whether the military standoff will erupt in yet more fighting, or whether the West African peacekeepers now here can prevent that.
Then there is the question of whether the White House, which has made Mr. Taylor's departure a precondition for any direct American engagement in bringing peace to the country, will do much more in this nation that is a peculiar American creation. It was founded by Americans in the anxious pre-Emancipation days of the 19th century, and it became black Africa's first independent republic in 1847. Three American warships are offshore with a total of 2,300 marines on board, but only seven of them have been sent on shore to help. 
"We are all looking to Monday with great expectations that we'll see a breakthrough," said Stanley Bedell, a resident on the rebel-held side of town. "We are more optimistic than pessimistic."
Liberians could hardly endure more pessimism. Monrovia's beaches have become burial grounds; people are foraging for snails to curb hunger; men and women are dying of gangrene and malaria; and mothers are watching their girls being raped. Dignity is the rarest commodity, rarer even than phones, electricity and running water. It is impossible to measure misery here: Liberia does not register on the United Nations Human Development Index, as if it had fallen off the map.
There are no ideological differences fueling the destruction. There is simply a contest for power between armed factions that connect to government and rebel factions in neighboring countries. The governments of Guinea and Ivory Coast are believed to be linked to the two Liberian rebel factions, and rebels in Guinea and Ivory Coast are believed to have had links to Mr. Taylor.
For more than a decade, with a trove of natural resources to fight over, this unending cycle of revenge has spread conflict across West Africa. The International Crisis Group, a research and advocacy organization, has singled out Liberia as the "eye of the regional storm."
Mr. Taylor, 55, has played the starring role during 14 years of civil war, and is scorned at home and abroad.
Blamed for fomenting civil war next door in diamond-rich Sierra Leone, Mr. Taylor is under United Nations Security Council sanctions that bar him from selling diamonds, buying weapons or traveling outside his country.
He has been implicated in the spread of weapons and soldiers into conflicts in neighboring Guinea and Ivory Coast. He is widely blamed for fleecing the country of its natural resources, principally timber and diamonds, for his own enrichment.
In June, an indictment unsealed by a war crimes tribunal supported by the United Nations charged him with crimes against humanity over his alleged role in the war in Sierra Leone. Mr. Taylor has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and his lawyers have filed a counter-claim in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In his speech tonight, he called the charges against him part of "a grand scheme of propaganda." 
The presidents of Ghana, South Africa and Mozambique, which now chairs the African Union, are expected to attend the transfer of power ceremony on Monday. Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has decided not to come but will send an envoy.
Mr. Taylor's resignation alone would not necessarily open a new chapter in the history of this nation of three million people. 
"It's still very fragile," said Dominique Liengme, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross, as she brought medicines to a makeshift hospital on the rebel side on Saturday afternoon. "Everything is conditional on his departure."
The test of peace comes after that, Ms. Liengme pointed out: Will peacekeepers be allowed to secure the port and open a safe corridor to the other side? Will a cease-fire hold? Will aid agencies be able to work?
Naturally, rebel leaders were happy to receive the medicines for themselves, but would not allow aid agencies to divert food and fuel to the other side. They said they were reluctant to let West African peacekeepers open a safe corridor into the city center for fear of infiltration by Mr. Taylor's forces. They also oppose his chosen successor, Vice President Moses Blah, describing him as too close an ally of their enemy.
"I'm afraid if Taylor doesn't leave on Monday, on Tuesday morning, expect an attack," said Andrew Tulay, a nurse at a makeshift hospital inside a brewery on the rebel-held side of the city. 
While he spoke, two men, one of them a soldier who had been tortured by his commanders, were dying of gangrene today, lying inside the brewery union office that is now the hospital's intensive care unit. The hospital had no means to amputate their infected limbs. Mr. Tulay expected them both to die in the first few days of a post-Taylor Liberia. 
Rebel leaders demand that Mr. Taylor resign and leave the country before they give up the port and allow free movement across three strategic bridges that divide the city. 
Mr. Taylor's aides lambasted the rebels tonight for holding the rest of the city hostage by keeping control of the port. "That's a typical human rights abuse," Defense Minister Daniel Chea said. 
"Sounds like a crime against humanity to me," quipped Mr. Taylor's minister of state, Samuel Jackson. 
Today in this partitioned capital, the tableau of terror continued on both sides. 
Armed boys, some barely into puberty, were still breaking into homes and shops and emptying them of anything of value, from tins of powdered milk to cellphones to brand-new Opels, still in the showrooms.
For the rebels, the port and the wholesale district have proven to be particularly profitable. One businessman with goods at the port said he had spent $20,000 on protection money, though that had not kept his goods from trickling out of the warehouse.
Civilians recalled witnessing one rebel soldier busily writing invoices for the looted goods that he was selling out of a wholesale shop. Those civilians said they were too afraid to identify themselves. 
On Saturday afternoon, rebel leaders escorted the American Embassy defense attache, Col. Sue Ann Sandusky, and members of the West African peacekeeping force on a guided tour of the Free Port of Monrovia. They strolled past the six emptied World Food Program warehouses and the hundreds of pried-open containers.
The rebel troops who were pulling the office furniture out of a container earlier in the day had cleared out by the time the visitors arrived. Groups of boy rebels hovered around the grown soldiers. One of the boys grinned at Colonel Sandusky and stretched out his right hand. The colonel pointed to the gleaming blade in his left. 
"Put your knife back," she told the boy, several times before he understood and obeyed. "There you go," she said. "You see how easy that was?" The boy grinned and slinked away.

PERSON: Saxon Riley 

HEADLINE: Saxon Riley, 64, Lloyd's Leader In Post-Sept. 11 Insurance Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Saxon Riley, who led Lloyd's of London through a sweeping reorganization and helped it survive heavy losses in the World Trade Center attack in 2001, died on July 25. He was 64.
 Mr. Riley, who was known as Sax, collapsed on a golf course southwest of London where he was playing as a member of the Lloyd's team in an annual tournament, Lloyd's executives said. 
 After more than a decade of financial turbulence, corporate and individual investors in Lloyd's approved a plan last September that had been championed by Mr. Riley, the chairman. The plan provided tighter management controls, shifted the organization to annual accounting from a system that stretched over three years and further limited the diminishing role of individual investors.
Mr. Riley announced the proposed changes, which he said were needed to make Lloyd's more competitive, four months after the attack on the trade center. Lloyd's lost $8 billion, the largest single share of the $40 billion loss suffered by the insurance industry from that day.
Even though Lloyd's said that two-thirds of the losses would be reimbursed by other insurance companies -- known as reinsurers -- corporate insurance customers, regulators, analysts and rating agencies questioned whether Lloyd's could survive. Lloyd's, a grouping of dozens of syndicates or individual companies that has always been willing to insure anything for the right price -- Betty Grable's legs, North Sea oil rigs and space ships -- was on the brink of collapse in the late 1980's and early 1990's and, after a brief recovery, had been losing money since 1997.
Mr. Riley made repeated assurances that Lloyd's would pay its share. Beyond the magnitude of the losses, Lloyd's was also threatened by a regulatory requirement that it keep in trust in New York an amount of money equal to its expected claims without regard to anticipated reimbursements from reinsurers.
After the attack, Lloyd's did not have the money suddenly needed to pay into the trust fund. The problem, Mr. Riley said, was short-term cash flow. He persuaded the regulators to extend the deadline for coming up with the money.
Had there been a showdown, forcing Lloyd's out of business, its World Trade Center claims might never have been paid. Moreover, the failure of Lloyd's would have sharply reduced the availability of insurance, and prices, which skyrocketed after the attack, would have gone even higher, experts said. This spring, partly because of the higher prices and strong demand for coverage, Lloyd's reported its first profit in six years, $1.34 billion for 2002, up from a loss of $4.5 billion the previous year.
Before Mr. Riley became chairman in early 2001, Lloyd's had been run by string of executives from London's establishment, often graduates of elite preparatory schools and Oxford and Cambridge. Mr. Riley, tall, heavy-set and blunt-spoken, left the American equivalent of public school at the age of 16 and began working at an insurance agency in Manchester, near West Didsbury, in the north of England, where he was born on Feb. 11, 1939.
He worked his way up as a broker. In 1992, he became chief executive of the Sedgwick Group, England's biggest brokerage house. Six years later, he engineered its sale to Marsh & McLennan Companies of New York.
Mr. Riley had just retired from the board of Marsh & McLennan in 2000 when Lloyd's asked him to become chairman. He had done business at Lloyd's as a broker for years and was serving part time as one of two deputy chairmen of Lloyd's governing council. He reluctantly agreed to serve for a year. He extended that until late last year. From the outset, recalled Michael E. Deeny, the chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Names, a group of individual investors, Mr. Riley "said he didn't want the job; he said he was planning to take things easier."
Mr. Riley is survived by his wife, Wendy Staines, according to The Daily Telegraph in London. In 1965, he married Janice Green, who died in 1996, the newspaper said. Mr. Riley is also survived by two sons, Matthew and Adam, and a daughter, Victoria, Lloyd's said.

To the Editor:
 "Surge in Rates May Hurt Pillar of the Economy" (front page, Aug. 5) describes the financial sector's failing confidence in federal economic policies as set by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. 
Paul Krugman, in his Aug. 5 column, "Everything Is Political," presents evidence of White House interference in the Treasury and reminds us how President Bush has set the federal economic policies himself, leaving Mr. Greenspan to make weak and unconvincing justifications. 
 Taken together, the two articles suggest that Mr. Bush has caused an erosion of confidence in the Federal Reserve that is now further destabilizing a weak economy.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
FastCompany's New Life in the Slow Lane

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Fast Company, a magazine that advocated a business revolution, was first published more than eight years ago on the verge of one. That revolution, fomented by digital technologies and soaring stock prices, came and went. But Fast Company remains, although in a much less exuberant and lucrative state.
 The task of making Fast Company relevant to slower times belongs to John A. Byrne, a writer for BusinessWeek for 18 years and the author or co-author of eight books on business, leadership and management, including the autobiography of Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric. 
 The lessons of those books, particularly Mr. Welch's, would have come in handy a couple of years ago at Fast Company. One of Mr. Welch's maxims suggests, "Change before you have to." But Fast Company is clearly an enterprise that is staring down its own obsolescence. Since being bought in 2000 for an astounding $360 million by Gruner & Jahr USA, the American publishing division owned by Bertelsmann, Fast Company has swerved into the ditch. 
The number of advertising pages it carried last year were a little more than a third of the 2000 total. Newsstand sales -- a good indicator of salience in the marketplace of ideas -- are half of what they were in 2000. The jargon that drove the magazine -- "the brand of you" and "social capitalist" -- seems as quaint and beside the point as the Pets.com sock puppet. 
Meeting with his staff last week in the Midtown Manhattan offices where Fast Company moved recently from Boston, Mr. Byrne betrays no panic as he methodically plans the October issue. The staff of 60, down from a high of 85 who once mixed Fast Company's brand of Kool-Aid, is hard at work making sure they write about a future that includes their magazine.
There will be a package on ideas -- everything from the choreographer Twyla Tharp on creativity to Tom Peters on leadership -- an approach that is very new economy and old Fast Company. Competing for pride of place on the cover is an article rigorously examining the performance of five chief executives, which reflects old economy concerns and Fast Company's new pragmatism. 
Before a concept is chosen for the cover, there is consumer testing, something that never happened during the boom. But the time when Fast Company, founded in 1995 by Alan M. Webber and William C. Taylor, both former editors of The Harvard Business Review, simply dished up the gospel to a waiting cult of hungry readers is gone.
"There was a lot of cheerleading that went on at this magazine, but it was hardly alone in that -- it was endemic to the times," Mr. Byrne said. "My role is to reinvent the magazine for a different time. The mission and the vision are the same, but the execution has to be remarkably different."
Since arriving in April, Mr. Byrne has moved to remake Fast Company. Instead of a kind of business service magazine that hyperventilated new approaches to business -- sometimes innovative and sometimes kooky, like the article "How Is Your Company Like a Giant Hairball?" -- he is creating a magazine that shows rather than tells, using narratives about existing companies with built-in lessons for making a go of it in conflicted times. 
"Fast Company is a magazine of ideas to help people work smarter and lead better," he said. The front of the magazine has been redesigned with an emphasis on clear-headed articles that reflect current business realities. "We want to do this in a way that is more irreverent and fun, more edgy than Forbes, Fortune or BusinessWeek are," he said.
The August issue of Fast Company is a sobering look at the current age. In one article, Hewlett-Packard is shown duking it out with I.B.M. and E.D.S. for a contract to service the informational needs of Procter & Gamble. Another offers an update on the women who blew the whistles at Enron. And a third profiles two executives who glued their companies back together after they were obliterated in the Sept. 11 attacks.
It is not sexy, it is not fun, and it is not fast. But at a time when Fortune magazine, Time Inc.'s once red-hot business publication, keynotes its feature about the "25 Most Powerful People in Business" by showing, once again, Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates on its cover, it is clear that Fast Company is not the only business magazine casting about for the next new thing.
There was a time when the business magazine field was so profitable that any publishing company without one seemed lost. When Daniel B. Brewster Jr., chief executive of Gruner & Jahr USA, bought Fast Company from Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News and U.S. News & World Report, he was ridiculed for paying so much for a magazine that many saw as a hothouse flower of the new economy. But he insisted at the time that the company's need to grow and diversify made for a great fit, and that the price was more than fair.
Now, expectations are smaller. Fast Company made $20 million in the year before it was sold, and Gruner & Jahr expected to raise profits to $40 million. Instead, the magazine lost $5 million in 2001, according to two publishing executives who saw its finances. After substantial cost reductions, they said, the magazine makes a small profit. Gruner & Jahr executives insist the magazine has made money every year they have owned it.
Although Fast Company was never a pure Internet magazine -- like The Industry Standard or Red Herring, which are no longer publishing -- there was no publication more irrationally exuberant. Written less out of hubris than fervor, the magazine's founders advocated a culture of business in which corporations were the instruments of individuals and not the other way around. (The founders left the magazine after Mr. Byrne was hired.)
Conceived on a set of principles -- "work is personal" and "computing is social" -- the magazine's leaders were fond of saying that Fast Company was more movement than magazine. The execution certainly bore that out: At the height of its influence, the magazine seemed to be full of beautifully rendered Power Point presentations, type-intensive tutorials that were designed to foster a bloodless coup d'etat of the status quo. Articles like "Project You" and the "Brand of You" suggested that the most important product anyone could work on was themselves.
During the late 1990's, Fast Company's brawny, ad-filled issues -- "The Big Issue," published in October 1999, weighed in at 424 pages -- did not so much break the rules as set out to make a whole new list of them. That included creating a business magazine that would attract many women as readers. The December-January 1998 issue, which touted a "Free Agent Nation," announced the formation of an active group of readers who met in cities around the country called the Company of Friends.
Unabashedly cultish, the Company of Friends at one time had 40,000 members in 120 cities. The Fast Company ethic -- a sort of Ayn Rand meets Tony Robbins celebration and promotion of individualistic capitalism -- was meant to be shared. But after the dot-com frenzy broke, people were less interested in re-engineering their jobs and more interested in making sure they had one.
"They were around when everything was opening up and booming," said Carla Stroud, an administrator for training anddevelopment at the Seattle office of the law firm Perkins Coie who served as the coordinator of the Seattle Company of Friends. She no longer attends meetings -- "Most of the people there seemed to be networking or looking for jobs" -- and stopped subscribing to the magazine more than a year ago.
"They were writing the same stories over and over," she said. "I wanted to read stories about where the new economy meets the old economy and they were just not able to maintain my interest. They had trouble changing, which made me think that they weren't reading their own magazine."
The Company of Friends has now shrunk to a total of 8,000 hardy souls.
"They rode a wave, but then the waters changed quite a bit," said Charlie Rutman, president of Carat North America, a media buying firm. "That is not to say it is a bad magazine; they just have a tougher go of it now."
Others in advertising say there is still a place for a business magazine that disregards conventions.
"I think the biggest problem with Fast Company is that there was this misimpression that it was a dot-com magazine," said Mike McHale, group media director of Optimedia. "I always thought of it as a new-age business book that put kind of a hippie spin on doing business -- a kinder, gentler approach for people who are interested in having balance in their lives. I think there is still relevance in that."
Although much of the competition for a nontraditional business audience has gone away, Time Inc.'s Business 2.0, a magazine formed out of the ashes of the unfortunately named eCompany Now and an earlier incarnation of Business 2.0, is in the midst of similar re-engineering. But Business 2.0's principal weakness, a lack of a clear identity, could paradoxically become a strength now that the challenge is one of redefinition. Josh Quittner, editor of Business 2.0, has started putting a cover flap on the magazine so he can promote more articles, some of them offering classic dot-com optimism -- "From the Perfect Storm to the Perfect Boom?" -- or a much more practical look at how to benefit from the return of mergers.
Walking a similar line between old and new is Mr. Byrne's mission as well. If he feels the pressure, Mr. Byrne is not one to show it.
"There is nothing but upside here," he said. "If we get the magazine right, and I think we will, we will have taken a magazine that lost its way and turned it into something that writes about failure and success in a way that makes people want to read a business magazine again."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Even with profitability required, technology companies are testing waters of initial offerings.

BYLINE:  By Laurie J. Flynn 

 BODY:
THE market for initial offerings of technology stocks shows signs of finally starting to stir. But the companies going public may now need to show a profit, something that few worried about in the late 1990's.
 During the boom, a good idea was enough to bank on. Investors oday are looking for a financial track record. That may explain why only 19 companies have gone public in the United States so far this year, which is shaping up as having the fewest initial offerings since the 1970's. 
 Notably, four of those have been classified as technology companies, and all four had reported at least one quarter's profit before going public.
IPayment Inc., which helps companies process credit-card payments on the Internet, sold five million shares to raise $80 million in May. 
The stock issue was the first new technology offering since March 4, ending the longest hiatus in initial offerings of technology shares since 1975 -- a bear-market year in which there were only five new offerings.
The most recent technology offering was last month, from Netgear Inc., a maker of networking technology for homes and small businesses, whose stock issue raised $98 million. 
The company, which had originally planned to go public in 2000, turned profitable last year and has been in the black for six consecutive quarters.
In the new environment, "it's a battle-scarred investor looking at exactly what the company does," said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, a research Web site. "They want to know: Is the company making money? Yes or no."
With profitability now nearly a prerequisite for a public offering, it is no wonder that the rollout pace is slow. More than halfway through the year, the number of stock offerings was less than a fifth of last year's final total, and it was but a fraction of the 869 stock offerings in 1996, the biggest year ever for new issues.
Richard Peterson, chief market strategist at Thomson Financial, which tracks initial offerings, predicts that the pace of new filings will accelerate between now and the end of the year, but that the year will still close with fewer offerings than in any year since the 1970's.
And yet, among technology stocks there is actually a pickup from last year. No one is now expecting a big wave of technology stock offerings, but it is significant that for the first time in several years a technology company with a respectable balance sheet can get investors' attention at all.
"We are not embarking on a new dawn," Mr. Menlow said. "Those companies are just the best deals we've seen in a long time."
According to Thomson Financial, first-day gains in share prices for public offerings so far in the third quarter have averaged 26 percent. All but one of the 19 companies that have gone public so far in 2003 are still trading above their opening day prices.
In another contrast to the bubble days, of the companies that went public in the first half of this year, only three were financed with venture capital, according to the National Venture Capital Association. And only one of the three, iPayment, was a technology concern.
"Usually, 60 percent of venture capital investment goes to technology companies," said John Taylor, director of the National Venture Capital Association in Arlington, Va. "But those companies are trying to sell products to people who just aren't buying, so they can't build a track record. For a lot of these companies, the stopwatch has even started yet."
That may be about to change, if only modestly. Richard Kramlich, a general partner of New Enterprise Associates, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm, said he detected a renewed interest in technology offerings, adding that several of the nine companies in his firm's pipeline were technology concerns. 
"I think there's a need for some quality issues, as long as they're fairly priced and have supporting economics," he said.
All four of the new technology stocks have had respectable showings. IPayment's shares are up 55 percent since the company went public on May 12 at $16 a share. And shares of Netgear, which opened on July 31 at $14, are up about 25 percent. The stock of IPass Inc., a maker of Wi-Fi technology, which went public on July 24 at $14, is up about 33 percent. And shares of InterVideo Inc., a producer of DVD software, which began trading on July 17 at $14, are up about 37 percent.
Those valuations, of course, are nothing like the heights reached in the late 90's, when new stocks routinely doubled and sometimes tripled on their first day of trading and often stayed at those levels or rose further.
One Internet company, RedEnvelope Inc., an online retailer of luxury gifts, has announced plans to sell 2.2 million shares to the public in the hopes of raising about $35 million sometime in the autumn.
But, RedEnvelope is not yet profitable. The company had a net loss of $7.7 million on revenue of $70 million for its fiscal year that ended in March. 
That was narrower than a net loss of $14.1 million on revenue of $55.8 million in the year-earlier fiscal period. And, as the company's losses are shrinking, its customer base is growing -- to 1.3 million currently, from 448,000 customers in 2001.
Executives of RedEnvelope declined to comment, citing a quiet period mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Peterson, at Thomson Financial, cautions that the opportunities for new technology offerings will remain sparse until information technology spending picks up. And even once corporations start buying equipment again, it will still be several quarters before that translates into profits for technology companies.
"Any bounce back may seem great," he said, "but there's less there than meets the eye."

HEADLINE: The Art of The False Impression 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Al Gore slipped into Manhattan last week and gave a rousing speech downtown before a very young audience at New York University. He got some coverage, but Mr. Gore has never been mistaken for an entertainer. In the superamplified media din created by the likes of Arnold and Kobe and Ben and Jen, it's very difficult for the former vice president, a certified square, to break into the national conversation.
 That says a lot about us and the direction we're headed in as a nation. You can agree with Mr. Gore's politics or not, but some of the points he's raising, especially with regard to President Bush's credibility on such crucial issues as war and terror and the troubled economy, deserve much closer attention. 
 "Millions of Americans now share a feeling that something pretty basic has gone wrong in our country, and that some important American values are being placed at risk," said Mr. Gore.
Keeping his language polite, the former vice president asserted that the Bush administration had allowed "false impressions" to somehow make their way into the public's mind. Enormous numbers ofAmericans thus came to believe that Saddam Hussein was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks and was actively supporting Al Qaeda; that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction were an imminent threat, and Iraq was on the verge of building nuclear weapons; that U.S. troops would be welcomed with open arms, and there was little danger of continued casualties in a prolonged guerrilla war.
The essence of Mr. Gore's speech was that these corrosive false impressions were part of a strategic pattern of distortion that the Bush administration used to create support not just for the war, but for an entire ideologically driven agenda that overwhelmingly favors the president's wealthy supporters and is driving the federal government toward a long-term fiscal catastrophe.
What if Mr. Gore is right? There's something at least a little crazy about an environment in which people are literally stumbling over one another to hear what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say about the budget crisis in California (short answer: nothing), while ignoring what a thoughtful former vice president has to say about the budget and the economy of the U.S.
Voters with children and grandchildren who may someday have to shoulder the backbreaking debt that is being piled up by the Bush crowd might want to carefully examine some of the points Mr. Gore is raising. The Bush administration would have you believe he is talking nonsense. But what if he's not?
"Instead of creating jobs, for example, we are losing millions of jobs -- net losses for three years in a row," said Mr. Gore. "That hasn't happened since the Great Depression." He then looked at the audience and deadpanned, to tremendous laughter: "As I've noted before, I was the first one laid off."
Credibility is the Bush administration's Achilles' heel. If the public comes to believe that it cannot trust the administration about its reasons for going to war, about the real costs of the war in human lives and American dollars, about the actual state of the nation's defenses against terror and about the real beneficiaries of its economic policies, the Bush II presidency will be crippled, if not doomed.
This is an administration that is particularly sensitive to light. It prefers to do business behind closed doors, with the curtains and shades drawn. Enormous taxpayer-financed contracts are handed out to a favored few without competitive bidding. We still don't know what went on at the secret meetings between Dick Cheney and top energy industry executives at the very beginning of the Bush reign.
"It seems obvious," said Mr. Gore, "that big and important issues like the Bush economic policy and the first pre-emptive war in U.S. history should have been covered more extensively in the news media, and better presented to the American people, before our nation made such fateful choices. But that didn't happen, and in both cases reality is turning out to be very different from the impression that was given when the votes -- and the die -- were cast."
The Bush administration has managed to dodge the hard questions and benefit from an atmosphere in which the media and much of the public would rather contemplate Jennifer's navel and Arnold's fading pecs than pursue a possible pattern of deceit at the highest levels of government.

HEADLINE: A Civil Rights Struggle for Survival; 
Leader Returns to a Hispanic Legal Group Facing Financial Ruin

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Cesar A. Perales, who was New York City deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, state social services commissioner under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and assistant secretary for health, education and welfare under President Jimmy Carter, sits in a modest office in TriBeCa these days in a chair that squeaks under his weight.
 "I can't afford to have it fixed," Mr. Perales said, only half joking. 
 Money is Mr. Perales's official chief preoccupation as the newly appointed interim president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a 30-year-old Hispanic institution with a solid civil rights legacy and a severe financial crisis. 
So severe is the problem that the fund's staff of 21 lawyers, paralegals, policy analysts and secretaries is working as little as half time. So dire are the budgetary needs that the organization is two months behind in rent and is trying to hold off creditors while deciding whom to pay first -- the landlord, the bank or the fund-raising consultant.
So Mr. Perales, 62, who was one of the fund's founders and its first president, has come back to lead the rescue efforts.
Nowadays, every nickel counts. When a staff member asked Mr. Perales whether he would attend the Hispanic Heritage Awards in Washington in September, he scoffed, "They think we have money for people to fly down and wear a tuxedo."
Then he said, like a mantra: "We. Have. No. Money."
This is hardly the first time that the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a public-interest law group modeled in 1972 after the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., has struggled for its survival. In 1984, a dispute between management and staff over control of the fund jeopardized private funding.
But the timing of the latest crisis could not have been worse. Nonprofit organizations are finding that private donations have become scarce. And Mr. Perales and others say the fund, despite its reputation as a defender of Latino rights, needs to be more aggressive in raising funds and in selling itself as a relevant institution at a time when civil rights is not the premier issue it once was.
Luis Alvarez, 68, a former board member who has come out of retirement to help coordinate a fund-raising group, "Friends of P.R.L.D.E.F.," said the fund needed to market itself better, because, despite its name, it encompasses labor, redistricting and other issues that affect Dominicans, Mexicans and other Latinos. It also needs a legal strategy, he said.
"We have to have a real boutique of lawyers with an agenda," Mr. Alvarez said. "We need to refocus our mission."
In fact, Mr. Perales said that when he returned to the fund, he found only 15 pending cases in its docket, down from what used to be dozens.
Formed "to advance the civil rights of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics through litigation and other legal means," the fund filed class-action lawsuits that brought bilingual education to New York City public schools and bilingual ballots to school board elections in the 1970's. Its court challenges to redistricting plans have helped increase the number of Hispanic elected officials, and its law exam workshops and counseling services for as many as 300 black and Latino students a year have helped create generations of minority lawyers. The fund broadened its work in 1998 by merging with the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, which analyzes government policy and data on issues like underreporting of Hispanic groups in the census.
Once, the discrimination the fund fought was obvious, like the height requirements that kept minorities out of the New York City Police Department. But now, said Mr. Perales, who most recently was a senior fellow at Baruch College School of Public Affairs, the fund needs to be more creative in an era when things may not be as clear cut.
"We've got to learn to find and attack the subtle problems," he said. 
But Mr. Perales said that "the vision is the same."
But the organization is short $500,000 of its $1.8 million budget this year, meaning that fund-raising comes first. Mr. Perales, who took over in June at a nominal salary, said the financial situation stemmed largely from bad planning inthe face of cutbacks in foundation and corporate financing.
He said the problems were temporarily masked by an influx of more than $1 million the fund received after Sept. 11, 2001, to provide services to those affected by the terrorist attack. That money led to new hiring to help victims with jobs, housing and other needs.
The fund's employees blame poor management by the previous president, Juan A. Figueroa, and flawed oversight by the board of directors for the precarious finances. They specifically fault Mr. Figueroa, who was the fund's president for nearly 10 years, for leaving in January in the midst of a $3 million fund-raising campaign without allowing for a smooth transition of leadership.
The employees said that Mr. Figueroa had warned them of looming financial problems if more private money was not forthcoming, but that managers and board members had denied until May that there was a serious problem.
But Carlos Ortiz, chairman of the 19-member board, said the financial troubles began when grants that were expected early in the year were late in coming. By May, he said, "we could not hold out any longer."
The staff's union agreed to $287,000 in salary reductions over four months but still faces layoffs. "The staff feels betrayed," said Jose A. Garcia, a policy analyst and co-chairman of the union, the National Organization of Legal Services Workers, Local 2320 of the United Automobile Workers.
Mr. Figueroa, now president of the Anthem Foundation of Connecticut, which gives money for health care initiatives, conceded that "some things could have been done differently."
But Mr. Figueroa, who said he was still involved with helping to raise money for the fund, said the basic financial issue hobbling the organization over the years was too much reliance on foundation grants and what he called a lack of "financial depth," including the tapping of resources within its Latino constituency. Because of its litigation against the government, the fund receives no public financing.
But Mr. Perales's call for financial support is being heeded. Members of the Hispanic legal community in the city are holding fund-raisers and developing plans to enlist new board members and pro bono lawyers.
One of these lawyers, William Malpica, an associate with Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, said he owed the fund his "ticket to middle class." A Puerto Rican New Yorker, Mr. Malpica said that he interned at the fund as a college student and that its preparation course had helped him get into Fordham Law School.
"I wanted to be a lawyer, but I was scared of failure," he said. "They inspired me."
But other supporters note that the fund must prove itself worthy of financial support.
"The challenge is to put together a plan that shows they can secure the agency financially, and that if money is given to them it's not washed away," said Ninfa Segarra, a former New York City deputy mayor and president of the Board of Education who is now executive director of the New York City Police Museum.
But Ms. Segarra, like many others, said the fund must thrive.
"P.R.L.D.E.F. has not outlived its usefulness," she said. "We need it to stay alive and stay strong."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
If You Can't Take the Heat, Get Out of Crawford

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
How hot was it at President Bush's ranch lastweek?
 So hot that he momentarily slipped up and let it be known that the 106-degree temperatures were getting to him. 
 "We've got to get in before we have a heat stroke," Mr. Bush told reporters at his ranch on Friday, trying to end an 18-minute news conference with his top military advisers under the blistering noon sun. 
Then he corrected himself. 
"Before you have a heat stroke," he told reporters, implying, once again, that he could take the heat even if all those squishy White House correspondents, who would rather be at Mr. Bush's parents' place in Maine, could not.
The heat wave was the big story at the president's ranch last week, serving as a kind of leveler that wilted the parade of White House advisers and political fund-raisers summoned by Mr. Bush to the inferno. From Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, no one stayed a moment longer than necessary. Certainly no one lingered to see the Crawford scenery or to take a dip in Lake Waco.
Even the crickets that swarm into Waco on their annual August migration tried to come indoors, and dozens hopped all over the lobby of the Hilton hotel one night this past week.
Rich political fund-raisers who blew in for a barbecue with the president on Saturday left some 40 private jets temporarily parked on the tarmac at the Waco airport, their pilots ready for immediate takeoffs afterward. One invited fund-raiser who stayed home confessed that he did so because of the prospect of Crawford in August.
"I simply couldn't take it," he said.
Neither could the president's dog Spot who trotted out after the president to meet reporters on Friday, then quickly retreated, unlike her owner, to the shade of the house.
The president for the most part continued his monthlong ranch routine as if it were, say, 98 degrees, by clearing cedar and going fishing. On Thursday, when the official Crawford high (measured in the nearby town of McGregor) was 105.8 degrees, and on the same week that the Waco newspaper warned people not to exercise in the heat, Mr. Bush went for a run -- at noon.
"That's weird," said Vince Castillo, 57, the police chaplain in the nearby town of Bruceville-Eddy, who was having lunch on Sunday at the Coffee Station, Crawford's combination gas station and restaurant.
Mr. Castillo's wife, Martha, said that she had remained in the air-conditioning during the heat wave and that the time she had spent outside was "two minutes, and that would be tops."
Of course, the run did allow Mr. Bush to add a Secret Service agent to the membership list of his "Hundred Degree Club," which consists of people able to run with him when the temperature hits 100.
So far, the Bush administration officials who have stayed the longest in Crawford this month are Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his deputy, Richard L. Armitage, who arrived at the Waco airport on Tuesday afternoon, had dinner at the ranch, then left after lunch with the president at the Coffee Station on Wednesday.
Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, has been at the ranch for more than a week, but as part of the regular Crawford duty she shares with her deputies to ensure that a national security aide is always with Mr. Bush. Bill Clinton had the same system, but his national security aides caught the breezes of Martha's Vineyard.
It was in the furnacelike air outside the Coffee Station that Mr. Bush gave some hint as to why he might be continuing to run through the heat wave: a five-pound weight gain from last year recorded on his Aug. 2 checkup, which the presidential doctors spun out as "most likely" because of increased muscle mass.
But Mr. Bush patted his stomach and said, as Mr. Powell watched, "When you're 57, you know where it is." Inside, the group dined on cheeseburgers, French fries, fried jalapeno peppers and fried onion rings.
By the weekend, the heat wave had broken after a thunderstorm, and temperatures on Sunday reached only the mid-90's. In any case, Mr. Bush is about to begin brief political and fund-raising trips from his ranch -- Colorado and Arizona on Monday, California on Thursday and Friday -- to places where the temperatures are less extreme. But he will be at the ranch through the month, and Washington will continue to come to him. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and the White House economic team are to be in Crawford on Wednesday.
On Friday, Vice President Dick Cheney descended from his summer home in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming to the dry Texas prairie, where he met with the president on Iraq and cast for bass in Mr. Bush's stocked pond. Mr. Cheney normally pursues trout in cold mountain streams.
"Dick Cheney is a great fly fisherman," Mr. Bush told reporters.
"But not a member of the Hundred Degree Club," Mr. Cheney said.

HEADLINE: In Full Field, The Talk Is of One Candidate 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF and ALAN FEUER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Nearly 160 people have tossed their hats, beads or tutus into the three-ring circus of California politics, but the morning after the filing deadline to be the state's replacement governor the talk of the town was of just one candidate, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 While the headliners and lesser lights of California politics -- including Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante; Arianna Huffington, the author and radio personality; and Senator Dianne Feinstein -- used the Sunday morning talk show circuit to plot their positions in relation to Mr. Schwarzenegger's lodestar, he stayed silent. 
 Admonished by his advisers not to make news out of the box, Mr. Schwarzenegger left his campaign chairman, Pete Wilson, the former California governor, to attack Mr. Davis as an incompetent spendthrift, and lesser political minions to explain his personal finances to a press corps demanding details, any details. 
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the Schwarzenegger campaign, released tax statements this afternoon showing that Mr. Schwarzenegger is a rich man. 
His tax returns show that his gross adjusted income for 2000 and 2001 was slightly more than $57 million. For that period, Mr. Schwarzenegger owned at least 10 stock and bond portfolios worth more than $1 million each. His interests include real estate, a racetrack, an Ohio shopping mall and commercial aircraft.
Mr. Walsh said Mr. Schwarzenegger had not decided whether he would place his holdings in a blind trust if elected.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's financial documents describe not just what he has earned but also how he has shared his wealth. 
In 2000, he gave a 1934 Bentley valued at $41,500 and a 1996 Humvee valued at $86,000 to the Inner-City Games Foundation, which runs after-school programs. The next year he donated a house in Santa Monica appraised at more than $2 million to the Roman Catholic church.
Mr. Schwarzenegger is fond of reminding voters of his history as a penniless Austrian farmboy who became one of Hollywood's highest-paid entertainers. But today, Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, challenged Mr. Wilson on Mr. Schwarzenegger's rags-to-riches immigrant story and ridiculed Mr. Schwarzenegger as being no friend of the immigrant.
Mr. Torres reminded voters on "This Week" with George Stephanopoulos that Mr. Schwarzenegger had once stumped for Mr. Wilson, the sponsor of Proposition 187, a successful ballot initiative barring illegal immigrants from receiving state services. The measure was eventually struck down in state appellate court.
"Arnold did support it," Mr. Wilson confirmed, noting that about 60 percent of the state's electorate had supported the proposition, too. "Mr. Torres, and the Democrats, are trying to play the race card," Mr. Wilson said.
When Mr. Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy last week, it sent the Democrats into disarray. An agreement to offer no alternative to Mr. Davis and instead present a united front to beat back the recall fell apart as two prominent Democrats joined the race.
But in an 11th-hour compromise on Saturday, John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, pulled out, leaving Mr. Bustamante as the sole sanctioned Democratic option.
Democratic strategists are betting that the presence of Mr. Bustamante, the first statewide Latino officer-holder in 100 years, will draw Hispanics to the polls to vote no on the recall, as Mr. Bustamante is urging them to do.
But others worry the Hispanic voters may choose to remove the unpopular Mr. Davis and install Mr. Bustamante in his place.
"It's a really good question, the $64,000 question," one Democratic strategist said. "We're going to have to see what the polls say."
For his part, Mr. Bustamante, appearing on "This Week," said he was "a positive second option" and encouraged Californians to "vote no on the recall, but yes on Bustamante."
Mr. Bustamante contends that Mr. Schwarzenegger does not possess the political acumen needed to run the fifth largest economy in the world. "I'm the only person in this race," he told Mr. Stephanopoulos, "who has been in a leadership position in the State Legislature." 
But on "Meet the Press" this morning, Darrell Issa, the San Diego County congressman who bankrolled the recall drive and dropped out of the race last week, said Mr. Bustamante's strategy would not work. 
"I'm interested to see if Cruz Bustamante will come out of the shadows of this failed administration and start talking about how he would do it differently," Mr. Issa said.
Asked why he had dropped out of the race only hours after promising to stay in, Mr. Issa said he cared more about the health of California than his own political fortunes.
"It became obvious that morning as the first, then second, Democrat entered the race, that I would only complicate things," Mr. Issa said. He blamed his swift decline on Mr. Davis's relentless attacks.
"I very much feel that Gray Davis's 16 weeks of pounding on me, in very much the same way as he did on Dianne Feinstein, needed to be taken out of the mix."
Mr. Davis lost to Ms. Feinstein by 26 points in a 1992 Senate primary despite television advertisements comparing her to Leona Helmsley, a convicted tax felon.
Ms. Feinstein, who rejected appeals from some in the Democratic establishment to put her name on the ballot, agreed that Mr. Davis did play dirty and said that he would need to run an above-the-belt campaign if he wished to keep his job.
"I think the governor has to be given on opportunity to plight his troth to the electorate of California," she said. "I think a negative campaign is a big mistake. People need to see Gray Davis, governor of the largest state in the union, in a positive mode."
And then there is Arianna Huffington, who has taken to tailing Mr. Schwarzenegger at news events to draw him out and bask in his glow. She has joined Ms. Feinstein and other progressives in demanding an end to bare-knuckle politics. She has also pledged to cap her campaign spending at $10 million and promised not to run negative advertisements or conduct opinion polls.
"I think the people of California are sick of demolition derbies," she said on "This Week."
Of the replacement candidates, Mr. Schwarzenegger is the odds-on favorite, according to various polls, with Mr. Bustamante the next closest competitor. By state law, one only needs a plurality to win.
Mr. Torres, the Democratic chief, said this morning that Mr. Davis was toying with the thought of apologizing for being a bad governor, contending that he may have made some mistakes but that his motivations were in the best interest of Californians.
"It's something he may consider," Mr. Torres said before launching into a litany of the governor's successes: improved student test scores, a paid family-leave act and an eventual solution to the state's energy crisis.
Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Mr. Schwarzenegger to detail his own political agenda. But instead of wading into the morass of California's finances this afternoon, he chose through aides to explain his own.
His financial documents show that he may be reluctant to spend on political campaigns other than his own. When asked on his tax returns whether he wanted to contribute $3 to the Federal Election campaign fund, he checked the "no" box.

HEADLINE: The New Yorker Who Changed the Diet of the South 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD MARKEL

 BODY:
Much of the knowledgeabout the relationship between diet and disease has been developed over the last century. In those decades, many health experts devoted their lives to conducting research on the new science called nutrition and the task of teaching others how to avoid deadly illnesses by altering their diets.
 Alan M. Kraut, a professor of history at American University, tracks the career of one such physician, Joseph Goldberger (1874-1929), in his new book, "Goldberger's War: The Life and Times of a Public Health Crusader" (Hill & Wang). Goldberger helped solve one of the great medical mysteries in the last century, the cause and cure for pellagra, a potentially lethal disease. 
 Pellagra is signaled by diarrhea, a scaly rash, dementia and death. It is caused by a deficiency of niacin, a form of vitamin B. With balanced diets and fortified foods, pellagra is rare today in Westernized nations. But it continues to be a problem in developing countries, where niacin-poor foods like corn and rice are primary sources of nutrition or where malnutrition is common.
In the United States, pellagra continued to be a huge problem through the mid-20th century. From 1906 to 1940, about three million people contracted it and 100,000 of them died. Most were in the South. "Until the 1930's," Professor Kraut said, "no one knew what caused it." 
For millions of impoverished Southerners, who struggled to make a living as sharecroppers, millworkers or tenant farmers, most meals consisted of the "three-M diet": meat, usually pork fatback; molasses; and meal, derived from corn. 
"Southerners of this era ate what they always ate and were not aware of these deficiencies," said Charles Reagan Wilson, a professor of history at the University of Mississippi and the co-editor of The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture. "These foods were a valued tradition and gave them a certain amount of nurture. But improved nutrition should be seen as part of an entire movement of modernization, which was a slow process in the South."
In 1883, the 9-year-old Joseph Goldberger joined the growing waves of Eastern European Jews immigrating to the United States. He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. After receiving his medical degree from Bellevue Medical College in 1895, he briefly practiced general medicine in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., before joining the Public Health Service in 1899.
His first job was inspecting immigrants at Ellis Island. Later, while stationed in Delaware, he was introduced by a colleague to Mary Farrar, a grandniece of Jefferson Davis. The unlikely couple fell in love and were married in 1905. Their relationship was an essential element of Goldberger's peripatetic, dangerous and successful career.
From 1902 to 1914, he battled yellow-fever epidemics in Louisiana, Mexico, Mississippi and Puerto Rico; dengue fever in Texas; and typhus in Mexico City. He contracted all three, yet survived.
In 1914, Surgeon General Rupert Blue assigned Goldberger to the South to tackle pellagra. After inspecting Southern orphanages, mental hospitals and prisons, Goldberger made the critical observation that although the malnourished inmates of those institutions often developed pellagra, the better-fed staff did not. Pellagra, he asserted, arose not from germs, as commonly thought, but from deficient diets.
To prove his theory, Goldberger, his assistants and even his wife engaged in experiments called filth parties. They injected themselves with blood or ingested the scabs, feces and body fluids of patients. None developed pellagra.
From 1929 to the early 40's, Goldberger was the subject of magazine profiles, movie shorts, best-selling books and even an issue of Real Life Comics in 1941.
"Goldberger had great cachet as a popular hero in his day," said Bert Hansen, an associate professor of history at Baruch College in Manhattan. "He was clever like Sherlock Holmes in noticing patterns of clues that others overlooked. People were fascinated by his wise insights."
Equally important, Goldberger searched for wholesome foods that might prevent pellagra. One cure he stumbled on was cheap, if not exactly palatable -- daily doses of brewer's yeast.
It was not until 1937, eight years after the doctor's death from kidney cancer, that biochemists at the University of Wisconsin identified the exact chemical root of the dietary deficiency that causes pellagra: niacin. The vitamin is plentiful in red meat, fish, poultry, green leafy vegetables and, as it happens, brewer's yeast.
Goldberger faced long odds in trying to change the eating patterns of Southerners. "The arrogance of science combined with a Yankee voice was not always very persuasive," Professor Wilson said. 
After an educational campaign by the Public Health Service and better economic times, Southerners gradually changed their diets to include fortified foods or those containing niacin. By the 50's, pellagra had almost vanished.
Campaigns like Joseph Goldberger's carry lessons for today. Diet continues to be a major health problem, strongly correlated to leading killers like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and, of course, obesity. What has changed is that dietary diseases of the past were almost always connected to nutritional deficiencies, while those seen today are almost caused by eating too much. 
"Goldberger's war, encouraging us to eat better, never really ends," Professor Kraut said. "We just send in fresh troops."

HEADLINE: Generics Shake Up a Drug Industry 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
After four years of chronic recession, few Argentine companies can boast a clean bill of financial health. But for the generic drug maker Fada Pharma, the country's economic crisis has been nothing short of a tonic.
 Thanks to a new generics law, hastily passed by decree in 2002 just as the economy hit rock bottom, Fada rode out the crisis and is now growing fast, selling an expanding range of no-brand drugs to pharmacies and drugstores. 
 The new law, born of patent legislation that came into force in 2000, shook Argentina's previously cozy pharmaceutical industry to the core. 
It not only changed consumer buying patterns, but also forced bigger drug companies to lower their prices, redraw their marketing strategies and even look overseas to make up for shrinking margins at home.
The drugs market, worth nearly $6 billion in the mid-1990's, shrank to $1.2 billion in 2002.
For Fada, though, the upheaval was a godsend.
Its work force, reduced to 200 in 2002 from 270 employees before the crisis, is now up to 300, Eduardo Epstein, the company's general manager, said. Sales in 2003 are expected to top 65 million pesos, up 44 percent from 25.5 million pesos in 2000, and are recovering even in dollar terms.
After plummeting by nearly half to $13.5 million in 2002 -- when the devalued peso lost two thirds of its value -- from $25.5 million in 2001, sales in 2003 should be back to nearly $22 million, Mr. Epstein said.
Before the economy's collapse -- and the change in the generics law -- Fada made only injectable generic drugs and it could sell only to hospitals.
While it remains the market leader in that niche, it is benefiting from the new demand.
"The devaluation hurt us, but from a strategic point of view, the crisis definitely helped us," said Eduardo Campiani, a director of Advent International, a private equity fund based in Boston that bought Fada in 2000.
Although medicines are staple products, the severity of Argentina's crisis -- the jobless rate was 21.5 percent in 2002 and even now more than half the country still lives below the poverty line, according to the government -- meant increasing numbers of people could not afford to buy drugs.
Anxious to head off a health -- and political -- crisis last August, the government hastily passed the generics law, overruling a powerful lobby of big Argentine laboratories that have traditionally made most of their money on branded drugs.
"Without the generics law, people would have suffered terribly," Mr. Campiani said, "so the government rushed through in 18 months what we had been expecting to take three or four years."
For consumers, the immediate effect has been lower drug prices.
Although not all drugs are available yet as generics -- Fada, for example, still markets only 33 generic drugs in capsules and tablets -- prices have fallen across the board.
Olga Fernandez, a 57-year-old who earns $300 a month as a domestic worker, says that prices at her local drugstore have fallen by nearly half in six months.
"It's just as well, because with the country in the state it's in, nobody could afford to get sick," she said.
Under the new law, doctors must list the generic name of medicines on patients' prescriptions and may also list a brand name, effectively shifting the balance of selling power away from physicians to pharmacists, as they can now recommend unbranded drugs to patients.
Fada's sales force, therefore, started focusing its promotions on drugstore owners and employees, and the company set up its own postal distribution network, sidestepping traditional wholesale distributors, most of them owned by larger laboratories.
While generics here still account for only a small market share -- 10 to 12 percent, compared with nearly 50 percent in the United States -- Argentina's continuing economic woes mean potential is huge.
With the government and insurers -- the institutions that have traditionally financed Argentine health care -- cutting costs, industry insiders estimate that patients will pay for nearly half the drugs sold out of their own pockets, compared with less than a third before the crisis.
"Now it's a question of price, not brand," Mrs. Fernandez said. "In my neighborhood, everybody now goes to Dr. Ahorro."
Since last fall, the El Fenix pharmacy chain of Mexico has opened eight stores in Buenos Aires specializing in generics, buying in bulk from the cheapest supplier and using the discount brand name Dr. Ahorro, or Dr. Savings.
Over the next two years, the company plans to open another 50 stores.
At first people were concerned about the drugs' safety, Mrs. Fernandez said, "but they must be O.K.; otherwise half the country would be dead already."
Hurt by dwindling sales, traditional drug companies at first warned consumers against buying generic cocktails produced in the back rooms of smaller pharmacies, saying they contained inadequate amounts of antibiotics or that the quality was inferior.
Under the law, generics producers must guarantee that their drugs will have exactly the same clinical outcome on patients as their branded equivalents, though not all are subject to full bio-equivalence tests, which can cost up to $30,000 a drug.
Such is the generic market's growth, however, that some traditional manufacturers of branded drugs, like Laboratorios Bago, are considering buying out smaller laboratories to produce no-brand drugs themselves.
"There has been such a radical change in the market that we've all had to rethink our strategies," said Carlos del Valle, Bago's director of institutional relations. "We have had to become more flexible in our marketing and realize that customers who used to have 10 pesos in their pocket, now only have 4."
More flexible marketing at Bago has meant everything from traditional point-of-sale campaigns -- two for the price of one -- to coupons offering discounts of up to 40 percent to needier families and patients who need long-term treatment.
It has also meant making the most of the weak peso to export to markets outside Latin America.
In July, Bago delivered its second shipment of Trifamox IBL, an injectable antibiotic, to China, and the company expects to sell anti-inflammatory drugs to South Korea, and vitamins to Japan,Australia and New Zealand worth $3.2 million in 2003. 
"This is a niche, admittedly," Mr. del Valle said. "But it certainly helps compensate for some of the dollar costs we have in importing raw materials."

HEADLINE: 86% Rise In Profit For Hyundai In Quarter 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The Hyundai Motor Company today reported an 86 percent increase in second-quarter profit, despite a strike that began in the third week of June and declining sales in the domestic market.
 The company, South Korea's dominant motor vehicle manufacturer since it opened its first plant in the southeastern port city of Ulsan in the mid-1960's, said net income for the quarter was a record 571 billion won ($482.8 million), up from 307 billion won in the second quarter a year earlier. 
 The company ascribed its high overseas sales in large part to the success of its Santa Fe sport utility vehicle, mostly in the United States, and of its Grandeur XG luxury sedan. 
A company spokesman, Jake Jang, acknowledged that demand was sluggish in South Korea, where concerns about a sagging economy have forced lenders to tighten credit as would-be customers stayed away from showrooms.
But a sharp increase in exports more than compensated for the difference, Mr. Jang said. While selling 165,000 vehicles in South Korea in the first six months, down 18 percent from the same period last year, the company sold 436,000 vehicles over all, up 7.6 percent. The chief financial officer, Chae Yang Ki, said Hyundai had overcome numerous obstacles, including the drag created by the war in Iraq and the SARS epidemic.
The 47-day strike at Hyundai ended last week and cost $1.1 billion, which will be mostly felt in the second half.
Hyundai Motor's results came a week after the suicide of Chung Mong Hun, the chairman of Hyundai Asan and brother of Chung Mong Koo, the chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group. Chung Mong Hun had led efforts to foster economic relations with North Korea, in keeping with the wishes of his father, Chung Ju Yung, founder of the Hyundai empire.
Chung Mong Hun's body was found on Aug. 4 after he leapt from a 12-story window of Hyundai Asan headquarters. He was under indictment on charges of having ordered the altering of records to disguise the transfer of nearly $100 million of $400 million in payments that have been confirmed as having gone to North Korea. He was one of eight former Hyundai executives and government officials indicted so far in the scandal.
Chung Mong Koo, the head of Hyundai Motor, speaking near his brother's grave at the family burial site in Hanam, 30 miles southeast of Seoul, said North Korea's socialist system makes significant investment there all but impossible for the foreseeable future.
"North Korea is a socialist country," Mr. Chung said. "North Korea has a different system, so we don't think we can go there for business. They have a unique environment."
Mr. Chung's outlook is widely shared by other South Korean businessmen. Hyundai Asan, the company founded by Chung Ju Yung to coordinate Hyundai investment in North Korea, has seen no return on its $1.16 billion investment in the North so far. 
Almost all that investment has gone to the Mount Kumkang tourism project, and the remainder on planning for an industrial park. Hyundai's investment towers over the $300 million invested by all other South Korean companies in North Korea, mainly for factories producing textiles from material shipped from South Korea and returned to the South as finished garments with no labels indicating where they were made.

HEADLINE: Deflation at Bay, Fed Is Expected To Stay Course 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
As the Federal Reserve prepares to meet about interest rates on Tuesday, recent fears about price deflation have in large part abated.
 Three months after the Fed began hinting about its readiness to nip any trend toward declining prices before it started, even if it meant reducing short-term interest rates almost to zero, officials have made it clear they are now less worried than they were before and more reluctant to jump in with unconventional tactics. 
 Many financial analysts, some taking their cue from the Fed, have shifted their outlook as well. Suddenly there is more talk about faster growth and rising prices for many commodities. 
"A few months ago, fears of deflation were extraordinary and in my opinion overdone," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist at Citigroup Global Markets. "Now the markets are going in the opposite direction, and I think some of that is overdone as well."
Almost all analysts predict that the Federal Open Market Committee will leave the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks unchanged at 1 percent.
The Fed may also express slightly greater optimism than it did after its meeting in June, when it reiterated its worry about "an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation" and described economic prospects as "weighted toward weakness."
But Fed officials have made it clear they are less worried now about deflation than they were just a few months ago. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a Congressional hearing last month that he did not think it would be necessary to fight deflation with unconventional tactics like buying up longer-term Treasury notes.
Buying longer-term securities, rather than simply setting the federal funds rate, would allow the Fed to pump more money into the economy even if the overnight lending rates had dropped to zero, as they have in Japan.
Fed officials say they are still prepared to take such measures, but they say the conditions have improved and that such measures are unnecessary for the moment. They also insist that Mr. Greenspan has never really changed his views, because both he and other officials were always careful to say they viewed the likelihood of deflation as remote.
But has the risk of a Japanese-style downward price spiral actually diminished?
Optimists note that a variety of recent data indicates that economic growth in the United States accelerated to 2.4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter. And while nearly half of the economy's growth came from increased government spending, business investment also increased sharply.
Inflation is still running at an annual rate of only 1 percent, the lowest level in nearly four decades, and there are few signs that it will pick up anytime soon. But analysts note that prices for many raw materials have been climbing, which is at least one hint that prices are not poised for an across-the-board decline.
Adam Posen, a senior fellow at the Institute of International Economics in Washington, said he had gradually become convinced that deflation would not turn into the scourge it has proved to be in Japan for nearly a decade.
"If you look underneath the headline numbers, you see that there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in the U.S. economy," Mr. Posen said. Since the stock market bubble burst three years ago, he said, shaky technology companies have been closed, businesses have cut back on their costs and banks have tightened up on credit standards.
That revamping, he said, has now given the American economy a better basis for new economic growth going forward.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said he was much more skeptical about the possibility of deflation than he was a year ago. Not only has the Fed continued to make cheap money available, he said, but the federal government is now stoking demand through the tax cuts and tax rebates that Congress passed this summer.
But even within the Fed, some officials have been quick to caution that deflation or at least "disinflation" -- a further decline in inflation, but a rate still slightly above zero -- is possible even if economic growth picks up.
Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, noted in a speech in July that the American economy still has a great deal of "slack" in the form of unused capacity and that the jobless rate could easily remain at more than 6 percent for the rest of this year and much of next.
In addition, Mr. Bernanke warned, inaccuracies in measuring the nation's capacity could even now be understating the real amount that factories are being underutilized. That would raise the possibility that "the amount of effective slack currently in the economy is greater than most analysts think," Mr. Bernanke said. "There are good reasons not to discount this possibility."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Even After SARS, Airlines Suffer on Asian Routes

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The disease had run its course, as far as Peter Chu was concerned.
 Sure, the respiratory illness known as SARS had sowed fear throughout Asia in the spring. But Mr. Chu was now determined to take his wife, Rose, and 4-year-old son, Michael, back to Taiwan for a visit. 
 "They haven't found a new SARS patient," said Mr. Chu as he and his family waited at San Francisco International Airport on a recent afternoon for a flight to Taipei on EVA Airways, the Taiwanese airline. "So we think there will be no effect on us." 
But not everyone shares his bravado. Mr. Chu, who moved here three years ago to work as a loan officer for a Taiwan bank, said his older brother and two co-workers had canceled their annual trips back to Taiwan.
The summer season is usually the peak period for trans-Pacific travel, when immigrants visit friends and family and tourists flood streets from Beijing to Bangkok. But the region remains far more depressed in terms of air travel than any other part of the world. Passenger traffic plummeted on lucrative trans-Pacific routes at the height of the SARS scare in April and May. It has recovered somewhat -- monthly traffic numbers are no longer as far below last year's figures as they once were -- but travel across the Pacific continues to lag travel in all other regions.
What's more, the Bush administration's decision on Aug. 2 to bar many passengers from catching connecting flights in the United States without having to get entry visas will cut into another source of revenue for some airlines. Industry experts said flights that would be most affected are those passing through this country on trips between Asia and Latin America. Passengers unwilling to go to the time and expense of obtaining a United States visa will probably catch flights that connect through other countries, like Canada.
The Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group in the United States, estimated that travelers connecting through this country under two programs giving them permission to enter without visas accounted for $150 million of revenue last year. While that is less than 1 percent of total industry revenue, the figure will undoubtedly decline just as airlines are scrapping for every dollar they can find. 
In addition, rising anti-Western violence in parts of Asia, illustrated by the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta last week, will continue to scare off some tourists. Business travelers are not returning as quickly as airlines hoped, and some who had canceled trips during the SARS scare could decide now that they can continue to substitute telephone or videoconferencing for face-to-face meetings.
Though traffic numbers have shown some improvement lately, much of this travel was stimulated by cutthroat deals on plane tickets, so revenue will continue to lag.
"Tickets to Taiwan are usually $700 round trip," said Jennifer Wong, a 37-year-old loan consultant also waiting to catch the EVA Air flight here with her two children. "This year, I got a $540 ticket from a travel agent in San Jose. Some friends got deals with hotel stays."
Trans-Pacific traffic in July for the major United States airlines was down 13 percent compared with the month last year, said John Heimlich, an economist for the Air Transport Association. That was a far larger drop than the systemwide decrease of 2 percent, though it was an improvement over the decline of about 40 percent at the height of the SARS scare.
"At this point, it's as much general malaise as it is residual effects of SARS," Mr. Heimlich said.
United Airlines, which relies on Asia travel for nearly a fifth of its revenue and uses San Francisco as its trans-Pacific gateway, reported that its Pacific traffic in July was down 22.1 percent from a year ago. That is a significant improvement over April and May, but still much worse than its 5.7 percent system-wide decline.
Richard H. Anderson, chief executive of Northwest Airlines, which is United's main American rival on trans-Pacific travel, said he expected a double-digit decline in passenger boardings in August.
"While we've seen recovery, it's difficult to see significant recovery at this point from SARS," Mr. Anderson said. 
The summer months "are typically the strongest travel months," he added. "But the booking period for June, July and August was right in the middle of SARS."
Mr. Anderson said he believed that the real problem with the Pacific slump was the stagnating Japanese economy. He predicted that a true resurgence in travel would not happen until that country recovered. For now, he said, Northwest will reduce capacity by using smaller aircraft, a practice it began during the SARS scare.
The airline has also reduced capacity by offering fewer flights on some routes. Between its hub in Minneapolis and Tokyo, for example, it is operating 7 flights a week instead of 10. It has stopped flying between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu altogether. "We're not to where we were by any measure," Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman, said of the Pacific service.
Foreign airlines are among those hardest hit by the summer travel slump. The International Air Transport Association, the largest trade group for overseas airlines, said last week that preliminary June traffic numbers showed a 35.8 percent drop for the Asia-Pacific region from a year earlier. Worldwide, traffic is down 11.8 percent.
Because air fares around the world -- and especially those to Asian destinations -- are so low, any increase in traffic will not mean a proportional increase in yield, or revenue per passenger for each mile or kilometer flown.
"Even the most optimistic scenario for a robust traffic recovery will not see yields returning to normal for some time," Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, said last week in a speech in Hong Kong.
It was appropriate that Mr. Bisignani was spreading words of caution while in Hong Kong. Travelers shunned the city after SARS cases surged there in the spring. Last week, Cathay Pacific Airways, the airline based in Hong Kong, said it lost $159 million in the first six months of the year on revenue of $1.6 billion -- its worst half-year performance ever. It parked 22 planes during the SARS scare and has kept four of those on the ground. The airline has returned to a normal schedule on many routes, but offers only half as many nonstop flights between Los Angeles and Hong Kong.
Cathay is one of several airlines offering deep discounts on tickets to Asia. Earlier this summer, it was selling its All-Asia Pass -- a round-trip ticket from the United States to Hong Kong and onward to as many as 17 cities -- for $699, down from $999. In July, the airline offered a $499 round-trip fare between the United States and Hong Kong.
Singapore Airlines has also cut rates. In mid-May, it began offering a $599 round-trip fare from North America to Bangkok and Bali, with a five-night stay in a five-star hotel.
While such sales have spurred travel among bargain-hunting vacationers, they have done little to get the most profitable passengers, business travelers, back on the planes. "The higher end has been slower to respond, with first-class being the most sluggish," said James Boyd, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines.
Airlines, meanwhile, are groping for a way to retain foreign travelers who pass through the United States on their way to other countries -- for example, someone changing planes in Los Angeles while flying from Tokyo to Toronto. Before Aug. 2, these travelers did not need a visa from the United States. Now, because of suspicion that terrorists could use this exemption to enter the country illegally, travelers who would usually need a visa to visit the United States have to go to a consulate or embassy abroad for a face-to-face interview to get a visa for their brief stop. That could lead foreign passengers to book flights that connect through other countries instead, or cancel their trips altogether.
Such travelers accounted for only 0.3 percent of the total revenue of $56 billion among major United States airlines last year, according to the Air Transport Association. But Mr. Heimlich, the industry economist, noted that "it's another 0.3 percent you have to make up for in cutting expenses."
Mr. Anderson, the Northwest chief executive, estimated that his airline would lose millions from the suspension of the programs.
What's more, the change may hurt airports, as restaurants, gift shops and other concessionaires lose the money that such travelers would have spent while in transit.
Mary Jersin-Shammas, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific, said her airline had to reroute a resident of Mexico who was scheduled to fly back from Hong Kong to Mexico City via Los Angeles. The man was instead booked on a flight going through Vancouver, she said.
Terry Trippler of Cheapseats.com, an online travel merchant, noted that United Airlines runs flights between Hong Kong and Mexico City with a stop here. Passengers wanting to fly between those cities without having to get a visa just to connect could book a Hong Kong-Mexico City flight on Air France that goes through Paris, he said.
"I've been in the business for 35 years, and we've always had transit without visa," Mr. Trippler said. "Then it changed in two hours. I know they've made a lot of mistakes, but these poor network carriers are just getting hit every time they turn around."
So how much worse can it get? Some scientists are predicting there could be a resurgence of SARS this fall or winter.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Athens; 
An Ancient City Is Sprucing Itself Up

BYLINE:  By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
Athens is getting a makeover for the return of the Olympic Games in 2004 to the land of their birth. The new Metro system is a model of speed, efficiency and beauty, with many stations displaying archeological artifacts excavated during construction or bold contemporary works by Greek artists.
 Roads are being built or improved, the phone system is being upgraded, security is being increased, museums and archeological sites are being spruced up, and hotels are being renovated. 
 The construction has jump-started the Greek economy. According to Stratos Papadimitriou, chairman of the Hellenic Center for Investment, the economy grew last year at nearly four times the average rate of other European Union countries. In addition to its traditional industries of shipping and tourism, Dr. Papadimitriou says, Athens has become a trade and banking hub. 

AIRPORT
ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, also known as Eleftherios Venizelos after a Greek statesman, opened in March 2001 to accolades, replacing Hellinikon Airport, which "we all loved to hate," said Nick Larigakis, executive director of the American Hellenic Institute.
Last year, after its first full year of operation, Athens International was ranked No. 1 in the world for overall passenger satisfaction among airports of similar size, according to an annual survey by the International Air Transportation Association. For now, taxis are the best way to get into the city -- and a bargain. By next summer, the Metro will run from the airport to the city's center.

HOTELS
The HOTEL GRANDE BRETAGNE (011-30-210-333-0000, $395 and up), has been a favorite of diplomats and divas since the 1870's for its Old World charm, upscale services and central location. In World War II, it was headquarters for the Germans. It was reopened in March after a $70 million restoration. It has a rooftop pool. (To call to a number in Athens from the United States, you must first dial 011-30-210.)
The ATHENIAN CALLIRHOE (921-5353, $225 and up) is a new boutique hotel with custom lighting, ergonomic pillows and mattresses, an executive floor, suites with Jacuzzis, and a rooftop garden restaurant with a backdrop of the Parthenon.
Victoria A. King, a screenwriter and freelance production coordinator, books documentary-film crews on tight budgets at the ACROPOLIS SELECT (921-1611, $105 and up), which she calls "a cheap and cheerful option" on a quiet street.
The elegant new SOFITEL (354-4000, from $275 and up) is close to the airport and has a Satellite Newspaper Kiosk that prints papers from all over the world in two minutes, and next month it will open a corridor of rooms for women travelers.

RESTAURANTS
Forget the power breakfast. Expect to eat a late lunch and an even later dinner. "If you go to a restaurant at 6 or 7, nobody's there," said George D. Kapetanakos, an executive with Southern Star Shipping. "The chef may not even be there."
Most neighborhoods have mom-and-pop tavernas with excellent food, like VITRO (923-8124, $50 for dinner for two with wine and tip) in the Makrigiani neighborhood, a few blocks south of the Acropolis. Vitro has live music every night and attaches complimentary trinkets, like the local worry beads known as komboloi, to your bill.
Mr. Kapetanakos suggests heading to the winding stone-paved streets of the Plaka, the oldest neighborhood of Athens at the foothills of the Acropolis, for traditional Greek food, like souvlaki or a Greek salad "to sit outside, people-watch and have an inexpensive meal."
But Athens now has many upscale dining options, including all varieties of ethnic food. "It's not just tavernas anymore with rickety chairs and moussaka," said Renee Pappas, who does international public relations for museums. For a business lunch, she recommends PRYTANEION (364-3353, $112 for two) in the Kolonaki neighborhood, which she compares to New York's Upper East Side; and for dinner she suggests the modern ARISTERA-DEXIA (342-2380, $100) in the trendy Rouf-Gazi district to sample its fusion cuisine and wide selection of wines.

ON YOUR OWN
If nothing else, visit the PARTHENON, the temple to Athena on the ACROPOLIS. History buffs will enjoy the AGORA, the hub of ancient Athenian life and Socrates's stomping ground northwest of the Acropolis. Stroll the PLAKA for souvenirs (or go just about anywhere in the city to shop for leather and jewelry).
Another popular destination is the top of MOUNT LYCABETTUS for a panoramic view of landmarks, the sea and mountains. In the evening, take in an open-air performance at the ancient HEROD ATTICUS THEATER at the base of the Acropolis, or sample the night life that often goes until dawn.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Newest Balkan State in a State of Stress 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: BIJELO POLJE, Montenegro 

 BODY:
On paper, the newest nation in Europe is a single country that combines the two former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro. But the theory is not quite reality, as a trucker, Milorad Zarkovic, 40, said his 24 tons of watermelons prove. 
 He had been waiting for over two hours, as the driver of one of 15 trucks idling at what is undeniably a border crossing here between Serbia and Montenegro. There were inspectors, baffling mountains of paperwork, a guardhouse with the word "customs" written on it -- all of which make it tougher to cross inside this nation than to cross an international border between, say, France and Germany. 
 "You have to go through six customs posts if you want to go from Serbia to Montenegro -- and it takes six days," he complained. He corrected himself: there are actually eight customs stops round trip. 
Six months after the country of Serbia and Montenegro was created from the carcass of Yugoslavia, there seems a growing frustration with this experiment in Balkan unity, a mounting sense that it is just not working very well. Diplomats and politicians on both sides increasingly acknowledge that progress is slow and that the country may not live out its three-year trial run, after which there is scheduled to be a referendum on whether to continue as one country.
"Yes, it is difficult," conceded Jan Willem Blankert, a top official in Belgrade with the European Union, which has been pushing unification of Serbia and Montenegro most strongly. "I give it less than a 50 percent chance."
While many in Serbia and Montenegro would like to keep the countries together, it is the outside world -- mostly the European Union and to some degree the United States -- that forced the trial unification. 
The worry is largely about the precedent. If tiny Montenegro, with just 650,000 people, were to go its own way, so too could more problematic areas with separatist leanings: Kosovo, where Albanians wanted to leave Serbia after the war there in 1999; Serb-dominated areas of Bosnia; perhaps even Albanian areas of Macedonia, where fighting broke out just two years ago.
That fragmentation, the argument goes, could spell a return to war, and so in March 2002, European Union officials arm-twisted the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro into an agreement to try out a single country for three years. The agreement was formalized in February. 
But, increasingly, politicians and intellectuals on both sides say the process is making the future more difficult. The complaints are growing loudest in Serbia, which has traditionally favored unification. Now many politicians say the drive is distracting from the much more important goal of joining the European Union, which is seen by many here as the only real route to normalcy after a decade of devastating war.
The European Union is reportedly demanding greater "harmonization" between the two republics as a condition to starting talks for joining. But Serbian politicians complain that their Montenegrin counterparts, led by pro-independence forces, are dragging their feet.
"In my view, it should be one country," said Miroljub Labus, a former federal deputy prime minister and the leader of a reformist political party, G-17 Plus. "But, you know, there is no political determination in Montenegro for that. The reality is that we have two states with a very weak connection."
So far, he and others say, there has been little progress toward merging the two nations. They just got a flag, but there is no national anthem, and Serbian officials still check passports on flights from Montenegro. Some headway has been made in the army and in cutting some tariffs. But the most difficult tariff issues remain unsettled along with others involving the judiciary, communications and energy. 
Serbia also needs foreign investment, something Mr. Labus said was less likely to happen in an already unstable country that does not even have fixed borders. And he said he was not sure Serbia should wait the three years specified in the union agreement before deciding whether to be one country or two.
"Whatever the outcome, whatever the solution, the sooner the better," he said. "I really do think time is of the essence. The economy is ruined. People are unemployed. We can't wait."
Like much in the Balkans, the history of the new country of Serbia and Montenegro is complicated. Though Serbs and Montenegrins share a language and the Orthodox Catholic faith, and so are perhaps the most similar of the six old Yugoslav republics, their ties have often been strained. 
In the late 1990's, the West supported the separatist leader Milo Djukanovic, now the prime minister, as a way to put pressure on the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic. 
By the time Mr. Milosevic, now on trial for war crimes in The Hague, fell in October 2000, Montenegro was already largely an independent country, if a flawed one. It has been criticized as a hotbed of smuggling of people and cigarettes, with Mr. Djukanovic himself cited in several international lawsuits about cigarette smuggling, an allegation he denies. 
Further clouding the picture is the fact that Montenegrins themselves are deeply divided between those who support independence and those who oppose it. The union is supported for various reasons, from nostalgia about Yugoslavia to worries that Montenegro, which makes and grows very little, is just too small to support itself alone. 
But politically, many of the forces for unification are also opposed to Mr. Djukanovic, whom they accuse of supporting independence as a distraction from his supposed corruption. 
Dragisa Pesic, a leader in the Socialist People's Party, which opposes independence, said he detected a shift recently among Serbian politicians and diplomats against unification, and he said the West needed to step up pressure on Mr. Djukanovic. But there are many questions about what will happen next. 
Most experts doubt that Mr. Djukanovic will try for an early referendum so as not to anger the European Union. But they expect him to move quickly afterward.

HEADLINE: LEADER OF LIBERIA SURRENDERS POWER AND ENTERS EXILE 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Charles G. Taylor, a star player in this country's 14 years of sporadic civil war, resigned from the presidency today and left his country for exile in Nigeria.
 "History will be kind to me," Mr. Taylor said, addressing the crowd in a sweltering second-floor room inside the Executive Mansion that had been packed for the ceremony with Liberian politicians, three African heads of state and foreign journalists. "I have accepted this role as the sacrificial lamb." 
 Sounding alternately bombastic, chipper and defiant, Mr. Taylor, 55, as usual likened himself to Jesus, blamed international forces for his downfall and challenged the United States in particular to step in, now that he had done his part. President Bush called on Mr. Taylor to leave Liberia more than two months ago and made his exit a condition for any American involvement in peacekeeping here.
Dressed in white, Mr. Taylor handed over the presidency to his longtime ally and vice president, Moses Z. Blah. Mr. Blah will steer the country until a new transitional government takes over in mid-October, President John Kufuor of Ghana announced today.
Mr. Taylor, accused of spreading conflict across the region, has been under a United Nations arms embargo and has been charged with playing a role in the civil war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
"I want to thank Mr. Bush, even though we have had some disagreements," Mr. Taylor said, adding that he was confident that as a Christian, Mr. Bush would soon see the truth. 
"He's been misled," he offered. "God will reveal the truth to him."
The White House, under competing pressure for and against intervention to restore security to this crushed nation founded by Americans 150 years ago, has yet to decide to what extent it will engage in Liberia. 
Three American warships appeared on the horizon here today, apparently more for show than anything else at the moment. Two helicopters hovered from a warship to ferry supplies to the American Embassy this afternoon.
"Today's departure of Charles Taylor from Liberia is an important step toward a better future for the Liberian people," Mr. Bush said in remarks this afternoon in Aurora, Colo. "The United States will work with the Liberian people and with the international community to achieve a lasting peace after more than a decade of turmoil and suffering."
It was not clear when the Americans, or the West African peacekeepers who are already on the ground here, would secure the vital Free Port of Monrovia to open the lifeline for food and fuel to the rest of the city. The port is in the hands of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, a rebel group. 
In Washington this afternoon, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the commander of the Marine Expeditionary Unit off Liberia's coast would come ashore, probably on Tuesday, to discuss how to assist in getting aid supplies into the port.
"They have agreed to leave upon a turnover," Mr. Powell said of the rebels, adding that the West African mission in Liberia "will be in the lead." 
"The United States is there to see how we can assist them," he said.
Monrovians rushed to the beach at the first sight of the American ships late this afternoon. They stared out at the sea, anxious and hopeful. 
"We eat something now," said an optimistic Koko Wreh, 40, a resident of the rebel-held side of the city who was seeking shelter in an overflowing building on the government side.
"I'm tired of fighting," said Johnson B. Sulonteh, 20, a government soldier sitting on sandbags near the beach. "I'm ready to go back to school."
Peace talks between government and two rebel factions have been under way in Ghana's capital, Accra, for more than two months.
"The war in Liberia has ended," said Mr. Kufuor, the Ghanian president. 
Mr. Kufuor, who currently leads the regional bloc known as the Economic Community of West African States, escorted Mr. Taylor and his family to Nigeria this afternoon. Waving a white handkerchief to a crowd that rushed onto the tarmac to wave and weep, Mr. Taylor boarded a Nigerian government jet. West African officials said he was bound for the capital, Abuja. The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, had offered Mr. Taylor a safe haven. 
The first of 3,250 West African troops have begun arriving in Monrovia, but so far have done little more than erect checkpoints near the Executive Mansion. A United Nations peacekeeping force is expected to take over this fall. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, at the handover ceremony today, pledged to contribute troops.
"It has indeed been a shameful thing that as Africans, we have killed ourselves for such a long time," he said. "It is indeed time this war should come to an end."
Mr. Taylor's exit, while it closes one page in Liberia's sad history, also paves the way for new challenges. The warring parties must agree on an interim government before elections can be held. The port must be opened and desperately needed aid delivered. Soldiers on both sides must be offered reasons not to pick up their guns again. 
Before anything, the fighters who still control their patches of the city, on opposite sides of a set of strategic bridges, must be told what to do. Confusion reigned today after Mr. Taylor's resignation, as rebels in Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, known as L.U.R.D., pranced on their part of what is called the New Bridge, and began taunting the government side's chief. Shots were fired in the air. 
Then, throngs of civilians from both sides tried to press through, meeting again midway, only to driven back by the gun-toting youths who rule each side. Neither side had agreed to open up the bridges. 
A commander on the government side, Gus Menwon, said he was awaiting orders. His men were asking him who would take care of them now. Asked if reconciliation was possible, he first waxedoptimistic, saying many fighters on the other side were his friends. But then, he added, "It's hard to trust human beings." 
shots were fired in the air jubilantly this afternoon, after news came of Mr. Taylor's exit. Around sundown, chaos erupted for a little while, as rebel fighters started shooting in the air to blow off steam, witnesses said. Apparently, two of their men had been executed for killing civilians.
"For us in L.U.R.D., the war is over," said the rebels' secretary general for civilian administration, Sekou Fofana.
The rebels had been rankled by the choice of Mr. Blah as president, preferring someone they considered more neutral. Today, Mr. Blah, 56, reiterated his invitation to the rebels to join the interim government. "Let the nation begin to heal," Mr. Blah said. "Let all of us unite as one people and work to peace."

HEADLINE: Medicare Fees For Physicians In Line for Cuts 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials say they expect to cut Medicare payments to doctors by 4.2 percent next year unless Congress passes legislation to reduce or eliminate the cut.
 In a proposed rule to be published on Friday, the administration says the cut is required by the existing Medicare law. Many doctors and some members of Congress disagree. 
 Medicare officials said that Congress could avert the cut as part of legislation to add drug benefits to Medicare, the health insurance program for 40 million elderly and disabled people. But there is no guarantee that Congress will finish work on the legislation before Jan. 1, when the cut is to take effect. 
Administration officials said the cut in Medicare payments to doctors would not harm beneficiaries or hurt their ability to obtain care.
But doctors said the new cut, after a 5.4 percent cut last year, would give them a fresh incentive to limit the number of elderly patients.
"Physicians want to keep treating Medicare patients, but there comes a point where it is just not economically reasonable," Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, president of the American Medical Association, said.
Maureen K. Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Family Physicians, said that more than one-fifth of family doctors were not accepting new Medicare patients.
Marilyn Moon, a health economist, said: "This needs a lot of vigilance. As yet, it's not a crisis. But it could quickly turn into one."
Doctors repeatedly express concern that Medicare payments are not keeping up with their costs.
Medicare has different formulas to pay doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers of care. The program reduces payments to doctors whenever Medicare spending for their services exceeds a goal, the "sustainable growth rate," linked to the nation's economic growth.
Medicare officials said the proposed cut for 2004 resulted from the fact that estimates of economic growth had declined below earlier projections, while the use of health care services by Medicare beneficiaries had grown more than expected.
The cut can be attributed to "slow growth in the economy and to a significant growth in physician outlays," the Department of Health and Human Services stated.
An independent federal panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, said last year that Congress should repeal the existing formula and replace it with a system that more accurately reflects doctors' costs.
The administration will accept public comments on its proposal until Oct. 7. It could change the proposal in the light of those comments or under pressure from Congress.
Doctors say that federal policies, including Medicare coverage for new services and diagnostic tests, have encouraged greater use of doctors' services, and that patients benefit.
The Senate and House Medicare bills provide prescription drug benefits costing roughly $400 billion over 10 years. 
John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said, "Every penny that's available should be used to improve the drug benefits." If Congress wants to increase payments to doctors, he said, it should do so in separate legislation.
In February, Congress spared doctors from a cut this year and decreed that they should receive a 1.6 percent increase in Medicare fees in 2003. Still, the cut last year and the proposed cut for 2004 mean that Medicare payments for a given service would be 8 percent lower next year than in 2001.
House Republicans, including two committee chairmen, Bill Thomas of California and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, say the proposed cut results in part from serious flaws in the payment formula. 
Like many doctors, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Tauzin say the Bush administration has the power to correct some of those flaws. The administration insists that it cannot make the changes without action by Congress.
The Medicare drug bill passed by the House would increase Medicare payments to doctors at least 1.5 percent a year in 2004 and 2005. 
The version passed by the Senate says that the payment formula is "fundamentally flawed" and that beneficiaries' access to care "may be compromised" if Congress does not intervene. The bill expresses the "sense of the Senate," but does not change the existing law.
House Republicans say the Bush administration has overstated the growth of Medicare spending on doctors' services by including amounts spent on certain prescription drugs furnished to patients in doctors' offices. Spending on these drugs has grown much faster than spending on doctors' services, they said.
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Tauzin and Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, have sent letters to the administration saying that drug costs should be removed from the calculation. Doctors "are being penalized for prescription drug price increases," the letter from Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Johnson said.
In their proposal, administration officials give doctors a slightly higher allowance for the cost of malpractice insurance. Doctors around the nation have reported sharp increases in malpractice premiums.

How One Hospital Benefited From Questionable Surgery

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Could it possibly be, Dr. Patrick Campbell wondered, that doctors at his hospital in Redding, Calif., were cracking open the chests of perfectly healthy people?
 Dr. Campbell, an internist, first suspected trouble in Redding Medical Center's cardiology program soon after joining the hospital in 1993, according to papers obtained by federal investigators. That year, one of his patients underwent open-heart surgery even after the surgeon told Dr. Campbell the procedure was unnecessary. Two years later, another patient received a coronary bypass, though the cardiologist's report said it was not necessary. 
 Then there were the numbers -- tens of thousands of diagnostic tests, thousands of surgical coronary procedures. The totals seemed more likely for a major university medical center than for a hospital in a rural community of about 90,000 people. 
Dismayed, Dr. Campbell brought his concerns to Stephen E. Corbeil, the hospital's chief executive at the time. Though Dr. Campbell declined to comment on the meeting and Mr. Corbeil did not return telephone calls, the papers obtained by federal investigators indicate that the administrator's response was succinct: The young internist, he said, should mind his own business. 
Ultimately, Dr. Campbell's concern proved to be everyone's business. Last week, the hospital's owner, Tenet Healthcare, agreed to pay $54 million to the government to resolve accusations that Redding Medical doctors conducted unnecessary heart procedures and operations on hundreds of healthy patients. Tenet did not admit any wrongdoing and agreed to cooperate with further investigations.
As disturbing as the accusations may be, there would have been a logic to what a patient called Redding's "little house of horrors" -- a logic born of the twisted finances of American health care, which may have made the hospital less willing to hear concerns about two of its highest-billing doctors.
Until federal agents raided Redding last fall, Tenet's business model was based on maximizing the dollars it could collect from Medicare, the nation's biggest buyer of health care. And Medicare's complex formulas -- the template for private insurers, as well -- reward some kinds of health care more richly than others, and few more richly than cardiac care. 
So it was that two heart doctors at Redding -- Dr. Chae Hyun Moon, the chief cardiologist, and Dr. Fidel Realyvasquez, its top cardiac surgeon -- became immensely powerful, people who worked there said. Tenet promised investors growing profits, and at Redding, these people said, that required steady growth in cardiac care.
Together, Dr. Moon, who also sat on the hospital's board, and Dr. Realyvasquez directed the California Heart Institute, the cardiac program that Redding had started in the 1970's, and it proved to be a bonanza.
'We were constantly being pushed to bigger budgets, and there was no way to do it without the heart institute," one former Redding administrator said. "People were terrified that Moon would go on vacation, because of the effect a few days would have on the hospital's financial performance."
While few doubt the hospital would have responded to explicit evidence of problems in the heart program, like high death rates, the financial pressures created a disincentive to pursue less specific suspicions, people who worked at Redding said.
And there were many suspicions. Besides Dr. Campbell, more than half a dozen doctors, along with medical technicians and patients, expressed concerns to multiple administrators, according to people interviewed and records obtained by investigators. There were also questions of competence: one former executive said that two years ago, a representative of the company whose ultrasound machine Dr. Moon relied on for many of his diagnoses warned that he was misusing it. 
But the hospital never conducted the peer reviews that might have confirmed the critics' doubts.
"I sometimes just shake my head at the American system, where the financial intent is almost cleverly designed to create mischief," said Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health care economist. "For administrators, it creates a conflict of interest when they're trying to deliver the numbers at the same time that doctors are saying the hospital is doing too much cardiac surgery." 
Tenet's $54 million settlement with the government -- the largest ever for accusations of billing federal health programs for unnecessary care -- means that the company will not face criminal or civil charges. But the company has been upended by the scandal, the first in a series of events to raise questions about the company's finances. Numerous executives, including Jeffrey C. Barbakow, its longtime chief executive, have resigned, and its stock has lost almost three-quarters of its value.
A criminal investigation of Drs. Moon and Realyvasquez is continuing, though no charges have been filed. Their work at the heart institute has been suspended, and Dr. Moon has surrendered his medical license pending resolution of the matter. Lawyers for each of them say that, while other doctors' opinions about their decisions may differ, neither did anything illegal. 
"Certainly physicians can and do have differences of opinion," said Matthew Jacobs, a lawyer in Sacramento representing Dr. Moon. "But to base a fraud prosecution on such differences with no other evidence of fraud just doesn't work."
Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Dr. Realyvasquez, said that his client's decisions to operate were justified. "Dr. Realyvasquez is an outstanding, well qualified surgeon," Mr. Segal said. "He did everything he was supposed to do and believes that when he provided the surgery to the patients, it was needed." 
For its part, Tenet says that as part of its settlement with the government, it has imposed new checks and balances to ensure that no future problems could occur at Redding. Harry Anderson, a Tenet spokesman, said the company's new management had agreed to heighten monitoring and education programs "to rebuild the reputation and services of Redding Medical Center so it may continue to serve that community for years to come."
Meanwhile, there are hundreds of former patients of the two doctors who now must wonder whether there was any reason for their operations. They are like Shirley B. Wooten, 78, who sought care last year for back and arm pain. After several tests, she was told she needed emergency bypass surgery, which was conducted by Dr. Realyvasquez. Complications followed, and Mrs. Wooten, who loved to attend dances with her husband, Bob, and take long driving trips around the California countryside, can no longer write or walk steadily. An independent expert has deemed the surgery unnecessary, and she is suing.
"I had to quit my job to take care of her," Mr. Wooten said. 'Our lives came to a screeching halt after that surgery, I'll tell you."

Push for Higher Profits
By the winter of 1998, Redding Medical Center was virtually bursting at the seams. A conference room was converted into a patient care area. The emergency room was running over capacity.
"We were beyond full," one former administrator said. "We were flying."
That fiscal year, officials said, the hospital exceeded its budget for pretax profit by almost 50 percent, bringing in more than $50 million. And then at a budget meeting with senior Tenet officials, the order came down: Do better next year.
"We said 'We don't know how to do it unless we have extra capacity,' " the former administrator said. "They were pushing for what I thought was ridiculous financial results."
Tenet agreed to investmillions of dollars to complete rapidly the construction of a five-story addition to the hospital. People in town came to call it "the tower," a symbol of how a once sleepy hospital, founded by a single local physician in 1945, had truly entered the big time. 
The project only heightened Redding's dependence on Dr. Moon and the California Heart Institute. The son of a family practitioner, Dr. Moon told associates that his decision to become a doctor had been dictated to him by God when he was a boy. He graduated in 1972 from the Medical College at Yonsei University in Seoul, and completed his internship and residency at Metropolitan Hospital in New York. 
After setting up practice in Redding in the early 1980's, Dr. Moon rapidly developed a reputation for aggressively pursuing evidence of coronary disease. He also was known for being quick to recommend a cardiac catheterization, in which a small tube is passed through a blood vessel to examine how a patient's heart is working.
"His philosophy has always been if you know the anatomy of the diseased heart, you are going to be able to make informed decisions," said Dr. Bruce Kittrick, an internist at Redding who does not believe the accusations against Dr. Moon. "That is what made him really investigate anatomically most of the people he took care of."
That willingness to conduct catheterizations and other invasive procedures also helped fuel Dr. Moon's success within Redding Medical Center. Over time, he became one of the hospital's biggest money-makers, conducting more than 35,000 catheterizations during his years there, which other cardiologists say is easily many times the number that they would expect in such a time frame. 
In the last fiscal year he collected more from Medicare than all but one other cardiologist in Northern California, figures compiled by the program show, billing for almost $4 million in the 12 months ended June 30, 2002. In that year, Medicare records show, he billed for 876 catheterizations for the left side of the heart, at least four times the number performed by any of his colleagues in Northern California. 
By the early 1990's, Dr. Moon's success gave him enormous power in the organization. At one point, according to several Redding doctors, a former administrator and investigative records, Dr. Moon earned the reputation for having been instrumental in persuading Tenet to dismiss one of Redding's chief executives. The event, which became the stuff of hospital legend, only increased Dr. Moon's influence, said one former administrator.
"No one would ever want to take him on," he said. "Moon was Redding Medical Center, and he knew it."
Indeed, Dr. Moon became fond of making that point himself. "Who is Redding Medical Center?" he said in a recorded presentation in the mid-1990's. And then, participants said, Dr. Moon pointed to himself.
Administrators' pay grew if Redding's profits exceeded Tenet's expectations, so the financial performance of Dr. Moon, Dr. Realyvasquez and their cardiac program was reviewed intently. 
As part of a companywide procedure, Redding's chief financial officer prepared a report each month describing important events affecting the hospital's returns. 
"They noticed everything," one former administrator recalled. "If Moon's numbers were off a little bit, they asked about it."
In turn, Redding did all it could to keep its heart specialists happy. The hospital began an advertising campaign, with mailings and billboards that used tombstones and other images invoking death to persuade Redding residents to be checked for heart disease. It paid nurses to dictate charts for Dr. Moon, who colleagues and former administrators said made little time for record keeping. It sponsored golf tournaments to promote the heart institute, and sometimes offered Dr. Moon use of its helicopter to fly to the golf course, administrators and doctors said.
The doctors also received particular attention from senior Tenet executives, particularly Thomas Mackey and Neil Sorrentino, according to former Redding executives, doctors and documents obtained by investigators. Mr. Mackey was ultimately the chief operating officer of Tenet, while Mr. Sorrentino was the head of its California hospitals.
Topping it off were the financial rewards. Former Redding administrators said that, around 1997, Dr. Realyvasquez demanded and was given a lucrative contract, paying him huge sums of money.
"He told us the number he wanted, and we had to work backwards to figure out a way to get it to him," one administrator said. 
Normal checks and balances did not seem to apply to Dr. Moon, Redding physicians said. He was not only head of the cardiology program but also a hospital director. And though he was not board certified in cardiology or internal medicine -- a credential he dismissed as insignificant -- he was also head of the hospital's Cardiology Care Committee, in charge of conducting peer review of his own program's quality of care. 
Court records say that committee rarely, if ever, met.

Others Saw Trouble Signs
Across town, Redding's chief rival, Mercy Medical Center, also took admissions from Dr. Moon. But the staff there was far less impressed with him. 
In 1996, one of his patients at Mercy, Charles K. Brown, a 67-year-old man from Anderson, Calif., suffered a stroke while Dr. Moon was performing a catheterization and soon died. Staff members in Mercy's catheterization lab complained to the hospital's medical division, saying that Dr. Moon's care had fallen below appropriate standards.
According to court records, the staff members said that Dr. Moon left the hospital while the patient was unstable, leaving nurses without clear instructions. A review of the medical chart found no indication that Dr. Moon had taken basic preparatory steps to ensure that Mr. Brown was well enough for the procedure, according to written findings of the medical division. 
As a result, the medical division ruled that Dr. Moon would have to be monitored by another doctor.
"Leaving the nurses to deal with the complication was inappropriate and a serious quality of care issue," read a letter to Dr. Moon from the medical division. 'You will not jeopardize patient safety."
Dr. Moon objected, saying in a letter that he had alerted Mr. Brown's other doctors to his problems and had been assured they were handling his care. The division revised its decision, saying that the monitoring would be limited to two cases and that a letter would be placed in his file. Dr. Moon struck back, announcing in an advertisement in the local newspaper that he would no longer admit patients to Mercy. He then sued the hospital, claiming defamation and financial harm. The suit was later dismissed.
About the same time, Dr. Campbell, the internist, brought his concerns about Redding Medical Center's heart program to Mr. Corbeil, then the hospital's chief executive. 
Dr. Campbell arrived at Redding in 1993 and quickly benefited from Dr. Moon's influence; the cardiologist helped him and three other doctors form a group practice, and pledged that Tenet would provide more than $100,000 toward the group's start-up costs.
The sameyear, Dr. Campbell's worries about the heart center began.. Dr. Moon recommended that a patient, Mary Rosburg, receive immediate coronary surgery, according to papers obtained by federal investigators. A surgeon working with Dr. Realyvasquez telephoned Dr. Campbell, vehemently arguing that no surgery was needed. Dr. Moon's view prevailed, and the once-reluctant surgeon performed the operation. Ms. Rosburg died from complications several months later. 
In 1995, another of Dr. Campbell's patients, Emma Jean Montgomery, came under the care of Dr. Moon's team. An associate of Dr. Moon informed Dr. Campbell that the patient had severe coronary disease and needed immediate surgery, which Dr. Realyvasquez performed. Afterward, when Dr. Campbell reviewed the medical chart, he found none of the evidence of serious heart problems that Dr. Realyvasquez had described, according to records obtained by federal investigators. 
Dismayed, Dr. Campbell took Ms. Montgomery's records to another local cardiologist, Dr. Roy Ditchey, who was astounded to hear that the patient had undergone surgery, according to information obtained by federal investigators. 
It was then that Dr. Campbell approached Mr. Corbeil, but the administrator dismissed his concerns, papers obtained by the investigators say. Dr. Campbell, who still practices in Redding, has since filed a suit on behalf of the government, under the federal whistle-blower statute, which remains under seal.
 When faced with credible concerns about a program, health care experts said, it is commonplace in the hospital industry to bring in an outside group to conduct a review.
"Most hospital administrators are very responsible," said Evelyn Baram-Clothier, executive director of the American Medical Foundation for Peer Review and Education. "I have administrators who call us to review departments just to be sure they're O.K."
In the fall of 1996, Mr. Corbeil was succeeded by Kenneth Rivers. The following spring, according to court documents and records obtained by federal investigators, a group of doctors including Dr. Campbell, Dr. Kittrick and two others approached him to discuss the cardiac program. 
According to the papers, Dr. Kittrick spoke for the group and asked for an independent peer review of the cardiology program, to determine if the catheterizations were reliable. Mr. Rivers replied that he would have to ask Tenet's lawyers whether such a study would violate patient confidentiality, the records say.
No such study was ever done, according to doctors at the hospital.
As new administrators arrived, the same pattern was repeated. According to court papers and other records, Dr. Roy Pick, a local cardiologist, approached Mr. Rivers's successor, Stephen Schmidt, and Mr. Schmidt's replacement, Hal Chilton, the current chief executive. Each time, Dr. Pick, who had reviewed the records of some of Dr. Moon's patients, raised concerns about the heart program and asked for an independent peer review. None was undertaken.
Dr. Pick and Mr. Chilton did not return calls seeking comment. A phone number for Mr. Schmidt, who has since retired, could not be located. Phone numbers found through a computer search for Mr. Phillips, Mr. MacKay and Mr. Sorrentino were all disconnected. 
Dr. Thomas Drakes, a board-certified oncologist who worked at Redding for two decades and taught at the University of California at Davis, said he, too, raised his concerns with Mr. Schmidt, with little result. 
"Here I am, a guy on his staff who has some credibility, and I go to Schmidt and tell him he's going to have a '60 Minutes' episode on your hands here if you don't do something," Dr. Drakes said. "He just said, 'Don't worry about it.' "
But, by 2002 the secrets at Redding Medical Center were about to burst into public view.

Differing Diagnoses
Last year, the Rev. John Corapi decided, at 55, to have a cardiac stress test at Redding. He passed the test, but Dr. Moon still suggested a trip to the catheterization lab. 
While Father Corapi, a Roman Catholic priest, was still on the table, Dr. Moon broke the news: He needed an emergency triple bypass. According to Father Corapi, the doctor said he had three dissecting arteries, a critical condition. Still, Dr. Moon suggested waiting for surgery until the next week, when Dr. Realyvasquez returned. 
Anxious, Father Corapi said that he telephoned a friend in Las Vegas, Joseph F. Zerga, an accountant who had close contacts with a cardiac unit at a local hospital. He persuaded Father Corapi to come to Nevada for the emergency surgery.
But when he got to Las Vegas, the heart specialists were confused. "While I was being processed in, the cardiologist there said, 'Excuse me, what are we bypassing?' " said Father Corapi, who, like Dr. Campbell, has filed a whistle-blower suit. 
Back in Redding, Father Corapi and Mr. Zerga met with hospital officials, who said that two cardiologists had reviewed the records and agreed with Dr. Moon's findings, though they declined to name the doctors. "I expected the hospital to be extremely concerned over this situation," Mr. Zerga said. "But they weren't."
When further discussions with the hospital proved unsatisfactory, Mr. Zerga contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Within days, agents found their way to Robert G. Simpson, a lawyer in Redding for whom Dr. Moon had recommended a four-way bypass last summer. Mr. Simpson had challenged Dr. Moon's diagnosis after getting a second and a third opinion. Mr. Simpson has since been interviewed by federal investigators and is now representing numerous patients suing Redding. 
Four months after being contacted about Father Corapi, federal agents raided the hospital. 
For Tenet, it was as if the roof were suddenly falling in. 
Near the time of the Redding raids, the company was hit with other financial body blows that raised the same question: Was Tenet really as successful as it had long appeared? Or had it just profited from multiple methods -- including unnecessary surgery at Redding -- of gaming the Medicare system? 
On Oct. 28, Kenneth Weakley, an analyst with UBS Warburg, reported that Tenet was heavily dependent on special Medicare payments for particularly sick patients. These "outlier" payments accounted for about 24 percent of Tenet's base Medicare payments for overnight stays, Mr. Weakley wrote, triple the amount three years earlier.
That same day, the federal Department of Health and Human Services notified Tenet that it would be auditing its hospitals to see if the company had been improperly manipulating its outlier payments. The company failed to disclose the information publicly for more than a week, later saying it had waited until it had more specifics. (The overpayment allegations were not covered by the $54 million settlement.) 
As the events unfolded, the nature of the outlier problem became clear. Tenet hospitals had been rapidly increasing their retail charges -- amounts actually paid by very few people who have procedures without insurance. But those numbers are used in determining outlier amounts. In essence, Medicare was paying Tenet more for treating sicker people, when in fact all Tenet was doing was charging higher prices.
Under pressure from investors, Tenet in early November disclosed that it received $763 million in outlier payments in the 2002 fiscal year, much of it from 11 hospitals that had ramped up retail charges. Seven of those 11 hospitals are in California.
Among that group is Redding Medical Center. According to federal data, outlier payments to Redding were off the charts. Medicare projected that it would pay 5.1 percent of its total standard payments for inpatient care at all hospitals to outliers. At Redding, in fiscal 2002, the payments instead reached 118.6 percent, or $55.7 million.
Indeed, the problems at Redding seem to infuse the repeated scandals at Tenet. Two of the company's biggest allies of Dr. Moon and Dr. Realyvasquez were soon gone. Mr. Mackey, the company's chief operating officer, left in November amid reports that he was an architect of the company's pricing strategy. Then, in March, Mr. Sorrentino, head of the company's California hospital operation, also departed. 
As the scandals unwound, with pricing strategies changing and the cardiac program suspended, Redding's finances fell apart.
According to data filed with the State of California, total net patient revenue at Redding for the first quarter of this year (the latest data available) dropped almost in half from the period last year, falling from $61.1 million to $31.2 million. All told, more than 75 percent of that decline came from the drop in Medicare payments, which fell by $23 million.
Indeed, the numbers at Redding raise questions about how problems at the hospital could have been missed. The state filings show, in the 12 months ended June 30, 2002, Redding Medical Center generated pretax net income of $94 million, more than any other of Tenet's 40 hospitals in California. Just down the street, the larger Mercy Medical Center reported pretax net income of about $5 million in the same period. 
"When those types of numbers get reported back to the home office, does everyone stay willfully blind and declare a holiday, or does someone say, 'Let's postpone the celebration and take a hard look at these,' " said Neil Getnick of Getnick & Getnick, which specializes in business integrity counseling. "Part of business integrity is creating reasonable expectations amongst shareholders of what kind of profits you can achieve, and what we have seen with Tenet indicates that the company departed from that basic model."
In that, analysts say, is the essence of the problem. Different hospitals can be run more efficiently, but ultimately, health care is a commodity; the science available at one hospital is the same across the street. The industry itself is more than a century old. Yet Wall Street expects and rewards double-digit earnings growth from hospital companies, something analysts say is unsustainable. 
"The hospital industry is by its very nature a mature industry," said Mr. Reinhardt, the Princeton economist. "It is not a high-margin business. It can't be a growth industry like some Internet company. That is just unreasonable."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about accusations of unnecessary heart procedures and surgery at Redding Medical Center in California misidentified the surgeon who performed an operation on Shirley B. Wooten, a former patient who has filed a lawsuit. The surgeon was a partner of Fidel Realyvasquez, not Dr. Realyvasquez himself. Federal investigators are examining the practices of several heart specialists at the hospital.

HEADLINE: AUTOMAKERS DROP SUITS ON AIR RULES 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are dropping lawsuits against California over a landmark clean-air regulation that requires the production of millions of low-emission cars and trucks over the next decade and a half.
 The move creates a temporary but momentous environmental truce between the auto industry, which has blocked the zero-emission vehicle mandate that was set in motion in 1990, and California, which wields enormous influence over the global industry. 
 The threat of the Z.E.V. mandate, as it is known in the trade, spurred the development of hybrid vehicles, which supplement gasoline with electric power. Now, with the dropping of the legal challenge -- unless other hurdles emerge -- every major automaker will have to start selling a range of vehicles with low emission levels of smog-forming pollutants, like hybrids and specially modified gas cars, in a plan that will phase in such vehicles in California between 2005 and 2020. 
Automakers will also have to sell tens of thousands of zero-emission vehicles, either battery-powered cars or, far more likely in the long term, vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells. 
"Given the fact that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, the companies with most concern about the regulation, have come to agreement," said Dr. Alan C. Lloyd, the chairman of the California Air Resources Board, "I'm hoping it spells a new era of working more effectively together."
G.M. -- which sells some high-emission vehicles like Hummers, Cadillac Escalades and Chevrolet Suburbans -- withdrew from the battle as part of an effort to enhance its environmental image that included a previous announcement that it would sell hybrids.
But it has also been reassured by recent steps of California regulators. The state amended its requirements in April to emphasize more low-emission and fewer zero-emission cars. In recent weeks, coinciding with negotiations over the suits, the air board expanded its credit system for hybrids to include a wider variety of vehicles.
Elizabeth Lowery, G.M.'s vice president for the environment and energy, said: "One thing we've been working hard on is getting credit for all the things we do, but people are focusing on the litigation in California. We think we have enough flexibility in this rule in order for us to put this litigation behind us."
A spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler, Ann Smith, said "we've had constructive discussions regarding the settlement" but declined to elaborate. The two big auto companies had filed their lawsuits jointly, but no other major manufacturer took part.
The industry and the state could soon clash again. Last year, California passed the nation's first legislation aimed at limiting automotive emissions of greenhouse gases, and a legal challenge is seen as a strong possibility. 
Dr. Lloyd said the greenhouse-gas law was pointedly not a topic of debate while the two sides were negotiating. "We stayed very much away from that," he said, adding, "It's our hope that we will be able to work together on the greenhouse-gas regulation."
Ms. Lowery of G.M. said: "We don't think mandates are a good idea. The resolution of this does not change that position." She added that "the industry will challenge any regulation that is pre-empted by federal law." 
The zero-emissions mandate was challenged in court on the ground that parts of it went beyond matters of vehicle emissions and tried to supersede federal authority to set fuel economy standards; a Bush administration filing supported the suit. 
The industry could have a stronger case on greenhouse-gas emissions, because they are directly correlated to fuel economy. Emissions of smog-forming pollutants can be filtered by catalytic converters.
California is the largest auto market, and is particularly influential because its air standards predated the federal Clean Air Act. The state thus sets it own air standards and other states can choose California's tougher rules over federal regulations. Northeastern states that have followed California on air-quality standards, like New York and Massachusetts, have previously announced plans to adopt their own versions of the zero-emissions regulation. That will mean that advanced-technology vehicles will be more widely available there.
The zero-emissions mandate was introduced in the early 1990's, intended to spur development of battery-powered cars, which the industry now sees as a dead end. Many automakers, though, have built up credits by selling a variety of such vehicles, from gussied-up golf carts to an electric version of Toyota's RAV4 sport utility. 
The current zero-emissions rule is focused more squarely in the long term on fuel-cell cars, which are electric cars with an onboard power system that generates electricity through a chemical reaction involving hydrogen. Fuel-cell cars emit only water vapor, though producing hydrogen leads to varying emissions. 
The Bush administration has also talked up the promise of hydrogen, even in the State of the Union address, but has so far restricted its activity to financing research. 
Automakers are also working on more immediate technologies to cut emissions, from hybrids to advanced diesels to improved internal combustion engines, and any one of them could play a role in meeting the zero-emissions mandate.
"Basically, we're talking about a giant technological horse race here and everyone's hoping their horse is Seabiscuit," Gary Cowger, G.M. president of North American operations, said last week. 
He added that G.M., like other automakers, was hedging bets by developing a variety of prototypes. The settlement coincides with G.M.'s demonstration of many of its green vehicles at Dodger Stadium this week. Earlier this year, it announced a plan to start selling hybrid vehicles of various types, the most ambitious being a hybrid version of its Saturn Vue sport utility in 2005. Toyota and Honda already sell hybrids. G.M. has also been bullish on the fuel cell. 
Environmental advocates said the prospect that the zero-emissions mandate would take effect after so many years of regulatory limbo would keep California well ahead of the federal government. Their frustration with Washington and Detroit has grown along with sport utility sales. In the 2002 model year, the fuel economy of the average new American passenger vehicle reached a 22-year low.
"The Bush administration has been talking about a fuel-cell vision; California is actually delivering on one," said Jason Mark, director of the clean-vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
"It's encouraging that G.M. has decided tojoin the fight for clean air in the state," he added. 
Such groups remain wary of G.M., however. "By suing California on environmental laws and building Hummers, they seem like they're in a race to the bottom to be seen as the worst environmental auto company," said Roland Hwang, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Dropping the suit "removes a real black eye for the company," he added, "but that's a far different thing from saying it will enhance their image."
In California, other factors could influence the regulatory landscape, like the gubernatorial recall campaign. It features Arnold Schwarzenegger, the biggest celebrity booster of G.M.'s Hummer, and the columnist Arianna Huffington, an outspoken basher of sport utilities who has likened the current campaign to "the hybrid versus the Hummer." 
A new governor would have the power to replace Mr. Lloyd. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger, though, may have an affinity for fuel-cell-boosting regulation. In "Terminator 3," his friendly cyborg character informs the audience that he is powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Unfortunately, the cells have a tendency to rupture and explode, like everything else in the movie.
Dave Barthmuss, a G.M. spokesman asked for comment, replied, "Those aren't G.M.-designed."

HEADLINE: The Carnegie-Philharmonic Ballet; 
You Can't Tell the Players Without a Program

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
As the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall hammer out the details of a merger, inevitable conflicts over artistic, managerial and financial control may only be intensified by the many strong personalities involved.
 From Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to the opera diva Beverly Sills, from the financial mogul Sanford I. Weill to the orchestra chairman Paul B. Guenther, the cast of characters includes many of New York's most influential public figures, each with different interests. 
 The two sides have yet to submit their plans to the New York attorney general's office, which, to guard against an antitrust violation, has the power to approve or reject the reunion of the two charitable institutions in 2006 after 41 years. A Philharmonic board meeting is scheduled for today. 
What follows, drawn from nearly a dozen interviews, is a close look at the various players involved and what their stakes may be in this effort to rejoin two of the most important cultural institutions in the country.

The Mayor
Although he has maintained his distance, Mayor Bloomberg clearly has an interest in the outcome, both as a public official and as a private philanthropist. The city owns Carnegie Hall and parts of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, including the New York State Theater, where the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera perform.
Both Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall are members of the Cultural Institutions Group, 34 arts organizations that are owned by the city or are on city land and that receive public money for operations and construction. The city gave $34.7 million toward the cost of Carnegie's new Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, for example, and $24 million to Lincoln Center for its redevelopment project so far.
In his charitable giving Mr. Bloomberg has contributed generously to both institutions. Before he was elected he gave $15million to Lincoln Center's redevelopment and was on the board. The 97 charities listed on the mayor's most recent tax return included both the Carnegie Hall Society and Lincoln Center. As mayor Mr. Bloomberg is now on both boards.
Mr. Bloomberg would not comment for this article, officials said, as he waits for the two sides to come to terms.
Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, said the city was being kept up to date on the merger talks. "Carnegie Hall is a city-owned building, so as both organizations know we would need to review any substantial changes to the way it is administered," she said.
Although Mr. Weill, chairman of Carnegie Hall, initially said the mayor had given the merger his blessing, city officials call that an overstatement. Mr. Bloomberg has both an official and a personal interest in the vibrancy of Lincoln Center, the officials say, which many say will be hurt by the orchestra's departure.
The mayor has friends at Lincoln Center, including Ms. Sills, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera and former chairwoman of Lincoln Center, and Nathan Leventhal, a former president of the center who is still on the board and who led Mr. Bloomberg's transition team.
His right hand for cultural activities, Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris, is also close to Diane M. Coffey, a Lincoln Center trustee. The two worked together in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch -- Ms. Coffey was chief of staff, Ms. Harris assistant to the mayor -- along with Ms. Levin, who helped Ms. Coffey run the cultural affairs department for a while after Bess Myerson stepped down as commissioner.
This group is also close to Gordon J. Davis, the former president of Lincoln Center, founding chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center and a former parks commissioner. Mr. Davis was also a member of Mr. Bloomberg's transition team, along with Ms. Coffey and Jerry I. Speyer, a developer on the Carnegie board.
The city was a strong presence at a Lincoln Center fund-raiser in April in honor of Ms. Sills. In addition to Ms. Harris, Ms. Coffey and Ms. Levin, those who attended the event included Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker; Joel Klein, the schools chancellor; and Robert B. Tierney, the chairman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Should the two sides have difficulty coming to terms, the mayor's past behavior suggests that he might decide to step in, as he did with the Broadway musicians' strike in March. But Mr. Bloomberg will be wary of interfering with Mr. Weill, those involved say.

The Mogul
In bringing the Philharmonic to Carnegie Hall, Mr. Weill has achieved a cultural coup, arts executives agree, as he moves into the twilight of his professional career, having just announced his decision to step down as chief executive of Citigroup at the end of this year.
Mr. Weill's image has been damaged by New York State's prosecution of his company on conflict of interest charges, which led Mr. Weill to withdraw his nomination to the board of the New York Stock Exchange. The case ended in a negotiated settlement.
In another example of overlapping worlds, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer can have a say about the merger, a potential complication Mr. Weill did not know about when he negotiated the deal, a person close to the process said.
William Josephson, the assistant New York State attorney general in charge of charity oversight, withdrew from any role in the merger because his wife, Barbara Haws, is the Philharmonic's archivist and historian, and his former law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, represents the Philharmonic. (A merger is also subject to the approval of a state Supreme Court justice.)
Many of those involved in the deal have questioned Mr. Weill's ability to share power with the Philharmonic, given his reputation for dominating previous business mergers. Mr. Weill declined repeated requests to comment.
Still, in an interview, Ms. Sills called Mr. Weill "the ideal partner" and said fears of domination were unfounded.
"He is financially able to support and assist, and he certainly is not going to interfere with the artistic product," she said. "I think you have to separate the businessman from the man who is philanthropic."

The Power Couple
Many of those involved in the deal suggest that it was helped along by the strong friendship and business association of Mr. Weill and Mr. Speyer of Tishman Speyer properties, who is on Carnegie's executive committee and is married to Katherine G. Farley, an active member of the Philharmonic board.
Ms. Farley was recently appointed to the board of Lincoln Center Inc., the center's parent group, prompting some to question her loyalties. The Philharmonic has said Ms. Farley was instrumental in pursuing the merger. At the same time she was leading the Philharmonic's renovation plans for Avery Fisher Hall.
Although some Lincoln Center officials speak of a betrayal of the Philharmonic and are bitter about it, executives have said that Ms. Farley is not to blame.
The Carnegie board has many prominent directors like C. Michael Armstrong, Peter Jennings, Felix G. Rohatyn, Oscar de la Renta, Ronald O. Perelman and E. John Rosenwald, and nearly all appear to have lined up behind Mr. Weill.
The Philharmonic's board is not so famous. Among its members are Gerald M. Levin, former chairman of AOL Time Warner; Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey; Rita E. Hauser, an international lawyer; and the former schools chancellor, Rudolph F. Crew.
One reason that Mr. Guenther, the orchestra chairman, decided to pursue the Carnegie option after having initially and vehemently opposed it, people involved say, is that the Philharmonic board was unwilling or unable to provide enough money to redevelop Avery Fisher Hall.

The Orchestra Chairman
For his part, Mr. Guenther seems to have accepted the idea of stepping aside for Mr. Weill. In an earlier interview, he said, "If somebody says, 'You did a great job, and we're going to get a new chairman,' that's fine with me."
Mr. Guenther, who declined through a spokesman to be interviewed, became chairman of the orchestra in 1996 after resigning as president of the Paine Webber Group.
Some people involved describe Mr. Guenther as enthusiastic and able; others say he has lost the confidence of several trustees because he agreed to the merger before telling the full board or Lincoln Center's top officials.
"Paul was never authorized to make this deal," said someone connected to Lincoln Center. "He called the directors and said, 'We have a deal,' and they said, 'What deal?' "
In an interview Ms. Sills seemed unaware that the pursuit of a merger had been decided on by Mr. Guenther, Mr. Weill and their executive committees, that the rest of the board was informed only after the fact. "I really don't believe that happened," she said. "Nothing can be done without the approval of the full board. Not a decision like this. This is monumental."

The Executive Directors
Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's executive director, is widely expected to stay on as the primary force in programming at Carnegie Hall. But there is potential conflict with Carnegie's executive and artistic director, Robert J. Harth.
The Bombay-born Mr. Mehta, who also declined to be interviewed, comes from a musical family that includes his brother, Zubin, who was music director of the Philharmonic for 13 years until 1991.
If Mr. Mehta is unhappy with the merger, he may decide to leave the orchestra. He moved to the Philharmonic in 2000 from Chicago's Ravinia Festival after Deborah Borda resigned.
The merger also marks a decisive moment for Mr. Mehta's counterpart, Mr. Harth, who took over at Carnegie on Sept. 17, 2001. Mr. Harth, the son of two concert violinists, was the longtime chief executive of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado.
With the economic problems that followed Sept. 11, he had to delay the opening of Zankel Hall by a year, to September 2003. Now, poised to make his stamp on Carnegie Hall with Zankel's first season and his own programming decisions beginning to take effect on Carnegie's other two stages, Mr. Harth faces the prospect of yielding much of the hall's programming to the Philharmonic and possibly his own power to Mr. Mehta in 2006. Mr. Harth declined to comment.

The Chairman and the President
At Lincoln Center, Bruce Crawford, the chairman, and Reynold Levy, the president, are also just months into their jobs. They want to strengthen Lincoln Center even as it stands to lose City Opera, which plans to leave the New York State Theater it shares with the New York City Ballet, for its own new stage because of the acoustics.
Mr. Crawford hardly bargained for this kind of trouble, Lincoln Center executives say. Now 74, he took the job in June 2002 as a caretaker, to right the ship after the rocky first phase of the redevelopment project. He made his reputation as both president and general manager of the Met and as chairman of the Omnicom Group, the advertising conglomerate, a job he still has.
Mr. Levy, some argue,has more to prove. Despite previous positions as president of the International Rescue Committee, president of the AT&T Foundation and executive director of the 92nd Street Y, Lincoln Center is his most public stage. He took over after the short tenure of Mr. Davis, who clashed with Ms. Sills.
But Mr. Levy said his optimism about what he could accomplish had not been dimmed by the Philharmonic's expected departure. "The opportunity to reconsider, rethink, reframe the use of Avery Fisher Hall for the public and to program there as a tabula rasa is a one-time opportunity and extraordinarily exciting," he said.

The Diva and the General Manager
Since many executives on the Lincoln Center campus say Ms. Sills bears some responsibility for City Opera's decision to leave -- she aligned herself with the Met in opposing a new opera house on the premises and has disputed the company's acoustical complaints -- many assume she also played some role in the Philharmonic's potential departure.
If Ms. Sills had any effect, participants say, it was during her tenure as chairwoman of Lincoln Center, when she and the orchestra butted heads over issues like scheduling. The Philharmonic chafed at being a tenant, she said: "The Philharmonic always wanted to manage their own theater."
Similarly, several people inside and outside Lincoln Center suspect that the Metropolitan Opera was an important factor, since the Philharmonic has always played second fiddle to the richest and most powerful of Lincoln Center's 12 constituent groups.
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met, may have helped force the Philharmonic out, insiders say. Mr. Volpe opposed major changes to Avery Fisher Hall in early redevelopment discussions and clashed frequently with Mr. Guenther.
But Mr. Volpe said these conflicts were only part of the process. "They were being unrealistic in their thoughts about what could be done," he said. "But I never stood in the way."

HEADLINE: Bush Flies Over Fire Site to Promote 'Healthy Forests' 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush went on a helicopter tour today over a national forest hard hit by fires to promote a plan that he said would help control them, but that his critics said would allow excessive logging on federal land.
 From his vantage aboard Marine One, Mr. Bush gazed on the destruction caused by a fire in the Coronado National Forest that destroyed more than 300 houses in Summerhaven this summer. Later, Mr. Bush clambered up to Inspiration Rock, a granite outcropping in the Santa Catalina Mountains, and spoke in front of the charred remains of Ponderosa pines. 
 "Too many communities like this have known too many hardships that fire causes," Mr. Bush said. "We've got a problem in the country, a problem which has built up over decades and a problem we'd better fix before more people go through the grief the people of Summerhaven have gone through."
Mr. Bush's plan, the Healthy Forests initiative, is part of a summer push by the White House to show Mr. Bush as concerned about the environment, an issue of great importance to the swing voters he would need to be re-elected next year. Mr. Bush is to travel to California, Oregon and Washington this month to promote his environmental policies.
The Healthy Forests initiative, which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate, would let the Forest Service speed up the burning of underbrush and the thinning of trees on 20 million acres of federal land with the most severe risk of fire. Mr. Bush said today that removing the brush was in effect clearing the forest of highly combustible kindling that could turn small blazes into raging fires of such intensity that trees literally explode. 
"We need to thin our forests in America," the president said. "Our citizens must understand there are millions of acres of forests around this country that are vulnerable to catastrophic fires, because brush and small trees have been collecting for decades."
But the Healthy Forests legislation exempts some underbrush removal and thinning projects from environmental reviews. Many Democrats and environmental groups say the plan would make it too easy to remove older larger trees. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is a presidential hopeful, said today that the policy was nothing more than a gift to loggers.
"He's using the real need to clear brush and small trees from our forests as an excuse for a timber industry giveaway," Mr. Lieberman said in a statement. "Arizonans should make no mistake. This is logging industry greed masquerading as environmental need."
Environmentalists said the initiative did not address the real problem of the fires in Summerhaven, which was the need for more money.
"The administration's proposal neither focuses on communities nor provides additional funding to help make homes and towns safer across the West," William H. Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society, said in a statement. "Simply put, it will not help protect future Summerhavens from the risk of wildfire."
Mr. Bush said that his critics were wrong and that "any skeptic about what I'm talking about ought to come and talk to the people who know what they're talking about, who make a living fighting fires, who understand the devastation that is caused by backward forest policy."
Mr. Bush was accompanied by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who ran against him in the primaries in 2000. Today, Mr. Bush called Mr. McCain a common-sense conservative who knows that the United States can do better at managing national resources.
Later, Mr. Bush went to Aurora, Colo., for a fund-raiser for his re-election campaign at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum. Some 350 people attended the $2,000-a-plate dinner, which raised more than $1 million. The campaign has raised more than $40 million.
Mr. Bush delivered a version of the speech he has given since he started going to fund-raisers in June, an overview of what he considers accomplishments on national security, the economy, education and the elderly, among other issues.

HEADLINE: Bush Nominates Utah Governor To Lead Environmental Agency 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush today nominated Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, the three-term Republican governor of Utah, as the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, tapping a veteran of the West's volatile land use debates.
 The nomination drew praise from business and Republican Party groups and mixed reviews from environmental activists, who commended Mr. Leavitt for working for clean air in the Grand Canyon and faulted him for helping to open public lands in Utah to industry and roadbuilding. 
 If confirmed by the Senate, Governor Leavitt would succeed Christie Whitman, whose credentials as a political moderate failed to satisfy environmentalists and at the same time raised suspicions among White House officials. She resigned in May. 
"I selected Mike Leavitt because he is a trusted friend, a capable executive and a man who understands the obligations of environmental stewardship," Mr. Bush said today as he arrived in Denver for a fund-raising event. "Mike Leavitt will come to the E.P.A. with a strong environmental record, a strong desire to improve what has taken place in the last three decades."
Business interests portrayed Mr. Leavitt as a moderate consensus builder, while environmental groups, nationally and in Utah, said he supported development over conservation and was a friend of the oil and gas industries.
Mr. Leavitt, 52, said he had "a very clear environmental philosophy," which he said was based on balance.
"To me, there is an inherent human responsibility to care for the earth," he said as he stood by Mr. Bush's side. "But there's also an economic imperative that we're dealing with in a global economy to do it less expensively."
His Senate confirmation hearings, to be scheduled in September when Congress returns from its summer recess, will probably provide the stage for a politically charged battle over the Bush environmental record. Two Democratic senators who are presidential candidates made clear today they would use the hearings to denounce Mr. Bush on the environment.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said, "While none of us should be surprised that President Bush has chosen someone who has a record of working to undermine national environmental protections, the truth is that we aren't going to have a real commitment to the environment until we have a new president."
And Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said: "President Bush has the worst environmental record in history. The American people deserve to know whether Governor Leavitt shares the same disregard for clean air, clean water, land conservation and global warming as the president. Protecting our environment is too important -- and the damage done by the Bush administration too great -- to confirm a nominee that does."
The announcement was a well-kept secret: Mr. Leavitt's aides said they learned of it on Sunday night. It caught business interests and environmental groups by surprise, in part because Mr. Leavitt had turned down the post in June. At the time, Governor Leavitt's press secretary said that accepting it would be "highly problematic" because he was still considering whether to run for a fourth term. Already, fellow Republicans were lining up to challenge him.
Attention shifted to Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, Republican of Idaho, who had discussed the position with the White House. Friends said that Mr. Kempthorne preferred the position of interior secretary, though there is no indication that Gale A. Norton, the current secretary, is leaving the post.
The fact that Mr. Bush wasconsidering two Western governors and appears to be keeping Ms. Norton, who comes from Colorado, suggests he is more comfortable with a Western stamp on environmental policies. Westerners traditionally are more involved in issues of federal land use than in the kind of regulatory calibrations that are central to the E.P.A.
A person close to the administration said the selection of a Westerner -- in tune philosophically with Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney -- suggested the White House had "given up a little bit on the Eastern-industrial-urban-environmental base."
The person said that administration officials had believed they could mollify swing voters with Ms. Whitman, a moderate former governor of New Jersey. But, he said, she never managed to appease Mr. Bush's environmental critics, and that left some in the administration to wonder why they had bothered to try.
"So they went with someone they trust," he said of Governor Leavitt.
Governor Leavitt, first elected in 1992 and now the longest-serving of the nation's governors, has known Mr. Bush for years. At a recent fund-raising event in Salt Lake City, Mr. Cheney described him as "a very close friend of President Bush's from their days as governors."
The E.P.A. has undergone considerable turmoil, drawing fire from administration critics. After Ms. Whitman stepped down, her deputy, Linda Fischer, became acting administrator. But when it was clear to Ms. Fischer that she would not be named to the top job, she left, effective July 12. Marianne Horinko, another deputy, has served as acting administrator since then.
Mr. Bush's announcement of his selection of Mr. Leavitt came with no advance notice. Moreover, the selection did not appear to have been cleared with administration allies on Capitol Hill. As one top Republican Senate aide said, "It was a shock to us." 
In introducing Governor Leavitt today, Mr. Bush said: "As co-chair of the Western Regional Air Partnership, Governor Leavitt has been a leader in applying high standards in air quality, and he understand the importance of clear standards in every environmental policy. He respects the ability of state and local governments to meet those standards, rejects the old ways of command and control from above."
Thomas R. Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents utilities, praised Mr. Leavitt for a management style that "stresses collaboration of all stakeholders in policymaking, which helps break down barriers to resolving highly charged environmental issues."
Governor Leavitt cited his own work in bringing together 13 states, 13 tribal Indian nations, three federal agencies, the private sector and environmental groups in improving air quality in the Grand Canyon.
"There is no progress polarizing at the extremes, but there is great progress, there's great environmental progress, when we collaborate in the productive middle," he said. 
Fred Krupp, an environmental advocate and president of Environmental Defense, said that Mr. Leavitt had been "very good" in his efforts to protect scenic vistas and Western national parks from haze. "I'd call him a real leader in the West to address regional air issues and protect our national parks, and he deserves credit for that," he said.
But he and others gave him less credit for land issues. Most recently, Mr. Leavitt was involved in an agreement with the Interior Department over the protection of wilderness in Utah. Larry Young, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said that the arrangement essentially lost the "wilderness" designation for millions of acres of public land, opening them to mining, drilling and road-building.
In addition, he has advocated building a major highway through wetlands and sensitive shore areas around the Great Salt Lake. He has opposed the Kyoto treaty on global warming. Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said, "I can't think of too many governors more hostile to government regulations than Mike Leavitt."

A front-page article on Tuesday about President Bush's choice of Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency misspelled the surname of a former deputy in the agency. And because of an editing error, a correction yesterday referred incorrectly to her role there. The official is Linda Fisher, not Fischer. While she served briefly as acting administrator, she left the E.P.A. on July 12. (Marianne Horinko, another deputy, has held the job since then.)

HEADLINE: The Governor and the City 

 BODY:
Residents of New York City can be forgiven for sometimes thinking that Gov. George Pataki is out to get them. After Mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Mr. Pataki in the last election -- holding off dealing with the city's financial emergency until the governor was safely re-elected -- the mayor went to Albany for a payback. After cutting city services and raising city taxes, the mayor still needed funds to fix a crippling $6.4 billion budget gap. Mr. Bloomberg proposed that those who live in the suburbs and work in the city should pay their fair share of the cost of fire and police protection through a commuter tax. But the governor refused, snubbing the city and instead giving the suburbs what amounted to a bonus in special aid. 
 So the mayor and the Legislature came up with a less savory idea: a municipal bond deal that would save the city as much as $500 million a year by having the state take over debt incurred by the city in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, and stretching out the payments. Fiscally, it was a terrible plan -- as Comptroller Alan Hevesi has made clear. But it was at least a way for the state to help the city, its biggest economic engine. 
 Last week, just as the city prepared to sell these key bonds and its financial picture started to brighten, Mr. Pataki dragged in the storm clouds. A board controlled by the governor blocked the city's bond sale, calling it financially irresponsible. Mayor Bloomberg vowed to fight in the courts and the bond markets -- a prospect that sounds threatening to the city's and the state's financial well-being.
Late last week Mr. Pataki finally came up with a good first step toward a compromise on the bonding. It shortens the new bond issue to 10 years instead of 30, removing the possibility that the next generation of New Yorkers will still find themselves paying for a fiscal crisis that occurred before they were born. The governor also acknowledged, some say for the first time, that the state could pay for these bonds, at least in the beginning. But the lack of clear, firm commitments is understandably unnerving to the city, given Mr. Pataki's lack of reliability in the past. 
Still, Mr. Bloomberg should give Mr. Pataki a chance to work out a compromise. At a minimum, the governor should produce a plan in which the state clearly agrees to pay for the refinancing, but over a shorter period of time than the Legislature originally decreed. If that does not work, the best solution would still be for the commuters to pay a modest new tax for the city services they use.

HEADLINE: From Hewlett, Digital Cameras, Bells and Whistles 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Carleton S. Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, traveled 2,500 miles to do a pretty nifty imitation of Steven P. Jobs of Apple Computer, one of her Silicon Valley counterparts whoseshowmanship has made him even better known than Ms. Fiorina despite the fact that he runs a far smaller company.
 At a heavily promoted product introduction event yesterday in New York, Ms. Fiorina announced a great number of new Hewlett-Packard computers and digital imaging products with an expensive marketing campaign taken right from the pages of Mr. Jobs's playbook. As at Apple, where Mr. Jobs is chief executive, Ms. Fiorina said the hallmark of Hewlett's new product line would be simplicity, promising that she had heard consumers' demand for easy-to-use, low maintenance electronic devices. 
 But in contrast to Apple, with its narrow range of clearly delineated products, Hewlett offered a vast array of goods, with 158 variations, mostly things like laptop computers, printers and digital cameras aimed at the back-to-school and holiday shopping markets.
Ms. Fiorina, calling the event "the largest launch in our company's history," said Hewlett would spend $300 million to market its new product lineup.
"We have almost as many products as there are gubernatorial candidates in the California recall election," she joked. 
Hewlett may not have to face the number of challengers that Gov. Gray Davis does, but its own challenges are not insignificant.
Now that the company has achieved much of the cost savings from its merger last year with Compaq, its strategy for growth must rely more on increasing its revenue and market share, industry analysts said.
Whether Hewlett-Packard, a Palo Alto-based pioneer of Silicon Valley that has built itself into a consumer electronics giant on the strength of a highly lucrative franchise in computer printers, can make good on a promise of simplicity remains to be seen. In informal product demonstrations after Ms. Fiorina's speech, at least two had hitches and in one case a computer froze and had to be rebooted.
The challenge is compounded by a tough economic environment that has businesses in particular holding tight to purse strings.
But Jeff Clarke, Hewlett's executive vice president for global operations, said it was better positioned than many other technology companies -- with a strong presence in several fast-growing product categories, particularly digital imaging and photography. 
Dan Niles, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, reinforced that view, saying the array of products the company announced yesterday should put it in good position to gain customers.
"This should be terrific for them," he said, while warning that Hewlett would be hard pressed to maintain its earnings momentum without significantly increasing sales.
In her speech, Ms. Fiorina alluded to the Apple marketing theme "Think Different." She said Hewlett must go further in persuading consumers not just to "think different, but to rethink" how they use their digital equipment.
Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, said that "only a few companies can put all these things together," but he also remarked that until these products prove themselves in the marketplace, "this is lots of good propaganda."
The strongest product emphasis from Hewlett yesterday was on digital photography. Ms. Fiorina said that only 20 percent of people had switched from film-based cameras to digital, suggesting that the market could grow substantially. What has held it back, she said, is the difficulty of using a digital camera and downloading the images to a personal computer.
"For many, maybe for most, the digital experience has been anything but empowering," she said.
Among its array of products, Hewlett introduced four digital cameras, along with a desktop computer that comes with a camera docking station so that users can immediately load their pictures onto a hard drive.
But when the company showed off another product, intended to let users transfer images from a videocassette to a DVD, the demonstration proved less than seamless.
A Hewlett official, Dean Anderson, said the device "wouldn't recognize the video through the USB connector."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
A California New Music Festival, But Not All New or All California

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN BAUTISTA, Calif., Aug. 10 

 BODY:
For more than 40 years, the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music has been a notable West Coast outpost for new classical music. But the festival, which has had a series of distinguished music directors, has evolved, and new music then is not new music now.
 The festival took its name from Cabrillo College, a community college in Aptos, where it used to take place, but it is now based in picturesque Santa Cruz. Most performances are in the Civic Auditorium there, but the final day of the two-week festival consists now of two concerts with the same program in the more intimate Mission San Juan Bautista. This functioning church, lovingly restored, is one of the Spanish colonial missions strung along the California coast. 
 Festival history dates to some casual concerts in Aptos in 1961. Founded by Robert Hughes, then a student of Lou Harrison, the festival started with a focus on Harrison and his circle of California composers -- musicians who looked to the Pacific, not back across the Atlantic, and who created music more sensuously beautiful than knottily challenging.
But now, as seen from this year's installment, which ran from July 30 to Aug. 10, the net has been cast far wider.
There was still a strong California element. Harrison, who died in February, was honored on Aug. 3 with a concert and an encore recital to benefit the festival. But there was also new music from all over the country, very much including the middle of it, from England (a program with music by John Adams and Thomas Ades) and from the Continent (H. K. Gruber's well-traveled "Frankenstein!"). There were also Christopher O'Riley's piano transcriptions of songs by the art-rock band Radiohead, Marin Alsop conducting "Harry Potter" music by John Williams (which technically counts as contemporary) and a piece by Wladyslaw Szpilman, the composer-pianist who inspired "The Pianist."
In 1963 the first of the music directors who have shaped the festival's evolution took over. Gerhard Samuel, then conductor of the Oakland Symphony, was in charge until 1968. The Mexican composer and conductor Carlos Chavez ran it for four years, then Dennis Russell Davies, that indefatigable champion of all things new, was music director from 1974 to 1990. 
Mr. Davies returned this year as a pianist for the Harrison celebrations.
Since an abbreviated 1991 festival led by Mr. Adams -- there had been an earthquake, a financial crisis and administrative turmoil, long since resolved -- the festival has been led artistically by Ms. Alsop. 
She is routinely mentioned on the short list of promising American conductors who might one day fill major American symphonic posts.
Over the years there has been a steady change of emphasis and even some noncontemporary music. (This year there was a chamber program of mostly Mozart and Schubert.) Mr. Samuel had broader tastes than just the extended San Francisco Bay Area; Mr. Chavez naturally brought in pan-American composers; Mr. Davies conducts every kind of new music there is; and Ms. Alsop has East Coast roots with a strong addition now of things British, since she often conducts there.
But whatever "new" means, the excitement of the new still predominates. This enthusiasm holds true both for the upscale, educated audience and for the orchestra. The musicians, mostly from midlevel American professional ensembles, are selected not by audition but by player recommendations, and they perform for only a $55 per diem and free lodging.
"This is the only place I can think of where the phrase, 'Will it sell?' never comes up," Ms. Alsop said.
"So many times I rehearse with an orchestra and as soon as they see the front page of a score of new music, they're turned off," she continued. "This is an orchestra that's here to play new music."
The final program consisted of three West Coast premieres of non-West Coast music. Reflecting these musically conservative times, all of it was accessible, more or less tonal and conceived for regular symphonic instruments conventionally played. In short, too safe.
Kevin Puts's Symphony No. 2, "Island of Innocence" (2001), despite a tenuous programmatic connection to the Sept. 11 attacks, offered the most engaging music, with stretches of lyrical, Mahlerian writing.
Augusta Read Thomas's "Prayer Bells" (2001) led things off, rather less mystically involving than its title might have promised. Richard Danielpour's "Metamorphosis" (1990) might have recalled Richard Strauss's "Metamorphosen." In fact, though, it was a busy, virtuosic piano concerto with Mr. O'Riley as the deft soloist. Mr. Danielpour had lots of ideas in this piece, and some worked nicely, with ingenious effects of orchestration crowding after one another. But the end impression was more technically industrious than emotionally satisfying.
Conductor and orchestra delivered strong accounts of all three scores, and the slightly hard-sounding acoustics surpassed those of most churches. The audience responded with healthy enthusiasm.
Ms. Alsop seems happily settled here for the long haul. She reported that she had joked with Mr. Davies as to who would wind up with the longest festival tenure. She works hard, she said, but the experience is still a relief from her increasingly intense international orchestral rounds.
"It's completely unique here," she said. "It's an absolute oasis. It's rejuvenating. It really charges my batteries for the whole year."

HEADLINE: Europe Decides Air-Conditioning Is Not So Evil 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
About five years ago, Jacques Cazaban decided he couldn't take the heat. Yet he wanted to stay in the kitchen all the same.
 So Mr. Cazaban, 58, who runs a medical equipment business in Bordeaux, paid the equivalent of about $1,700 for a home air-conditioner. 
 In the United States, almost three of every four homes has some kind of air-conditioning. In Europe, people have traditionally just slowed down and baked in summer. But with the arrival of this summer's heat wave, fans and air-conditioners have been leaping off appliance store shelves. And Mr. Cazaban has been delighted with his investment. 
"It's indispensable," he said by phone recently, as the worst heat wave in decades continued to wither Europe.
While air-conditioner sales in the United States have been fairly stable, they have grown in Europe by more than 10 percent a year.
The engine of this growth is in part the global economy, which is forcing more and more Europeans to work summers. But Europeans have also come to know the benefits of air- conditioning in offices and in their cars and decided they want it at home, too. Sniffing a trend, air-conditioner manufacturers, most notably producers of inexpensive units from Japan, South Korea and China, have flooded the market with affordable models well adapted to small European homes.
Now, this year's seemingly endless heat wave has given the market a huge lift. "Our busiest months are usually June and July," said Christophe Mutz, marketing director in Paris for the French unit ofDaikin of Japan. "This year it's been all summer long."
Not surprisingly, most air-conditioner makers are viewing Europe as a potential El Dorado.
Daikin, Mr. Mutz said in a phone interview, originally projected a growth in sales of about 8 to 10 percent for this year, compared with growth rates of 15 percent and more in recent years, based on early weather forecasts and the generally weak economy.
"Now we are thinking more than 20 percent for the whole year," he said. Demand has been strongest for residential units, he said, while sales have been relatively weak to commercial customers, who apparently feel cool enough in the general economic chill.
To be sure, hurdles to the spread of air-conditioning remain. Both air- conditioners and the power to run them are costly, and there are serious moves in the European Union to curtail both energy use and the gases traditionally used as coolants. Moreover, many Europeans continue to harbor a bias against air-conditioning; some consider it unhealthy, while others say, why not rely on nature?
The demand for cooling products has not let up. At Castorama, a leading French do-it-yourself outlet, fans of all types have been sold out since July. The hypermarket chain Carrefour reported more than 200 customers a day at its store in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, looking for fans, though by early August the entire supply was sold out except for ceiling fans. In Paris, sales of mineral water are up this summer by as much as 50 percent over last year, and ice cream by as much 40 percent, according to the daily Le Parisien.
On the Paris energy exchange, Powernext, the price of electricity has soared, rising to 67 euros a megawatt-hour today, compared with less than 40 euros in June, as demand for power to run air-conditioners and other cooling devices surges.
Europe's air-conditioning market was built after World War II by the companies that pioneered the technology in the United States, like Carrier. In recent years, the market has expanded, not least thanks to a flood of advanced equipment at affordable prices from Asian manufacturers like Daikin and Mitsubishi of Japan, LG Electronics and Samsung of Korea, and more recently, Haier and Midea of China. Indeed, such has been the onslaught of the Asian companies that smaller European competitors, like DeLonghi of Italy, find themselves increasingly squeezed.
The Asian invasion has caused prices to plummet. "You can now get these moveable spot coolers at do-it-yourself places for about $:170," about $272, said Andrew Giles, director of world market intelligence at the Building Services Research and Information Association in Britain. "These are impulse purchases," he said, that often lead consumers to buy up to a larger system.
But as temperatures climbed across Europe, French researchers, echoing warnings from environmental officials elsewhere in Europe, argued that air-conditioners, while cooling the air, force out warm air, raising temperatures outside. Moreover, they said, the devices can contain ozone-depleting gases that contribute to global warming if released into the atmosphere.
"There are several big disadvantages," said Jean-Louis Plazy, deputy director for air and transportation at the French government's Agency for the Environment and Energy Conservation, in Nantes. "For one, there's energy consumption; to produce one calorie of cold, you have to generate three calories of heat. And there's the greenhouse effect, which is linked to emissions."
Makers of air-conditioners are scrambling to find substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as refrigerants. They were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because the gases deplete the earth's ozone layer. Mr. Mutz of Daikin said that European Union rules required the replacement of the gases in conventional air-conditioners this year, and in heat pumps, which can both heat and cool living spaces, by January 2004. All of Daikin's equipment meets the new norms, he said.
But France, joining a trend throughout Europe, wants to go a step further, Mr. Plazy said. By next year, the government hopes to have in place changes to building codes that will require architects and builders to help limit the use of energy both in winter and summer. The measures, he said, "require architects to look at alternative materials, walls that keep the interior cool, window openings that reduce the cold in winter and heat in summer."
The idea, in effect, is to urge builders to construct buildings as though energy supplies were limited. As Europe deregulates its energy market, electricity supplies are expected to rise, thus reducing the cost of running appliances like air-conditioners. Governments across Europe, eager to comply with the Kyoto agreement to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide that come from the burning of fossil fuels, are seeking ways to curb energy consumption and production.
In part, Europeans learned to appreciate air-conditioning from the offices they work in and the cars they drive. In France today, as much as 80 percent of office and commercial space is estimated to be air-conditioned, though important gaps remain. American travelers often lament the lack of air-conditioning in hotel rooms. More seriously, in the present heat wave there has been loud criticism of hospitals, where few spaces other than operating rooms and emergency treatment areas are air-conditioned. In Paris alone, more than 50 deaths, including those of some hospital patients, have been attributed to the heat. Many industry officials say this summer's crisis could increase hospital installations.
When automobile air-conditioning caught on in the 1990's, it was in part because of automakers' seeking to counter stagnant sales by making it standard equipment. In 1998, only 55 percent of European cars were air- conditioned, said Tom Devleesschauwer, who follows the auto air- conditioning market at Global Insight, a London consulting firm. For 2003, he forecasts almost 82 percent. That may be little compared with the United States, where 98 percent of cars are air-conditioned, but the market continues to grow.
"If you expect it in your car," Mr. Devleesschauwer said, "the next thing where you'll expect it is the home."
Still, resistance lingers. News reports about air-conditioning rarely fail to mention that Legionnaires' disease can be spread through air-conditioning systems. The leftist daily Liberation recently warned readers with the headline, "Air-Conditioning Cools You, While Heating Up the Planet."
Will this year's heat wave move the market permanently? Some, like Mr. Mutz of Daikin, think it will. "The French market for residential air-conditioning had been evolving anyway, with 15 percent annual growth rates," he said. "In fact, only about 4 to 5 percent of French homes have it, and you're talking 25 million. The potential is immense."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET-- New Jersey; 
Commuter Rail Hub May Help Energize the Economy

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
After the Secaucus transfer station of New Jersey Transit's commuter rail system goes into full operation by the end of the year, it could pump almost $1 billion into the state's economy, according to a study of the effects of transit improvements by a transportation research center at the City College of New York.
 The $450 million center, which will connect all the active rail lines in the northern part of the state, is scheduled to open for weekend service next month and expected to be fully in operation by the end of the year. It is intended to provide easier access to Manhattan for riders from both the northern and southern parts of the state and will also make it easier for New Yorkers without cars to go to places in New Jersey. 
 Because the station links rail lines that were formerly operated independently, it could have a greater effect than the Midtown Direct service that has reduced commuting time and provided a one-seat ride into the city on some lines since 1996. The connections could result in a "disproportionate jump in economic activity -- more than would normally be expected from the reduction in travel times," according to the report, which was issued in December. 
The station will connect 11 of the state's 12 passenger lines. The only one not included links Atlantic City with Philadelphia.
"These rail lines were built separately to compete for territory and markets," said James P. Redeker, assistant executive director of New Jersey Transit. "Now, they are all being connected in a unified network. A person in Bergen County can connect with the North Jersey Coast Line and go to the beach. Someone living in Manhattan can get to anywhere in New Jersey served by rail."
Noting earlier developments like Midtown Direct service, the report found that investments in commuter rail service bolster the regional economy and give people more choices of where to live. It found that for every $10 million invested in transportation, the economy grew by $21.5 million and 207 jobs were created.
Using this standard, it is not unreasonable to expect the Secaucus transfer station to provide more than $965 million in benefits and result in more than 9,000 jobs over about a decade, said Robert E. Paaswell, a professor of civil engineering at City College and the leader of the study group.
The price of residential real estate near the lines served by Midtown Direct increased 20 percent in the first year of operation, the report found, and the expansion of financial and insurance companies in Hudson County was tied directly to rail and ferry connections with Manhattan.
"All these projects were designed as singular activities, but we found that collectively they have increased accessibility in northern New Jersey and that increased accessibility has produced a boost in employment," Professor Paaswell said. The report, which was sponsored by the State Department of Transportation, is titled "New Jersey's Links to the 21st Century: Maximizing the Impact of Infrastructure Investment."
Shortening commuting time is directly associated with job and income growth, the report found. On average, a 10 percent reduction in travel time within a county results in a 4.8 percent increase in the rate of job growth and a 15.7 percent increase in income growth.
The prospect of shorter commuting attracts more riders to the rail system and gives people the option of living farther away from work. The introduction of Midtown Direct eliminated the need to stop in Hoboken and transfer either to a ferry or the PATH train line under the Hudson River. It also cut commuting time by about 20 minutes.
A survey taken in 2001 as part of the report found that ridership on the Morris and Essex branches of New Jersey Transit had increased 15 percent, to 18,400 passengers a day. And it found that 8 percent of regular commuters had moved as a result of the service, most of them west and farther from Manhattan.
Professor Paaswell said the study demonstrated that there is a direct connection between access and income. One reason the price of housing has increased along the rail lines with access to Midtown Direct service is that train users tend to have higher-paying jobs and the ability to bid up the prices of homes they want.
He described a proposal to build a rail line from the Secaucus station to the $1.3 billion Xanadu shopping complex near the Continental Arena in the Meadowlands as important. He said such a line would ease highway traffic jams like the ones that occur on Route 17 near Harriman, N.Y., when the stores in the Woodbury Commons shopping center close.
Mr. Redeker said the Secaucus station largely completes a plan devised in the 1980's to tie the disparate rail lines stretching across the state into a unified system. But since the highways are choked with traffic, New Jersey Transit officials are looking for ways to increase their capacity. 
"All the active lines are now connected," he said. "Now we are looking at some of the inactive lines."

HEADLINE: Saving the Farm On Long Island Sound; 
Agriculture Boomlet Revives Debate

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
One of the constants of life on Long Island for the last half-century, so relentless as to seem almost a motor of history, has been the steady swallowing up the farmland. Suburban development, roaring east from New York City, changed the quality of the air and water, overwhelmed old patterns of transportation and transformed the connections between people and the land. 
 But now, here on the island's east end, there is a plot twist. To Ed Harbes, it is called opportunity. 
 Mr. Harbes, a fifth-generation Long Island farmer, is doing quite well and wants to expand his acreage, not contract. And he is not alone. Agriculture, in a part of the nation that might seem the least likely of breadbaskets, is hot. 
"The business has grown in very healthy fashion," said Mr. Harbes, 45, who reinvented his farm in the late 1980's -- giving over the potato fields his father cultivated to sweet corn and pumpkins that he sells to weekenders and tourists from two farm stands. Chardonnay and merlot grapes for a Harbes winery were planted this spring. Three of Mr. Harbes's eight children now say they want to stay in the family business, which has taken on 10 new employees in the last few years. 
Here on Long Island Sound's southeastern edge, 70 miles from Manhattan, the environmental and political implications of a strengthened farm economy are immense, conservationists, farmers and local elected officials say. The question of what land is saved, what is built upon, who profits and who loses -- a real estate equation that has been at the heart of the Sound's environmental trajectory for decades, if not centuries -- are all in play here as agriculture asserts its muscle.
But the shifting debate about the land also reflects a much deeper pattern on the Sound -- how fundamentally its fate, for better and for worse, has always been in the hands of local politics and passions. Although its deep waters, stretching out 110 miles from New York City to Rhode Island, have shaped much of the climate and economy of the Northeast, historians say the Sound has always been like the proverbial elephant as described by blind men -- understood by its parts, never by the whole. 
"You've got a resource that has so many different boundaries -- no one ever looks at what the big picture is," said Tom Andersen, author of "This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound" (Yale University Press, 2002). "The decisions are made in isolation. That's the Sound's character." 
That picture is clear in Riverhead, where the economics of farming and the intricacies of zoning have become bound up with the Sound's fate along the stretch of majestic bluffs and cliffs that form Riverhead's northern boundary on the water.
Last year, town officials drafted a long-term development plan for Riverhead that would have focused development along the Sound -- by far the most valuable land in town -- as a way of preserving farmland in the interior. It was a trade-off that many environmentalists condemned, and they threatened to push instead for a plan the farmers hated -- a revision of the zoning rules that would sharply reduce the value of any farmland sold for development.
The farmers fought back. Working through their trade group, the Long Island Farm Bureau, they forged an unlikely political alliance of agricultural interests, home builders and environmentalists, and they offered an alternative vision.
Their plan would preserve farmland values. Environmentalist support was rewarded by shifting development away from the Sound and by aiming to save more open space than the town's version would have. Builders would get a streamlined development process -- and in perhaps the most divisive element of all -- the ability to build higher density clustered homes at up to six units per acre within the town's agricultural zone -- an area that was off limits under the town plan. 
Riverhead's elected town supervisor, Robert F. Kozakiewicz -- whose family's farm here is still run by his parents and a brother -- said the plan was still being debated. But he said he believes that substantial elements of the "stakeholders proposal," as the farmer-led effort is called, will probably be incorporated when the town board votes this fall. 
Some critics say the farmers and their allies have hijacked Riverhead's future -- horse trading to get everything they want now, in protecting the agricultural industry, and everything they want in the future, in being able to sell out to a housing developer when times change or retirement looms.
"It's a scheme," said Richard L. Amper, the executive director of Pine Barrens Society, a conservation group based in nearby Manorville. "What they are producing is a shell game -- they're not reducing development, just moving it around."
Some farmers also oppose the plan -- especially the idea of building town houses near the farms -- and are fighting back as well. 
"The whole issue here is density," said Art Binder, a horse and bison rancher who favors cowboy hats and is running for a seat on the Town Board this fall on his opposition to the idea of higher-density housing in Riverhead. "If you want to save the farmland, then you just can't develop it at six units per acre."
Both supporters and opponents agree that farming has changed. What had been a mostly wholesale business subject to the fluctuations of national and global markets, especially when potato-growing was king, has shifted to retail, specialty foods and tourism -- or even further to what some people here call "agri-tainment." (Mr. Harbes, for example, builds mazes in his corn fields for children to wander through.) And the higher profit margins of that shift are showing.
Between 1997 and 2001, farm cash receipts here in Suffolk County rose more than 40 percent, to $5,543 an acre, according to the most recent figures from the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. That was more than 10 times the statewide average and far higher than any other county in New York. 
And much of the rest of Riverhead's economy has gone along for the ride, residents say. The dozens of small wineries that have sprung up on Long Island's North Fork attract weekend tourists who like to shop at farm stands and who are at least partly drawn by the idea of farm land itself, almost as a kind of a prop. One resident is even pushing for a rule in the master plan that would require any new homes built on farmland -- especially the clustered houses -- to look like farm buildings, the better to fool the tourists.
That agricultural strength, in turn -- not to mention the tentacles it extends into other aspects of the local economy, from restaurants to gas stations -- is what gives preservationists here hope. Land on which people are making money, they say, and in which farmers see a bright future, is simply less attractive to development. Supporters of the farmer-led stakeholder plan say they hope to permanently preserve up the 12,000 acres of farm open space, compared to only 5,000 under the town's plan. About half of Long Island's total farmland of 34,000 acres is within Riverhead's borders.
"Preservation is terrific, but a strong agriculture industry is what's keeping this area rural," said Timothy Caufield, a vice president at the Peconic Land Trust, a conservation group.
And so, by such convoluted means and tangled trails, one of the last big undeveloped coastal sections on all of the Sound may be saved -- not by the dictates of an environmental regulator, but through the self-interested give-and-take of the market.
"A relatively undeveloped Long Island Sound coastline is one of Riverhead's largest assets," said Eve Kaplan, an environmentalist who helped put together the stakeholder group.
Ms. Kaplan said she thinks there is an inevitable exchange for retaining the gift of an undeveloped Sound. Development pressure is immense and cannot be completely stopped. The things with highest priority are the ones that should be saved, she said.
"You have to accept that some development is inevitable, and not everyone wants to do that," she said.
Many people on both sides of the land conservation debate in Riverhead say that much of what has happened here in rethinking how and where development should occur comes down to one man, Richard Wines, 57, a soft-spoken former Wall Street investor relations consultant. Even some people who vehemently hate parts of the stakeholder proposal, like Mr. Amper at the Pine Barrens Society and farmers like Mr. Binder, have only kind words to say about Mr. Wines, even though he came up with many of the ideas.
Mr. Wines is a modest man who plays down his role. His strength, he said, is that he can talk to all the power groups. As a former businessman, he said that he understands the builders. As a small farmer, he knows that community as well. But he also donated the development rights to his farm last year to the Peconic Land Trust, which means that as long as there are lawyers to defend the claim, the 15 acres of his little spread can never be built upon. That gave him capital, he said, in talking to environmentalists.
Mr. Wines, sitting in front of his house a few feet from his potato field on a recent afternoon, said he approached the land debate here in exactly the same way he would have approached a deal-making conference on Wall Street: by making sure that everyone at the table had an economic incentive to follow through.
"A business deal is most likely to succeed if all the parties benefit," he said. "Land preservation needs to be the same way."

Human Nature
Over many years of settlement, Long Island Sound has been a breadbasket and a dumping ground, a private playground for the wealthy and a symbol of environmental despair. 
But when people reached for a new definition -- a repaired, restored, managed Sound -- nature did not respond according to the rule book. 
For every push to achieve a certain end, the whorls of the ecosystem have pushed right back, often in unexpected ways. 
This is the seventh article of a summer-long series on the evolving nature of Long Island Sound. Part 8 will look for the imprint of the past, and the hints of what may come. Research into the muck at the bottom and the web of life in the water are producing some surprises.

HEADLINE: Fed Statement on Rates 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. 
 The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming, although labor market indicators are mixed. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. 
The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Renovationof Pabst Brewery Aims to Revitalize Downtown Milwaukee

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE 

 BODY:
Two developers have teamed up to purchase and renovate the sprawling historic but long-vacant Pabst Brewery complex here into an entertainment and residential complex.
 The project -- called Pabst City -- is expected to provide this city of about 600,000 with something it has long been without: a downtown entertainment district featuring the kind of national dining and entertainment chains -- like ESPN Zone and House of Blues -- that have increasingly come to dominate many center-city revitalization efforts. 
 The developers are the Ferchill Group in Cleveland and Wispark L.L.C., a division of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation, which is based here. "If you like historic readaptation projects," said John Ferchill, chairman and chief executive of the Ferchill Group, "it doesn't get any better than this."
Jerold Franke, president of Wispark, said that it took a while for him to understand the potential of the project but that he now thought it would redefine downtown. "You have to go back and look at it several times to understand what's there," he said. "We think it helps make Milwaukee an attractive place to come to by providing a venue that's not there." 
The site is commanding: 26 buildings -- many extravagantly ornamented with battlements, turrets and numerous Gothic touches -- spread over seven city blocks. Most are built of cream-colored brick and date from the late 1800's. Since the site is just west of the central business district on one of the highest hills in the city, the effect is of a medieval walled fortress brooding over the downtown area.
For more than a century, Milwaukee was dominated by three large breweries: the Miller Brewing Company, the Pabst Brewing Company and the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company. All three were basically minicities that covered dozens of acres and included everything from extensive blacksmith and stable operations to brewing and office facilities.
The cards started falling in the early 1980's, however, when the two-million-square-foot Schlitz brewery closed and was subsequently transformed into Schlitz Park, a successful office park that also contains a public school. Pabst followed in 1996 after the company was acquired in the mid-1980's by the late Paul Kalmanovitz, an investor.
Pabst Brewing is now owned by the Kalmanovitz Charitable Trust in Mill Valley, Calif. Pabst Blue Ribbon, its flagship brand, is brewed on a contract basis by the Miller Brewing Company.
Miller, now the second-largest brewer in the nation, says it has no plans to abandon its 80-acre facility on the city's west side.
Last fall, Ferchill Group and Wispark bought the 22-acre Pabst site from the charitable foundation for $9.7 million. Since then, two architecture firms -- Sandvick Architects of Cleveland and Eppstein Uhen Architects of Milwaukee -- have completed preliminary drawings as well as an extensive historical survey.
The survey is necessary to have the complex placed on the National Register of Historic Places, which would allow the redevelopment project to be eligible for historic-preservation tax credits. The credits as well as a conservation easement are expected to defray about $100 million of the project's price tag of about $350 million.
The rest will be paid for through traditional financing mechanisms like loans from banks and insurance companies, Mr. Ferchill said.
TerreMark Partners of Atlanta has signed on to handle the commercial leasing efforts. It has its work cut out for it. The commercial portion of the 1.6 million-square-foot project will consist of 450,000 square feet of retail space. "We're talking about 50 to 60 businesses," said Craig Kaser, president of TerreMark.
Mr. Kaser said the project would seek to capitalize on estimates that about $300 million in local retail and entertainment spending annually leaves Milwaukee for the much larger Chicago market. "There's a lot of pent-up demand here," he said.
The project will also have 175,000 square feet of office space and about a million square feet of residential space, which works out to 350 rental apartments and 100 condominiums.
Most of this will be contained in the existing structures; however, the developers plan to tear down several 1960's-era buildings and construct eight buildings with a total of 450,000 square feet.
No leases have been signed, but the developers are clear on what they want: "basically, anything that can be construed as entertainment -- restaurants, clubs, movies, kid's venues," Mr. Ferchill said.
The developers say they will announce about 100,000 square feet of entertainment leases next month. If all goes according to plan, construction will start after the first of the year and be completed in early 2006.
David Boerke, a developer as well as a principal with the Boerke Company/Grubb & Ellis in Milwaukee, said the plan for the Pabst site was the latest in a series of recent gentrification projects -- the new Milwaukee Art Museum designed by Santiago Calatrava is another -- that have transformed the city in recent years.
"Downtown residential has just exploded for us," he said. "We're adding 500 to 600 units a year. And that brings decisions to move companies downtown."
Pabst City represents the latest evolution of an idea many older cities have bought into in recent years: teaming up with private developers to transform obsolescent 19th-century and early 20th-century commercial and industrial properties into colorful entertainment and tourist attractions.
"It's a well-established program," said Thomas Kirschbraun, executive vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle, a large real estate investment and services concern in Chicago. "The idea is to replicate a true downtown experience where you can do everything -- shopping plus entertainment -- in one destination."
A number of developers specialize in these projects, with one of the largest being the Cordish Company in Baltimore, which has built more than a dozen such developments in Baltimore; Charleston, S.C.; Houston; and other cities.
"Everything in one form or another is a competition with the suburbs," said David Cordish, chairman and chief executive of the company. "So you look for things -- like historic buildings -- that suburbs don't have."
Mr. Cordish said these kinds of projects worked best when there was strong local interest. "Convention and tourist traffic certainly helps," he said, "but your bread and butter -- probably 60 to 65 percent your business -- is people who live no more than an hour away and keep coming back on a regular basis."
The other crucial factor, he added, is a certain level of public participation. "Without help from the public sector," he said, "the financial equation does not pencil out."
At Pabst City, the city of Milwaukee's involvement will be limited to street and infrastructure improvements that are to be financed by the creation of a tax increment financing district for the area. "We'll get involved a little bit," Mayor John Norquist said. "The developers have a good urban plan. It should work."
Mr. Norquist added that Pabst City would also benefit from a major city demolition project under way nearby. The Pabst site is bordered on two sides by elevated expressways -- Interstate 43 on the west and the Park East Freeway on the north. The latter is a half-mile spur constructed in the 1970's as a connector to a proposed lake-front expressway that was never built. Earlier this year, the city began dismantling the spur, at a cost of $26 million, and reinstalling the original street plan.
The demolition will free 26 acres for development and also eliminate a barrier that tended to discourage development to the north. "That should help Pabst a lot," Mr. Norquist said. "Instead of being an isolated pod next to a freeway, it will be fully integrated into the street grid."

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Reward if North Korea Scraps Nuclear Arms 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, which had barred concessions to North Korea before it dismantled its nuclear weapons program, is now considering some conciliatory steps. In return, North Korea would have to either fully disclose its weapons or allow international inspectors into the country, administration officials said today.
 Possible concessions include some form of written assurance that the United States has no intention of attacking North Korea and some relaxation of curbs on activities by international institutions to help the North with its economic problems, the officials said. 
 An administration official said the United States might even be prepared to offer economic incentives, an idea it previously disparaged in connection with the Clinton administration's 1994 deal to freeze North Korea's nuclear program, which the North subsequently breached. 
But, the official added, economic benefits would come only after the dismantling of the nuclear program. "There's no such thing as you-do-this and suddenly Ed McMahon shows up with a check for $10 billion," the official said.
Asian and American officials said today that the next round of talks with North Korea would take place from Aug. 27 to 29 in Beijing. That session was made possible last month, when North Korea dropped its demand that the talks be limited to direct negotiations with the United States.
"There are a lot of ideas being discussed," said an Asian diplomat. "The question is how they will be packaged, and in what sequence. The United States clearly wants its concerns addressed at an early stage, while the North Koreans want their concerns addressed at an early stage."
The Beijing talks will involve six nations: North Korea, the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The only other recent session was in Beijing in April, with only North Korea, China and the United States involved.
As the next Beijing meeting approaches, the Bush administration is reported once again to be divided over concessions to the North. There are also differences of view between Washington and its allies, Japan and South Korea.
An American official said Japan and the United States take a harder line, while South Korea is inclined to accept the idea of "front-loading" some concessions in return for preliminary steps by the North toward nuclear disarmament.
A senior administration official emphasized that no final decision had been made. The final goal, he said, remains what it was: "A complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons program."
Japanese and South Korean envoys are to confer with American officials in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday.
An administration official said hard-liners at the Pentagon, who oppose preliminary concessions, were once again at odds with State Department officials, who favor moving the process along with step-by-step concessions.
One point under discussion, according to American and Asian diplomats, is exactly what concessions might be offered if North Korea were to agree, for example, to disclose the exact number of its nuclear weapons or give more details about its plutonium reprocessing program.
Though such steps would be far short of the dismantling of nuclear programs demanded by the United States as the price for any future economic aid, the Bush administration was said to be considering preliminary steps to encourage North Korea to keep cooperating.
"The question is what actions do you take if they freeze their program, versus dismantling it," said an administration official. "There is not now a fully coordinated U.S. position on that. There are some principles, but we have to decide the whole issue of sequencing."
For nearly a year, North Korea has insisted that in exchange for dropping its nuclear program, it must get a a nonaggression treaty with the United States and large infusions of economic aid.
The Bush administration has ruled out a nonaggression pact. But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has said some form of written assurances might be acceptable as a means of underscoring President Bush's declaration that the United States had no intention of attacking North Korea.
"We won't do nonaggression pacts or treaties, things of that nature," Mr. Powell said last week, speaking to foreign journalists. He added that "there should be ways to capture assurances to the North Koreans from not only the United States, but we believe from other parties in the region."
Asian diplomats said today that the wording of a written assurance was already under discussion. The administration has already ruled out any language that would assure the North that there would never be a pre-emptive attack, they said, on the ground that an imminent attack by North Korea might require one.
Meanwhile, the administration said today that John R. Bolton, the Under Secretary of State for nonproliferation and a figure much reviled by North Korea, would not be a part of the delegation in the Beijing talks. But officials said President Bush reserved the right to decide who would make up the delegation.
The issue arose earlier this month after Mr. Bolton gave a speech in Seoul attacking the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, as a tyrant who could not be trusted. That was followed by a North Korean attack on Mr. Bolton as "human scum" who would not be welcome to any negotiations.
Mr. Bolton is regarded in the administration as a hard-liner close to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who advocates making as few concessions as possible. But he has been involved in nuclear proliferation issues and not in direct negotiations with North Korea.
After the White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Bush, and not North Korea, would decide who would attend any talks with North Korea, Mr. Bolton issued a statement saying, "I am happy to play whatever role the president and secretary want me to play."
Administration officials emphasized that President Bush had yet to make any final decisions on either what concessions to make or what timetable to adopt, if North Korea agrees to take steps toward nuclear disarmament.
Some administration officials acknowledge that North Korea has been one of the most internally contentious issues that has been faced by President Bush.
Mr. Rumsfeld and other hard-liners are said to support negotiating with North Korea, if only because they expect the talks to fail. They believe that would make it easier to rally support from other countries for more economic and political pressure and, eventually, military confrontation.
An administration official, echoing what Chinese diplomats have said publicly and privately, said there was little expectation that the talks this month would yield progress but that, over time, there was some hope for resolving the stalemate with North Korea peacefully.

HEADLINE: Fed Maintains Its Key Rate And Suggests NoShift Soon 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve left its overnight interest rate unchanged at 1 percent today, but it cheered financial markets by strongly suggesting that it would not raise interest rates until at least some time next year.
 Today's decision -- almost universally anticipated by analysts and investors -- leaves short-term rates at their lowest levels since the 1950's. 
 But the Fed also gave investors a big clue about its plans for the months ahead and that clue came as a pleasant surprise to the markets.
In its statement accompanying today's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated almost verbatim its previous assessment of the economy. It added a new sentence, however, on top of its familiar formulations, declaring that "the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period." 
Investors and analysts immediately pounced on that comment as confirmation that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low even if, as seems increasingly likely, the economy picks up speed in the next several months.
The stock market climbed modestly after the Fed's announcement. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1 percent, to close at 990.35.The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.53 percent, to close at 1,687.01.
Perhaps more telling, traders bid up the price of futures contracts on the overnight federal funds rates. Where traders had given a 90 percent likelihood of a rate increase by next April, analysts said prices after today's announcement reflected only a 60 percent chance of that happening.
"The Fed is attempting to say that we have the ability to stay with these rates for a while," said James E. Glassman, senior economist at J. P. Morgan.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve reinforced the impression that officials are not inclined to take any unusual or unorthodox measures to fight the fading risk of deflation, or an across-the-board decline in prices.
Although today's statement reiterated almost verbatim past statements about the risks of an "unwelcome fall in inflation," it offered no suggestion that the central bank would lower the federal funds rate below 1 percent or that it might pump money into the economy by buying longer-term Treasury securities.
As a result, today's announcement is unlikely to reverse the recent sharp surge in rates on longer-term Treasury notes; that, in turn, has caused a rapid rise in rates for mortgage loans.
The bond markets has suffered one of its worst routs in years during the past several weeks, a development that has sent home mortgage rates surging even though short-term interest rates are at their lowest level in about 45 years.
Analysts differ on who is to blame for the bond market's plunge into turmoil, but most agree that a crucial reason is either miscommunication by the Fed or misinterpretation by investors of what the Fed is actually saying about its intentions to fight deflation.
Many bond investors became convinced in May and June that the Federal Reserve was preparing to buy up longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would allow it to keep flooding the markets with money even if the overnight federal funds rate dropped close to zero.
But those hopes waned after the Open Market Committee's last meeting, when the Fed reduced the federal funds rate by only one-quarter of a percentage point.
Any remaining hopes were dashed in July, when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told a Congressional committee that there would probably be no need to resort to unconventional methods.
Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said the Fed's policy on short-term rates might even help keep longer-term rates high because it slightly increases the chance of future inflation.
"The F.O.M.C. generosity on liquidity for the economy may have the unfortunate result of keeping the 10-year Treasury rate near its current elevated levels," Mr. Taylor wrote in an assessment today. Because higher rates on mortgage loans have already slowed the trend of homeowners refinancing their homes and pulling out cash, Mr. Taylor said car sales could soon be affected. 
As it has before, the Fed said that current monetary policy is relaxed enough to provide "important ongoing support to economic activity" and it said that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth are "roughly equal."
William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the central bank seemed intent primarily on underlining Mr. Greenspan's view that inflation is not a significant risk at the moment and that the Fed can afford to keep short-term rates at extremely low levels without igniting a new round of price increases. He said he did not expect another increase until 2005.
"The markets viewed that as significant," Mr. Dudley said. "My own view is that it follows pretty logically" from statements by Mr. Greenspan as well as other top officials at the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Power and Peril 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
I tagged along the other day with Bernard Kerik, the dynamo former New York City police chief who is in Baghdad retraining the Iraqi cops. We sat in on a class where a U.S. police trainer and his translator were going through the basics of how to start an interrogation. The Iraqi policemen, who four months ago thought removing a suspect's fingernails was how to start an interrogation, dutifully took notes in their U.S.-provided notebooks.
 What struck me most, though, was the new "mission statement" for the Iraqi police, posted next to the blackboard in English and Arabic. It said: "We the Iraqi Police Force protect human rights and uphold our laws by serving our citizens and community for the unity and freedom of Iraq." 
 That statement exemplifies just how radical and revolutionary the U.S. nation-building project in Iraq is. Half the words in that statement were meaningless here four months ago. Human rights? Laws? Citizens? They still have no meaning, but the intent to endow them with some is what is radically new. For 50 years, Iraq, and the Arab world generally, has seen only the status quo side of U.S. power: American power used to buttress the oldauthoritarian order. Iraqis and other Arabs are now being treated to something radically new: our ideas, the revolutionary side of American power. They still don't quite believe it.
Unfortunately, the same Bush Pentagon that had the audacity to undertake this revolutionary project in Iraq did not prepare either itself or the U.S. public for such a vast undertaking. I worry that we're not going to have the time, money or people to finish this job right -- for several reasons.
First, there's a word I've heard here that I did not hear on two previous visits since the war: "humiliation." This is an occupation. It may have come with the best of intentions, but nobody likes to be occupied. I just watched a scene at the checkpoint at the July 14 Bridge, which leads to the huge U.S. compound in the heart of Baghdad. U.S. soldiers kept telling Iraqi women -- who were coming to work for the U.S. forces! -- that they could not enter because no female U.S. soldiers were available to search them. It is 120 degrees here. To wait in line for 30 minutes and then be told you have to go across the city to a different gate produces humiliation and rage, and eventually grenades tossed at Americans. I saw it in the eyes of those Iraqi women and their husbands as they drove away.
Second, America's real enemies in Iraq are exacerbating the situation by cutting electricity lines, which the U.S. does not have enough troops to protect, so many Iraqis today have less electricity (read: air-conditioning) than they had a month ago. The electricity cuts are disrupting oil production and refining, which leads to gasoline lines, soaring prices, more unemployment and more looting.
I was in a five-car convoy that was robbed in broad daylight on Monday morning just outside Baghdad. We were on the only highway linking Iraq to Jordan -- the country's lifeline -- when several BMW's with masked men, armed with AK-47's, ambushed us under a bridge. These "Ali Babas" blocked the road, pointed guns at our faces and demanded our cash (no credit cards!). They made off with thousands of dollars, which maybe they'll just keep, or maybe they'll use to pay people to kill U.S. soldiers. Who knows? I do know we drove for two more hours before we ran into the soldiers of a U.S. patrol and told them what had happened.
"Sorry," the sergeant said, "we just don't have enough people."
It's a travesty that four months after the fall of Saddam, the main road in and out of the country is still not safe. It underscores how much the Pentagon's ideological reach exceeds its military grasp. All of America's friends in Baghdad say the same thing: I love your ideas, but my daily life -- salary, electricity, security -- is worse since you came, not better.
"If you have an animal in the zoo who is fearful, angry and hungry, how can you train him?" Imad al-Tamimi, a college student who works for U.S. forces as a translator, asked me. "But if you secure him, caress him and give him some food, he will be obedient. The Iraqi people, if you secure their lives, give them a minimum level of good living, they will be your friends without your even asking them to be your friends. But that's not what's happening."
We have planted many good ideas and programs here, but the ideas will not be heard and the programs will not flower without more money to create jobs, more troops to protect the electricity and more time to train Iraqis so U.S. troops can get off the streets, and without a U.S. advisory team here dedicated to stay. There is no continuity. U.S. advisers come for a few months, then leave, and their replacements have to start all over.
It would be a tragic irony if the greatest technological power in the history of the world came to the cradle of civilization with its revolutionary ideas and found itself defeated because it couldn't keep the electricity on.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Is Divided Over Renaming Airport for Former Mayor 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
From the grave now, Maynard H. Jackson is stirring things up once again in this city he led and loved.
 A tempest is brewing here over how best to honor the memory of Mr. Jackson, the three-term mayor. His widow and other admirers are insisting that the Atlanta airport -- which he helped expand into the world's busiest, while carving out a share of its economic benefits for African-American workers and contractors -- be renamed for him. 
 That, however, would require erasing the name of William B. Hartsfield, the city's longest-serving mayor and a giant among civic boosters, who cut the deal to build Atlanta's first airport on an old racetrack and steered it from the barnstorming era into the jet age. With one brief interruption, he served from 1937 until 1962.
The proposal, not surprisingly, has prompted a lively, if somewhat academic, debate over Atlanta's relationship to its history and its habit of obliterating its past in pursuit of its future.
But there is a sharper issue as well: Mr. Jackson was black; Mr. Hartsfield, while a racial moderate for his day, was white. 
And so the push for a name change, which materialized in the eulogies for Mr. Jackson at his funeral on June 28, has tapped a wellspring of tension that many Atlantans, fresh from a polarizing fight over whether the state flag should be dominated by the emblem of the Confederacy, would rather keep sealed off.
"There is this racial overtone, of one side saying, 'We want it and we're going to get it,' and the other side saying, 'That's a terrible thing to do to us,' " said Sam Massell, the city's most recent white mayor, who renamed the airport for Mr. Hartsfield a week after his death in 1971 and was himself unseated three years later when Mr. Jackson became the city's first black mayor. "It's very similar to the flag debate, only in reverse, and just as divisive."
It has also brought to the fore a low-level fear among many black residents and some leaders: that the era of black political dominance in the city, which Mr. Jackson ushered in, may be nearing an end, as affluent whites move into renovated old homes and new apartment towers, and the black majority steadily erodes. 
Some have even speculated that Mayor Shirley Franklin, who was elected in 2001, could be the last African-American to win the post.
"Atlanta is being gentrified every day," Mable Able Thomas, a black state representative and former city councilwoman, warned at a heated public hearing two weeks ago. "So while you do still have a majority, as Maynard would say, use the power you have today."
Mr. Jackson, who was 65 at his death, never made public a desire that the airport be renamed for him. But his wife has said she remembers him saying so, as have some of his associates. And others are now invoking memories of his often confrontational style to suggest that Mr. Jackson would be pleased by both the proposal and the way it is being pressed.
In 1974, they recall, when the city embarked on a major expansion of the airport, he demanded that 25 percent of contracts be set aside for minority-owned businesses, and threatened to block the project if white Atlantans did not agree.
"Maynard represents a certain kind of forceful assertiveness on the part of the black community," said William Boone, a political science professor at Clark Atlanta University. "He did confront the white business establishment in the city, he forced them to do things they were not going to do on their own and he forced them to scream about it."
But Bob A. Holmes, a longtime state representative from Atlanta, said Mr. Jackson's combativeness was only a means to an end, and only when all else failed. "That's not what Maynard was all about," he said. "He didn't go out of his way to be confrontational. He was about doing what is right. It wasn't that he was sticking a finger in the eye of the white establishment, it was the idea of righting a wrong."
Mr. Holmes said he was the first black Georgia lawmaker to have a state highway named for him, more than 11 miles of Interstate 285, the Atlanta perimeter expressway.
Yet he said that renaming Hartsfield for Mr. Jackson was a terrible idea. 
"I think it would create a major racial schism," Mr. Holmes said. "What happens if, two elections from now, there's a majority white council and a white mayor? Should they get rid of Abernathy Freeway and name it for Hartsfield, and get rid of Andrew Young International Boulevard? You'd have people saying it's our turn, we've got a majority, let's do it. Once you begin invoking that as the basis of taking action, you drive a wedge."
Mr. Holmes also said that it was wrong to do to Mr. Hartsfield what was done to Confederate war heroes like Nathan Bedford Forrest whose names have been stripped from Atlanta's streets. "It's like the Soviet Union, where you rewrite history every 10 years," he said.
A carefully chosen 17-member biracial city commission is mulling over some 2,300 suggestions from the public about proper memorials, and is expected to make recommendations in September. But people who want the airport to be renamed are unlikely to be happy with any consolation prize, especially when the airport is about to undergo a $5 billion expansion, by far the largest public-works project on the horizon.
"When somebody brings up the airport, and compares it to a statue or a park, it just doesn't seem fitting," said a businessman close to the Jackson family.
One of the most outspoken supporters of the change is Aaron Turpeau, a businessman who served in Mr. Jackson's cabinet for 17 years. He said the renaming would hardly be disrespectful to Hartsfield's legacy, since the airport that now stands was completely rebuilt after he died.
"Things need to be updated for current history," he said. "Hartsfield's name means absolutely nothing to current society."
But Mr. Massell, who is old enough to remember Mr. Hartsfield's love affair with the airport, disagreed.
Anyway, Mr. Massell added, "history is old."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Fed's Stance on Low Rates Could Be Nudge Stocks Need

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
While Federal Reserve policy makers were not very upbeat about the outlook for the economy yesterday, their statement that they would keep their benchmark interest rate low for a long time could help start the stock market moving again.
 The three main stock gauges have been locked in a trading range this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on June 17. The Nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on July 14. Many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in July. Instead, they were surprised by another loss. 
 And the tone of the Fed's statement was not so rosy. It said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still "roughly equal" and that "on balance" the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.
But some analysts argue that the Fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recoverytime to gain strength. With this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.
Corporate profits, as included in the gross domestic product, have been rising the last five quarters, from the quarter in which the National Bureau of Economic Research said the most recent recession ended. Economists forecast that such profits also rose in the second quarter and should climb even higher in the current one.
A seven-quarter run would be the first for before-tax profits since a 10-quarter rise that ended in the fourth-quarter of 1988 and the first for after-tax profits since a nine-quarter run that finished in the second quarter of 1996.
The 14.4 percent rise in after-tax profits through the latest five-quarter run is slightly bigger then the 14.2 percent jump in the first five quarters after the previous recession, which ended in the first quarter of 1991.
Operating earnings in the second quarter are up 9 percent for the 458 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported so far, compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to Thomson First Call. The final number could be slightly higher, which would be the fifth consecutive quarterly rise for this measure.
The outlook for the third quarter is growth of 13.5 percent, a forecast that has actually inched slightly higher since the beginning of last month.
But investors may not be convinced yet because the general profit environment is not as strong as it was around the 1990-91 recession. In the 32 quarters from the fourth period of 1989 through the third quarter of 1997, there were only four quarterly declines in G.D.P. profits, and one of those was a slip of just 0.02 percent. In the 32 quarters ended in March, there were 12 quarterly declines.
In addition, the level of after-tax profits, which was $490.2 billion in the first quarter of this year, is still well below the levels reached in the bull market fueled by technology stocks.
"I think the negative attitude regarding profitability is because we still have that dot-com high-water mark for profits in our head, and until we get past it, profits will always be bad," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, said the slight overvaluation of the stock market right now might be holding investors back. He argued that "earnings levels are growing well enough to support higher valuations."
"But," he added, "I don't think investors recognize it yet."
Another plus for stocks is that it appears that bonds are finally losing favor with investors. From 2001 through last month, there were net inflows of $294.4 billion into taxable bond funds and $42.2 billion into municipal bond funds. In the same period, the flow into domestic equity funds slowed to $98.5 billion.
But as of Aug. 6, the four-week moving average of net inflows to bond funds had reversed, with a $1.4 billion outflow, according to AMG Data Services. In the week ended Aug. 6, outflows reached $3.6 billion.
Robert Adler, the president of AMG, said "there is no evidence yet" of a broad-based return to stocks. But he said the strong flows into mutual funds that invest in stocks with high dividends, which have become attractive since taxes were cut on them, and small-cap funds could signal the beginning of a return to stocks.
The performances of the stock and bond markets since mid-June, the high for the Dow and the low for interest rates, also show that many investors think that the economy is set for a revival. That expectation accounts for much of the sharp rise in interest rates since then.
In the stock market, Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc America Securities, said that the "trading range is obscuring a divergence going on underneath."
Stocks that are sensitive to economic growth have soared, showing that many investors are betting on a rebound. The Morgan Stanley index of this sector, which includes 3M, Caterpillar, Ford Motor, International Paper and Whirpool, has jumped 5.2 percent since mid-June, while the S.& P. 500 is off 2.1 percent.
The policy makers on the Federal Open Market Committee made their commitment to low rates yesterday with 13 words in their statement: "The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period."
The rally in the stock market after the Fed's announcement put the Dow within easy striking distance of its June high. So maybe the positive signals are being heeded.

HEADLINE: Investigators Say Fraud Ring Staged Thousands of Crashes 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., Aug. 12 

 BODY:
Law-enforcement officials said today that they had cracked an insurance-fraud ring that staged thousands of car accidents and then employed its own network of doctors, acupuncture therapists and fake medical clinics to bilk an insurance company out of $48 million.
 Prosecutors and insurance experts said the ring was the largest of its kind ever broken in New York State. A grand jury on Long Island has issued 567 indictments, 86 of which were made public at a news conference here today. Those indicted included doctors,psychiatrists, chiropractors, dentists and nearly 20 bogus health-care clinics that were set up as part of the scheme to defraud State Farm Insurance, the Suffolk County district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, said. 
 "It's one of the biggest busts in the nation in terms of its breadth, its scope and the dollars involved," said Robert Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. "We're talking about bringing down an entire network. It's analogous to bringing down a drug kingpin."
Mr. Spota said the ring used "runners" and "crash dummies" in cars that would cut in front of other cars, often driven by women with children or by elderly people, slam on the brakes, and cause a crash. The authorities said the investigation dates to 2001, when they received word from insurers who noticed the same names were popping up over and over on insurance claims. One runner was involved with about 1,000 accidents.
Although tales of insurance fraud are well known in New York, Suffolk County investigators and prosecutors said this network, which traces its roots to the heavily Russian Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, was especially large and complex.
Mr. Spota would not link the series of frauds to Russian organized crime, but an insurance-fraud lawyer familiar with the case said the fingerprints of organized crime appeared to be all over it. Some profits from the frauds were channeled to businesses in Russia, while others were funneled into a Swiss bank account and withdrawn by Russian citizens, the authorities said.
Insurance fraud in New York began to skyrocket in 2001, when criminal groups, chased from other parts of the country, including New Jersey, realized they could easily exploit New York's system, Mr. Hartwig said. Under the state's no-fault insurance laws, anyone injured in a car accident can receive up to $50,000 for medical care.
"New York State has the biggest problems in the nation today with auto insurance fraud," Mr. Hartwig said. "It's the biggest and last open checkbook in America today. It's a magnet for this kind of abuse."
The fraud, in turn, is responsible for driving up auto insurance premiums in New York State, and is expected to cost drivers $432 million this year, Mr. Hartwig said. An earlier study by the Insurance Research Council found that insurance fraud added $177 annually to each New York driver's insurance bill.
The frauds began with accidents in which a "runner" would recruit friends, relatives or strangers, promising them $500 apiece for participating. The runner would load them into an inexpensive sturdy American car -- usually an aging Cadillac or Lincoln -- and drive onto a highway, then veer in front of an unsuspecting driver to cause an accident, usually a fender bender. The accidents were staged mainly in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island and Westchester.
In the confusion, the driver would dart from the car and be ferried away in another automobile, leaving someone else to pose as the driver, in order to to avoid being connected to a string of accidents. Sometimes, the getaway car would disgorge people who would later claim to have been in the accident, said Bob Clifford, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney.
The passengers then went to one of several counterfeit medical clinics in Brooklyn and Queens that had been set up specifically to treat them, prosecutors said. The clinic management filed no-fault insurance claims and ordered a barrage of tests and procedures, sometimes performing them and sometimes not, the prosecutors charged.
The clinics were financed by lawyers, accountants and other investors, though doctors are listed as the owners. Lawyers whom prosecutors said were aware that the claims were false often called the insurance companies and threatened to file suits if the claims were not paid.
Each passenger could bring in $50,000, officials said. According to Peter Smith, a Suffolk County assistant district attorney who investigated the ring, runners received $1,500 per "patient" while the "crash dummies" received up to $500 per crash. The lawyers who pressed the claims reaped one-third of the profits, and the clinic managers received another third.
Some of the passengers had been in 30 or 40 accidents, though prosecutors said that one man who was indicted, Aleksandr Tarashchansky, had orchestrated as many as 1,000. Mr. Tarashchansky, speaking in halting English, referred questions about the charges to his son, who in turn referred them to Mr. Tarashchansky's lawyer, who could not be reached for comment. 
Prosecutors said Mr. Tarashchansky carried a small book that contained the names of 300 doctors, clinics and other contacts.
Though Brooklyn is their nucleus, the insurance-fraud networks are now starting to move upstate, said Gregory V. Serio, the state superintendent of insurance.

HEADLINE: Great Haven for Families, But Don't Bring Children 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: LOPATCONG TOWNSHIP, N.J. 

 BODY:
Everyone agrees that this recently rural township, its sleepy streets fringed by old farms, is a fine place to rear children. And in just a few years, hundreds of children have arrived, each like an invoice addressed to taxpayers.
 Now the town faces another expense, the legal defense of a new ordinance that will, in effect, keep down the number of families moving in. The courts will decide whether the restriction, limiting new multifamily housing units to two bedrooms, crosses a fine line between zoning meant to slow galloping development and zoning meant to keep out families with children. 
 The situation in this town, where enrollment in the town's only elementary school has almost doubled since 1995, illustrates a tension deeply felt in fast-growing areas from here to California as the cost of education turns the social logic of the suburbs upside down. Havens for families are expensive to run, and many of the people who run them are trying to draw childless couples, single people, retirees -- anybody but children. 
"It shows that the economics of the suburbs are out of phase with the original purpose of the suburbs," said Robert Fishman, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan and the author of "Bourgeois Utopias" (Basic Books, 1989), a history of suburban growth.
That purpose was to take women and children out of the "morally corrupt environment" of rough industrial cities, Professor Fishman said. "It's still to an amazing degree the cultural assumption that this green, open environment is a better place to raise children."
But the cost of educating children, not a huge concern even in the postwar Levittown decade, now exceeds what their parents' houses yield in taxes. As school costs rise, "people get more desperate about it," said Myron Orfield, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of "American Metropolitics: The New Suburban Reality" (Brookings Institution, 2002).
The local governments' first line of defense, Professor Orfield said, is simply to fend off housing. "They aren't providing land for housing, especially apartment buildings. Everyone's zoning for commercial buildings. In California, auto malls are king. In New Jersey, commercial office parks are the most valuable things."
The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against people with children. But restrictions that have that effect but are meant to accomplish something else are usually lawful.
Some communities that may not want to increase their school-age population can embrace the elderly. That is socially acceptable, and because the federal Fair Housing Act allows senior-citizen developments to prohibit younger residents, it is legally acceptable. The fast-growing western suburbs of Boston, for example, are scrambling for developments with age restrictions and otherwise engaging in what one legislator calls "vasectomy zoning." Naperville, Ill., outside Chicago, is imposing restrictive covenants on some new developments to prohibit sales to people under 55.
Edward J. Blakely, dean of the management school at New School University and co-author of "Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States" (Brookings Institution, 1999), said some communities are limiting times when children can be on streets or putting prohibitions on skateboards and roller skates "because it supposedly does damage to the sidewalks."
In the development corridors of central and northwestern New Jersey, many towns have adopted minimum lot sizes of 5 or 10 acres.
Patrick O'Keefe, the chief executive officer of the New Jersey Builders Association, said, "The idea is both to inflate the price of what will be built and to diminish the amount that will be built."
In the fast-growing Jersey Shore area, Ocean County has attracted scores of developments for retirees. Ventnor, a shore town that sends its high school students to Atlantic City, at a cost of $12,000 a year each, recently started offering owners of apartment buildings $22,000 to convert year-round rentals to seasonal.
Ventnor has set aside $200,000 in incentive money. Mayor Tim Kreischer pointed out that if two high school students ended up elsewhere for four years, "there's half your $200,000 right there."
New Jersey's position is especially painful because local property taxes provide about 55 percent of school costs, while the national average is about 42 percent. Professor Orfield says the problem is worst in "places that are turning into bedroom suburbs, where people are not so affluent and have blinding taxes."
That describes Lopatcong, near Interstate 78 at the state's western edge. As farms gave way to subdivisions of single-family houses, the population rose to 6,991 in 2002 from 5,765 in 2000. Enrollment at the town's elementary school was 503 in 1995 and 755 in 2001, and it is expected to reach 900 this fall, when a new middle school will open.
In a state with the nation's highest property taxes per capita and the highest education costs per pupil, Lopatcong's are comparatively modest. The average property tax bill is about $4,400, half that of many Bergen County and Essex County suburbs. Lopatcong's school cost is $7,696 per pupil, while the state average is nearly $10,000.
But the numbers worry a town with few commercial taxpayers. And when the developer of a half-built condominium and town house complex applied to redesign 72 planned two-bedroom units to add another bedroom, saying that many prospective buyers needed three bedrooms, local officials denied the request. The zoning ordinance governing the 414-unit development limited the total number of bedrooms but not the number per unit, so the Township Council enacted the two-bedroom limit for all new units in the multifamily zone.
The builder's opponents cited, among other things, an estimate that the additional bedrooms would mean 88 additional residents, including 41 children of school age. At a public hearing, several residents worried aloud about school crowding. "So if you have kids, you have got the bottom line, you have got the school tax," one man said. "That is my concern."
The builder, Larken Associates, sued in Superior Court, contending that the town was discriminating against families with children. Larry Gardner, the company's chief executive, said in anger after a Planning Board meeting, "Is children coming into a township a reason not to approve? What they're saying is 41 children are going to cause such a detriment to the community."
Mayor Douglas J. Steinhardt protested that the builder was more interested in maximizing profit than in opportunities for young families. The zoning ordinance, he said, simply aimed to slow the erosion of the town's rural character.
"It's changing the makeup of what's already a high-density development," Mr. Steinhardt said.
He also said the ordinance merely enforced the builder's original agreement with the township to build one- and two-bedroom units, which the town accepted when it approved a higher density than the original zoning permitted.
If local officials hesitate to mention school costs publicly -- although several in Lopatcong did so in comments to local newspapers -- it is in part because New Jersey courts have been hostile to such arguments for restrictive zoning.
Even Ventnor, in paying landlords to eliminate year-round rentals, is offering an incentive rather than a restriction, and savings on school costs will be "an auxiliary benefit," the city administrator, Andrew McCrosson, said.
"We addressed it as a quality-of-life issue," Mr. McCrosson said. "So many people packed into such a tight area, you have more police calls, more utility problems, and it exacerbates an already terrible parking problem."
But in private conversations, local officials talk about the staggering expense of educating children.
James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said a desirable development is now considered to be "one that doesn't have smokestacks and doesn't generate children."
Twenty-five or thirty years ago, Dean Hughes said, industry was anathema to suburbs, so office buildings and housing were seen as desirable. "All of a sudden they realized how expensive schoolchildren are."
In older suburbs the second baby boom has not strained the schools built for their parents, he said, but recently developed towns on the periphery had tiny and often aging schools.
Costs have risen everywhere, he said. "Back in the 1950's and 60's things were so much cheaper. You were building dirt-cheap buildings. You didn't have the bells and whistles. A lot of high schools now have TV studios, swimming pools, computer labs. The schools have to be triple-wired and air conditioned. You have additional staff."
People who got property tax bills for $1,000 or $1,500 when their children were in school now pay $10,000 or $12,000 for the same house, Dean Hughes said.
Professor Orfield said that people on all sides of the issue have a common enemy: the property tax.
A few states, notably Michigan, have shifted substantial educational costs from local governments to the state, easing the competition between local governments to maximize revenue and minimize school populations.
In the suburban counties in New York State, many towns have property taxes at least as high as those in New Jersey, but planners say the band of rapidly developing suburbs is smaller and the issue of school populations less volatile.
Dean Blakely said: "Most of the people who have kids are moving to Jersey now. There's more land, it's cheaper, the transportation is good, and that's where the jobs are anyway."
Connecticut, one of the few states that ranks above New Jersey in its schools' reliance on property taxes, has similar problems, said Richard Porth, the director of the Capital Regional Council of Governments in Hartford. "The way that New Jersey and Connecticut and some other states rely on the property tax to pay for education hurts us in 100 ways," Mr. Porth said.
In New Jersey, the pressures on middle-class towns are aggravated by the state school-aid formula, which provides nearly full financing for the 30 neediest districts and scales back payments to the more affluent, including many suburban districts whose schools are most in demand.
Urban experts and politicians say it is a problem that communities will wrestle with for years.
"You cannot deal with smart growth in an environment where, in the back of people's minds they're saying, 'If we have another unit, will this cost us tens of thousands of dollars in school costs?' " said Edmund O'Brien, the mayor of Metuchen, N.J. "You can't have a town without kids."

Retailers in the Lead as Fed's Decision Spurs a Rally

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve said that the lowest interest rates in 45 years were helping the economy. Retailers like Home Depot had the biggest gains.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced for a fifth trading day, climbing 9.76 points, or 1 percent, to 990.35. The winning streak is the longest for the index in more than two months. 
 Capital One Financial led a rally in credit card stocks after the company said its loan losses fell.
The Fed left its target rate for overnight loans between banks unchanged at 1 percent. Fed policy makers said they were still concerned that prices were rising at an ever-slower pace, suggesting rates would remain steady for some time.
"They're going to keep rates low and that's going to be good for stocks," said Richardson T. Merriman, president of Pennsylvania Trust, which manages more than $1 billion in Radnor, Pa. The Fed's statement "sort of confirms that things are on the mend."
The Hewlett-Packard Company jumped almost 5 percent to lead the gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed 92.71 points, or 1 percent, to 9,310.06. The Nasdaq composite index gained 25.50 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,687.01 for its biggest gain in more than two weeks. Indexes reached their highs after the Fed's 2:15 p.m. statement.
Stocks of consumer-related and technology companies, which led the advance, have had the biggest gains for the year, on optimism that their earnings will rise as the economy picks up. The S.& P. 500 has gained 13 percent this year.
Still, the rally has stalled for the last two months as investors sought further evidence that the recovery would occur.
Smaller stocks, which some investors say perform the best in an expanding economy, had the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks climbed 7.68 points, or 1.7 percent, to 466.95.
Quarterly results from Deere & Company and Marvel Enterprises exceeded the average analyst estimates, also giving stocks a lift. Earnings for S.& P. 500 companies rose 9.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Financial, beating the 7.2 percent average prediction at the quarter's end.
"The second quarter was a reasonably good one for earnings," said Stephen J. Dillenburg, who helps oversee $6.2 billion at Summit Investment Partners in Cincinnati. 
Retailers had the biggest gain of the 24 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. Home Depot rose 44 cents, to $33.13. The Lowe's Companies added $1.53, to $48.35.
Computer-related shares also gained amid optimism that a growing economy will lift sales. Hewlett-Packard added 99 cents, to $20.95.
Financial shares contributed the most to the gain in the S.& P. 500. Capital One rose $2.40, to $50.49. 
Providian Financial, a San Francisco-based credit card issuer, gained 40 cents, to $9.73. Citigroup, the world's biggest card issuer, rose 64 cents, to $45.19.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell for a third day in New York trading after the Federal Reserve expressed optimism that economic growth was accelerating.
By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note fell 21/32, to 98 16/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, jumped to 4.43 percent from 4.36 percent. And the 30-year bond lost 13/32, to 100 11/32. Its yield rose to 5.35 percent from 5.27 percent.

HEADLINE: Bush Choice to Head E.P.A. Asks Clinton Administrator for Reference 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
By 6 o'clock this morning, Utah time, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, President Bush's choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, had called Carol M. Browner, the administrator under President Bill Clinton. He asked if he could use her as a reference as he prepared for his confirmation hearings, which are bound to be rife with Democratic dissent.
 Ms. Browner said sure, but she told him she would tell people about both his pluses and his minuses. In the plus category, she told a reporter later, she would say that they worked well together, that he was "very good on the Grand Canyon visibility stuff" and that "he didn't simply walk the industry line." In addition, she said, "he's a really nice guy." 
 On the down side, she said, she would say he was a true believer in two philosophies with which she adamantly disagrees. One, which he shares with the Bush administration, is cost-benefit analysis, which she opposes because, she said, it traditionally overestimates the cost of regulations to industry and underestimates the benefit to health and the environment. The second is his belief in states' rights, which she said can lead to low standards and to some states' becoming pollution havens.
The call to Ms. Browner, a Democrat, was an indication that Governor Leavitt, a Republican, was executing a comprehensive confirmation strategy to win over Democrats as well as Republicans for his hearings, expected to begin in September.
And it illustrated his chief virtue, as his supporters describe it: an ability to work both sides of the aisle. 
Governor Leavitt is getting a big head start on his potential opposition. While he worked the phones and lined up support -- he said today that among his calls was one to Christie Whitman, whose resignation as administrator made way for his nomination -- the Senate was in recess. That means that organized opposition would be slower to take shape.
Several environmental groups were working feverishly to amass details critical of what the Sierra Club called his antienvironmental record, highlighted chiefly by secret negotiations he held with the Interior Department to eliminate protections for millions of acres of wilderness.
But the groups have not been united against him. Some have lauded him for keeping nuclear waste out of his state. Others have praised his work against urban sprawl.
Mr. Leavitt said in a speech today in Salt Lake City that his environmental views were in the "productive middle" and not on the extremes. That "is where the vast majority of the American people are," he said. Last week, before his nomination was announced, he called his environmental critics "extremists."
Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster who wrote a memorandum this year advising the administration how to sound sympathetic on the environment, said today: "The American people believe that many of these environmental groups are extreme. They want a centrist policy that doesn't hurt the economy and doesn't stop progress. Leavitt has taken that middle-of-the-road approach."
At the same time, most senators have been reluctant to criticize him. They include Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent and ranking minority member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearings.
His spokeswoman, Diane Derby, said Mr. Jeffords wanted to study Mr. Leavitt's record before weighing in and that he wanted to talk with the governor about one of his primary concerns -- a lack of timely information to the committee from the Bush administration on environmental matters.
Similarly, Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic presidential candidate, who as a fellow governor has a long history with Mr. Leavitt, put out a statement that avoided any criticism of him as nominee.
This typified the approach of Democratic presidential candidates, who are lambasting President Bush's environmental record while essentially sparing Mr. Leavitt. Four of the nine Democrats running for president are in the Senate and will almost certainly use the confirmation hearings as a platform on which to attack the president's record.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one candidate, sounded the strongest note. He said in a letter today to Senator James M. Inhofe, the chairman of the environment committee, that Governor Leavitt's record deserved extra scrutiny. Mr. Lieberman said he was concerned about the secret wilderness negotiations; his insistence on building a highway across wetlands, a project stopped by the courts; and his failure to respond quickly to the release of carcinogens from a magnesium plant near the Great Salt Lake.
Both sides expect the hearings to offer political fireworks. As one top Republican aide said, "We expect Lieberman may slap a hold on the nomination and say, 'This is my trophy to the environmental group,' " referring to the process by which any senator can try to stop a nomination.
The Republican-controlled Senate could ignore the "hold," which could force the senator objecting to the nominee to stage a filibuster. But, the Republican aide said, if that happened, "pressure can be brought to bear, and we can get Democratic governors to come out and support Leavitt."
"There will be all kinds of political tricks here," the aide said, "but at the end of the day, he'll have solid, unified Republican support and at least 10 moderate Democrats."

HEADLINE: UBS Chief Cautious Despite Soaring Quarterly Profit 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Favorable market conditions and a tight grip on costs contributed to a 23 percent leap in profit for the quarter at UBS, the bank said today.
 Earnings soared to 1.64 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion), beating forecasts of 1.3 billion francs. It was one of the best quarters for UBS since 2000, with all of its business units posting gains in revenue and profit. 
 Still, Peter A. Wuffli, president of UBS, expressed caution on the rest of the year, sending the company's stock price lower and erasing gains from early in the day. 
Speaking in an interview, Mr. Wuffli said the worst was past for the banking industry and acknowledged that UBS had done remarkably well in the second quarter. The "near perfect" conditions in fixed-income trading and improvement in the equity markets that fueled profits were unusual, he said.
Operating income rose only 1 percent, to 9.1 billion francs, and a strict diet of cost-cutting, including the elimination of 1,400 jobs, helped raise profit margins. 
"I look less at totals and more at individual divisions, and at UBS all were good," said Heinrich Wiemer, an analyst at Bank Sal. Oppenheim.
UBS, traditionally a risk-averse bank, surprised many analysts with its ability to recover 24 million francs of loan losses in contrast to making provisions to cover 104 million francs of bad debts in the first quarter of this year.
The bank, the world's largest asset manager, added 14.4 billion francs ($10.7 billion) of net new money in the second quarter, compared with a rise of 17.1 billion francs in the first quarter.
For the first time since it bought PaineWebber, UBS managed a profit -- 143 million francs ($106 million) -- in its United States wealth management business, after losing 137 million francs in the period last year, the company said. 
The company added $2.9 billion of new money in the United States, drawing more money than most other United States firms.
In contrast, Merrill Lynch lost $2 billion in its United States private-client services unit in the second quarter.
In spite of the company's strong results, Mr. Wuffli said he was not sure if the trend would continue. "We are more cautious for the second half," he said.
Industrywide, Mr. Wuffli said he believed that there would be a cooling in the factors that so far have led to double-digit growth.
The fixed-income business, which was fueled by low-interest rates, is slowing, while the equity market recovery remains uncertain.
Areas where the company will probably see increased activity in the second half, like mergers and acquisitions, are not likely to keep pace with UBS's current rate of growth.
Also, the second quarter included the sale of some small units, which added one-time gains to the company's profit figure.
"It is difficult to assume corporate earnings will be sustainable," Mr. Wuffli said. "You can't extrapolate."

HEADLINE: Anger Over Car Insurance Rates in Canada 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Canada's auto insurers, squeezed by soaring injury claims, falling investment income and slow-moving regulators, are hitting drivers with huge increases in premiums.
 The public outcry has led politicians across the country to promise mandatory cuts in premiums and other reforms. That has left insurance executives wondering whether their industry, already flooded with red ink, will be the chief casualty, or whether their long campaign for regulatory change is finally paying off. 
 Michael Donoghue, chief executive of the Allstate Insurance Company of Canada, a unit of the Allstate Corporation of Northbrook, Ill., said that while his company "had posted disastrous results in seven of the last eight quarters," he was encouraged by the current furor. 
"It seems like it had to become a political issue before the governments wanted to do anything," Mr. Donoghue said. "I see a good understanding of the issues."
But George Cooke, chief executive of the Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company in Toronto, expressed concern that with American- and European-controlled companies writing about two-thirds of auto insurance policies in Canada, heavy underwriting losses and political pressures could discourage foreign investment.
According to Mr. Cooke, many foreign-controlled companies "have a for-sale sign up, either in neon lights or in invisible ink."
There has already been considerable consolidation. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, a trade group, 37 property and casualty companies have merged, sold or closed their Canadian operations since 1998; the number of active companies has fallen to 207 from 231.
As in the United States, auto insurance rules are a patchwork in Canada. Each of the 10 provinces draws up its own regulations, trying to balance the interests of consumers, insurance companies, lawyers and health care providers, among others.
In three provinces, government corporations have a monopoly on basic coverage, with private insurers selling only optional supplementary benefits. Six other provinces, including Ontario, have privately run systems, where insurance companies compete for business. Quebec has a hybrid system.
Premiums in places with privately run systems began spiraling in 2000, after holding steady -- or even falling -- for a long period. Insurers say the increases were a result of factors beyond their control, notably fast-rising health care costs, the requirement in some provinces that insurers cover anyone who applies regardless of risk, and generous no-fault settlements mandated by the provincial governments.
For instance, physiotherapists bill private insurers in Ontario 60 Canadian dollars ($43) for an hour of treatment, compared with the 14 dollar fee set by the province's health insurance plan, which covers residents' normal health care needs.
But Frank Fotia, director of insurance services for the Canadian Automobile Association in Ottawa, said private insurers had contributed to soaring premiums by undercutting each other in a drive for market share, when the stock market was booming and they could cover underwriting losses with investment income.
According to data collected by Canadian Insurance magazine, property and casualty insurers' investment income fell to 2.2 billion Canadian dollars last year from a peak of 3.4 billion dollars in 1997. In that same period, total underwriting losses grew to 1.5 billion Canadian dollars from less than 500 million.
"People were silly in the 90's," acknowledged Mr. Cooke of Dominion of Canada.
According to the insurance bureau, premiums in the six provinces with privately run systems soared an average of 19.8 percent in the year ended in March.
Increases in the provinces with government-run systems were minuscule, though Stanley Griffin, the insurance bureau's president, said that all too often in provinces with government-run plans, rates are frozen in the year or two leading up to elections but rise sharply once the votes are in.
The Bank of Canada, expressing concern that soaring rates have become a major factor in pushing up inflation, is studying the impact of auto insurance on the consumer price index.
The political furor over the jump in premiums has fueled both hope and despair among underwriters.
In New Brunswick, the province with the biggest jump in premiums last year, an average of 27.5 percent, auto insurance emerged as the leading issue in elections in June, causing an otherwise popular government to eke out the narrowest of victories.
In response, the government has introduced a raft of changes, including a proposal to cap awards for minor injuries at 2,500 Canadian dollars, a plan that has greatly encouraged insurers.
But the government has also demanded that the insurers reduce premiums. Those that fail to comply face a mandated cut of 20 percent, and fines of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars per policy.
In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, the Progressive Conservative government has announced a similar combination of carrots and sticks ahead of an election that is likely to be held in the fall.
The current state of upheaval has left many insurance companies unsure about where their Canadian operations are headed. For instance, State Farm Canada, the Canadian unit of the State Farm Insurance Companies of Bloomington, Ill., incurred record auto underwriting losses of 207 million Canadian dollars in2001 and 311 million last year. Yet the unit is also planning a new head office in suburban Toronto.
Canadian auto insurance "has the potential to be a good market," said Derek Fee, a State Farm spokesman, "if we can get the legislative reform needed to get costs under control."
Mr. Cooke said he was optimistic that "sooner or later, we will get it sorted out, but I have a lot of gray hairs getting there."

HEADLINE: How to Prevent the Next Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By John Deutch and Ernest Moniz; John Deutch, professor of chemistry at M.I.T. and former director of central intelligence, was in the Energy Department from 1977 to 1980. Ernest Moniz, professor of physics at M.I.T., was in the Energy Department from 1997 to 2001. They directed a recent M.I.T. study on nuclear energy.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
The world needs both more electricity and less pollution. The goals are not incompatible, but the solution will require better management of demand, smarter use of coal as well as renewable energy sources, and increased use of nuclear power.
 As Congress considers an energy bill when it returns from recess, it will be under pressure to expand or limit the use of nuclear power. The issue, however, is not simple. More nuclear power will be necessary -- but more nuclear plants will be built only if more safeguards and incentives are put in place. The challenge is to make nuclear energy safer, cleaner and more economical. 
 We built a model to compare the costs of producing electricity from new nuclear, coal and natural gas plants. The model focuses on economic cost, not regulated or subsidized cost. According to our study, the baseline cost of new nuclear power is 6.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 4.2 cents for coal and natural gas (when the price of gas is $4.50 per thousand cubic feet). Plausible, but unproved, technology could reduce nuclear costs to those of coal and gas.
However, if a cost is assigned to carbon emissions -- either through a tax or some other way, as in a current Congressional proposal that would limit emissions but allow companies to buy and sell the right to discharge more pollutants -- nuclear power could become an attractive economic option. For example, a $50 per ton carbon value, about the cost of capturing and separating the carbon dioxide product of coal and natural gas combustion, raises the cost of coal to 5.4 cents and natural gas to 4.8 cents.
Even under these favorable circumstances, the regulatory uncertainty threatening the large-scale investment needed for a nuclear plant will require some government assistance. A production tax credit, similar to that extended to wind power, is a good idea. It would give private investors an incentive to complete a plant. If no plant is built and operated, no public money is spent. If the first plants are indeed built and operated competitively, more will follow and the possibility of reducing greenhouse gases increases.
Besides cost, there is the problem of nuclear waste. While it is technically possible to dispose of spent fuel safely, the issue is actually doing it. Successful operation of the planned Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada would be an important step.
But the Department of Energy's nuclear waste research and development program should consider solutions beyond mined depositories like Yucca Mountain. For example, burying spent fuel several kilometers deep in a dry well, called a borehole, may offer significant cost and environmental benefits compared to mined repositories. This and other possibilities should be systematically explored.
Finally, there is the challenge of nonproliferation, which is complex because of its international dimensions. There is no question that the current nonproliferation regime needs to be strengthened. Particular attention must be paid to enrichment technology and reprocessing. Enrichment, which converts natural uranium into reactor fuel, can produce uranium well beyond reactor grade, suitable for weapons. Reprocessing separates plutonium metal, which can be used directly in weapons, from reactor fuel. There is ample uranium available so that reprocessing can be avoided for at least the next 50 years.
In the near term, the priority should be to require signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, like Iran, to accept inspections of suspected but undeclared nuclear facilities. For the longer term, advanced nations that operate nuclear facilities should offer to provide fuel to reactors in less developed nations -- and to remove all spent fuel.
Nuclear power can make an important contribution to meeting the world's growing electricity needs while helping to reduce carbon emissions. But this contribution will be realized only if the United States and other nations focus on making today's technology work and avoid expensive advanced technologies that involve reprocessing, which presents serious proliferation risks.
It will be difficult, of course, to carry forward this nuclear agenda. Yet it will also be difficult to limit greenhouse gas emissions adequately while satisfying global energy needs for social and economic development. In both of these endeavors, American leadership is essential.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
It's not just about price and performance. Intangibles are increasingly important.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness," to be published in September by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
OSCAR WILDE defined a cynic as someone who "knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing." To many people, that sounds like an economist or an executive.
 But Wilde's witticism ignores what prices do. They convey information about how people value different goods, including the intangibles an aesthete like Wilde would care about most. 
 Those hard-to-count intangibles are an increasingly important part of the economy. Competition has pushed quality so high and prices so low that many businesses can no longer distinguish themselves with price and performance. To add value, they turn to aesthetics: the look and feel of people, places and things.
Today's successful restaurants do not just serve food; they create environments. Cellphones do not just communicate; they let owners swap face plates and personalize rings. Toilet brushes do not just remove grime; they come in caddies with a personality -- from Philippe Starck's sleek Excalibur to Stefano Giovannoni's playful Merdolino.
If you go to Lowe's to get a key copied, you have a choice. For $1.24, you can get a standard brass key. For $2.97, you can choose from a half-dozen colorful patterns -- flowers, American flags, tie-dyes, flames.
The more expensive key will not open the door any better. The difference is purely aesthetic.
Prices capture the relative value people put on intangibles. The price system lets individuals make trade-offs among goods, without having to articulate a "good reason" for their preferences. It rewards value you cannot easily count.
Some critics find that wasteful. "Addiction to a strict and unremitting valuation of all things in terms of price and profit" leaves executives "unfit to appreciate those technological facts that can be formulated only in terms of tangible mechanical performance," Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1921 in "The Engineers and the Price System." 
Veblen's critiques still influence both intellectual opinion and practical policy. His intellectual heirs, like the economists Robert Frank and Juliet Schor, treat the intangible pleasures of style as either deceptive "salesmanship" (Veblen's term) or wasteful status competition.
Public policy often regards aesthetic value as illegitimate or nonexistent. This oversight comes less from ideological conviction than from technocratic practice. Unlike prices, regulatory policy requires articulated justifications and objective standards. So policy makers emphasize measurable factors and ignore subjective pleasures.
Take lighting. Outside the theater, lighting has traditionally been an engineering field. Guys with calculators (or slide rules) would figure out what fixtures would produce enough light for a room at a specific cost. Veblen would approve.
Over the last couple of decades, all that has changed. For retailers, restaurants and hotels -- any business that wants customers to feel special -- lighting isn't just illumination anymore. It's identity, emotion, drama.
"There is a significant difference between being able to see and being able to appreciate," said Fred Oberkircher, director of the center for lighting education at Texas Christian University. "That word 'appreciation' means a lot. It would be like asking, 'What's the difference between wearing coveralls and a designer dress?' "
Veblenites prefer lighting coveralls. So, apparently, does the Environmental Protection Agency, which has encouraged states and cities to adopt the International Energy Conservation Code. When the code is put in place, interior designers lose some of their favorite tools.
The code penalizes incandescent lighting, favoring fluorescents, which, designers complain, make dimming harder and more expensive. It penalizes rooms with high ceilings, which require more lighting. It gets rid of cove lighting, which typically uses high-wattage fixtures on dimmers.
"You have to have incandescent sources to be able to light the space nicely, softly -- to get that warm feel, even in contemporary spaces," says Granville McAnear, a senior designer at Craig Roberts Associates in Dallas. The code went into effect in September in Texas, forcing Mr. McAnear to explain the rules to unhappy clients who want traditional styles.
"No client," he says, "wants to see fluorescents or metal halide fixtures or anything industrial."
Raising the price of electricity would encourage conservation without dictating style. But in this case at least, the engineers have triumphed over the price system.
The energy code limits itself to Veblen's "tangible mechanical performance." The boards that set energy codes and evaluate their effectiveness include engineers and environmental advocates. They do not include artists or designers, much less their clients. Engineering experts tend to dismiss the concerns of designers. "I can demonstrate through research that your color perception is better with fluorescent than it is with incandescent," says Mark Rea, director of the lighting research center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
By providing a balanced spectrum of colors, he explains, today's fluorescent lights make it easier to distinguish shades that can look the same under incandescent bulbs: maroon versus violet, for instance. Interior designers, he says, just do not know what they are talking about.
But even Professor Rea admits that humans do not always want a balanced spectrum. Skin tones look better under the long wavelengths of incandescent lights. If you're designing a restaurant, skin tones are what you care about.
"Fluorescent is just not attractive," says Jan Martin, a designer of Zero 3 in Dallas, which specializes in restaurant design. "I don't care what they say."
Interior designers are not trying to pass scientific color-identification tests. They, and their profit-seeking clients, are trying to make people happy. Pleasure is in the eye of the beholder. It's subjective. But that doesn't make it any less real. Prices recognize that value, even when we can't otherwise measure it.

HEADLINE: Framework Set For Reduction Of Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER with DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
In an effort to breathe life into global trade negotiations, the United States and the European Union said today that they had agreed on a way to reduce the subsidies and import duties used to protect their farmers.
 Agriculture subsidies have been the chief obstacle in the current round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization. Delegates from the 146 member nations of the organization will meet next month in Cancun, Mexico, and the poorer nations have said that the trade talks would be doomed unless the developed nations cut back sharply on the subsidies. 
 Today's proposal was necessary if the Cancun meeting is to have any chance of success, Europe's top trade official, Pascal Lamy, said in a telephone interview. 
"We have agreed to substantial reductions to domestic support," Mr. Lamy said. "This moves the negotiations 50 or 60 percent forward."
Allen F. Johnson, the chief agriculture trade negotiator for the office of the United States trade representative, gave an equally cautious welcome to the accord. He described it as a breakthrough but warned that there remained "tough issues ahead."
The agreement between Washington and Brussels is preliminary and thin on details, and trade officials from developing nations were skeptical of its merits.
Still, it reflects remarkable cooperation between the world's biggest trade powers, which have clashed often on agricultural issues. And it is a new start on the issue of agriculture subsidies after previous negotiations had failed.
"It is an important deal," said Richard Weiner, a trade lawyer with the law firm of Hogan & Hartson in Brussels. "Developing countries may criticize it, but the two sides have now created the conditions needed for success in Cancun. They have created the framework; now they have to fill in the numbers."
The Cancun meeting is intended to deal with trade distortions across a range of goods and services, ahead of a new global trade agreement that is set to be signed by the end of next year. Agriculture accounts for a much smaller share of world trade than industry, but it could upset wider talks because of its political sensitivity.
Developing countries are pushing hardest for global cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs that make their products less competitive in other markets. Developed countries, likewise, are looking to gain easier access to developing markets and especially China, the W.T.O.'s newest member.
However, regions where farmers have grown dependent on subsidies, including the European Union and Japan, contend that these protective measures are needed to keep rural communities alive.
Big farm groups in the United States were encouraged by the announcement, saying that agreements to reduce government subsidies and do away with trade barriers would eventually benefit American farmers.
"U.S. farmers face significant trade barriers around the world," said Ron Heck, president of the American Soybean Association. "We want these markets open."
The National Corn Growers Association also said that it was in favor of phasing out United States government subsidies and price supports if it meant opening more markets for American corn.
"We're saying let each country produce what they produce best, and not be adversely affected by the size of another government's treasury," said Rick Tolman, chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association.
The United States abandoned an earlier proposal to cap trade-distorting subsidies at 5 percent of the value of a country's farm output. Mr. Johnson reiterated his aim to eventually wipe out agriculture subsidies, but the agreement announced today does allow for some state support for farmers.
The joint proposal does not specify a reduction in subsidies and import duties, nor does it set any deadlines. It commits the United States and the European Union to reducing protection for their farmers in parallel, and it separates some subsidies, like assistance to improve environmental standards on farms, into a category Mr. Lamy said should not be considered protectionist.
Protectionist measures used by the United States and the European Union amount to $15,000 to $20,000 per farmer each year, according to estimates by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The agreement comes after the European Union said in June that it would reduce its subsidies to wealthy farmers if the United States and other countries followed suit.
Officials of developing countries said they welcomed today's effort, but that the proposal fell short of what they would expect to achieve at Cancun.
"We welcome the step; everyone welcomes that," said Luiz Felipe de Seixas Correa, Brazil's envoy to the W.T.O. "But it's not enough."
India's ambassador to the W.T.O., K. M. Chandrasekhar, was more critical, telling reporters in Geneva that the proposal "seems to be an attempt to pry open the developing country markets without clear commitment" on the part of the United States and Europe to open their own. "I think it isn't feasible for us."
Farmers in developing countries complain that assistance to European and American farmers hurts them, not just by keeping them out of lucrative Western markets but also because some subsidies encourage European and American farmers to sell their produce below cost in third world markets, undercutting local growers. 
Tim Rice, a trade policy analyst with the international group ActionAid, said of today's agreement, "America and the E.U. are paying lip service to third world farmers."
But the details of the accord could change everything. "The numbers make all the difference," Mr. Correa said, "and the deadlines make all the difference."
Celine Charveriat, head of advocacy for the aid group Oxfam International in Geneva, welcomed the effort to tackle the agricultural subsidies issue. "At least they are showing willingness to sit down and come up with proposals," she said.
The talks came at the request of the World Trade Organization in an effort to break the stalemate ahead of the meeting in Cancun. "It's not a question of take it or leave it, but you've got to start somewhere in these things," a spokesman for the European Union, Eric Mamer, said. "We're at the beginning of a process, not at the end."

HEADLINE: Cleaner Air, Courtesy of California 

 BODY:
At a time when neither Congress nor the administration seems interested in significantly improving automobile efficiency, California has kept up the good fight and has now won an important victory. The Times's Danny Hakim reported this week that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler had agreed to drop their lawsuits against a California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient "hybrid" vehicles -- cars powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity -- over the next 15 years. Since other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in these matters, such vehicles may in time be available everywhere. This, in turn, could lead to progress not only on cleaner air but also on global warming and the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. 
 At issue was California's 1990 zero-emission rule, which decreed that 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state from 2003 to 2008 be pollution-free. That essentially meant electric cars, but since these have turned out to be a commercial dead end, California wisely extended the deadline and invited the industry to meet part of its quota with hybrids. The industry, which hates quotas, went to court, arguing that the rule was merely a backdoor way of setting new fuel economy standards, a federal prerogative. California retorted that it was interested only in reducing air pollution and that improved mileage would be a serendipitous byproduct. 
 The manufacturers apparently decided that California would get the better of the argument in court. The state has also agreed to regulatory changes that will allow the companies to make even fewer zero-emission cars and more hybrids. To meet its zero-emission mandate over the long term, the industry will now devote an increasing share of its investments to hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars.
The settlement could not have come at a better time. In the 2002 model year, the fuel economy of the average new American passenger vehicle reached a 22-year low, largely because of the increasing popularity of S.U.V.'s and other so-called light trucks. And while California says that its main objective is to obtain cleaner cars that emit fewer smog-forming pollutants, it is also true that hybrids tend to go farther on a gallon of gas than conventional cars and thus emit less carbon dioxide, a big factor in global warming. For the same reason, they also require fewer barrels of imported oil. 
Efforts in Congress to jump-start the production of hybrids by mandating increases in fuel economy have gone nowhere. California, often on the leading edge of environmental issues, may have found a way to accomplish what Congress has not.

HEADLINE: White House Fantasies on Iraq 

 BODY:
Someday, in the months ahead, there may be an Iraq where a smoothly run American occupation authority has dealt devastating setbacks to terrorism, brought security to most of the country, improved infrastructure and basic services, and elicited encouraging signs of democracy, economic renewal and cultural rebirth. Unfortunately, right now that Iraq exists only in the pages of the implausibly upbeat 100-day progress report recently issued by the White House.
 In Iraq today, American soldiers die, electricity shortages lead to rioting, and the threat of terrorism against civilians must be taken increasingly seriously. The biggest problems have been airbrushed out of the White House report, making it read more like a Bush campaign flier than a realistic accounting to the American people. There have, of course, been positive accomplishments, but making a success of Iraq will require much time, many billions of dollars and real sacrifices. Pretending otherwise risks future public disillusionment. 
 In the face of news reports detailing continued insecurity, failing basic services and painstakingly slow political progress, the White House cites significant signs of better security, improved basic services and emerging democracy. Not mentioned in the Panglossian report, covering the 100 days after President Bush declared an end to major combat operations, were the 56 American soldiers killed in attacks during that period.
Days after the report's release, Basra was swept by rioting over electricity and fuel shortages. While the report boasts of broad international support, Washington still scrambles to line up countries willing to contribute peacekeeping troops without expanded United Nations authority. 
Many of today's problems in Iraq can be traced to the Bush administration's tendency to credit what it wants to believe rather than more realistic accounts. It exaggerated the evidence on Iraqi unconventional weapons and links with Al Qaeda, underestimated the potential for chaos in a country that had endured years of war, sanctions and dictatorship, and misjudged the patience of the Iraqi people for putting up with postwar disruptions and an occupying army. All those delusions find uncanny echoes in the 100-day report.
In the real world there have recently been some hopeful signs that administration policies are beginning to reflect a more sophisticated understanding of Iraq. Future White House reports should describe that world, not wishful fantasies.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales in July Posted Biggest Rise in 4 Months 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
America's shoppers spent heavily in July on cars, appliances and clothes, catapulting sales at retailers 1.4 percent, the biggest increase in four months, a government report released today said.
 The gain in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department showed that consumers have been opening their wallets and purses wider since April, when retail sales fell 0.3 percent. That steady improvement is good news for the nation's budding economic recovery. 
 "The latest retail sales figures paint a picture of an economy that is rapidly accelerating," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.
In May, retail sales went up a solid 0.5 percent, followed by an even stronger 0.9 percent increase in June. The July performance beat analysts' expectations. They were forecasting a 1 percent rise in sales.
Retail sales, excluding both automobiles and gasoline sales, which can swing from month to month, went up a solid 0.7 percent in July.
Consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity in the United States, are the main force keeping the economy going. Their willingness to spend will play a crucial role in determining how vigorous the anticipated economic rebound in the second half of this year will be, economists say.
Some economists think that fatter paychecks and other incentives coming from President's Bush's third tax cut left consumers with extra money to spend and contributed to the rise in retail sales in July.
In a second report from the department, businesses increased inventories 0.1 percent in June, after trimming stocks 0.3 percent the month before, a sign that companies are feeling better about customers' demand for their products. Businesses had a 1.1 percent sales increase in June, up from a 0.2 percent rise in May.
Economists are hoping that businesses will build inventories, which are lean, through the rest of this year, something that would contribute to growth.
The retail sales report suggested that consumers' appetite to spend was hardy, with many types of merchants registering gains.
Sales by automobile dealerships rose 3.2 percent in July, up from a 0.4 percent increase in June. Automakers have been offering free financing and other incentives to bolster sales.
At electronics and appliance stores, sales advanced 1.2 percent, twice as fast as June's 0.6 percent increase. Sales of building and garden supplies rose 1.3 percent in July, on top of a 2.5 percent gain. Furniture and home furnishing sales went up 0.5 percent, after a 1.3 percent rise.
Clothing store sales gained 0.8 percent in July, after a 1 percent gain in June. Health and beauty store sales rose 1 percent, after a 1.3 percent increase.
Sales at bars and restaurants rose 0.9 percent in July, up from a 0.4 percent gain in June. At gasoline stations, sales rose 1.6 percent, up from 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Burlington Made to Order For Investor Seeking a Test 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Ask Wilbur Ross why he recently agreed to pay $620 million for the bankrupt Burlington Industries and he is likely to tell the dirty necktie story.
 A few months ago Mr. Ross, a Burlington creditor long before he became a would-be buyer, visited the company's headquarters in Greensboro, N.C. There, he watched, wincing, as George W. Henderson III, Burlington's chief executive, spread out a necktie and dotted it with blobs of ketchup, mustard and red wine. "It was a pretty expensive Hermes tie," Mr. Ross recalled. 
 But then the Burlington chief picked up a cloth, took a few swipes at the soiled tie and it was back to its pristine, unstained self. The tie's fabric had been treated with a substance invented by Nano-Tex, a little California company with a new way to make fabrics resist stains. Burlington owns 51 percent of Nano-Tex, and scarcely a week after Burlington accepted Mr. Ross's bid, he was talking about using Nano-Tex technology on Burlington fabrics and licensing it to makers of sheets, towels and other items Burlington does not make. 
"Putting just $20 million into this little business could do wonders for it," he said during an interview at the Midtown Manhattan offices of W. L. Ross, his buyout firm. 
Clearly, Mr. Ross is banking that new technology can help dig Burlington out of the hole that is swallowing the entire American textile industry. He knows that products from overseas, made with cheap labor, will continue to flood the markets, and that Burlington, like its American competitors, can survive only by shifting more manufacturing offshore. But he asserts that Burlington's strong brand, and a focus on innovation, can nonetheless keep it a viable American company.
He has made it the business of Burlington's staff to prove him right. Two weeks ago, he asked about two dozen Burlington executives to provide him with a detailed rundown on the strengths and weaknesses of various Burlington businesses, as well as a list of acquisitions, investments or joint ventures that could help them grow. His goal was to incorporate that information into a business plan for Burlington that he has promised to announce on Oct. 31. 
The deadline for the information was Monday, and Mr. Ross said that all the executives had met it. "We're going to look at each business and see what it needs to get more earning power," he said.
W. L. Ross's specialty is distressed companies. Most recently it bought money-losing steel companies -- notably LTV and Bethlehem Steel -- and combined them into the International Steel Group, which Mr. Ross said was now profitable and would soon go public.
A big part of Mr. Ross's success in salvaging the unionized steel makers, though, was the federal government's role in taking on the billions of dollars in pension benefits the companies owed to retirees, who outnumber the current work forces.
Mr. Ross cannot hope for similar help as he tries to revive Burlington. The company's remaining 7,600 workers (at its peak, three decades ago, Burlington employed 88,000) are not union members, and 1,500 of them are in Mexico. So benefits are already lean, and there are no big pension obligations.
Yet Mr. Ross says there is at least one lesson to be gleaned from his steel experience. "The blue-collar guys aren't your enemy," he said. "I'm going to make sure the Burlington workers buy into any game plan."
It will take more than an enthusiastic work force, however, to make a go of it in textiles. In the last year or so, Malden Mills Industries, CMI Industries, Guilford Mills and Galey & Lord all sought Chapter 11 protection. And just last month Pillowtex, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2002, filed again. It is being liquidated, despite its ownership of strong brands like Cannon and Fieldcrest towels and sheets.
"Our industry has invested hundreds of millions in modernization, yet it is still impossible to compete, and the situation is just going to get worse," said Barry Leonard, president of Glenoit, a large textile company. Glenoit, which emerged from bankruptcy in October, has survived in good part by moving much of its production to China, and using its dwindling number of United States sites primarily as warehouses and distribution centers.
Mr. Ross's plans for saving Burlington differ markedly from the ones that Warren E. Buffett evidently had in mind when his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, made an unsuccessful bid to buy Burlington this year.
Lees Carpet, Burlington's largest and most profitable division, might have been a perfect fit for Shaw Industries, a carpet company that Berkshire Hathaway bought last year for $2.1 billion. Mr. Buffett said that he intended for Burlington to report to Shaw, and few analysts expected him to invest much time or money in Burlington's other assets. (Mr. Buffett declined to be interviewed for this story.)
In contrast, Mr. Ross arranged to sell Lees to Mohawk Industries, another carpeting giant, even before he made his bid. One reason, he said, was to free money for investing in Burlington's other businesses. He also plans to cut Burlington's $50 million corporate overhead, and to sell or rent its huge, architecturally distinctive headquarters building. 
He said he would probably maintain a small headquarters staff in Greensboro. But even if he does not, the blow to the local economy will be more psychological than economic.
Ten years ago, about a quarter of Greensboro's work force was employed in textile or other manufacturing jobs; now, that portion is down to only 18 percent of the metropolitan area's 750,000 workers. And, increasingly, the manufacturing workers are landing jobs with nontextile companies like Timco, an aviation maintenance company; DaimlerChrysler's Thomas bus-making unit; or RF Micro Devices, which makes chips for cellphones.
"We were never a one-horse town," said Dan Lynch, senior vice president of the Greensboro Economic Development Partnership. 
As Mr. Ross ticks off his plans and hopes for all of Burlington's businesses, he sees growth opportunities for Burlington House, a $200-million-a-year upholstery fabrics business that, with carpeting gone, is now Burlington's largest operation.
"If they did more with branding and decorative fabrics, they could be much bigger," Mr. Ross said. "And if they added Nano-Tex to fabrics, so hotels don't have to replace chairs and such that often, they could be bigger still."
Denim, with sales of $150 million last year for Burlington, is the company's single biggest product. And it is quite profitable, Mr. Ross said, mainly because most of its production is in Mexico. He expects to use acquisitions and joint ventures to bolster the denim line. 
Burlington's uniform-making business, which he said had annual sales "in the tens of millions," gets about half of its sales from the American military, which will not buy from overseas suppliers. The government sales, Mr. Ross said, give Burlington the economies of scale to compete with foreign companies for industrial sales.
"All of these businesses can get bigger market share and be the lowest-cost producers," he said.
Even profitable textile companies, though, are rarely engines for growth. And Burlington does not have a corner on new technologies. DuPont Textiles and Interiors, a $6.3 billion business that Koch Industries is negotiating to buy from DuPont, just introduced elasterell-p, a fiber that can recover its original shape no matter how far it is stretched. And it has on the drawing boards diaper fabrics that can signal that the baby is wet, shirts that can monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and other items that work by building electric conductivity into fabric. 
"We have no intention of being viewed as a noninnovative commodity business," said Steven R. McCracken, the president of DuPont Textiles.
If Mr. Ross is firm in his conviction that Burlington can succeed, his is a convert's zeal. He began his involvement with the company as a short seller, betting that the share price would plummet. That was even before Burlington, then laboring under $1.1 billion of debt, filed for bankruptcy in November 2001. After that filing, he began buying up the company's debt. In its fiscal year that ended in September 2001, the company lost $91.1 million on sales of $1.4 billion.
Mr. Ross said his firm, as lead creditor, played a big part in persuading Burlington to contract out some production to low-cost manufacturers in China. That move, he said, freed cash that Burlington had tied up in inventory, and helped the company pay off debt.
He readily concedes that his ultimate goal is to take Burlington public again. But he says he is in no hurry. In the meantime, he does not rule out possible plant closings or exits from some businesses -- but he does not see them as inevitable, either. Burlington is now profitable, he said, and its debt is manageable.
"This company is not bleeding any more," he said. "And we just don't have to go in with a big machete and break it up."

HEADLINE: What's 50, Curvy And Full of Air?; 
It's the Wiffle Ball, Still Popular, Holes and All

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: SHELTON, Conn., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
It was just another summer evening in 1953. A man, down on his luck but hiding his difficulties from his family, came home, as he always did, to find his boy and some friends playing ball in the backyard, as they always did. 
 But on this night, an idea struck him. He saw the boys struggling with a small plastic golf ball, trying to give it what pitchers call action -- a little curve or a little slide. 
 "My dad comes home and sees us no-good kids trying to throw curveballs and throwing our arms out," recalled the man's son, David A. Mullany. "So he decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch." 
With that thought, 50 years ago on Sunday, the Wiffle ball was born. 
What started out as an idea in a backyard in this Connecticut suburb has since drifted into the popular imagination and now ranks with the Hula-Hoop and Barbie as quintessentially American toys.
And unlike some other fad items, the Wiffle ball remains as popular as ever.
"They never go out of style," said Evan Lederman, the sporting goods buyer for Modell's, which has more than 100 stores. He said it did not matter what age people were or where they lived, Wiffle balls sold well.
While he could not put a number on last year's sales, he said: "It's a lot. And as long as we have them, we sell them."
Adults have definitely gotten into the Wiffle scene, forming leagues from Costa Mesa, Calif., to Rehoboth, Mass. An organization known as the United States Perforated Plastic Baseball Association was founded a few years ago to help organize the sport.
Although toy companies have approached the Mullany clan many times over the years offering vast sums of money to buy the brand, the business remains a family affair. How many Wiffle balls they sell and how much money their company makes remains a tightly held secret.
"You have to do something in this life," said David A. Mullany, now 62 and the company's president. "And this is what we do."
Standing outside the same small, two-story brick factory here that has churned out the wispy polyethylene plastic balls with the holes in the top since 1959, Mr. Mullany told the story of how his father, David N. Mullany, came to be an inventor.
It was the turn of the century and the Mullany family worked a tobacco farm in Hatfield, Mass., making the wrappers for cigars. Mr. Mullany was the only one of the family's children who got to go to college, and he went off to the University of Connecticut.
But he finished school in the 1930's, in the throes of the Depression. 
"He couldn't find a job anywhere," his son said.
Fortunately, in college, Mr. Mullany had done pretty well for himself as a left-handed pitcher and the area around New Haven had a large industrial economy with many of the companies fielding ball clubs. 
Mr. Mullany bounced around the industrial leagues for a spell, living in the Y.M.C.A. in Bridgeport, until he got a break through a friend he met playing ball and landed a job.
But he had a family and was looking to do more than load and unload trucks. When a friend told him about a patent they could buy for a new wipe-on, wipe-off auto polish, the two started their own business.
At first, things went well. But through some bad deals, Mr. Mullany lost the company and was facing bankruptcy. He hid this failure, cashing in a life insurance policy and pretending to go to work each day.
"Things were tough for him, but he didn't let on," his son said.
It was just after World War II and, while much of the country was booming, for the Mullany family, things looked dim.
Then, on a summer evening in August, Mr. Mullany came up with the idea for the Wiffle ball. 
On the face of it, the whole idea sounds a bit like Tim Robbins's character's refrain in the film, "The Hudsucker Proxy," about the invention of the Hula-Hoop: "Y'know, for kids."
After seeing his son, then 12, struggling to throw a curveball, the two began cutting holes in plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics, trying to come up with a design.
"Most of the samples didn't work," David A. Mullany said. With his mother standing in as a batter, they tried balls with square holes, diamond-shaped holes and all other sorts of holes. 
Finally, they came upon the design that still exists today. Eight oblong slots cut in the top of a feathery plastic ball that weighs two-thirds of an ounce, less than a third of the weight of a baseball. 
But there was still the matter of a name. "The kids used to taunt a batter when he struck out, saying he whiffed," David A. Mullany said. So they decided to drop the "h" and trademark the name Wiffle.
At first, after mortgaging the house to finance the venture, they sold the balls for 49 cents each from the back of a station wagon and at a local diner.
In 1954, they became an incorporated company and hired a marketing agent based in New York. Soon, they were selling the Wiffle balls on Canal Street in Lower Manhattan.
And when they struck a deal to sell the product in Woolworth stores, the rest was history.
While there were all sorts of homespun games modeled on baseball, like stickball in New York, or corkball in St. Louis, or halfball in Philadelphia, the Wiffle ball was widely embraced.
"It has become something of an icon without even really trying," said Richard C. Malley, curator of technology at Connecticut Historical Society. He said it fit a pattern of other toys, like the Slinky, that were born out of the technologies made during World War II and fed by the optimism of the era.
"The whole postwar era was an era of prosperity and we had all these new materials that came out of that era," he said. "People looked at these new products and imagined other ways for them to be used."
The company has only made one major advertising push, -- in the 1960's, it got Whitey Ford to endorse the product and appear in a short film about how to throw the Wiffle ball -- but it ultimately decided it was not worth the expense.
The family, which employs about a dozen people, has distribution contracts with many of the major sporting goods stores. 
The price has risen only slowly. The suggested retail price for a Wiffle ball today is $1.29, about 70 cents more than it was a half-century ago.
The company has made several types of bats over the years, introducing the familiar yellow plastic version in 1959. It also makes Whiffle golf balls and flying discs. 
David N. Mullany died in 1990 and David A. plans to pass the business on to his two sons, David J. and Stephen, who now work at the factory as vice presidents.
On the walls of the office, they have old newspaper clippings along with a letter of thanks from Dick Cheney, then the secretary of defense. During the first gulf war, one of the items on the top of the soldiers' wish list was Wiffle balls and bats, so the company sent them a bunch.
"It's kind of neat to know that we are a little part of American history," David J. Mullany said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Thursday about the 50th anniversary of the Wiffle ball compared its weight imprecisely with that of a baseball. At two-thirds of an ounce, it is less than an eighth of the weight of a baseball -- not merely less than a third. (A regulation baseball weighs 5 to 5.25 ounces.)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Wal-Mart, Aware Its Image Suffers, Studies Repairs

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart, concerned about its public image, is using a consultant to analyze that image and has commissioned radio and television ads to try to reverse criticism from local officials, consumers and others.
 It is the first time that Wal-Mart, known for parsimony in its business practices, has invested in "reputation research" -- using polling techniques, focus groups and phone interviews -- and then spent more money to try to repair the distressing aspects of what it found. 
 The project began about two years ago at the suggestion of Wal-Mart board members, a company spokesman said, and is continuing. Regular updates are being given to the board, with one scheduled next month. The company's relationships with consumers, employees, bankers and community leaders have all been examined by the consultant, Fleishman-Hillard, a part of the Omnicom Group. Last but not least will be its ties to suppliers, who make and deliver billions of dollars' worth of goods to Wal-Mart stores. 
Such an effort indicates concern at Wal-Mart's highest levels about fallout from the company's rapid growth and enormous economic influence. With that ascent has come scrutiny of Wal-Mart's penchant for hiring part-time workers as well as its treatment of female employees, the subject of a pending federal lawsuit, and its resistance to organized labor.
Community opposition to building Wal-Mart stores has been vociferous in some places, and muttering is heard from time to time among manufacturers, which say they are being constantly pressed to sell their goods to Wal-Mart at low prices.
The project found that many people view Wal-Mart as a place of dead-end jobs, and that its performance as a corporate citizen leaves much to be desired. "They didn't see us as involved in the community as they might like," Wal-Mart's chief spokesman, Jay Allen, said. "They didn't give us good marks on listening. Sometimes it was as basic as the parking lot was not clean, and that's not treatingthe community with respect." 
To reverse the impression about its jobs, Wal-Mart is broadcasting three ads nationwide that portray it as a great place to work. Two of the ads feature women who work at Wal-Mart discussing their job satisfaction. "They give you opportunity to advance," says one, a black department manager who persuaded her daughter to give Wal-Mart a try.
Another, a white mother of two who is a district manager in charge of several stores, says, "It's not easy to have a career and a family, but my job makes it a lot easier to do both." As the camera panned over her tranquil home, she said she hoped to "set a good example for my boys, that they can go out and achieve absolutely anything." 
The ads, produced by GSD&M of Austin, Tex., also part of Omnicom, are appearing at a time when Wal-Mart is on the defensive over its treatment of female employees. A group of them filed a discrimination lawsuit against the company 18 months ago in federal court in Washington, and a hearing to determine whether the suit should become a class action, covering all of the women working at Wal-Mart, has been scheduled for next month. 
So far, the television ads have focused on correcting what Wal-Mart maintains is a false impression about its jobs. But a lawyer for the plaintiffs said he thought the ads were a direct result of the lawsuit. 
"The telling thing is that the ads are even here," the lawyer, Joseph Sellers, said. "My sense is that Wal-Mart has never run ads like this before, and that the timing is more than coincidental." The lawsuit includes accounts from many women, he said, about being told that "they were unsuited to management," and from others "who said they were told that the hours are too long, you should be home with your children." 
Mr. Allen, the Wal-Mart spokesman, insisted that the research, rather than the lawsuit, prompted the ads featuring the women. But he added: "We would acknowledge that we need to get better as an employer. The lawsuit has certainly heightened our awareness of that."
Among bankers, Mr. Allen said, Wal-Mart's image included problems that some consumers and local officials had cited, including low-paying jobs. "But it didn't really have an impact on the way they looked at Wal-Mart as an investment," he said. "Their questions were: Can Wal-Mart continue to grow in the United States, and are we well positioned to capitalize on the international opportunities that we have?" 
Wal-Mart workers generally gave the company high marks, Mr. Allen said. But pay and benefits did not get much applause. "People always want to make more money," he said. "Really, what you see for the most part is people want to be treated well. They want to be treated fairly. They want to develop on the job."
The lawsuit contends that women were often overlooked or ignored when it came time to promote cashiers and others to management positions. In January, Mr. Sellers said, the company began its first formal system for inviting people to apply for vacancies in an important management-training program. His attempts to find out more about the program were batted away by company lawyers, who said it was "attorney work product" and therefore not to be offered as part of discovery. 
"It was clear that they were inaugurating this with the help of lawyers," Mr. Sellers said. 
A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Sarah Clark, called the January change "an enhancement" to a program already in place.
More television ads are planned around other findings from the Fleishman-Hillard research, Mr. Allen said. Among the positives were that many people think Wal-Mart has a good reputation and that "we were easily the first retailer you think of with low prices," he said. "Even people who don't like us or respect us would not argue that we have the lowest prices." 
The negatives, though, also caught everyone's attention at the company's highest levels and are now pushing it to make changes. 
"We need to do these things," Mr. Allen said. "At the same time, we can't change who we are. We can't change what makes Wal-Mart Wal-Mart."

HEADLINE: Rochester Goes for Green, On and Off Championship Course 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The homicide rate is up. The main employer, Eastman Kodak, is laying off people -- again. And the candidates for the region's top offices are sniping at one another almost daily in bitter election campaigns.
 So naturally, Rochesterians have a lot on their mind. Like golf. 
 Will the surprise British Open winner, Ben Curtis, have a chance? Or will it be Tiger Woods who burns bright? And don't forget about the favorite son, Jeff Sluman. 
Rochester is playing host to the 85th P.G.A. Championship, one of the Grand Slam contests of the golfing world, which promises to provide an economic boost and mental distraction to this beleaguered city in western New York.
"Do we need it? Ab-so-lute-ly," said Patrick Marcanio, a bartender who was hawking Professional Golfers Association specials -- a $15 parking spot during the tournament, and a $12-off dinner coupon for after -- outside Hawthorne's Restaurant on Tuesday. "Oh my God, do we need it."
PGA officials say they expect the tournament, which runs Thursday through Sunday, to draw up to 35,000 people a day and pump $45 million into the local economy. While it is probably difficult to find a hotel room (nearly all of the region's 6,400 hotel rooms are booked), it is a good bet that parking spots are easy to come by. Many of those who live close to the Oak Hill Country Club, where the tournament will be played, are parceling out their manicured lawns with the eagerness of children selling lemonade. 
"Rochester is really a golf-oriented community," said Ed Hall, president of the Greater Rochester Visitors Association. "For those who love it, this is like a 12" on a scale of 1 to 10.
Oak Hill has been host to major golf tournaments periodically since 1949, when the United States Golf Association held the United States Amateur Championship. In 1968, Lee Trevino won his first professional golf tournament there, the United States Open, and became the first man in history to shoot four rounds of sub-70 golf in an Open, according to Oak Hill history.
The U.S. Amateur Championship in 1998 was its last major tournament.
Before practice sessions began Monday -- attracting 25,000 spectators in spite of water hazards from above, consistently gray and threatening skies -- much of the news here was bleak. 
In the last month, Eastman Kodak, which has been shrinking for the last decade, announced plans to lay off an additional 6,000 to 9,000 workers. The Rochester police vowed to step up efforts after it reported a homicide rate that was the worst in years. Candidates competing for the region's top offices are holding regular news conferences to criticize one another. 
"I don't think this will be any vacation from bad news," said Mayor William A. Johnson Jr., a candidate for Monroe County executive who plans to take his eldest grandson, Blaine Bromfield, 13, to the tournament to glimpse Tiger Woods. 
"These are just bad times, period."
Not so, says the current Monroe County executive, Jack Doyle, who is vacillating between rooting for Mr. Woods and for Mr. Sluman. "The PGA is a good opportunity," Mr. Doyle said. "Travel writers and site selectors are coming in. Golf is one of the selling points of this community."
As top-level business leaders come into town, Mr. Hall plans to show them what Rochester has to offer. "I think it's a great event," he said. "It reinforces the fact we can put on a world-class event and do it with style." He added that he was cheering on Mr. Woods, "everybody's sentimental favorite."
Mr. Marcanio, the bartender, was enthusiastically rooting for Mr. Sluman. "Come on, Jeff," he shouted at passing cars today.
Some have not chosen favorites. Richard Steamer, a Sunoco franchise owner, said he considered golf a "good way to ruin a walk." He was rooting for the spectators he expects will pay $20 for his makeshift valet parking service. 
David Metzger and Herb Ross, volunteer firefighters and PGA volunteers, admit that they do not play much golf. They were cheering mostly for the region itself. 
"This brings a whole level of excitement to the community that we don't really have," Mr. Metzger said. "It adds flair and fun."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Rockies: Colorado: Stress On the Ballot 

BYLINE:  By Mindy Sink (NYT)

 BODY:
 Stress, or efforts to reduce it, will be on the ballot for Denver voters this fall. Jeff Peckman, 49, collected enough signatures to force the city council to either pass his initiative, which would require the city to study ways to alleviate stress, or send it to the voters. Mr. Peckman said he believed that soothing music in public places could help lower crime and improve the economy. Council members say they regard the measure as frivolous, with one calling it lunatic and another saying it was causing her stress.

 HIGHLIGHTS

MONTREAL: FESTIVAL TO SHOW SLAIN FRENCH ACTRESS'S NEW FILM -- The Montreal World Film Festival will show the latest film with Marie Trintignant, left, the French actress who was killed earlier this month. "Les Marins Perdus," which had its premiere in Paris last month, will be one of the 439 films from 68 countries shown in the festival. It was directed by Claire Devers and also stars Audrey Tautou and Bernard Giraudeau. The festival, which this year honors Martin Scorsese, the Swedish actor Erland Josephson and the Montreal-based producer Denise Robert, begins Aug. 27 and runs through Sept. 7. Ms. Trintignant, 41, died on Aug. 1 in a Paris hospital from severe head and face injuries suffered several days earlier in Vilnius, Lithuania, where she was shooting a film. Her boyfriend, the French rock singer Bertrand Cantat, has been arrested as a suspect in the murder.

DALAI LAMA TO SPEAK AT CONCERT -- The Dalai Lama is going to be a busy man during his tour of New York in September. In addition to his four days of teachings at the Beacon Theater and his appearance at Central Park, he will speak at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center on Sept. 21 in a benefit concert for Healing the Divide, a new nonprofit organization that promotes culture, health, economic growth and technology in the Himalayan region. The hosts of the concert are Philip Glass and Richard Gere, and the performers are to include the Kronos Quartet, Jessye Norman, Anoushka Shankar, Hamza El Din, the Buddhist monks of the Gyuto Tantric Choir, Foday Musa Suso, R. Carlos Nakai, Nawang Khechog and Mr. Glass. The Dalai Lama, who will visit New York from Sept. 17 to 21, will speak to the public at the East Meadow in Central Park earlier in the day on Sept. 21. He last visited New York in 1999.

EDINBURGH: FRANKENTHALER PAINTINGS OPEN NEW MUSEUM GALLERIES -- The Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, currently the site of a blockbuster exhibition of Monet paintings, will open a new gallery space tomorrow with an exhibition by the American painter Helen Frankenthaler, "Frankenthaler: Paintings on Paper (1949-2002)." The show, which includes "Eve," above, is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, in Florida. It will open a large new exhibition space downstairs at the academy, which was founded in 1826 and is part of the National Galleries of Scotland. Ms. Frankenthaler has worked almost exclusively on paper for the last decade, but this show of 42 abstract paintings includes works from her entire career. Ms. Frankenthaler, 74, who was born in New York and now lives in Connecticut, was made a member of the Royal Scottish Academy earlier this year. The exhibition is to remain up through Oct. 26. Upstairs from the Frankenthaler show, "Monet: The Seine and the Sea" opened last week with 80 paintings from the period before Monet painted his famous water lilies. That exhibition is drawing record crowds. The BBC reported that 19,000 people saw the show in its opening week.

THEATER NEWS -- Two Off Broadway companies have announced their seasons for 2003-4. Theater for a New Audience, in its 25th season, will offer three productions: the New York premiere in English of "The Last Letter," an adaptation by Frederick Wiseman of a chapter from the novel "Life and Fate" by the Russian author Vasily Grossman, opening Dec. 18 at the Lucille Lortel Theater on Christopher Street; a production of Shakespeare's "Pericles," to be staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater in February; and "Engaged," an 1877 farce by W. S. Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame), in April at the Lucille Lortel. Primary Stages, in its 19th season, also has three productions, opening with the New York premiere of A. R. Gurney's "Strictly Academic," a bill of two one-acts ("The Problem" and "The Guest Lecturer"), on Oct. 21 at the Primary Stages 45th Street Theater. In January the company inaugurates its new performance space, 59E59, at 59 East 59th Street, with two new plays by Terrence McNally, "Full Frontal Nudity" and "Prelude & Liebestod," which are collectively called "The Stendhal Syndrome." The premiere of Julia Jordan's "Boy" is to run at the 45th Street space in April and May.

FOOTNOTES

Three Farms, a pair of free rock concerts in the East River Park on the Lower East Side, has had bad luck with the weather this summer. Two scheduled concerts, on June 7 and 21, were postponed by rain; even the rain date, June 22, was rained out. The festival is trying again on Sunday with a concert called "Who'll Stop the Rain?," with David Johansen and the Harry Smiths, Mary Lee's Corvette, Rachel Loshak, Andrew Vladeck and others. It starts at 1 p.m. at the East River Park Amphitheater, south of Grand Street. . . . David Bowie, above, will be broadcasting a London concert on Sept. 8 to fans in movie theaters around the world. The 90-minute concert is to be seen live by satellite in more than 20 cinemas across Europe and the following day in Asia and Australia. Fans in North and South American will see it on Sept. 15.

HEADLINE: Kentucky Race Is Test For Bush on Economy 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Improbable as it sounds, the first major test of President Bush's vulnerability on the weak economy may come this November in a state that he won handily in 2000, where his favorable ratings are still high and where Republicans hold seven of eight Congressional seats. 
 No one said Kentucky politics was predictable. 
 With a tenacity that has surprised his opponent and some supporters, the Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Ben Chandler, has attacked Mr. Bush's stewardship of the economy, contending that Republican policies have drained Kentucky of 56,000 jobs, aided the wealthy at the expense of the poor and helped drill a gaping hole in the state budget. 
"It's hard to believe that just three years ago, Kentucky had a surplus, had an economy that was growing," Mr. Chandler, 43, said Monday at a campaign event outside a shuttered I.B.M. plant in Lexington. "What has changed is the team in charge in Washington. And my opponent is in the starting lineup."
He has mocked his Republican opponent, Representative Ernie Fletcher, as "the job terminator." He jokes that Mr. Fletcher's motto is "leave no job behind," a jab at President Bush's vow to "leave no child behind."
The state Democratic Party has even created a Web site featuring a comic-strip depiction of an evil emperor -- President Bush -- conspiring with Mr. Fletcher to wreck the economy.
With his scathing attacks on the White House, Mr. Chandler has turned Kentucky, which has voted with the winner in every presidential election since 1964, into a closely watched bellwether of the 2004 presidential campaign, analysts say. 
If Mr. Chandler, considered the underdog, can ride voters' anxieties about unemployment to victory, it could give the Democrats momentum in their seemingly uphill quest to unseat the president, Democrats and political analysts assert.
"He has a powerful message," said Nicole Harburger, spokeswoman for the Democratic Governors Association. "I would not be surprised if the economy and unemployment become the seminal issues in many campaigns."
Kentucky Republicans seem bemused by the attacks, deriding Mr. Chandler as a "guinea pig" for national Democratic strategists. If anything, they have wrapped themselves tighter around the president, who has a 70 percent favorable rating in Kentucky, according to their polls. 
"If they'd like to run against President Bush," said Senator Mitch McConnell, the state's most powerful Republican and a mentor to Mr. Fletcher, "I question whether they are smart enough to take over the job."
Still, Mr. Chandler's assault seems to have put Mr. Fletcher on the defensive. In campaign events, he acknowledges that Kentucky's economy is struggling and that job creation should be among the new governor's top priorities.
But Mr. Fletcher places the blame on the Democratic governor, Paul E. Patton, who because of term limits must leave office at the end of the year. And Mr. Fletcher has made Democratic longevity in the governor's mansion -- there has not been a Republican governor in 32 years -- his central campaign theme. 
"Ben talks about change," Mr. Fletcher, 50, said in a debate in Louisville on Tuesday. "The biggest change he wants is to move his desk 100 feet."
Mr. Patton casts a broad shadow over the race in another way: his administration has been racked by scandal. 
Last September, the governor admitted having a two-year affair with a Kentucky businesswoman, reversing his earlier denials. The woman, Tina Conner, was indicted in July on federal charges that she used false information to apply for state highway contracts. She has pleaded not guilty and has sued Mr. Patton, contending that he pressured state officials to help her during the affair, then harassed her after she broke it off. He denies both assertions.
More indictments are considered likely, and the trial is set for October, just weeks before the election.
In June, Mr. Patton also pardoned two top aides and two union officials who had been indicted on charges of violating state campaign finance laws in 1995. The charges were brought by Mr. Chandler, who angrily called on the governor to resign when the pardons were announced. 
What is more, the state auditor said this month that more than 200 computers in the state's transportation agency had been used to search for pornographic Web sites. The F.B.I. has joined an investigation into the matter. 
Mr. Chandler has tried to distance himself from Mr. Patton, calling himself a "maverick" who had angered the Democratic establishment by indicting the governor's aides. But Republicans are not letting him off the hook.
"We have the most scandal-ridden, embarrassing administration we've had in years," Mr. Fletcher said in an interview. "To have him sitting in the middle of it as the chief law enforcement officer, it's going to be impossible for him to dissociate himself from it."
Despite Mr. Chandler's attacks on the president's policies, the prescriptions he offers for reviving the economy do not differ markedly from those of Mr. Fletcher. 
Mr. Chandler generally supports tax cuts, though he says he would give more relief to lower income families. Both men have endorsed tax breaks to encourage job creation and programs to retrain displaced workers. Neither has issued a detailed plan for closing a projected $274 million state budget shortfall, beyond trimming the state work force and cutting "waste and fraud." 
They do differ on the issue of gambling. Mr. Chandler has called for allowing slot machines in racetracks to generate revenue for schools. Mr. Fletcher has said he opposes gambling, but would be willing to hold a referendum on the issue.
Mr. Chandler, a former state auditor, learned about politics at the knee of his grandfather, A. B. (Happy) Chandler, a former governor and commissioner of baseball who epitomized a back-slapping Kentucky style of charisma. Mr. Fletcher, a former practicing physician and fighter pilot, is more reserved and formal, though he shows flashes of an acerbic wit.
Their contrasting styles were evident Monday night at a political picnic at Red's Fish House, a popular Owensboro restaurant. Mr. Chandler, sweating and garrulous, pumped hands and grabbed shoulders with the vigor of a masseur. Mr. Fletcher, stiff and cerebral, talked quietly with supporters and at times found himself standing alone.
At Red's, some Democrats expressed concerns that Mr. Chandler's attacks on the president could alienate conservative Democrats. 
But many Democrats at Red's also said they thought Mr. Chandler -- who barely survived a bruising primary and is running several points behind Mr. Fletcher in public polls -- had few alternatives. 
"What else do you have?" asked Wendell H. Ford, a former Democratic senator. "The only record the opponent has is in Congress."
Meanwhile, Republicans seem energized by the opportunity to retake the governor's office. The White House has dispatched the presidential political strategist Karl Rove, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and a Bush brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, to appear at fund-raisers for Mr. Fletcher. 
Asked if he expected the president himself to campaign for him, Mr. Fletcher said, "I sure hope so." Mr. Chandler said he would also welcome a visit by Mr. Bush. 
"We'll ask him if he brought along any jobs," Mr. Chandler said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 1, 2003

 CORRECTION:

Making Light Of the Season Of Absurdity

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IN California, people are annoyed with the governor they just re-elected, so they are threatening to replace him with an actor or a columnist or a former child star. In New York, the senior senator is so popular he could run for re-election with negligible competition, so a political critic tried to stir up opposition by accusing him of religious bias. And in television land, a network that labels itself "fair and balanced" is suing a comedian for using those rare words in a book title.
 The political scientists will no doubt tie themselves into knots parsing the dire implications of the summer of 2003, but we prefer to look on the positive side. It's August, the country is taking a break from pondering wars, orange alerts and unemployment statistics, and having some fun. 
 Consider the California scene -- 135 people are running for the punitive job of replacing the incumbent, Gray Davis, if he is recalled in October. The campaign, barely begun, is already tickling the political imagination. Imagine a 135-way debate. O.K., forget that.
Imagine Bill Clinton as an adviser. He is telling Mr. Davis to act gubernatorial. It is nice of him to help out. But isn't the way Mr. Davis has been governing -- from his handling of the state's energy crisis a few years ago to his management of its staggering budget deficit -- what got him in trouble in the first place?
Back in New York, which would never ignore the silly season, politics has produced a home-grown spectacle. The Conservative Party chairman, Michael R. Long, said in several interviews this week that Senator Charles E. Schumer had "an anti-Catholic bias" because of his opposition to some of President Bush's judicial nominees.
Mr. Schumer and other Senate Democrats have been fighting a handful of the president's nominees, arguing that they are far removed from the ideological mainstream and could impose their own views and philosophy on the law.
That, in Mr. Long's view, is being anti-Catholic: "I think he has a prejudice against anyone who is pro-life, for traditional family values, and who fights the gay agenda." When told that Senate Democrats, including Mr. Schumer, had supported dozens of judicial candidates who are both Catholic and opposed to abortion rights, he dismissed those nominees as "pro forma," compared with more prominent candidates.
Mr. Long's allegations were not made in isolation. The same day that his remarks appeared in The New York Post, Robert Novak wrote about the judicial battle in his column, citing charges of anti-Catholicism from Senate Republicans and the Knights of Columbus. He called Mr. Schumer "aggressive," referred to his "confidence and assertiveness" and cited his "massive war chest." Must be because the senator is from New York.
Mr. Long, who says the timing was a coincidence, was criticized by public figures ranging from Edward I. Koch (a Democrat) to Alfonse M. D'Amato and Guy V. Molinari (Republicans). But he is standing firm, and says he is still hopeful he might get someone to actually run against the senator next year. He declined to name names.
Mr. Schumer reacted to Mr. Long's charges by relating a conversation with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. "He said to me, 'Don't be the lead guy on the judicial nominees because the hard right wants this badly, and if you get in their way, they will be brutal with you, the way they were with me in South Carolina,' " Mr. Schumer recalled yesterday from Madrid, where he is vacationing. "I said to him, 'John, you forgot one thing: I'm from Brooklyn.' " He would prefer to be attacked on the merits, he added.
AL FRANKEN doesn't mind being attacked any which way, and why should he? A day after news accounts reported that he had been sued by the Fox News Network for using words they claim as their own in a book title, the new book made it to No. 1 on Amazon.com's best seller list, rising from the 400's a day earlier.
The network argues that it has trademarked "Fair and Balanced" to describe its news coverage and that Mr. Franken is besmirching it. So Fox, which truly is as fair and balanced as it is reputable, went to court to stop the satirist from selling his book -- "Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right" (Dutton) -- as is. 
Mr. Franken, on vacation in Italy, issued a statement thanking Fox for the publicity, and joked about a countersuit.
Or was it a joke? We shall ask again -- after August has ended.

HEADLINE: No Work, No Homes 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Talk about preaching to the choir. President Bush and his clueless team of economic advisers held a summit at the president's ranch in Crawford, Tex., yesterday. This is the ferociously irresponsible crowd that has turned its back on simple arithmetic and thinks the answer to every economic question is a gigantic tax cut for the rich.
 Their voodoo fantasies were safe in Crawford. There was no one at the ranch to chastise them for bequeathing backbreaking budget deficits to generations yet unborn. And no one was there to confront them with evidence of the intense suffering that so many poor, working-class and middle-class families are experiencing right now because of job losses on Mr. Bush's watch. 
 After the meeting, Mr. Bush said, "This administration is optimistic about job creation."
It's too bad George Akerlof wasn't at the meeting. Mr. Akerlof, a 2001 Nobel laureate in economics, bluntly declared on Tuesday that "the Bush fiscal policy is the worst policy in the last 200 years." Speaking at a press conference arranged by the Economic Policy Institute, Mr. Akerlof, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said, "Within 10 years, we're going to pay a serious price for such irresponsibility."
Also participating in the institute's press conference was Robert Solow, an economist and professor emeritus at M.I.T. who is also a Nobel laureate. He assailed the Bush tax cuts as "redistributive in intent and redistributive in effect."
"There has been a dissipation of the huge budget surplus," he said, "and all we have to show for that is the city of Baghdad."
The president and his advisers could have learned something about the real world if, instead of hanging out at the ranch, they had visited a city like Los Angeles (or almost any other hard-hit American venue) and spent time talking to folks who have been thrown out of work and, in some cases, out of their homes in this treacherous Bush economy.
The job market in California worsened in July. More than a million people are out of work statewide, and there are few signs of the optimism that Mr. Bush is feeling.
Officials at homeless shelters in Los Angeles, as in other large American cities, are seeing big increases in the number of families seeking shelter because of extended periods of joblessness. The pattern is as depressing as it is familiar: the savings run out, the rent doesn't get paid, the eviction notice arrives.
Tanya Tull, president of Beyond Shelter in downtown L.A., said the percentage of families in her facility had climbed from about one-third to more than half because of the employment crisis. The breadwinners can't find jobs, she said, "so they're losing their housing."
Ralph Plumb, president of the Union Rescue Mission on L.A.'s skid row, said his agency, traditionally a haven for homeless men with drug and alcohol problems, is providing shelter for more and more "intact" families. Their problems are not the result of drug or alcohol abuse, or mental impairment. They simply have no money. Forty percent of the people at the mission are there "purely due to economic issues," he said.
Ms. Tull and Mr. Plumb both said an important factor in the rise of homeless families had been the "reform" of the welfare system. Destitution is the next stop for people who can't find jobs and can't get welfare.
One of the families at the Union Rescue Mission was featured this week in a front-page article in USA Today. William Kamstra, who earned $40,000 a year before losing his job, looks for work each day while his wife, Sue, and their three children spend the day at a library. They sleep at the mission.
"Homelessness in major cities is escalating," the article said, "as more laid-off workers already living paycheck to paycheck wind up on the streets or in shelters."
That story ran one day after a front-page Wall Street Journal article that spelled out how sweet just one of the Bush tax cuts has been for those in the upper brackets: "The federal tax cut, which slashed the tax rate on dividends and prompted many companies to increase their payouts, is proving to be a boon for some corporate executives who are reaping millions in after-tax gains."
Some people have reason to be optimistic. It's the best of times, or the worst of times. Depending on your perspective.

HEADLINE: Citing Upturn, Bush Rejects More Tax Cuts As Vote Nears 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the sluggish American economy was on the road to recovery and that he would not push for a new round of tax cuts as he heads into his re-election campaign this fall.
 "We are discussing a lot of things, and we believe that the tax relief plan we have in place is robust enough to encourage job growth," Mr. Bush told reporters at his 1,600-acre Texas ranch here, as he stood flanked by his top economic advisers. "If we change our opinion, we will let you know," he added. 
 Mr. Bush did not rule out tax cuts further down the road, but his advisers said that he wanted to determine first how the economy responds to the most recent tax cuts that went into effect last month.
"The president made it clear he wants to wait and see," N. Gregory Mankiw, the Council of Economic Advisers chairman, said. 
Mr. Bush also said that "America is a safe place for people to fly" and that the arrest of a British arms dealer accused of trying to sell a surface-to-air missile proved his point. The arms dealer was arrested on Tuesday in a hotel near Newark International Airport in an American-Russian sting operation. The missile, when armed, is capable of bringing down a commercial airliner.
"The fact that we were able to sting this guy is a pretty good example of what we're doing in order to protect the American people," Mr. Bush said. 
Mr. Bush made his comments after a two-hour meeting this morning with members of his economic team, including Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Joshua Bolten, the new White House budget director. The meeting was held to show Mr. Bush as engaged and concerned about the economy at a time when the Democratic presidential candidates have intensified their criticism of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship and of the more than two million jobs lost since he became president.
In a 13-minute question-and-answer session with reporters in the hot morning sun at Prairie Chapel Ranch, Mr. Bush and his advisers offered no new initiatives or ideas to improve the economy. Instead, Mr. Bush repeated calls that Congress rein in spending, and said that the $350 billion in tax cuts enacted this year would soon lead to economic growth. 
"We believe it is more likely in the upcoming year that people are going to be able to find a job, and that's exactly what -- where we focused our policy," Mr. Bush said.
Democrats responded that Mr. Bush was fiscally irresponsible and that future generations would have to pay for the record $455 billion deficit that has built up on his watch.
"The debate has been much too polite," said George A. Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who participated in a Democratic conference call with reporters on Tuesday to counter what was anticipated as Mr. Bush's good-news pronouncements today. "There might be some question whether Bush policies are advisable. The proper reference point is that the Bush policy is the worst policy in the last 200 years."
This summer, Mr. Bolten said that Mr. Bush was unlikely to call for any significant new tax-cutting initiatives beyond existing proposals not yet enacted by Congress, like a move to make the repeal of the tax on large estates permanent. But today was the first time that Mr. Bush himself ruled them out. Conservative Republicans are considered certain to revive calls for tax cuts between now and the election.
Those attending the meeting at the ranch today were Stephen Friedman, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser; Andrew H. Card Jr., White House chief of staff; Harriet Miers, White House deputy chief of staff for policy; Donald L. Evans, Commerce secretary; Elaine L. Chao, Labor secretary; along with Mr. Bolten, Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Snow.
After leaving the ranch, the group fanned out to repeat the president's statements to White House reporters in the Crawford Middle School gym and to television correspondents set up with their cameras in front of bales of hay near the school's outdoor track. Mr. Snow indicated that he considered the event more than a photo opportunity and a determined job of White House salesmanship on the eve of the 2004 election campaign.
"It's important that the president talk to his economic advisers," Mr. Snow said. "He wants to be connected to the economy, he wants to let us know what's on his mind, he wants to spur us on to continue to work hard to do the things we need to do. I'll let you characterize it. I found it very worthwhile."
Mr. Friedman said after the meeting that the mood had been one of "guarded optimism" and that the group continued to believe that there would soon be the kind of economic growth that would lead to new jobs. 
The current rate of growth in the economy is 2.4 percent, and many economists say that in order to spur significant new job growth, the economy must expand at the rate of 4 percent. But Mr. Mankiw said today that he thought a growth rate of 3.1 percent was sufficient to add jobs, and predicted that the economy would be growing by 3.7 percent by the end of the year.
"The economy is like a ship, it doesn't turn on a dime," Mr. Mankiw said.

HEADLINE: NOMINEE FOR E.P.A. DEFENDS HIS JOB AS UTAH GOVERNOR 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt today defended his environmental record in Utah against critics of his nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, saying that under his stewardship, the quality of air, water and public lands in Utah had indisputably improved. As he described it, the success had been achieved by seeking collaborative solutions involving public as well as private interests.
 "There is no progress to be made at the extremes," Mr. Leavitt said in an interview in his office here, responding to accusations by environmental groups that he had been less than ideal as a steward of Utah's natural resources. "Progress can only be made in the productive center. There will always be those who feel their voice has not been heard, so there is a sense of disappointment. I understand that." 
 "But it's clear to me," he added in his first extended comments since he was chosen by President Bush on Monday, "that in collaboration you can create a mechanism for those voices to be heard even if they are not incorporated." 
Despite such amiable words, Governor Leavitt's record has drawn criticism from conservationists, who voice concerns about his warm ties with industry, especially mining, timber, oil and gas interests. Among the actions they cite are his secret negotiations with the Interior Department to eliminate protections for millions of acres of wilderness and his insistence on building a major highway through wetlands and fragile shore areas around the Great Salt Lake, a project stopped by the courts.
Others, however, have praised Governor Leavitt for keeping nuclear waste out of his state and for working against urban sprawl. 
Mr. Leavitt's remarks offered strong insight to the approach he would take as the nation's chief environmental officer. While he reviewed what he considers to be a long list of environmental successes in Utah, he declined to answer specific questions about his vision of national policy or his personal goals for the agency, citing what he expected to be contentious Senate confirmation hearings next month.
"My past speaks volumes about a willingness and desire to improve the way we conduct environmental discussions in the country," he said. "For now, I shouldn't say more than that."
Even as he mounted a proud defense, environmental groups in Utah and beyond were examining his 10-plus years as governor for examples of how they believe he has betrayed the environment in a state known for spectacular scenery and outdoor attractions. The list of complaints reflects the battles Mr. Leavitt has waged for years over issues from air quality to toxic waste to highway construction.
"I don't know of any environmentalist who thinks Governor Leavitt has done a particularly good job protecting the environment," Heidi McIntosh, conservation director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a typical observation from leaders of state and national groups who contend that Mr. Leavitt has been too willing to consider the economic needs of developers in matters of environmental quality.
But citing his own list of successful projects that have led to cleaner air and water, Mr. Leavitt argued that the old ways of problem solving, pitting environmentalists against developers in a zero-sum death grip, was too simplistic and no longer feasible in a country where military and security needs have placed new demands on federal resources and nearly every environmental dispute ends up in costly lawsuits.
"The facts are indisputable," Mr. Leavitt said, offering examples of improvements. "The water here is more pure than when I became governor, and the air is cleaner, not just in Utah but throughout the West. And our lands are in better condition."
Mr. Leavitt's approach to environmental challenges is based on a principle of balanced interests that he calls "Enlibra," a word created from Latin meant to convey the need to consult all sides to achieve a collaborative result. It stresses eight basic principles, including national standards but local approaches, collaboration and market incentives rather than mandates.
The Enlibra approach, adopted by Western governors, also urges measuring the costs of environmental decisions against the benefits, which has allowed Mr. Leavitt to cast himself as a moderate in one of the most conservative states in the country. He pointed out -- proudly -- that he was once booed by right-wing members of his party at a Republican state convention for supporting a measure that would ban the carrying of guns in churches and schools.
Yet now, with Democrats promising to make his confirmation hearings a proxy fight against environmental policies of the Bush administration that began under Christie Whitman, Mr. Bush's first E.P.A. chief who resigned under pressure in May, Mr. Leavitt said he was bracing for new rounds of criticism by groups that contend he is far too conservative, and too friendly to business interests, to serve as the nation's top environmental steward.
"I am nothing but satisfied with my environmental record," Mr. Leavitt insisted. "I think the facts bear that out. If one's agenda is to portray otherwise, they will do so without benefit of the truth."
While the concept of Enlibra was devised -- and named -- in the late 1990's by him and a fellow governor, John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat, environmental groups say the approach is little more than a thinly veiled ploy that shifts more responsibilities to states, opening the decision making to polluters and despoilers and undermining hard-won federal protections.
Ms. McIntosh cited several examples, including Mr. Leavitt's support for protections of the San Rafael Swell, a dazzling geologic landscape of 600,000 acres in southeast Utah, that were much weaker than environmentalists had sought. She also criticized Mr. Leavitt for quietly settling a federal lawsuit that preserved the state's control over little-used roads on federal lands, keeping them available for commercial interests.
Other environmentalists took issue with Mr. Leavitt today for not doing enough to ensure cleaner air, allowing too much processing of toxic waste in the state and supporting construction of the highway over wetlands.
Denise Boggs, executive director of the Utah Environmental Congress, cited uranium mine tailings that are polluting American Fork Canyon, which, she said, pregnant women and children have been advised to avoid. "God forbid the state would spend any money to clean it up," she said. "Mike Leavitt has been in office for 11 years and has done nothing to alleviate these terrible environmental impacts."
Hearing a list of complaints, Mr. Leavitt shook his head and said many environmentalists in the state and beyond might be unaware of what he considered rousing successes. Among those he is most proud of, he said, is his work with a task force to clean the air over the Grand Canyon involving 13 states, 13 Indian tribes and three federal agencies during the Clinton administration.
Another that he cited was a recently completed effort to clean up a huge copper mine outside Salt Lake City that became the largest mining water reclamation project ever undertaken in the nation. 
He said the collaboration avoided the need to spend billions of Superfund dollars and completed the task in five years, half the time it might have taken if he had not brought environmentalists, government officials and mining officials to the table.
Mr. Leavitt said he fully expected his opponents to do whatever they could to derail his nomination. "I'm ready," he said. "We'll see what happens."

HEADLINE: Court Blocks City's Plans For Bond Sale 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The Pataki administration sued New York City yesterday and won a court order temporarily blocking a bond sale the city had planned for next week, escalating a battle between the governor and the mayor over a deal to save the city $500 million a year.
 With the filing of the lawsuit, the dispute between Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went from a simmer to the boiling point. City officials angrily complained that state officials had given them no warning that the suit was coming, and that they had filed it in an Albany courtroom to keep the city from presenting its side of the case. The suit charges that part of the city's budget plan -- which was passed by the State Legislature over the governor's veto -- is unconstitutional. 
 Yesterday, Justice Thomas W. Keegan of State Supreme Court in Albany granted the state a temporary restraining order that keeps the city from moving forward with the deal until Aug. 25. The city had planned to sell $556 million worth of bonds next week.
The plan in dispute, which the Legislature offered the city in place of its request for a commuter tax, would allow the city to refinance debt left over from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. It would free the city of $500 million in annual payments to bondholders by allowing it to stretch out the remaining five years of debt for 30 years. The state agreed to pay back the new long-term loan for the city in annual installments of $170 million. 
Governor Pataki, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and budget watchdogs have condemned the deal, arguing that it is expensive and bad fiscal policy, and likening it to taking out a new mortgage to pay for last year's groceries. But city officials said they needed help closing a $3.8 billion deficit once the state rejected the commuter tax.
Yesterday, the Local Government Assistance Corporation, the state authority directed to make the annual payments, which is controlled by a board made up of two Pataki appointees and Mr. Hevesi, filed suit to keep the city from moving ahead.
The lawsuit, which reads in places like the news releases that the state has put out in recent days, calls the plan "a public policy disaster."
"If allowed to stand, it would unjustifiably burden state taxpayers for generations to come with $5.1 billion in obligations," the lawsuit says. "It is also unconstitutional."
Mark Page, the city's budget director, countered in a statement that the plan was legal and constitutional, and he noted that New York State had often resorted to the very kind of long-term borrowing to pay operating costs that it was now objecting to.
"It is nothing less than hypocritical to conveniently object to this structure when it benefits the people of New York City, and we will not stand for it," Mr. Page said.
But Pataki administration officials countered that existing state debt was not analogous to the deal the city was trying to move ahead with, which seeks to stretch out debt issued in the 1970's until the 2030's.
The lawsuit capped a week of steadily escalating tensions between the governor, who is on vacation at his upstate farm on Lake Champlain, and the mayor, who had believed that the city's severe budget crisis this year was behind him and that smoother fiscal times were ahead.
On Aug. 6, the board of the Local Government Assistance Corporation, which gets its money from the state sales tax, voted not to proceed with the plan to pay the city $170 million a year even though a state law directed it to.
Mayor Bloomberg threatened legal action and ordered the city to proceed with the bond sale. The governor made a counterproposal, offering to spread out the debt for 10 years instead of 30. But the mayor rejected the offer, saying it did not provide the city with the same amount of money as the Legislature's plan and required the city to go back to Albany every year and request a reallocation of funds, something city officials deemed too risky.
On Tuesday, in defiance of the governor, city officials announced that they were forging ahead with their plan. They said they would sue the state corporation to try to compel it to comply with the state law in a few days, and sell the bonds next week.
The Pataki administration moved to try to scare buyers away from the bonds. A senior Pataki official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was quoted as describing a small part of the bond issue as "junk bonds."
Then, before the city could file suit, the state beat it to the punch, getting the court order yesterday.
The state's action appeared to have caught the Bloomberg administration by surprise. 
Today, the city plans to go to court to try to get the court order lifted and have the case transferred to New York City. 
Pataki and Bloomberg administration officials accused each other of negotiating in bad faith. Mr. Page's statement said the state obtained the court order "at the very moment we were continuing good-faith negotiations with the state over possible alternatives" and added, "This action has brought negotiations to a halt."
A senior Pataki official countered: "They're the ones that broke down the negotiations. We're negotiating, and they released a statement announcing that they were going to sell the bonds at a certain time and sue on or around a date."
Throughout the battle, Mayor Bloomberg has carefully avoided criticizing Governor Pataki by name. Even Mr. Page's statement complains that "a nonrepresentative state agency is standing in the way of our recovery." 
He omitted noting that the governor controls the agency, and that the only two plaintiffs mentioned by name are his appointees: Carole E. Stone, his budget director, and Maryanne Gridley, a former first deputy secretary to the governor who is now the executive director of the State Dormitory Authority. 
But Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, who unlike Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg is a Democrat, seized on the opportunity to attack the governor as someone "trying to destroy the city's finances."
After Mr. Miller criticized the governor for hiring a "white shoe" law firm at public expense -- the suit was filed by Kornstein Veisz Wexler & Pollard -- a reporter noted that Mr. Miller had hired a white-shoe firm this year to argue his case to change the city's term limits law so he could stay in office longer.
"But that was for justice," Mr. Miller said. "And I never checked their shoes."

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE BALLOT; 
Race Officially On: 135 Are Candidates In California Recall

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was officially certified today to run in the Oct. 7 recall election on Gov. Gray Davis of California. But so were 134 other people, creating what will be the most congested ballot in state history and setting the stage for an election night count that could drag on for weeks.
 Even without legal challenges, which many people consider likely, state officials said it could take as long as 39 days after the vote to certify the results. The ballot will be longer than the one in 1914, when 48 ballot measures were put to the vote, state records show. 
 "Our next task is to turn our attention to the mechanics of Oct. 7," Secretary of State Kevin Shelley said in releasing the certified list of candidates, "so that we can work on the details of a smooth Election Day operation."
State officials did not draw a distinction between Mr. Schwarzenegger and the others on the official list, but they were possibly the only ones in California who did not. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has thoroughly dominated the early hustings, made another splash today when his campaign announced the addition of Warren E. Buffet, the billionaire investor.
"He is the greatest investor ever, my mentor, and my hero," Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a statement.
Even with respected figures like Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, and an entertaining assortment of porn stars, comedians and general malcontents in the mix, Mr. Schwarzenegger easily finishes at the top of most public opinion surveys.
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted over the weekend showed that 48 percent of probable voters said there was a good chance or a very good chance they would vote for Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican. 
"I am not necessarily certain that anyone can describe this in a fashion that sounds reasonable," said John M. Feliz, the campaign director for a fellow Republican, State Senator Tom McClintock, who is among the 134 other certified candidates.
"It is not a new star being born," Mr. Feliz said of the Schwarzenegger candidacy, "it is a mass that has its own gravity and its own orbits." 
On a day when he did not make a public appearance, Mr. Schwarzenegger still dominated the recall scene when his campaign announced that Mr. Buffett would be its senior financial and economic adviser.
Strategists for Mr. Schwarzenegger predicted the appointment would blunt criticism from both Democrats and conservative Republicans that the actor was not capable of running a state with a $99-billion budget and an economy bigger than the economies of all but a handful of countries.
The naming of Mr. Buffett, who will be unpaid, came a day after the Schwarzenegger campaign announced that it had hired three top aides to former Gov. Pete Wilson, including Bob White, a political fixture in Sacramento who served as Mr. Wilson's chief of staff. Mr. Wilson, a Republican, is a chairman of the Schwarzenegger campaign. 
"Warren Buffett is hot, don't you think?" said George Gorton, a political strategist to Mr. Schwarzenegger. "It shows the type of people Arnold is going to attract to participate in the recovery of California."
In the statement, Mr. Schwarzenegger called Mr. Buffett "a giant in the world of finance," saying, "he will be a huge help to me as we work to strengthen California's economy."
Other candidates, such as Mr. McClintock, the columnist Arianna Huffington and Peter Camejo, a Green Party candidate backed by Ralph Nader, kept to their campaign schedules today, but they were barely audible over the Arnold rumble.
That is not to say Mr. Davis and the others have given up. 
As the final certified list of 135 was being compiled today, an array of traditionally Democratic groups, calling themselves Stand for California, announced an eight-week campaign to urge a vote against the recall. The coalition will not take a position on the replacement candidates.
The recall ballot has two parts. First voters will be asked whether Mr. Davis should be recalled; second, they will be asked to choose a successor from the list of 135 should he lose the first vote.
"We are together on only one issue," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, "and that is the question of opposing the recall."
The Stand for California coalition includes groups like the California Labor Federation, the California Federation of Teachers, the Sierra Club of California and Planned Parenthood
"We've discovered through our polling that 78 percent of Democratic voters respond favorably to an anti-recall message that comes from community leaders like we have in this coalition," Mr. Pulaski said. 
Officials from the groups estimated their combined membership was about 5.5 million people in California. Though they will not be campaigning for Mr. Davis, their messages will emphasize the peril in removing him from office, they said.
"With ongoing threats to choice at the federal level, now is not the time to reject a pro-choice administration in California," said Steve Smith of Planned Parenthood. 
The labor federation said it alone was prepared to spend as much as $2.5 million on the effort.
State campaign finance records showed several candidates were busy raising money for an election that strategists from both parties predict will involve tens of millions of dollars in expenditures, regardless of the victor.
The cost to the state and 58 counties of holding the election, while still not determined, could run as high as $66 million, according to the secretary of state's office.
Mr. McClintock's campaign reported $33,000 in donations today, bringing his total for August to $267,500. Bill Simon Jr., the Republican who lost to Mr. Davis last November, reported $47,500, bringing his total for the month to $212,504.
Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, the choice of Democratic Party officials should Mr. Davis lose, reported $189,250 so far in August. Mr. Ueberroth, a Republican running a nonpartisan campaign, reported $103,000, and Ms. Huffington $105,500.
But Mr. Schwarzenegger even managed to steal the money show.
Most of today, the Schwarzenegger campaign statement showed no contributions in August. But late in the afternoon, that changed when Mr. Schwarzenegger donated $1 million to himself.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
Powerful Racing Association Gets New Scrutiny in Albany

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. with JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
When the New York Racing Association was founded in 1955, the goal was to consolidate the state's dilapidated racetracks under a charitable corporation that would devote its gambling profits to the state and pay for everything from schools to hospitals.
 In recent years, however, the racing association has made very little or no profit, and the benefit to the state, mostly in the form of taxes on bets and unclaimed winnings, has dwindled to $10.8 million last year from a peak of $45.3 million in 1987, state budget officials say. 
 Still, in the last six years, the racing association managed to persuade the Legislature and the governor to extend its unique franchise to operate New York's top tracks (Saratoga Race Course, Belmont Park and Aqueduct), each time without competitive bidding. Lawmakers also cut the tax rate on each bet at the track to 1.6 percent in 2001, from 5 percent in 1994, to provide more money for purses and improving the tracks. 
 The racing association argues that the rate cut, and not mismanagement, is the reason its contribution to the state treasury has dropped. Now the association has found itself the center of a growing political fight in Albany. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has said the tracks are rife with corruption, while State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi has suggested in a draft audit that the association is poorly managed. Federal prosecutors are also investigating allegations that its management allowed systematic tax evasion by employees.
 Yet Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Senate and Assembly have been reluctant to criticize the association, in part because the state is depending on revenue from the installation of video lottery terminals at Aqueduct.
 There is another factor. The members of the association's board of trustees, which includes many of the state's most powerful business executives, along with other thoroughbred owners, are politically powerful individuals who have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to various political campaigns. The governor and the two legislative leaders, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, have all benefited from their largess.
 Mr. Pataki and Senator Bruno both have fund-raisers planned in Saratoga next week that many in the horse racing set are likely to attend, aides said. Just last week, Mr. Silver's campaign committee held a fund-raising event at the Saratoga home of Barry K. Schwartz, chairman of the racing association.
 "They are a terrifically powerful group because of who they are," said Mario M. Cuomo, who butted heads with the association several times during his time as governor. "There has been a kind of reluctance to take them on over the years."
 But Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Hevesi, the two Democrats holding statewide office, have not been shy about criticizing the racing association. In a draft audit not yet officially released, Mr. Hevesi lambastes the association as having unsound budgeting practices and spending more than it takes in. Mr. Hevesi questioned, for instance, why the racing association had provided costly pension benefits to former top executives when its expenses outpaced its revenue for three out of the five years from 1997 to 2001.
 Mr. Spitzer has accused the track managers of cultivating a "culture of criminality" and of running "an organization that is, at best, indifferent to corruption." In a scathing report in June, he laid out a variety of scams that parimutuel clerks have used to fleece bettors. He has called for the management of the tracks to be replaced.
 Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, are investigating the association to determine if top managers engaged in a conspiracy to commit tax fraud. The inquiry stems from the convictions of 16 betting clerks for cheating on their taxes and centers on whether the racing association could have prevented that.
 Racing officials have said privately that the review of their finances and operations has become highly politicized because their franchise to run the tracks will be automatically extended to 2013 if the video lottery terminals are installed and running at Aqueduct by March 2004, under budget legislation passed this year. Some competing racing and gaming interests would like to see the franchise put out to bid, they say.
 The video-lottery terminals, which are similar to slot machines, are projected to generate about $400 million for education in their first year, the racing association estimates. They are important to horse owners and breeders, too, because a portion of the revenue will go toward purses and the State Breeding and Development Fund.
 As Mr. Spitzer has publicly flogged the tracks' management, the racing association has pushed back with a public relations campaign. Last week, it announced it was suspending the construction of a gaming building at Aqueduct that was to house the new video lottery terminals, saying its partner in the venture, MGM Mirage, said it could not go forward with the deal if the racing association were indicted.
 The trustees also maintain they have taken steps to tighten controls, appointing a committee, headed by Stuart Subotnick, the executive vice president of Metromedia, to look into the allegations of corruption and mismanagement.
 But some fiscal experts say the association lacks an incentive to make a profit, since all its profits, if it makes any, go to the state. 
 "Whether N.Y.R.A. performs well or poorly in different regards, there is no good mechanism for holding it accountable," said Edmund J. McMahon, a fiscal analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a think tank that promotes economic choice and individual responsibility. "This is because the franchise has been treated as virtually permanent, with no regular, systematicreview."
 Racing officials and lawmakers say the argument that they produce too little revenue for the state is both inaccurate and misses a larger point. Beyond the $10.8 million of taxes on bets and unclaimed winnings contributed to the state in 2002, the racing association paid nearly $18 million in real estate taxes and contributed $3.4 million to the state breeding fund.
 "They end up producing 40,000 jobs, people who work and pay taxes and buy goods and services," Senator Bruno said.
 In addition, racing officials say fewer people are attending races and an increasing number of people are betting off track, driving down parimutuel tax collections.
 One unanswered question is whether a for-profit racetrack company could operate under the franchise's current restrictions. The Magna Entertainment Corporation, a publicly traded company that owns, operates and manages 15 racetracks, has said it was interested in bidding on the New York tracks. Yesterday, however, a spokesman declined to comment about how Magna would generate revenue for both the state and its shareholders.
 Michael Shanley, vice president of the New York Thoroughbred Horseman's Association, which represents owners and trainers, says he does not believe it is possible.
 "We believe the only structure that works is a not-for-profit where all the money stays within the system or goes to the State of New York," Mr. Shanley said. "With any public corporation, they exist for the benefit for their shareholders, not the horsemen and not the State of New York."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE STING; 
F.B.I. Asserts Dealer Was Aware Airliner Would Be Missile Target

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON and PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The clandestine meeting between the arms dealer and the prospective buyer of the surface-to-air missile, the government says, took place at a hotel with a commanding view of the runways at Newark International Airport on Sept. 17, 2002, less than a week after the first anniversary of the September 2001 hijackings.
 The two watched aircraft take off and land at the nearby airfield, according to an F.B.I. affidavit unsealed today in federal court in Newark. The arms dealer, Hemant Lakhani, a Briton born in India, told the buyer, who was in reality an F.B.I. informant, that he was aware that the shoulder-fired Russian-made missile would be used in an attack against a commercial airliner in the United States, the affidavit says. 
 Mr. Lakhani also said, according to the affidavit, that he understood the economic harm such an attack would cause the United States. "Make one explosion . . . to shake the economy," he is quoted as telling the buyer, described in the affidavit as "a cooperating witness." 
The conversation was one of more than 150 secretly recorded by investigators during an 18-month inquiry that led on Tuesday to Mr. Lakhani's arrest in Newark on charges of trying to sell such a missile to American agents. The missile, one of dozens that the government says Mr. Lakhani was to provide, had in fact been made inoperable by the agents' Russian counterparts in a sting operation, however, and no terrorists were ever actually involved in the plot.
In an earlier meeting in New Jersey, on Jan. 17, 2002, Mr. Lakhani and the buyer discussed Osama bin Laden. According to the affidavit, Mr. Lakhani said Mr. bin Laden had "straightened them out" and had done "a good thing."
At yet another New Jersey meeting, on April 25, 2002, when the buyer told Mr. Lakhani that the missile was intended for a "plane" and would "hit the American people over here," Mr. Lakhani replied that "the Americans are bastards," the affidavit says.
Today Mr. Lakhani, who is 68 years old and lives in North London, was charged in a federal complaint with trying to provide material support to terrorists and trying to sell arms without a license.
Two other men arrested on Tuesday were also identified today. Prosecutors said one was Yehuda Abraham, a 76-year-old jeweler from New York. The other was Moinuddeen Ahmed Hameed, a 38-year-old citizen of India who, the government said, arrived in the New York area on Tuesday from Malaysia.
Court documents said Mr. Lakhani had enlisted Mr. Abraham and Mr. Hameed to help manage the financial arrangements for the arms deal. Both were charged with conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, but neither with any terrorism-related offenses.
All three men appeared in federal court today, Mr. Lakhani and Mr. Hameed in Newark, Mr. Abraham in Manhattan.
Neither Mr. Lakhani nor Mr. Hameed addressed the court at the Newark hearing. Both men were handcuffed, their hands in front of them and chains around their waists.
Mr. Lakhani wore a blue short-sleeve shirt and dark pants. Shortly before the 15-minute hearing began, he was seen animatedly conferring with his lawyer, Donald J. McCauley, a federal public defender who later declined to comment on the case.
After the hearing, Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, told reporters that Mr. Lakhani was a "significant arms dealer" who had promised to deliver missiles "specifically for the purpose of shooting an American commercial airliner out of the sky."
"There is no question that Mr. Lakhani was someone who was sympathetic to the beliefs of the terrorists who were trying to do damage to this country," Mr. Christie said.
American officials said today that it was Russian investigators who first came across Mr. Lakhani, when, they said, he sought suppliers for illegal arms among Russian crime groups. The case was the first undercover terrorism investigation that the United States and Russia worked together, and Larry Mefford, chief of counterintelligence and counterterrorism at the F.B.I., said, "This was an unprecedented example of joint cooperation, and we look forward to building on this success."
In the affidavit unsealed today, the authorities described how American investigators had tracked Mr. Lakhani's activities through the cooperating witness, who, it said, convinced Mr. Lakhani that he was a shadowy middleman for Somali terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda. That witness is expected to testify when the case goes to trial, but he was not identified in court documents released today.
In addition, the affidavit details how Russian security officers operating under cover fooled Mr. Lakhani into believing that they were black-market suppliers who had sold him a fully functional weapon, which, already made inoperable, was transported by ship from St. Petersburg to the Port of Baltimore and seized by federal agents on Tuesday.
The price for that first missile was $85,000, to be paid in $100 bills, with a $30,000 down payment, the authorities said. But in all, they said, Mr. Lakhani had agreed to provide the buyer 50 missiles at a total price of $5 million. American officials said today that the case was still being investigated in Russia, apparently because of the possibility that Mr. Lakhani might have been close to tapping into an arms pipeline.
As the case shifted to the courts, the debate about the extent of commercial aircraft's vulnerability to missile attack continued today. President Bush said at his Texas ranch that American airliners and airports were safe. "The fact that we were able to sting this guy is a pretty good example of what we're doing in order to protect the American people," Mr. Bush said.
"Today," he added, "the airports are much more secure than they were prior to Sept. 11. America is a safe place for people to fly, because we are working hard to make sure that our homeland security is strong."
But overseas there was new evidence of a threat posed to passenger planes by terrorists. British Airways announced that it had suspended all flights to Saudi Arabia through Sunday because of what the airline described as "heightened security concerns in the region." 
Law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia said the airline was responding to the recent arrest of several Muslim militants in Saudi Arabia who were reported to have been plotting to attack a British Airways plane as it took off or landed at the international airport in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, or Jeddah.
The arrests in the United States this week and the reports of further terrorist threats in Saudi Arabia appeared to bring new pressure on the Bush administration to respond to the specter of shoulder-fired missiles.
The House's leading Republican on aviation security, Representative John L. Mica of Florida, said in an interview that it was clear that the government would need to pay to install antimissile devices on at least some passenger planes, and that installation should begin with larger jets flying to international destinations where terrorism is a special concern.
"These terrorists are not interested in shooting down a small Cessna," Mr. Mica said. "You want to cover your larger passenger aircraft. They want to make a splash, whether it's in Kenya, where they've tried before, or in Saudi Arabia or someplace else."
Though he praised the Bush administration for its early efforts to study the problem, Mr. Mica suggested that the government might want to speed up the research and the deployment of antimissile equipment, like flares or electronic jamming devices. "I think we can do this on an expedited basis," he said.
While American officials said Mr. Lakhani was an established arms dealer, his neighbors in North London described him today as a quiet businessman and said they had no knowledge that he might have been involved in arms trading.
The affidavit portrays him much differently. In one conversation in October 2002, it says, Mr. Lakhani told the cooperating witness that although it was not an "easy job" to obtain the missiles, he could get "the merchandise" and that it would be "high-class stuff."
The document also suggests that Mr. Lakhani was aware of the dangers of illegal arms trading, which, it said, he described as more risky since the Sept. 11 attacks. Advising the cooperating witness against placing money directly into Mr. Lakhani's bank account, he said, according to the affidavit: "This business is getting so dangerous. No one has the guts to do it."
"I won't do anything," he added, "if it's risky."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. 

Museums

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 12). Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and three collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military might, its industrial clout, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. On the other hand there are more positive expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. A wacky installation by a French artist, Gilles Barbier, in the form of life-size figures, offers a wry take on the United States through its aging comic book heroes, viewed in the setting of a nursing home and in the last stages of decrepitude. The show has its weak spots but overall is provocative and visually compelling. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

"ANSEL ADAMS AT 100," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Nov. 3). This exhibition of 113 of Adams's photographs, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth, has been traveling around the world for two years. In these warehouse galleries it has a strangely random and homely feel. The photographs look small and lost. Maybe it's the setting. Maybe it's because the show, organized roughly thematically -- austere peaks, plants, peaks with plants, grand vistas, rocks -- doesn't have a clearly focused concept. Or maybe it's because the curator wanted to tamp down Adams's bombast and replace it with something quieter, smaller and subtler. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Sarah Boxer).

* MAX BECKMANN, Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 29). Like Beckmann, this retrospective of that German genius is dense, frequently revelatory and exhausting: -- all that heavy-handed symbolism and claustrophobia. Beckmann can seem like a truculent master, glaring balefully at us from his self-portraits, disappointed by our moral turpitude. It is easy to get bogged down in the miasma of his obscure allusions. But he also puts brush to canvas with surprising tenderness. Color is luxurious, not garish. The humor is sly and black. Finally, he is unavoidably compelling. Hours and admission: See above. (Michael Kimmelman).

* "BLACK PRESIDENT: THE ART AND LEGACY OF FELA ANIKULAPO-KUTI," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 28). The Nigerian composer, musician and activist Fela Kuti (1938-1997) invented the musical style called Afrobeat, relentlessly assailed political corruption and repression in Africa and beyond through his records and performances, and led a scandalous private life very publicly. This taut, vivacious exhibition is less about the man himself than about how 30 contemporary artists, most of them African or African-American, respond to his blazing, goading lodestar presence. Their reactions range from celebratory to critical, and few are simple, but his vision of a rejuvenated Africa still shines bright. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"ART CHANTRY: GREATEST HITS, VOL. 1," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-24 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084 (through Aug. 31). The argument against graphic design as an art form receives its latest drubbing in this revelatory survey, organized by Robert Nikas and presenting more than 300 posters and album covers by Mr. Chantry, the Seattle-based designer and art director. Dating from the late 1970's to the present, these works capture much of the vitality of the city's underground music and theater scene while defining a maverick sensibility whose inventive low-tech production values and polymorphous recycling of images adds a chapter of its own to the history of appropriation art. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).

"CUBA ON THE VERGE: AN ISLAND IN TRANSITION," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). Is it possible for anyone to photograph Cuba without some sort of romance creeping in? The concept behind this show of Cuban, Cuban-American and American photographers was to eschew "cliched images of vintage American cars and other remnants of a prerevolutionary era" and instead to "convey Cuba present," as the show's guest curator, Terry McCoy, writes in the catalog. But some of the photographs suggest that even as Cuba sinks deeper into poverty, ruin and prostitution, the romance of faded beauty and glamorous revolution won't go away. The most refreshing shots are those in which subjects confront the camera and the fantasy. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+ (Boxer).

"SALVADOR DALI: DREAM OF VENUS," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Sept. 7). While images of the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens remain ingrained in the American collective memory, one attraction, relegated to the "Amusement Zone," was largely forgotten until now: Dali's "Dream of Venus," a tacky Surrealist fun house with live, semi-nude women. This exhibition consists mainly of photographs that document the project from start to finish. Featuring the handsome, charismatic artist; his enigmatic wife, Gala; and lots of voluptuous, unclothed models, this show and its catalog tell a fascinating tale of idealism, opportunism, provocation and censorship. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+ (Ken Johnson).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th-century Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Johnson).

* "DREAMING IN PICTURES: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF LEWIS CARROLL," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). A photograph is at least as much a looking glass as it is a window. We see in it our own reflections and obsessions. A post-Freudian world has inevitably come to see C. L. Dodgson's photographs through the looking glass of his alter ego, Lewis Carroll. This provocative show tries to put Dodgson's pictures back in their context, to stress that we have lost touch with Victorian conventions, which Dodgson largely obeyed when he photographed little girls. Childhood to Victorians represented, as the show's curator puts it, an "alternate reality, a metaphysical state of preknowledge." Dodgson, he adds "could pose his charges in adult roles, give them guns, daggers and exotic costumes, even portray them as odalisques and half-dressed waifs, because he and most of his audience believed so emphatically in their total insulation from the implications of such postures." These presentations do not so much underscore the latent sexuality of the child (as we post-Freudians would have it) as they do an obvious lack of it." Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "FROM EXPRESSIONISM TO THE BAUHAUS: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Sept. 15). Borrowed from the Museum of Modern Art, this economical, powerfully resonant exhibition of German Modernist artworks from the first third of the 20th century includes Expressionist paintings by Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller and Emil Nolde; mordantly satiric New Realist paintings by George Grosz and Otto Dix; and sumptuously elegant utilitarian objects by Marcel Breuer and Marianne Brandt. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

"FROM PICASSO TO POLLOCK: CLASSICS OF MODERN ART," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 28). This selective anthology of perennial in-house favorites in a major museum has much to be said for it. The bait is irresistible, the promised classics turn up here and there, and both the young and the not-so-young have a fine time on the ramps. In addition to fine examples by Kandinsky, Picasso, Leger, Chagall, Kokoschka and Malevich, there is an enormous piece in ceramic tiles by Joan Miro. Begun in 1965 and finished in 1967, it is largely in black and white, but every touch of color sings out. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (John Russell).

* "HENDRICK GOLTZIUS, DUTCH MASTER (1558-1617): DRAWINGS, PRINTS AND PAINTINGS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 7). Goltzius (1558-1617) was one of the hottest of hotshot Dutch artists. He was particularly celebrated for his engravings, many of them mythological tableaus of pumped-up gods and pinup goddesses, rendered in the Mannerist way with flabbergasting elan. But he was also one of the great draftsmen of his age -- his landscape drawings prefigure Rembrandt and Ruisdael -- and became a virtuosic painter whose primary subject was bare human flesh: its texture, its color, its chemistry. To some eyes he remains strictly a period artist; to others he connects to the present in interesting ways. The Met show offers the raw materials for both reactions. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "LANDSCAPE OF MEMORY: THE ART OF MU XIN," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sept. 7.) The artist and writer Mu Xin, born into a wealthy aristocratic family in China, received a classical scholar's education and early exposure to Western culture. Targeted as a dissident during the Cultural Revolution, he was held in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he secretly wrote a series of first-person meditations now called "Prison Notes," which he carried out of jail sewn in his clothes. Under house arrest several years later, he executed a remarkable series of small landscape paintings in which traditional Chinese themes meet Leonardo da Vinci. The paintings and some of "Prison Notes" are brought together in this lean, penumbral exhibition, organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"LEGENDS OF OUR TIMES: NATIVE RANCHING AND RODEO LIFE ON THE PLAINS AND THE PLATEAU," National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through March 7). This lively account of man, woman and horse among the native people in Western reaches of the United States and Canada proves that a cowboy can be an Indian, and vice versa. The show depicts native peoples not as objects of exploitation by the white man but as ranchers, cowboys, entertainers and rodeo performers. It displays more than 700 objects -- saddles, bead and quill works, paintings, photographs, blankets, clothing, horse gear, hunting implements, roundup equipment, headdresses and other ceremonial garb -- from the 18th century to now. At least half of this huge show provides an engaging and comprehensive account of rodeo, but nonrodeo fans will probably have more fun with the bedazzlement of objects depicting the more traditional side of American Indian life. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdaysuntil 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

"USDESIGN 1975-2000," Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Nov. 2). This survey of objects designed during the 20th century's last quarter is disappointing, partly because few of the products on view are very interesting to look at and partly because it sheds so little light on a field that has expanded in a mind-boggling variety of directions in recent years. Focused mainly on consumer goods like chairs, clocks, lamps, teapots, telephones, sneakers, ski boots, roller blades, sunglasses and computers, it has the feel of an outmoded department store. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

"WILLEM VAN TETRODE: BRONZE SCULPTURES OF THE RENAISSANCE," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sept. 7). This exhibition introduces a neglected Dutch artist who flourished amid the cultural ferment of 16th-century Italy, when the rediscoveries of monumental Classical marbles helped fuel a passion for mythological themes, the rise of private collecting and a new sense of physical and emotional drama in sculpture. Prodigiously talented, van Tetrode navigated his own path between Classicism and Mannerism with beautifully detailed bronzes, most notably a splendidly muscled and bearded Hercules dispatching various labors with violent panache. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Smith).

"ANDY WARHOL: SCREEN TESTS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 1). From 1964 to 1966, Warhol shot 500 short, silent, black-and-white films of artists, musicians, actors, writers, filmmakers, models, curators, celebrities and hangers-on at the Factory. The Modern has restored 277 of these screen tests, representing about 34 hours of watching time, and now 28 of the films are being shown continuously on six screens. The subjects include Baby Jane Holzer, Salvador Dali, James Rosenquist, Dennis Hopper, Cass Elliott and Susan Sontag -- but they are of variable interest. By shooting the films at one speed and playing them more slowly, Warhol exposed the mechanics of discomposure and charisma. Some people are fascinating as they lose charisma; others are not. It has nothing to do with handsomeness, histrionics, coolness, slimness, trying or giving up. The typology of charisma is as elusive as the typology of criminality. Hours and admission: See above (Boxer).

Galleries: Uptown

TED FAIERS, "Paintings From the 1950's," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through Aug. 29). Indian Space painting was a mid-20th-century American movement that mixed Cubist abstraction with Native American-style patterns and pictographs. Faiers's exercises in that now dimly remembered style have, at best, an appealing jazziness and chromatic radiance. There is something ultimately silly, though, about the idea of the sophisticated urbanite getting in touch with his inner shaman (Johnson).

TONY FOSTER, "Watermarks," James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Aug. 23). Mr. Foster is yet another Englishman whose art revolves around travel. Finding his way from South American tropical forests to glaciers in Greenland, he neatly documents what he sees in watercolor; he then adds found objects like bones, shells, vials of water, rocks and feathers. The art in the gallery is not as adventurous as the artist himself seems to be (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

"H2O," Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through Aug. 22). For obvious reasons a lot of summer group shows take water as a theme, this one more directly and more effectively than most. Works by more than 30 artists include Sally Mann's mysterious photograph of three naked, nubile girls urinating; a piece of magic illusionism by Amy Jenkins that has a bathing woman video-projected into a miniature bathtub; Laura Aguilar's portrait of her own mountainously corpulent self lying naked next to a small rock pool; and a gigantically enlarged sweat gland reproduced in rubber by Jeanne Silverthorne (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

"FROM GASLIGHTS TO TELEVISION," Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-7335 (through Aug. 28). Typewriters, stoves, refrigerators, clocks, pumps, sewing machines, telephones, fans, ice cream makers, irons and other labor-saving devices turn up in this surprising show about appliances in 20th-century American domestic life. From John Sloan's sexy etching of a woman turning off the light before joining her lover in bed to Louise Leech's painting of her teenage daughters watching the first Moon landing on television, the show conjures an engagingly humane vision of living with modern technology (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

ANSEL ADAMS, "100 + 1," Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 989-2947 (through Aug. 22). Great modern artist or purveyor of high-toned kitsch? Coinciding with the retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, this substantial show affords a fine occasion to weigh the evidence. Looking at Adams's skillfully manipulated, Wild West landscapes, one feels less awakened to the wondrous complexities of photography and nature than bludgeoned by a proto-Spielbergian romanticism (Johnson).

"BOYS OF SUMMER," ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020 (through Sept. 6). If you like to look at men, and you're passing by, stop in. Standing out among the crowd of pictures by more than two dozen photographers are "Bruce in His Car," a 1981 portrait of a skinny bohemian in his big red convertible by Nan Goldin; a beefy, shirtless young football player celebrating with his team, by Brian Finke; men in leather, by Barbara Nitke; and, by Malerie Marder, a large color image of a mixed-sex group of naked people relaxing in a California bathhouse (Johnson).

"FRANKENSTEIN (OR IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL SOMEONE LOSES AN EYE)," Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, (through Aug. 22). Organized by Ethan Sklar, the gallery's director, this exhibition examines the ways artists subvert the physical and decision-making processes of art making by using machines, accident, science, random selection and all-inclusiveness and has a title perfectly suited to its sometimes scary weirdness (Smith).

* "HALF AIR," Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889 (through Aug. 29). Everything in this fascinating reliquary of a show looks like it was exhumed from some moldy basement. It includes enigmatic, semi-abstract symbolist paintings by Forrest Bess; mesmerizing, diagrammatic linear compositions by Genn Branca; videos of the performance artist Charlemagne Palestine whipping himself into Dionysian frenzies; snapshots documenting the demimonde of the performance artist Jack Smith; and scenes from a Wooster Group film featuring the seaside antics of cross-dressed nuns (Johnson).

* "IN FULL VIEW," Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through Sept. 13). A show that invites visitors on a pluralistic treasure hunt for 18 artworks that tease one's limits of visual perception. Look for Christopher Chiappa's Ford Taurus gas-tank door built into the wall; Maurizio Cattelan's roosting stuffed pigeons; Vincent Shine's tiny, gold Brancusian wasp; Jim Hodges's jewelry-chain spiderweb and Charles Ray's classic "Rotating Disc" (Johnson).

"LIGHT AS AIR," Fischbach, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 759-2345 (through Aug. 22). Most remarkable of all in this 26-artist show is Victoria Gitman's actual-size picture of a moth-shaped silver brooch, its extremely fine filigree painted with eye-straining exactitude. Kevin King's painting of two white swans flying low at a man on railroad tracks is haunting; George Nick's picture of a Victorian house is juicy; and Meg Shields's small painting of an ordinary neighborhood with water tanks towering in the background is nostalgic but not sentimental (Johnson).

ANDREI MOLODKIN, Kashya Hildebrand, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 366-5757 (through Sept. 13). This skillful Russian draftsman has a heavy-handed way with popular and political symbols. He draws giant parodies of "I Love N.Y." or "I Love Sex" bumper stickers, replacing the valentine heart with anatomically accurate skulls. Also on view is a double portrait of Lenin and Stalin. What's most interesting is not the imagery but how these enormous drawings are made: entirely with a blue ballpoint pen (Johnson).

"SPLIT," Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Sept. 6). The best thing in this six-person show is Xavier Veilhan's bigger-than-life skeleton woven in wicker; it slouches casually in a corner of the gallery, a marvel of exotic faux-folk art. Note, too, a dense mix of cartoon characters and abstract patterning painted collaboratively in gouache by Christian Schumann and Gary Panter (Johnson).

"VACATION," Spike, 547 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4100 (through Sept. 20). Innocence and experience collide in the works of Norm Magnusson, who outlines juvenile, coloring-book-style images over gridded fields of pages from pointedly selected books. Jesus offering guidance to a little boy is drawn over pages from Bulfinch's "Mythology," for example, and paper-doll clothes over "Lolita." Also on view: Buck Henri's engaging photographs of exotic dancers, old cars, mannequins, small-town parades and other subjects; Alan Schmer's illustrative paintings of farm animals; and Melissa Stern's pedestal-size figurative sculptures that blend Surrealism and primitivism (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "ART OF THE FIRST CITIES: THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDUS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). The most timely exhibition in years, as well as diplomatically dexterous and beautiful. It surveys the culture of the third millennium B.C., mainly centered in Mesopotamia, the crucible of Sumerian civilization, where art, architecture, law and writing developed with the rise of the earliest cities. The beginnings of a cosmopolitan art are in tiny cylinder seals and in figurines. The show is full of small objects that are monumental in concept. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"FROM THE NECK UP," Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through today). The human head is here subjected to a cranium-spinning array of treatments in clay. Highlights include a funky, Strangelovian monument called "Crazy Nuke," by Robert Arneson; a sweet yet rugged oversize boy's head, by Elise Siegel; an extremely craggy bust that resembles a natural geological wonder, by Jean-Pierre Larocque; variously glazed portraits notable for their expressive mobility, by Louise Radochonksi; and a faux-neo-Classical bust of General Douglas MacArthur by the Japanese sculptor Akio Takamori (Johnson).

RACHEL HARRISON, HIRSCH PERLMAN, DIETER ROTH, JACK SMITH, REBECCA WARREN, Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea,(212) 243-0200 (through today). This show by European and American artists from different generations pays tribute to the ability to conjure loony, often sexual excess from next to nothing in terms of materials or techniques. A museum-quality effort organized by Jeffrey Peabody, the gallery's director, it sings the body electric in clay, found materials, altered stuffed animals and photography (Smith).

"MANET AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: THE BATTLE OF U.S.S. KEARSARGE AND C.S.S. ALABAMA," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). Along with many of his countrymen, the thoroughly French painter Edouard Manet was fascinated by a celebrated battle of the American Civil War that took place off Cherbourg in 1864: the fight between the Union sailing ship U.S.S. Kearsarge and the Confederate raider C.S.S. Alabama. Although he missed the battle itself, which ended in victory for the Kearsarge, he was inspired to make an imaginary rendition of it, and several weeks later, visiting the victorious Kearsarge at anchor off Boulogne, he painted the ship itself at first hand. His innovative paintings, with their striking compositional effects and fresher, freer brushwork, had an influence on other artists of the period, notably Monet, Whistler and Courbet. They are on view with other material bearing on the incident: photographs, memorabilia and paintings by others (among them a stunner by Monet). A bold depiction of the sea and ships, very different from the tight, literal renderings of more conventional marine artists, Manet's work helped lead the way to the radical brushwork of Impressionism. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* "THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF CHARLES SHEELER," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). This majestic progression of 90 vintage prints will cause some ripples in the big familiar pond of American Modernism, within which Sheeler is known foremost as one of the chief instigators of Precisionist painting. But his most profound, original response to Cubism came through the camera, in tautly composed photographs of Pennsylvania farmhouses and barns, New York skyscrapers and Ford's River Rouge factory. Their confident fusion of abstraction and fact, reverence and scrutiny, puts them among the most radical art of their time; and they are an important precursor, at least in spirit, to Pop and Minimalism. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

OLAV WESTPHALEN, "The First Long Island City Blimp Derby," Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750 (through tomorrow). The Blimp Derby, produced by Mr. Westphalen, took place on June 28. You can still see the track painted on the floor where contestants steered their ungainly, remote-control miniature dirigibles; the lumpy, handmade and clumsily painted silver winner's trophy; and painted on one wall in delicate gray washes, an advertisement for the race sponsor, Budweiser (Johnson).

"DIRT WIZARD," Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, at Leonard Street, Williamsburg, (718) 302-4702 (through Monday). Organized by the artist Kathy Grayson, this ambitious show of paintings, drawings and wall paintings uses the work of emerging artists like Keegan McHargue, Matt Leines, Maya Hayuk, Xylor Jane and Justin Samson. It highlights the graffiti-based drawing wizardry emanating from the East and West Coasts, as well as a spiritual and stylistic meeting of East and West in the global sense (Smith).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
From Small Sculptures to Glimpses of Signs, a Mix of Works in the Bronx

BYLINE:  By KEN JOHNSON 

 BODY:
No one ever said it would be easy to achieve a self-sustaining art career in New York. Even artists who have lived in the city for years remain mystified by the commercial system's apparent impenetrability. Yet there are lots of artists who do manage it. How do they do it?
 One answer is: Make great art and they will come. Summoned by the vibes of your art, the dealers, curators and collectors will magically appear at your studio door. The other answer is: It's a business, so deal with it. Make art good, bad or indifferent and then learn how to sell it -- and yourself. This is the approach favored by Artists in the Marketplace (A.I.M.), an artist-supporting program, now in its 23rd year, that focuses not on helping artists make better art but on helping them learn effective ways of marketing their work. 
 Over the course of two 12-week series of seminars, young and emerging artists are introduced to commercial gallery dealers, and to other successful artists, critics, curators, arts administrators, foundation representatives, publicists and even lawyers, who teach them about grant writing, contract negotiations, curatorial practices, pricing, portfolio presentation and so on. At the end of the year, the 35 participants are given a big group show, and this year's edition is on view now at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
Although it resembles one, the A.I.M. show is not a student exhibition. The artists are out of school and have embarked on their various professional journeys. But it is not the Whitney Biennial; it is not about fresh new things currently animating the art world. A few of these artists might eventually make themselves known in contemporary art, but if the next Matthew Barney or Lisa Yuskavage is among them, there is no evidence of it yet.
Most of the artists are doing the kinds of work that graduate students all over the nation are producing: slightly oversize, conceptually portentous color photographs laminated to panels; layered pastiches of appropriated cartoon imagery; oblique, politically tendentious videos; neat constructions mixing Minimalism and references to vernacular culture.
Most of the work in the show is well executed, but most of it is also so obviously derivative that it could revive a belief in originality in even the most hidebound neo-Marxist. But there is only one painting in the entire show -- Antonio Vigil's expansive cityscape painted with a sensuously meticulous touch -- which seems odd, considering what an active presence painting has had in New York galleries over the last couple of years. 
At the risk of sounding too harsh, it's hard to escape the feeling that what is most urgently needed here is not career coaching but some constructive critical input. Does this cast doubt on the A.I.M. program? Maybe, maybe not. This is not the place to judge its effectiveness at producing smarter career managers.
In any case, on a positive note, there are some appealing artworks in the show. Jeongtae Chae, for one, produces economical sculptural works out of ordinary found materials that are remarkable for their optical effects. A radiating ring of white plastic forks on the floor, called "Flower," for example, creates a pulsating composition of concentric patterns. And a grid of short cardboard tubes, each holding within it a plastic pipe section in red, black or white is similarly captivating.
Also absorbing to look at are Joe Fig's small sculptures of artists' painting tables, crowded with tubes, cans, bottles and brushes. These doll-house-scale works, which include lots of paint splattering and detritus, are not just feats of miniaturism. They represent the work tables of specific artists, including those of April Gornick and Gary Stephan. So they are, in a sense, indirect portraits, as well as sociological documents of a certain vein of professional art-making. 
The most enjoyable video is Kate Gilmore's, in which she appears to be trying to bring order to extremely messy situations. Dressed sensibly in black like an office temp worker, she stacks papers, envelopes and other clerical detritus into shaky towers that keep falling over. It's mildly funny, but the artist's earnest persistence is oddly moving as well. 
Each artist has provided a brief statement about his or her work. Some are more helpful than others. One of the best is by Hidemi Sato, who writes: "When I was a little girl in Japan, I saw the movie 'American Graffiti' on TV. I was amazed by the color in the film. Everybody was dressed in bright clothes: all of the cars and furniture were extremely colorful. I felt it was very American and it filled me with happy feelings."
This is how Ms. Sato explains her practice of what she calls "Happie Photographie," which consists of expansive, gridded arrangements of fragmentary glimpses of fast food restaurant signs, gas station signs and billboards, all seen against backgrounds of deep blue sky. For all its beautiful superficiality, there's a mysterious, poetic profundity to this work.

"A.I.M. 23" is at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, through Sept. 28.

AMERICA'S SPLENDID LITTLE WARS
A Short History of U.S. Military Engagements: 1975-2000
By Peter Huchthausen
Illustrated. 254 pages. Viking. $25.95.
 Barely a generation separates two milestones in the history of the United States military: in March 1973, the last American combat troops departed from Vietnam, demoralized standard-bearers of the nation's most ignominious modern failure at arms. Thirty years later, United States forces this past March began an invasion of Iraq that will likely be remembered as one of the most rapid conquests ever of a large nation. Between these two events lies an extraordinary story of regeneration and adaptation. 
 A full accounting of how the post-Vietnam military, a "hollow army," in the famous phrase of Gen. Edward C. Meyer, became a world-bestriding force has yet to be written. It is a work in need of an author not least because military might has become an outsize aspect of American power. Other Western countries have generous welfare states; the United States alone has a military that can project force anywhere on the globe, fight and win.
America's technological advantage in warfare has become so large that, despite the ritual references to coalition forces, the Pentagon finds it more of a burden than a benefit to have allies in combat. (It demonstrated this by turning down offers of assistance for the fighting in Afghanistan. The Department of Defense's desire for assistance in peacekeeping is another issue entirely.)
Remarkably, the Bush administration shows no sign of resting content with the current enormous superiority to all conceivable rivals. Defense spending has been rising for the last five years, and Congress is currently putting the final touches on a national security budget of $400 billion, or about 10 percent more in real dollars than the United States spent in an average year in the cold war. That does not include the $75 billion cost of operations in Iraq. 
In "America's Splendid Little Wars: A Short History of U.S. Military Engagements: 1975-2000," Peter Huchthausen has written a prelude to this subject, surveying the period that began with the Mayaguez incident, in which Khmer Rouge forces seized an American merchant container ship, and ended with NATO's defeat of Serb forces in Kosovo. The title, adapted from the diplomat John Milton Hay's description of the Spanish-American War, is ironic, as the author acknowledges. With ample chapters devoted to debacles like Desert One, the failed effort to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980, and the 1992-93 deployment in Somalia, little splendor is on display.
These sections are accompanied by others covering eight more engagements, including interventions in Grenada, Bosnia and Kosovo, the reflagging and escorting of merchant ships in the Persian Gulf, the hunt for Manuel Noriega in Panama and the 1991 Persian Gulf war. In clean and economic prose, Captain Huchthausen, a retired Navy officer, delivers a historical background to each engagement of the United States military and a concise narrative of the action.
The author takes a traditionalist's approach and dwells on those episodes in which shots were fired -- or should have been -- instead of ones that saw American troops involved in peacekeeping or nation-building, as in the substantial deployment to Haiti. Many of his vignettes are thoughtful and thorough, recapitulating, for example, the largely forgotten political struggles on Grenada that helped trigger United States intervention and describing in its full horror the experience of the Marines in their 1982-83 deployment in Lebanon, where they came to serve no function except as a target for hostile militias and terrorists. 
Others are marred by mistakes of fact -- the 78-day campaign over the skies of Kosovo involved not "450 allied sorties" but more than 10,000. Some of Captain Huchthausen's conclusions are also off, as when he argues that as a result of the air strike President Ronald Reagan ordered against Libya in 1986, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's "overt support of terror attacks ceased." Two years later, Colonel Qaddafi's intelligence agents arranged the bombing of Pan Am 103, the most murderous act of Libyan terror ever, which cost 270 lives.
Perhaps the most frustrating shortcoming of "America's Splendid Little Wars" is the author's tendency to touch on big themes without developing them. Thus, he limns the growing importance of special operations forces but never details how halting progress has been in putting these exceptionally trained and lavishly equipped warriors in the field. Though billions have been devoted to building up the fabled Army Delta Force, Navy Seals and others, commanders have been averse to employing them -- often to the exasperation of their civilian masters.
In the 1991 war against Iraq, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf wanted little to do with the "operators," and almost a decade later the brass in Washington was reluctant to use special forces to capture wanted war criminals in Bosnia. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld aims to change that aspect of the American Way of War, which favors great massed forces often to the exclusion of small, highly mobile contingents. Whether his innovations will outlast his tenure remains to be seen.
Similarly, Captain Huchthausen observes that "Each military engagement in this history demonstrates the progression of a blend of battlefield hardware, improved communications and command-and-control technologies." Yet he never addresses head-on how the advent of "stand-off" weapons like cruise missiles, precision-guided munitions or stealth technology have changed the face of battle. 
While he says his greatest obligation is to those who fought, he tells us little about who they are -- those who joined the all-volunteer military and, especially, those who fill the contemporary officer corps, an assemblage of talent and intelligence that may be as impressive as any in our history. The human side of the military transformation of the last three decades is surely the most fascinating part of the story. Too much chronicle and not enough history, "America's Splendid Wars" leaves this subject for another to reconnoiter.

Giving Life to the Debris of a Mechanized World

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
The exhibition of Richard Stankiewicz's charmingly vigorous welded scrap-metal sculpture at the AXA Gallery is the artist's first retrospective in New York, but it has a comforting, even stuffy air of familiarity.
 Glancing over Stankiewicz's slyly figurative semiabstract personages and creatures, with their steam-valve faces, rusted-nail feathers, links-of-chain coiffures, wheel-spoke headdresses and gas-tank torsos, you may tell yourself that you've seen it all before. Truth is, you probably have, but I'll bet you've never seen it quite this good. 
 Stankiewicz, who died in 1983 at the age of 60, was a poet of the industral sublime with an instinctive sense of the kinetic, figurative potential imprisoned within nearly all of the discarded machines, car parts and dismembered kitchen appliances that came his way.
In the early 1950's he started welding fragments of rusted metal scrap into pieces that lived up to titles like "Kabuki Dancer," "Middle-Aged Couple" and "Marionette" with the spine-tingling accuracy of an art-history-savvy cartoon caricature. In the 1955 "City Bird," for example, we see a feathered dandy whose dozen feet create a speeding Futurist blur. 
Soon Stankiewicz had a hit on his hands: "junk" sculpture, a sub-genre of the multifronted art of assemblage that thrived on the East and West Coasts and then rapidly spread to the hinterlands. Junk sculpture appeared to be an easygoing do-it-yourself art; anyone could do it and far too many did -- artists, would-be artists, nonartists and students alike.
Between 1952 and 1965, Stankiewicz had a dozen one-person shows, six at the Hansa Gallery and then six at the Stable Gallery. His work was included in four Whitney Annuals, two Pittsburgh Internationals, a Venice Biennale and a Sao Paulo Bienal. The critic William Geist greeted his 1953 show as "a miracle in the scrap heap," a phrase used in the title to AXA's show, which was organized for the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., by Emmie Donadio, a Stankiewicz scholar and associate director of the Middlebury College Museum of Art in Vermont. 
The miracle wasn't exactly new. Precedents included Picasso's bull's head made from a bicycle seat and handlebars, reliefs by Kurt Schwitters and to some extent Duchamp's readymades, which were all acknowledged in the catalog to "The Art of Assemblage" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961. Nor was Stankiewicz acting alone; his cohorts included Edward Kienholz, Bruce Connor, Marisol, Red Grooms as well as European artists like Eduardo Paolozzi and Jean Tinguely. 
Still, his work seems unusually emblematic of a period when Abstract Expressionism was losing traction and more worldly materials, subjects and ideas were bubbling up all around, shortly to be unduly organized into Happenings, Fluxus, Pop Art and Minimalism. It was also the visual equivalent of concrete poetry and jazz.
Born in Philadelphia in 1922, Stankiewicz was, in hindsight, well prepared for this form of improvisation. After training in mechanical drawing, he served a long stint in the Navy, seeking out museums whenever he was ashore. He was discharged in 1947 and less than two years later ended up in New York, where he studied with Hans Hofmann, whose theory of push-pull composition made an indelible impression on him.
In 1950 he spent a year in Paris on the G.I. Bill, studying briefly with Fernand Leger, whose appreciation of modern industry appealed to him even if his classroom style did not, and longer with the sculptor Ossip Zadkine. He also saw the work of Giacometti and Dubuffet. Back in New York, he was attracted by pieces of rusty metal in the garden of the building he lived in on Bond Street and taught himself to weld. 
For a while Stankiewicz had something like perfect pitch, in an almost photographic sense. In "Kabuki Dancer," he uses a little spiraling arrangement of flat metal bars to convey the stylized, cocked-ankle turn of the dancer's raised foot. In "Family Portrait," which comes closest to Kienholz, we make out the figures of a worrying, hunched-shouldered father, a more approachable mother with door-handle breasts and an open-faced child.
In "River of Styx," the attenuated form at the center of this marvelously billowing composition could be either the fierce boatman or the hysterical passenger trying to fend off the gates of hell. But thankfully most of Stankiewicz's choices do double time. "Bird Lover in the Grass" seems more like a skulking submarine with raised periscope, as two of the blades of rusted-pipe grass brandish motor parts that could be either binoculars or guns. 
Sometimes history rather than the work's title provides the punch line. An untitled work ruled by right angles and refrigerator shelving instantly conjures up the International Style version of Giacometti's "Palace at 4 a.m." And in the best work in the show, "Tribal Diagram," he learns from Cubism and African ironwork to achieve what may be the ultimate "drawing in space." It is a rectilinear family tree, as well as a vertical landscape, punctuated with little fringes, tassels and blossoms of nails and wire, each bursting with suggestions of plant, animal and human life.
By the late 1960's, Stankiewicz was fading from view. Artists like Jasper Johns, John Chamberlain and Donald Judd had jettisoned the compositional subtleties he had so assiduously perfected. Stankiewicz was notably absent from "Painting and Sculpture in New York: 1940 to 1970," Henry Geldzahler's big survey at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which spanned the generations from Hans Hoffmann to Frank Stella. In the catalog's introduction, Geldzahler called the show's 43 artists "deflectors," arguing that they had "significantly deflected the course of recent art." 
What happened? It could be argued that Stankiewicz is one of those artists whose work fits in at so many junctures, historical tangents and cultural moments that it almost seems to disappear as you think about it. It doesn't seem to be much more than the sum of its sources and references because in some basic way it lacks a personal core. Its passion lies in a delicate, erudite sophistication that keeps its inner necessity carefully under wraps. This needn't be so, as is ably demonstrated by the art of Cy Twombly, who was also omitted from Geldzahler's show. 
Stankiewicz's work also suggests a series of final flowerings: of the Cubist chassis, of Abstract Expressionist sculpture, of postwar figuration. It is all leavened by wit, elegance and an economy that is a rebuke to lugubrious efforts on both sides of the Atlantic, committed by artists from Ibram Lassaw to Reg Butler and Lynn Chadwick. In the end, Stankiewicz's art defines a moment of transition so precisely that it is ultimately more the end of one thing than the beginning of another. As the innovations it helped trigger gained force, it looked more and more familiar and old-fashioned, resonant of the past more than the future. Stankiewicz wrestled with and elaborated upon tradition, but did not break with it. 
But art, unlike an opera, is never over. Compositional complexity is no longer the taboo that it once was, and semiabstract cartoonish, double-playing representation has serious currency. Philip Guston's late work gave it a resilient credibility that has been extended by scores of more recent efforts, from Carroll Dunham's lonely, rageful mavericks to the abject composite waifs of Jonathan Pylypchuk. Maybe Stankiewicz's moment of greatest relevance is just beginning.

"Miracle in the Scrap Heap: The Sculpture of Richard Stankiewicz" is at the AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 554-4818, through Sept. 25.

HEADLINE: Letting Nature Run Its Course, and Making Money From It 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Brutal heat in Europe has caused power prices to soar and has robbed the profits of bakeries and chocolate makers. Meanwhile, rain in the northeastern United States has left amusement parks and beach resorts empty.
 Where most people see bigger bills, heat exhaustion or ruined vacations, investment banks and traders are finding a way to make money. The fledgling market for weather derivatives is expanding rapidly, they say, and the nasty weather is only going to help. 
 Weather derivatives allow companies whose earnings are affected by nature's variables -- temperature, precipitation, frost and others -- to hedge against that risk. A construction company that cannot pour concrete when the weather is too cold, for example, can buy a derivative that will pay out if there are more than the average number of freezing days in a winter. Soon, say some proponents, there will be no excuse for letting nature run its course.
"Within five years' time, companies won't be able to say, 'Our profits are down because of the weather,' " said Duncan Wilson, a consultant to WeatherXchange, a venture between the Met Office, a British forecaster, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Weather derivatives were introduced six years ago and popularized in the energy industry by Enron. But the collapse of Enron and the shrinking of other energy companies has left a vacuum that is quickly being filled by investment banks and insurers eager to sell the product.
In the 12 months ended in March, the number of new weather derivatives contracts tripled, to almost 12,000. At about $4.2 billion, the dollar value was nearly unchanged from the year before, but that is because some the biggest participants, like Enron, left the market. There are about $12 billion in contracts outstanding, up from none in 1996.
Oil and power companies still make up the bulk of derivatives users in the United States. But outside the country, industries from ice cream to breweries have signed on. Last year, even the two-week beer festival, the Munich Oktoberfest, was hedged against rain.
The recent spate of hot, dry weather in Europe is helping to increase demand, said Ross McIntyre, director for weather derivatives at Deutsche Bank in London.
"Companies hurt by these extreme weather events are in communication with us, and are interested in doing multi-year deals," he said. Most are from outside the energy industry.
Comey & Barrow, a London wine bar chain, was the first non-energy company in Britain to take out a weather derivative in 2000. Bars and pubs generally make a disproportionate amount of their income on warm days when patrons linger at outside tables, ordering a second or third drink. This year, buying a weather derivative may have seemed a waste, because it was unseasonably warm. But, "next year, it might rain all summer," said Sarah Heward, managing director of Corney & Barrow, who says she is lining one up now.
Trading in these contracts is still much smaller than in other derivatives. About 2,000 temperature-related derivatives trade daily on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, less than one-twentieth the number of interest rate derivatives traded. 
But expansion seems inevitable. On Tuesday, the Chicago exchange and the Met Office said they were creating temperature-related derivatives for Europe that are expected to trade on the commodities exchange by the end of the year. The Chicago exchange also plans to invest up to $1.8 million over the next three years in the WeatherXchange joint venture. "Weather is a new frontier," said Terry Duffy, the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in announcing the deal.
Even before the extreme weather in Europe, a renewed focus on corporate governance was sparking more interest in weather derivatives, said Alex Schippers, global head of weather and insurance derivatives at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank. Three years ago, ABN Amro was not even in the market, but it now has weather trading desks in Sydney, Amsterdam, Singapore and London, and will be selling products in India this year.
"The bottom line is a C.E.O. has to explain any deviation in his results," Mr. Schippers said. "Clearly 10 years ago a brewer could say it had a much colder summer than expected," he said. But now analysts will question executives at the same brewer, and wonder why they did not hedge for the weather, he added.
Last year, ABN Amro created one of the largest weather derivative deals to be syndicated, or parceled out to investors. An unnamed Dutch construction company took out a contract with the bank that would pay 10 million euros ($11.2 million) a day if there were more than 19 freezing days in the five months before March 31. (There weren't.)
After being created by an investment bank, weather derivatives can be held, traded, or sold off to third-party investors -- which is where the risk comes in. If an investor in weather derivatives holds a lot of contracts written to European ice cream retailers, for example, and an unseasonably cold summer follows, the investor will suffer.
Still, the derivatives appeal to institutional investors eager to diversify from traditional financial markets. Conventional economic wisdom has always been, "When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold," meaning that the impact of a weak currency, slow spending or plummeting stock prices in the United States are felt around the globe.
But there are no such clearly identified links with the weather. If it rains, say, more than normal in Iowa one summer, it might rain less in Malaysia. Or it might not. Investors in the weather sector often spread their exposure around, and rely on investing formulas that are highly personalized and secretive. One weather derivatives expert contends, for example, that a hotter-than-normal Europe generally comes at the same time as a wetter-than-average Eastern United States -- a bet that made money this summer.
Coriolis Capital, a fund manager, invests about half of its $350 million in weather-related derivatives tied to 20 different countries. . "We have no correlation to the markets," said the fund's chief executive, Diego Wauters. "Only factors like the temperature in London or the snow in the Alps influence the performance of our funds." Coriolis does not disclose its performance, but Mr. Wauters said returns are expected to top the London Interbank Offered Rate, the base interest rate paid on deposits between banks in Europe, by 2 to 10 percent. 
Despite the growing popularity of weather derivatives, there are some executives who say that they will never participate in the market. Hedging against the weather is just laziness, said Jim Clarke, chief financial officer of J.D. Wetherspoons, a British pub chain.
"We've told our pubs, come hail or shine, they have to keep people coming through the doors," he said.

HEADLINE: Data Show Recessions In Germany And Italy 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Germany and Italy slipped into recession in the second quarter, as the economies of the 12 nations that share the euro stagnated, according to government reports published today.
 While tentative signs of a rebound in the United States and the European stimulus programs have lifted business and consumer confidence, that optimism has yet to produce real economic gains, analysts said. 
 "We're still in an environment where the euro zone economy has basically come to a halt," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, an economist at CIBC World Markets in London. 
Germany entered a shallow recession for the second time in as many years, its government said today. The economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the second quarter, after a 0.2 percent drop in the first.
The weakness spread to Italy, heavily dependent on Germany as an export market. Italy's recession is its first in a decade.
The weakest numbers of all, however, came from the Netherlands, which was already in recession. Output declined 0.5 percent from April to June as consumers pulled back on spending. 
It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction.
Most countries in the euro zone are suffering from weak overseas demand for their goods, which have been priced out of some markets by a rise in the euro. Growth in the region was unchanged in the second quarter from the first quarter, when there was a 0.1 percent gain.
France, the second-largest economy in the euro zone, does not report its second-quarter performance until next week. But the government has steadily reduced its growth forecasts this year.
Despite the current gloom, analysts see a few reasons for optimism. Some recovery in the American economy, which grew 2.4 percent in the second quarter, improves the outlook for Europe, which usually lags the United States by about half a year.
Analysts are also encouraged by recent signs of recovery in business confidence and consumer spending after worries stemming from the war in Iraq kept shoppers at home. "The strengthening of domestic demand bodes well for a gradual recovery both in Germany and the euro area in the second half of this year," said Lorenzo Codogno, an economist at Bank of America.
Analysts were also optimistic about the commitment of Germany's chancellor, Gerhardt Schroder, to take long-delayed steps to improve the competitiveness of Germany, the euro zone's largest economy. The chancellor won cabinet approval this week for a plan to accelerate proposed tax cuts to next yearin an effort to jump-start sluggish consumer spending. The cabinet also endorsed a package of changes to the welfare system, aimed at reducing costly unemployment benefits and reviving the labor market.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in World Business on Friday about government reports that showed recessions in Germany and Italy misspelled the given name of the German chancellor. He is Gerhard Schroder, not Gerhardt.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Give Me Plugs In My S.U.V.

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
AS they so often do, the Simpsons have gotten to the essence of a change in modern American life. In an episode broadcast not long ago, Homer discovers the joys of appliances made to be used in the car: he plugs in a television set with VCR, a French fryer, a fax machine -- even a lava lamp.
 Homer's appliances only slightly exaggerate the range of equipment that plugs into cars these days. As Americans spend more time driving their cars in slow rush-hour traffic, or partying out of them, manufacturers are making all manner of gadgets that plug into the old 12-volt cigarette-lighter socket. And automakers, in turn, are scrambling to provide more sockets, racing one another in a battle shaping up as the new cup-holder wars. 
 Probably the most intimidatingly powerful vehicle on the road today is the Hummer H2, and it delivers not just horsepower (315 with its V-8 engine), but electrical power, too. It has five 12-volt power outlets scattered through its capacious cabin. Runners-up like the GMC Yukon and Lincoln Navigator have four. 
In the Navigator (which also boasts 10 cup holders), there are two outlets in front, one for the back seat and another in the cargo area. The Volkswagen Passat is one of several family sedans that have added plugs to their trunks.
The world of 12-volt power is as foreign to that of the 110-volt American home power systems as European current. But even the 42-volt standard that engineers have experimented with at DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and Delphi Automotive Systems would be too much of a jolt for the safety of mechanics, professional and amateur. So it has been up to appliance makers to adapt, and they have done so enthusiastically.
Heavy-footed drivers have long plugged their radar detectors, legal or not, into the dash. But camping and tailgate parties created a market for appliances like car-compatible coffee makers and refrigerators. And the cellphone, with its relentless demands for recharging, accustomed many drivers to using car plug-ins, further increasing the demand for outlets.
Drivers want front-seat plugs for food coolers and mug warmers. Back-seat power outlets are in demand to run video games for young passengers. Tailgate-party fans want power in the trunk or rear cargo area for their coffee makers and electric charcoal lighters.
Automotive parts and accessories stores, catalogs and Web sites offer a huge variety of kitchen and family-room devices in a 12-volt format, from game consoles to DVD players with flat-panel screens to blenders powerful enough to crush ice for drinks. But also increasingly popular are plug-ins that give drivers options they neglected to order on their new cars -- or allow them to buy those options at lower cost.
Several CD and DVD players are available, for example. Garmin's StreetPilot III fills in for a navigation system, providing a G.P.S. antenna, a map CD and a screen that gives directions for $999, in contrast to $1,200 to $1,500 for a typical factory-installed navigation system. Heated seats, usually an amenity associated with plush luxury cars, can be installed in plug-in form in the most humble econobox.
Some devices are marketed to truckers (the outlets in their rigs are the same 12 volts as the ones in cars). A recent visit to the shop at a South Carolina truck stop revealed a toaster ($24) that sits on clever little rubber feet to absorb highway bumps, a $20 blow-dryer and even a 12-volt soldering iron.
Splitters are available to let a single plug accept two devices. Some appliances for the car come with pass-through plugs so that a second device can attach to them. But in the 12-volt world, the ultimate accessory may be factory-installed. The Pontiac Vibe and Toyota Matrix, sibling vehicles aimed at young buyers, are the first cars to offer a conventional 110-volt household plug (courtesy of a transformer inside it) built into the dash. Using this, you can simply take your favorite appliance with you, from residence to road.
Cars can usually meet the power demands of several devices at once while underway, though the owner should be careful to observe any warnings about overloading from the manufacturers. And too many add-ons can drain the battery of a parked car more rapidly than headlights left on overnight.
When it comes to microwaving the egg sandwich or fishing through the fridge for the chilled drinks, the best option may be to sit and idle. Juggling his plug-in appliances, Homer Simpson becomes so busy that he runs right off the road.

PLUG-INS
To Take With You on the Road
INVENTING and designing for their own parallel power universe, the sellers of 12-volt gear constantly come up with novel appliances and devices to take on the road. Here is a sampling.

NOT JUST ANY COFFEE -- Bertone, the Italian automotive designer, has also turned out an espresso maker for the road. Available in black, bright blue or yellow, it is as cute as an Italian sports car and dispenses brew at 180 degrees. The list price is $52. It is available at Coffeenuts.webdirectbrands.com and www.800-espresso.com or 888-523-2424.

FOR COIFFURE OR WINDOW -- A hair dryer, also advertised as a defroster for those cold mornings, goes for $19.99 from the Hilltop RV Superstore in Michigan (www.hilltoprv.net).

ILLUMINATE -- The super-bright halogen map light is not just for reading maps. Its 10-foot cord and metal legs make it handy for lighting nighttime jobs such as changing a tire or loading luggage onto the roof. At $22.95, it is available at www.griotsgarage.com.

BACK-SEAT VCR -- The Audiovox VBP2000 Video-in-a-Bag, with a five-inch LCD screen, hangs from a seat back. It is available for $496 at Pep Boys stores.

PORTABLE POSITIONING -- The Cobra GPS1000 hand-held navigation system displays a car's location and plots the owner's trips. It is $249.90 at www.12voltfusion.com.

COMFORT -- Ten motors are ready to soothe in a massaging seat topper with heat that fits over the seat from a strap around the headrest. It is $99 at Brookstone (866-576-7337 or www.brookstone.com).

WARM IT OR COOL IT -- The Vector thermoelectric food cooler/warmer chest cools food to 40 degrees below the outside temperature or warms it up to 130 degrees. It sits on the car's seat or floor and comes with a seven-foot cord. It is $69.99 at www.jcwhitney.com.

WHIR -- Blenders are available at many RV stores or www.rvpartsstore.com. Most do not run directly from the 12-volt plug but from a power-storage device needed to provide the motor with the necessary jolts of juice. The Vector model at J. C. Whitney goes for $59.99.

HARNESS THOSE IONS -- The Ionic Breeze Dashboard Ionizer cleans the atmosphere inside the car by trapping airborne particles on an electrostatically charged ring. It is $39.95 at the Sharper Image (www.sharperimage.com).

MULTIPLICATION -- The Quest Blue Quadrasocket turns one 12-volt plug into four and glows in black light. It is $9.99 at Autozone stores or www.autozone.com.

ADAPTERS -- Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com) is a good source of power inverters that will turn a 12-volt plug into one accommodating many household appliances. Prices begin at around $30.

POWER TO GO -- The 2-in-1 Emergency Car Starter and DC Power Source is an electric-power storage device: a 20-minute charge stows away enough power to start a car with a dead battery. It can also be used away from the vehicle to power laptop computers, disc players or other devices. It is $39.99 at Radio Shack. PHIL PATTON

HEADLINE: Not Much Job Growth, but Mediocre May Look Good in 2004 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IT is a recovery. And it is not a jobless one.
 As the economy has gradually shown strength, unevenly to be sure, one critical mantra has been to call it a jobless recovery. But there are statistics that belie that and indicate that the number of people with jobs has been growing since last fall. 
 That growth, to be sure, has been less than overwhelming. At best, it is barely keeping up with the natural growth of the labor force. But it is better than people think.
The conventional way of looking at job totals is tolook at the government's monthly payroll survey. And by that measure, this recovery is a jobless one. In July, that survey found 129.9 million jobs, 2.7 million fewer than the peak reached in February 2001, the month after President Bush took office, and a million less than in November 2001, when the recession officially ended.
But the payroll survey has limitations, and they may be important ones right now. If a person has two part-time jobs, that person is counted twice. If that person then gets one full-time job, the payroll total would fall. And the survey does not try to count self-employed people, a group that is growing rapidly.
The alternative count is the household survey, which is used to compile the unemployment rate. It is based on a survey of 60,000 households, and a quarter of them are replaced each month. 
To be sure, the household survey can be volatile, and relying on month-to-month changes, particularly for smaller groups like black teenagers, can be treacherous. But there is little volatility to worry about if one looks at year-to-year changes in six-month moving averages.
Calculated that way, the number of working Americans in July was up 0.87 percent from a year earlier. It was the ninth consecutive month showing growth. Measured the same way, the payroll survey has shown annual declines for 22 months. Historically, the two surveys usually show similar trends, and there is a good chance that the payroll survey will start to show growth soon.
In hindsight, the remarkable thing about the final days of the boom was the extent to which it benefited those who most needed help. At the time of the last presidential election, the number of employed people over all was up 2.4 percent year-to-year, but the rate of job growth for adults who never finished high school was twice that. 
Now the limited job growth is concentrated among better-educated people. There are fewer jobs for teenagers, black or white, or for adults who never finished high school. But jobs for people with college degrees are rising at a rate of more than 2 percent a year. There are more jobs for managers and professionals, and fewer for workers involved in making and shipping goods.
Low expectations can make mediocre performance respectable. Just as parents may be thrilled if a student gets a C when failure was feared, voters may be relieved that the economy is growing at all after all the talk about Japan-style deflation and continuing loss of jobs. 
"We've set the bar so low that a pedestrian cyclical rebound associated with excessive fiscal and monetary stimulus, arriving just in time for a presidential election, will look spectacular," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig.
If that happens, President Bush may owe a debt of gratitude to all the commentators who have focused on the negative jobs numbers, while playing down the other signs that the economy is, if not ready to boom again, at least starting to show respectable growth.

HEADLINE: Twilight Zone Economics 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For about 20 months the U.S. economy has been operating in a twilight zone: growing too fast to meet the classic definition of a recession, but too slowly to meet the usual criteria for economic recovery. There's nothing particularly mysterious about our situation. But recent news coverage and commentary -- in particular, the enthusiastic headlines that followed a modest increase in growth and a modest decline in jobless claims -- suggest that some people still don't get it. So here's a brief refresher course on twilight zone Economics 101. 
 Since November 2001 -- which the National Bureau of Economic Research, in a controversial decision, has declared the end of the recession -- the U.S. economy has grown at an annual rate of about 2.6 percent. That may not sound so bad, but when it comes to jobs there has been no recovery at all. Nonfarm payrolls have fallen by, on average, 50,000 per month since the "recovery" began, accounting for 1 million of the 2.7 million jobs lost since March 2001. 
 Meanwhile, employment is chasing a moving target because the working-age population continues to grow. Just to keep up with population growth, the U.S. needs to add about 110,000 jobs per month. When it falls short of that, jobs become steadily harder to find. At this point conditions in the labor market are probably the worst they have been for almost 20 years. (The measured unemployment rate isn't all that high, but that's largely because many people have given up looking for work.)
All this leads to a great deal of suffering -- not just lost income, but also the anxiety and humiliation that come with long-term unemployment. Is relief in sight?
Over the last few weeks two numbers have led to a spate of optimistic pronouncements. One is the preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth, which came in at a 2.4 percent annual rate -- about one point higher than expected. The other is the rate of new applications for unemployment insurance, which has fallen slightly below 400,000 per week.
But while the growth and new claims numbers were good news, they didn't tell us that the economy is improving. All they said is that things are getting worse more slowly.
This should be obvious when it comes to growth. I saw headlines saying that in the second quarter growth "soared," even "rocketed." Huh? That 2.4 percent growth rate was a bit less than the average during our job-loss recovery. Just to stabilize the labor market in its present dismal state would probably take growth of at least 3.5 percent; it would take much more than that to return the economy to anything resembling full employment.
Meanwhile, about those unemployment claims: somehow that 400,000-per-week benchmark has acquired a lot more significance in people's minds than it deserves. For example, claims came in at 398,000 yesterday -- and this was treated as good news because it was (barely) below the magic number.
Well, here's some perspective: since November 2001 new claims have averaged 414,000 per week. A number a bit lower than that might mean stable or slightly rising payroll employment -- but as we've just seen, that's not nearly good enough. For comparison, in 2000 -- a year of good but not great employment growth -- weekly claims averaged 305,000. My conclusion is that the state of the unemployed won't improve unless claims fall a lot further than they have.
So is a real, unambiguous recovery just around the corner? Recent economic reports have had a "good news"-"bad news" feel to them. Businesses are starting to buy some equipment; that's good. But they seem to be engaging in replacement investment, not capacity expansion; that's bad. Consumers are spending; that's good. But rising interest rates seem to have ended the refinancing boom that put cash in consumers' pockets; that's bad. And so on.
The best guess is that growth in the second half of the year will be faster than in the first half, possibly high enough to create some jobs, but not high enough to make jobs easier to find. In other words, in terms of what matters most, the economy will continue to deteriorate.
All this is, of course, an indictment of our economic policy -- a policy that has managed the remarkable trick of generating immense budget deficits without giving the economy much stimulus. But that's a subject for another day.

HEADLINE: New York City Slows Its Losses, Holding Jobless Rate Steady 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The rate of job losses in New York City slowed further during July, according to monthly employment figures released yesterday by the state. Jobs in construction and in leisure and hospitality increased, and the rate of losses declined in financial activities and in professional and business services.
 The unemployment rate for the city, after seasonal adjustment, remained at 8.1 percent for the third month in a row, down from a high of 8.8 in February. 
 The state rate remained at 6.1 percent, which is lower than the national rate, now 6.2 percent, for the second month in a row.
"There's definitely some signs of improvement," said Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the New York State Department of Labor, which released the data. In addition to job gains in several industries, he said, "the rate of layoffs is slowing, even in some of the weaker sectors."
The shrinking was due in part to the increases in jobs in construction and in leisure and hospitality and to a relative increase in jobs in motion picture production.
But it was also attributable to a decrease in job losses in weak areas, including financial activities.
Comparing July 2003 with July 2002, the data showed that construction jobs increased by 7,400, or 6.4 percent, and leisure and hospitality jobs increased by 7,700, or 3 percent. There was also a year-to-year jump in health and social services of 9,000 jobs.
"You're still seeing a lot of industries struggling," said Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki. "But the outlook is positive, and it's positive because financial services is getting stronger."
Statewide, the private-sector job count remained essentially flat, decreasing by 3,900 jobs to 6,918,800 in July, the numbers showed.
The year-to-year percentage decline of 0.3 percent was better than that of the country as a whole, which was 0.4.
"Despite the long-term effects of the prolonged national recession, the September 11 attacks and the unique problems facing Wall Street, both New York State's unemployment rate and private-sector job count held steady this month," said David J. Trzaskos, acting director of the Labor Department's Division of Research and Statistics.

HEADLINE: Signs of Recovery Influenced June Rate Decrease, Fed Says 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy panel cut interest rates by a smaller amount than expected in June because of signs of an economic rebound and concerns that a larger cut would be misinterpreted, minutes from the meeting released today showed.
 "Views cited in favor of the quarter-percentage-point easing included the emergence of firmer signs of a possible upturn on economic activity, the near-term prospect of substantial added stimulus and an already accommodative stance of monetary policy," said the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 24-25.. 
 The committee cut short-term rates a quarter of a percentage point at that meeting, even though many market watchers had anticipated a half-point cut. Members worried such a move would be viewed as "a signal that the committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves -- a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time." 
The panel also felt a slower rise in prices was more likely to be a significant concern than inflation "for a considerable period of time."
The vote was 11 to 1 in favor of the quarter-point rate cut, but there was sentiment for both more aggressive and more mild action. Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, dissented in favor of a larger rate cut.
But the minutes also noted that one unidentified member saw merit in keeping rates unchanged, though the member did not oppose the cut that was finally approved.
The minutes also sought to damp speculation that the committee shied away from a larger move for fear of causing dislocations in money markets already pressured by a federal funds rate at a four-decade low. "No member expressed the opinion that a smaller move should be favored because of concerns about dislocations resulting from a very low level of the overnight interest rate," the minutes said.
The committee also talked about the possible avenues of nontraditional methods to use if cutting rates failed to stimulate the economy. But the panel saw no need to reach a consensus on any specific approach.

HEADLINE: Harvesting Poverty; 
Inching Toward Trade Fairness

 BODY:
Poor and developing nations have long -- and rightly -- complained that while the richest countries want open markets for their manufactured goods, they rig the game when it comes to agricultural products. Now it appears that the United States and Europe are beginning to get the message. Their trade negotiators have agreed to try to reduce their farm subsidies and other barriers to agricultural imports. The vague agreement, announced on Wednesday, falls short of what is needed and raises as many questions as it answers. The numbers are yet to be filled in. Still, the effort is a heartening sign that on the eve of next month's critical World Trade Organization meeting in Cancun, pressure is mounting on developed nations to make the global trading system more fair.
 As this page has been reporting in recent weeks, poor nations buy into the mantra of globalization and free-trade orthodoxy, only to find their farm products locked out of developed nations' markets by high tariffs, or competing hopelessly against subsidized European and American goods, which sell below cost. The ongoing "development round" of World Trade Organization negotiations is meant to redress this and other injustices in the global trading system by the end of next year. Talks are already behind schedule, however, and may derail entirely if no discernible progress is reached at the Cancun gathering. 
 The European Union and Japan have been most reluctant to face up to reality and commit to meaningful cutbacks in their protectionism. This week's deal, however, reflects the extent to which the Europeans have been shamed into showing some willingness to compromise. The vague document they have agreed to, with all those blanks to be filled in later, represents an effort by Robert Zoellick, America's trade representative, tobridge the considerable gap between American and European positions in advance of Cancun.
Despite the billions of dollars in farm subsidies agreed to by the Bush administration under pressure from farm-state lawmakers, Washington has been a strong and constructive voice in pushing the wealthy countries toward a fairer agricultural policy. Mr. Zoellick is right to coax Europe toward its more progressive position, but the Bush administration should not compromise too much in order to make common cause with protectionists. For instance, the deal's failure to call for a total elimination of export subsidies, long an American proposal, is alarming. Such subsidies, and American loan programs that amount to their functional equivalent, need to be phased out. Farmers in poor countries already struggle with poor transportion and primitive technology. It is outrageous that rich countries compound their advantages by subsidizing their own agricultural products with public money.
On tariffs, the agreement also fudges trans-Atlantic differences. Washington has rightly advocated that tariffs be capped at reasonably low levels, while Japan and the European Union prefer an "across the board" cut that would leave excessively high barriers in place. Of what use is a one-third reduction of Japan's 500 percent tax on imported rice? 
Both poor countries and the bloc of major agricultural exporters that include Australia and Brazil were quick to express an understandable wariness about the agreement reached between the United States and Europe. Their concerns must be heeded. This agreement simply does not go far enough.
The European Union and the United States are the world's two trading superpowers, but they cannot dictate World Trade Organization rules to suit their own interests. The Bush administration must now play the pivotal role of mediator at Cancun rather than digging in its heels at Europe's side -- an alternative that would thrill some of our domestic farm lobbies that live off their subsidies. Washington has shown that it can exert enough pressure to prod the Europeans into agreeing to some concessions. It will have to do a lot more of that before a fair deal on agricultural trade is within reach.

PERSON: KATHY BRONANDER 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Racing to Match Buyer and Seller in Montclair

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR, N.J. 

 BODY:
IT'S a beautiful day in the neighborhood actually, that 2003 meteorological rarity, the sun, is shining -- and the uninitiated might imagine that this would give Kathy Bronander an easy sale. "People think that because it's a sunny day, a Realtor can drive people around and sell a house, just like that," she said. "Well. What an idea." 
 For years now, the fantasy of an easy-money windfall in the real-estate game has collided with Darwinian reality in this town of 38,977. More than 600 licensed Realtors in the area have battled for some 200 salable houses thus far this year. 
 The resulting algorithm was succinctly stated by Mrs. Bronander, who has been selling houses here for 17 years: "Properties are going off the market faster than they are coming on." 
Montclair may not be the most competitive environment on the face of the earth -- network reality-television scheduling comes to mind -- but the Kathy Bronander to-do list is hardly for the faint of heart. 
Though recently mortgage rates have been inching up, supplicants have not been deterred, and are still beating down the doors. This, despite the proliferating cut-rate online brokers who are badmouthing traditional real estate cadres. So far, the discounters haven't made much of a dent in the Montclair market, where clients expect so much personal service. 
According to several real estate brokers, homes in Montclair have appreciated 100 percent in the last five years. Desirable houses draw multiple bids, and Mrs. Bronander, who works for Schweppe & Company, has had clients competing against as many as eight other suitors. 
She wistfully recalled the quaintness of the 1980's when "you'd take people out, show them houses, and there was a leisurely process of negotiation." Couples once had the audacity to offer less than the suggested asking price. 
Just to raise the stakes, her husband, Burt, is a Realtor for a rival company, Burgdorff ERA, and strict regulations forbid the couple from talking about deals, or bringing home office gossip, which could create unfair advantages. "Since we can't talk about real estate, Burt watches TV and I read a book," she said. 
Their feisty partnership is totally Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, since they live separate real-estate lives. Although their employers are competitive, husband and wife have never duked it out for a single house -- "so far," said Mr. Bronander, with a gleam in his eye. 
House-wrangling is very emotional. "Through the weeks and months, you develop such a close relationship with people when you're selling a house," Mrs. Bronander said. After the deal is done, "it's almost like coming to the end of a great book. There is an emptiness. But losing? It's hard on our clients. And hard on us." 
Mr. Bronander has been there: "When you get the call that says you're not going to get the house, you start to cry and pour yourself a Scotch." 
Empathic, poised and ever ready to defuse discomfort with easy wit, Mrs. Bronander has seen it all. There are the couples who make an appointment and don't show up. The window-shoppers who want to spend a pleasant afternoon and have no intention of buying. The transactions that fall apart in attorney review. 
There was also the couple that insisted on a six-bedroom center-hall colonial that needed work. Mrs. Bronander showed them dozens of properties over a year, until the couple suddenly chose a two-bedroom ranch in perfect condition.
These days most of their customers are repeaters, who also send along friends and family members. One of these will certainly be Rabbi Michael Monson of the Congregation Shomrei Emunath; Mrs. Bronander advised him when he was moving from Philadelphia to lead the congregation. 
"Kathy inspires instant confidence, because you have a sense that she cares beyond the sale or the purchase of the property," he said, adding: "And she's a strategist. She told us to add $200 to our offer so it wouldn't be an even bid -- and we got the house." 
The Bronanders' client base has grown for many reasons, not the least of which is that, after putting their five children through the school system, they know practically everyone in town. 
AND they are involved. Mrs. Bronander is past president of the Montclair Lions Club and the Mercier Club, and a sustaining member of the Junior League. Mr. Bronander is past president of the Commonwealth Club and, until 1986, managed the Wedgwood, a storied but now-defunct cafeteria. 
These days, e-mail, cell phones and pagers make Mrs. Bronander available 24/7 to her clients' demands. Twelve-hour days are routine on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. 
The effort has its reward. Recently Mrs. Bronander sold two $1 million houses, and most years she has had more than $3 million in sales; for three years she has won the silver award from the New Jersey Association of Realtors: 20 properties sold for a total of $7.5 million. 
Still, Mrs. Bronander's last vacation was three days -- in March, when she ran up a $150 phone bill from South Carolina. "I've never calculated my hourly wage," she said. "I'm afraid to."

 CORRECTION:
A quotation yesterday serving as the picture caption for the Public Lives profile of Kathy Bronander, a real estate agent in Montclair, N.J., carried an erroneous attribution. As the article reported, it was Burt Bronander, the agent's husband, not she herself, who said, "When you get the call that says you're not going to get the house, you start to cry and pour yourself a Scotch."

HEADLINE: BearingPoint Shares Drop 23% On News of Earnings Revision 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Shares of BearingPoint, the consulting firm formerly known as KPMG Consulting, fell by more than 23 percent yesterday after it announced that it would revise its earnings downward for the first nine months of its fiscal year.
 Executives of the company attributed the restatement to a revised valuation of assets acquired over the last 12 months. Shares of BearingPoint, whose fiscal year ended June 30, fell as low as $6.75 from Wednesday's closing price of $10.31 before closing at $7.90, down $2.41. 
 While analysts said they were surprised by news of the restatement, they said the company's prospects for the coming months were still encouraging because of its businesses serving government agencies. BearingPoint recently won a contract from the United States Agency for International Development to work in Iraq that could be worth nearly $80 million. In March, it won a three-year contract for similar work in Afghanistan for $40 million.
"Their public services business has remained strong," said Rod Bourgeois, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, which he said does no investment banking. But, Mr. Bourgeois added, "Part ofthe lack of revenue boost is basically that Iraq didn't kick into gear as quickly."
While the consulting business has been slow since the bursting of the technology bubble, it has rebounded slightly over the last year. For its fiscal year, BearingPoint reported net income of $41.5 million, or 22 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $26.9 million, or 17 cents a share, in 2002. In the fourth quarter, ended June 30, the company earned $8.3 million, or 4 cents a share; analysts had expected 15 cents a share.
Revenue at the public service unit -- which employs about 3,400, the largest single group of BearingPoint employees -- grew 13.5 percent this year over last. While consulting work for private-sector consumer and industrial clients grew faster, at 18.5 percent, the dollar amount was much smaller to begin with and that market was much more depressed a year ago, according to the company.
"We're very proud of the fact that our core business continued to perform and outperform the marketplace," Rand Blazer, BearingPoint's chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts yesterday morning. He added that the company's investment in expanding its overseas presence would be critical for it in the future, telling analysts, "We now have a footprint everywhere in the world."
BearingPoint's restatement, which will decrease reported net income by about $10.8 million over the nine months from July 1, 2002, to March 30, 2003, was a result of revising the value of customer contracts and relationships acquired by the company through asset acquisitions.
Several of the company's government projects involve putting in place computer systems that allow more effective tracking of resources and spending. Under another contract the company won, signed late Wednesday, BearingPoint would provide technical support and other services for the technology office of the state of Florida.
BearingPoint has paid no bonuses to employees because it did not meet earnings expectations, Mr. Blazer said. He also said the company might have to lay off workers over the coming year and predicted a loss for the current quarter, ending Sept. 30.
But getting rid of some of its more costly consultants may be exactly what BearingPoint needs to do, said Tom Rodenhauser, president of Consulting Information Services in Keene, N.H.
"The cost model for retaining those type of folks doesn't work if you're focusing on the public sector where, for the most part, the low-cost bidder wins," he said.

HEADLINE: Recovery Without Jobs? No Way 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "No Work, No Homes," by Bob Herbert (column, Aug. 14): 
 American businesses cannot truly prosper unless American workers have jobs. A so-called recovery without jobs is no recovery at all.
When so many people are desperately seeking work, they are unable to generate income to buy goods and services. The long-term implications for businesses are disastrous.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise Slightly, As Do Prices 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that new applications filed for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 2,000, to 398,000 for the workweek ended Aug. 9.
 In a second report, the Producer Price Index, which measures prices of products before they reach store shelves, rose 0.1 percent in July, as expected, restrained by falling prices for food and moderation in energy prices. In June, wholesale prices climbed 0.5 percent, mostly reflecting sharply higher costs for energy products. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed in June to $39.5 billion as exports climbed to the highest level in two years, helped by economic growth overseas. Imports were flat.
Even with the rise, jobless claims have been under 400,000 -- a level associated with a weak labor market -- for four consecutive weeks, an encouraging sign, economists said. Claims hit a high this year of 459,000 in the middle of April.
The more stable, four-week moving average of new claims fell last week to 394,250, the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 15.
The number of people drawing jobless benefits for more than one week dropped by 6,000, to 3.7 million for the week ended Aug. 2, the most recent period for which that information was available. That was the lowest level since the middle of July.
Exports of goods and services rose 2.4 percent, to $84.6 billion, the best showing since June 2001. Overseas sales of American-made capital goods, including airplanes and computer accessories, showed the biggest gain. Exports of capital goods grew $818 million, to $24.1 billion, from May to June.
Imports, meanwhile, held steady at $124.2 billion. A big drop in imports of consumer goods, like clothing and toys, offset gains elsewhere, including imports of automobiles and parts, which rose to a record $18.2 billion.
The performance of the producer price index in July matched economists' expectations. Economists said the report might ease, but not eliminate, the Federal Reserve's fears about the remote threat that already low inflation could keep moving lower and turn into deflation, an economically dangerous slide in prices.
Excluding food and energy prices, which can swing widely from month to month, core wholesale prices rose 0.2 percent in July, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in June. Rising prices for cars, light trucks and pharmaceutical preparations contributed to the increase in core prices in July.
"As the economy recovers, it will do so withouta significant threat of either steep inflation or deflation," said Ron Schreibman, senior vice president at the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. "Both bear careful watching, but both are nonfactors at the moment." 
Energy prices in July increased 0.3 percent, down from a 3.4 percent jump in June. In July, falling prices for liquefied petroleum gas, like propane, and residential electric power blunted rising prices for gasoline and home heating oil.
Food prices declined 0.2 percent in July, compared with a 0.4 percent rise in June. Beef and veal prices, which had been rising, dropped 5.6 percent, the largest decline since April 1995. Prices for pork and vegetables also went down.
The current economic climate makes it difficult for producers to raise prices, which is a benefit for consumers but can squeeze producers' profit margins.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Close Higher; Futures Fall After Power Failure

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Futures pointed to a lower opening for stocks today as widespread power failures shortly after the close of yesterday's regular session left investors uncertain that trading would resume normally in the next session.
 In regular trading yesterday, stocks closed higher, as investors cheered better-than-expected government data on employment and trade that pointed to an improving economy. 
 A huge power failure swept across large sections of the eastern United States and Canada, leaving parts of New York, Detroit, Cleveland and Toronto without electricity.
Wall Street firms were waiting to see whether the loss of power would affect trading or the overnight settling of transactions. Fears of civil unrest -- if power was not restored quickly -- could also have hurt futures, traders said. 
"I don't think people are fearing terrorism; I think they are fearing massive looting in cities like New York and Detroit if the power doesn't come back up before it gets dark out," said Keith Keenan, vice president for institutional trading at Wall Street Access. "Obviously, that creates economic problems. I think that's the reason why you're probably seeing the futures market move lower after hours."
September futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.70 points, to 981.00. September futures for the Nasdaq 100 dipped 9 points, to 1,236.50. The latest data did not show any trades in Dow Jones futures after 4:19 p.m. 
During regular trading yesterday, government data showed signs of job market stability and a sharp narrowing in the United States trade gap. The data pointed to the economic rebound investors had been betting on since early spring. Wall Street's reaction was muted early in the day, but stocks cut early losses and crawled higher as the session progressed.
In the regular session, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average added 38.80 points, or 0.42 percent, to finish at 9,310.56. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6.48 points, or 0.66 percent, to 990.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 13.73 points, or 0.81 percent, to finish at 1,700.34, based on the latest available data.
Rising bond yields kept a lid on stock price gains. Treasury prices fell for a fourth session, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to a one-year high near 4.67 percent. Some investors fear that rising bond yields could choke economic growth by raising borrowing costs.
But after the power disruption, Treasury prices jumped. The 10-year note's price surged 25/32 , while its yield fell to 4.46 percent.
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits edged up slightly last week, the government said yesterday. But the number held below 400,000 for the fourth consecutive week, which economists say indicates some job creation.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose a slim 2,000, to 398,000 in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said.
A separate report showed the trade gap ata smaller-than-expected $39.5 billion in June, down from $41.5 billion in May on the biggest surge in exports in three years.
A third government report showed that the Producer Price Index, a gauge of inflation at the wholesale price level, crept up 0.1 percent in July, helping keep deflation fears at bay without igniting inflation concerns.
Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, rose 43 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $25.14. Cisco Systems added 21 cents, to $17.80.
International Paper climbed $1.11, to $40.80, and the aluminum producer Alcoa rose 78 cents, to $27.80. Both led the Dow higher.
But McDonald's dragged on the blue-chip Dow with a loss of 22 cents, to $22.95. Wachovia Securities cut the fast-food company to market perform from outperform, saying the shares were nearly fully valued.
The diversified manufacturer 3M added more pressure to the Dow, skidding $2.36, or 1.63 percent, to $142.14. Smith Barney cut its rating on 3M to in-line from outperform to reflect the company's recent strong upward move.

HEADLINE: Property Slump Ruins Many in Hong Kong 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
A long, steep fall in property values has wiped out the savings of a generation of homeowners here, fed political unrest and caused deflation that makes even Japan's falling prices pale by comparison.
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced tonight that 22 percent of all residential mortgages are now larger than the current value of the properties they financed. The share of such mortgages that are "underwater," in bankers' shorthand, has jumped from 14 percent of mortgages in just one year. 
 Members of the Hong Kong middle class, not the banks, have borne the brunt of the decline in prices. Deflation contributed to the enormous pro-democracy demonstrations that shook the political establishment of this Chinese territory last month; a Hong Kong University survey of the main march, on July 1, found that those taking part were largely the college-educated professionals who have faredworst from falling apartment prices here. 
Property market experts say that Hong Kong's experience is a cautionary tale for homeowners in other financial centers, like New York and London. Just as the rise and then plunge of the benchmark Nikkei stock index in Japan foreshadowed in many ways the rise and sharp drop in Nasdaq stocks in the United States, the steep run-up in residential property prices here until 1997, followed by a 66 percent drop since then, offers a reminder that real estate prices do not always go up.
Johnny Lam, 46, a salesman here for a Japanese food importer, is an example of how badly a real estate investment can turn out. He and his wife, Connie, bought a $186,000 apartment in an outlying suburb in 1993, turned down a $218,000 offer in 1997 and then watched the apartment's value fall to $70,000. With Hong Kong's economy stagnant since 1997, Mr. Lam stopped earning overtime pay and his wife lost her job, prompting them to file for bankruptcy in February and turn in the apartment keys to the bank. They now live with their daughter, Shelley, who is 14, in a slightly smaller apartment for which the rent is less than a third of their mortgage payments.
"I wanted to go on, to pay for things, but my daughter asked me to file for bankruptcy," Mr. Lam said. "She sees the real situation."
Falling housing prices have dragged down broader price gauges, as well. Overall consumer prices have declined 15 percent, down for 56 consecutive months. Many workers have received cost-of-living pay cuts, a painful blow to anyone with large debts, like a mortgage.
In the last few days, there have been several tentative signs that the real estate market and the economy may have finally hit bottom and could start to recover -- in part, oddly enough, because of Beijing's reaction to the discontent here.
The benchmark Hang Seng stock index has climbed to its highest level in almost a year. Property stocks have helped propel this, some of them rallying by more than 40 percent since the worst of the outbreak last April of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease disappeared here around the end of June.
Chinese leaders in Beijing have used economic concessions to Hong Kong in an attempt to allay public anger about plans for stringent security laws. The concessions have strengthened Hong Kong's ability to compete with Shanghai, which has grown enormously over the last decade -- to a considerable extent because of huge loans by state-owned banks that are seldom repaid, an advantage Hong Kong has not had.
Two days before the July 1 march, China concluded a trade agreement that allows Hong Kong companies, including the subsidiaries of multinationals, to enter the Chinese market earlier than companies elsewhere. Hong Kong, a British colony until its handover to China in July 1997, has separate laws and immigration rules. 
Beijing agreed late last month to review ways to allow Hong Kong to become the first offshore banking center doing business in China's currency, which will strengthen Hong Kong's role as a financial center. Shanghai's stock exchange is stumbling, while the biggest banks are all still based in Beijing.
Shiu Sin-por, executive director of the One Country Two Systems Research Institute here, which has close links to Beijing's rulers, said that some transactions in the Chinese currency would be authorized, probably by the end of this year. A team of Chinese central bankers visited last week, he said, adding that "the focus is what level of activity will be allowed."
But the biggest news for Hong Kong was the Chinese authorities' decision last week to allow residents of four of the biggest and wealthiest cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen -- to begin traveling here on their own as tourists, starting Sept. 1, instead of coming on officially approved business trips or with organized tours.
Mainland business owners, flush with profits from a national economy growing 8 percent a year, had already become the biggest new buyers of Hong Kong real estate, and the new rules promise to increase that role considerably. Three- and four-star hotels, the sort usually occupied by mainland visitors, are already overbooked beginning next month.
To accommodate the visitors, the Hong Kong administration is reviewing a plan to offer short-term rentals of some of the thousands of apartments the Housing Authority has built but not sold for fear of depressing property prices further. That inventory of more than 10,000 unsold apartments could prevent prices from rising quickly in any recovery.
The Hong Kong property market soared in the mid-1990's despite conservative bank lending practices. Regulators here let banks lend up to 70 percent of the value of a property, in contrast to practices in Japan, where banks sometimes lent 100 percent or even 120 percent of a property's value during the 1980's boom there.
As in New York, although for different reasons, the supply of land for new buildings has been limited. Construction finally began catching up with demand in the late 90's, even as the economy stagnated.
While many Southeast Asian nations devalued their currencies during the financial crisis of 1997-98, Hong Kong kept its dollar linked in value to the strong United States dollar -- something that eroded Hong Kong's competitiveness.
One of the most unusual features of the deflation here is how well the banks have survived it. By requiring borrowers to put up 30 percent of the money themselves, banks left themselves a large cushion against losses. Mortgages that are underwater now are mostly for properties that changed hands within just a few years of the high point of the bubble economy in 1997.
By comparison, the Japanese banking industry has been hobbled for a decade as residential property prices dropped by about the same percentages as here, while Japanese commercial property prices fell slightly more.
The Hong Kong banks have further benefited from what critics describe as their cozy pattern of limited competition on loan interest rates, at least until recently. Mortgages were typically issued at the prime rate during the 1990's boom years, which was very profitable.
Only now, with banks stuffed with deposits and finding few credit-worthy borrowers, have mortgage rates fallen to the point that 92 percent of new mortgages are being issued at rates more than two percentage points below the prime rate, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which effectively serves as Hong Kong's central bank.
Most remarkable of all is how most Hong Kong residents, unlike Mr. Lam, have gone on making steep monthly mortgage payments for apartments that are now worth less than the mortgages, instead of mailing the keys to the bank, filing for bankruptcy and then renting another apartment for less. 
"If anybody outside Hong Kong looks at it, they ask why people don't just walk away," said Ryan Tsang, a banking expert at Standard & Poor's.
The answer lies in the high savings rate of Hong Kong's people and the strictness of its bankruptcy statutes. Many people wealthy enough to buy an apartment in bubble times typically have other assets that a bank can claim in a bankruptcy proceeding to make up the difference between the value of the apartment and the balance due on the mortgage.
Some of the biggest frustrations from real estate losses are for people like Mr. Lam, who never saw themselves as speculators but lost their savings anyway.
"I wasn't thinking about the rise in the market," he said. "I wanted a place to live."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT OF 2003: THE PAST; 
The Blackouts of '65 and '77 Became Defining Moments in the City's History

BYLINE:  By MARTIN GOTTLIEB and JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
There was, before yesterday, the good blackout and the bad blackout: the 15-hour power loss beginning on the evening of Nov. 9, 1965, that was largely characterized by cooperation and overriding good cheer and the 25-hour one beginning on the sticky night of July 13, 1977, that was defined by widespread looting and arson in the city's poorer neighborhoods.
 Until Sept. 11, 2001, they were the most wide-ranging catastrophic events to strike modern New York City, causing, in the case of the 1977 blackout alone, 3,800 arrests and more than a billion dollars in damage that can be seen today on streets like still-battered Broadway in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. The dimensions of those blackouts ensured that they would always have a niche in the city's history, but they have assumed a far greater place, becoming defining events. The first blackout instantly became an emblem of civic spunk and resilience, the second of civic disarray and uncertainty at a time of overwhelming municipal budget woes, economic deterioration, and fear caused by a serial killer known as Son of Sam. 
 "I think the way the '65 blackout is remembered generally is as sort of an exciting challenge -- that's when we thought of the babies being born nine months later," said Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New York Historical Society. "It was recalled as a shared difficulty. In 1977, the riots and the arson and the looting was seemingly symptomatic of a city that experienced very difficult times."
Even before the 1965 blackout, there were precursors in 1959 and 1961, reflective of the enormous surge in the use of electricity across the country in the years after World War II. About half a million people were affected each time. Each of the earlier blackouts began when high-capacity power cables failed as the city was drawing record amounts of power during extremely hot summer days, said Phillip F. Schewe, a physicist and writer who is preparing a book on the 1965 blackout.
In 1965, a giant cascade of failures on the power grid began when the breaker on a single cable was set too low on the Canadian side of Niagara, Dr. Schewe said. The cable's power was taken up by another set of cables, whose breakers also tripped, funneling the excess power elsewhere. Quickly, a "tsunami of power" was heading south, toward upstate New York, he said.
In New York City, as monitoring dials went wild, a crucial operator at the main power control station made frantic phone calls upstate instead of preemptively shutting down the city's system to protect it. Automatic shutoffs took over and suddenly closed down the Con Ed system for the first time in its history, causing damage to the power system. A 1,000 megawatt steam-turbine generator nicknamed "Big Allis" burned up its bearings. The power failure ultimately covered 80,000 square miles and affected about 25 million people.
Nowhere were the effects more evident than in New York City, where 800,000 rush-hour commuters were stranded in subways, cars clogged every road, Kennedy and La Guardia Airports were closed as at least 200 airplanes were diverted, and Broadway stayed dark. Thousands of people were stuck in elevators for hours on end and suburban commuters gave up on getting home.
But the city underwent an epidemic of pluck. People voluntarily directed traffic, handed out candles and settled down at Grand Central Station for a night of sleep, without much of a worry about their wallets.
The well-mannered and sometimes even buoyant tenor of the night was captured by Murray Schwab, a bookkeeping teacher at the old Central Commercial High School on East 42nd Street, who was quoted in "The Night the Lights Went Out," a book put together by the staff of The New York Times. Classes were still in session for some students and as Mr. Schwab recalled, "When the lights went out, the kids made jokes like 'Somebody should have paid the electric bill.' As the evening wore on we sang songs, even me with my voice. After a few hours they began to get sleepy. They put their heads down on tables and went to sleep."
For a city going through enormous ethnic and racial transitions, one that experienced rioting in Harlem a year earlier, the experience was reassuring and exhilarating. Within days some advertising executives published a book of cartoons entitled "Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?" The phrase, and the good-humored attitude behind it, stuck.
A series of lightning strikes set off the 1977 blackout. The first strike came at 8:30 p.m. on July 13, cutting off one huge power plant -- the Indian Point No. 3 plant -- and a second cut off another major plant, precipitating a general shutdown. By 9:30, the entire city was dark.
Because of the power failure, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports were closed down for about eight hours, automobile tunnels were closed because of lack of ventilation, and 4,000 people had to be evacuated from the subway system. Con Ed called the shutdown an "act of God," enraging Mayor Abraham Beame, who charged that the utility was guilty of "gross negligence."
In many neighborhoods, veterans of the 1965 blackout headed to the streets at the first sign of darkness.
But many of them did not find the same spirit. In poor neighborhoods across the city, looting and arson erupted. The Fire Department counted 1,037 fires burning throughout the city that night, more than 50 of them serious. On streets like Brooklyn's Broadway the rumble of iron store gates being forced up and the shattering of glass preceded scenes of couches, televisions, and heaps of clothing being paraded through the streets by looters at once defiant, furtive and gleeful.
"The looters were looting other looters, and the fists and the knives were coming out," Carl St. Martin, a neurologist in Forest Hills, Queens, recalled years later. A third-year medical student living in Bushwick when the blackout hit, he spent the night suturing a succession of angry wounds at Wyckoff Heights Hospital.
Before the lights came back on, even Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue was looted. On the first Sunday after the blackout, a priest named Gabriel Santacruz looked out at the congregation in St. Barbara's Church in Bushwick and bleakly told it, "We are without God now."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT OF 2003: LAWSUITS; 
Plaintiffs to Face Hurdles Proving Liability

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
The economic harm caused by the blackout will be enormous, and lawsuits are certain to be filed. But plaintiffs will face substantial hurdles.
 In New York and most other states, people suing utilities must prove more than negligence, the legal term for carelessness. In a case arising from the July 13, 1977, blackout that left most of New York City in darkness for 25 hours, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, held that the defendant, Consolidated Edison, "cannot be held liable for interruption of service due to the ordinary negligence of its agents and employees." Rather, plaintiffs were required to prove either willful misconduct or "gross negligence," which means, the court explained, "the failure to exercise even slight care." 
 Some customers were able to prove that in connection with the 1977 blackout. The utility's misconduct, the court said, included poor staffing decisions and its employees' failure to reduce voltage after lightning hit the electrical system.
The same court later ruled that the utility could not be sued by noncustomers. The plaintiff in that case, Julius Strauss, 77, sued after falling down a darkened stairway. He was a tenant in the building; his landlord had contracted for electrical service.
"In determining the liability of utilities for consequential damages for failure to provide service -- a liability that could obviously be enormous and has been described as sui generis," Chief Judge Judith Kaye wrote for the majority in 1985, "courts have declined to extend the duty of care to noncustomers."
In a case arising from power failures caused by a water main break in 1983, the court reaffirmed the principle, declining to "hold regulated utilities liable to every tenant in every one of the countless skyscrapers comprising the urban skyline."
"This would," the court concluded, "unwisely subject utilities to loss potentials of uncontrollable and unworkable dimensions."
Some scholars have criticized the decisions concerning noncustomers, and they are out of keeping with those in some other states.
The Oregon Court of Appeals surveyed various states' approaches and concluded that "courts are virtually unanimous that provisions limiting a public utility's liability are valid so long as they do not purport to grant immunity or limit liability for gross negligence." 
Writing in the Energy Law Journal last year, Richard J. Pierce Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, saw one area of consensus in the various laws.
"Generally," he wrote, "they protect the owners of transmission lines from potential awards of damages caused by interruptions of, or fluctuations in, electricity service due to alleged negligence."
Among the reasons for limited liability cited by courts are that it produces lower rates and protects utilities from catastrophic losses, and, as the Texas Supreme Court put it, "a utility is a regulated monopoly that cannot pick and choose its customers or vary its rates to reflect differential damage exposures."
Professor Pierce noted, however, that the recent restructuring of the wholesale electricity market in the United States had left some legal issues unresolved.

 The world's largest independent power producer, the AES of Arlington, Va., said that it would not build a $500 million dam at Bujagali Falls on the Nile. 
Frustrated by protests and a nearly decade-long delay, the company pulled out of what would have been the largest foreign investment project ever in East Africa. Environmental advocates celebrated but the World Bank said that it continued to thing that the dam is the best way to increase Uganda's power supply. Marc Lacey (NYT)

 South Africa's central bank cut its benchmark lending rate by 1 percentage point, as expected, after inflation slowed to a 19-month low in June. It may provide little relief to exporters reeling from a rally in the rand. The bank cut the rate to 11 percent, well above comparable rates in the United States and Europe, and analysts said the South African currency, the rand, is unlikely to retreat from a recent rally.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT OF 2003: THE CONTEXT; 
Failure Reveals Creaky System, Experts Believe

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Neela Banerjee, Kenneth N. Gilpin, Carl Hulse, Christopher Marquis, Andrew Revkin and Matthew L. Wald contributed to this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
While energy experts differed on the precise cause of today's power blackout, they agreed that the extensive failure betrayed the age of the region's transmission system and its struggles to keep up with demand.
 "We are a major superpower with a third-world electrical grid," said Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, an energy secretary during the Clinton administration. "Our grid is antiquated. It needs serious modernization." 
 The power system in the Northeast has long been plagued by inadequate transmission capacity and bottlenecks nationwide, especially in the New York metropolitan area. Most of New York City's and Long Island's power at peak times must be generated in the city and on the island, because it is physically impossible to transmit that much power into the area along the existing lines. 
Bottlenecks limit how much power can be shipped east to west across upstate New York, north to south within New York, and across the Hudson from New Jersey, and attempts to put a major line from Connecticut to Long Island under Long Island Sound have been thwarted for years.
"We've got excess power in upstate New York, but there's no way to get it to New York City because of the bottlenecks," said Denise VanBuren, vice president of Central Hudson Gas & Electric, which supplies powerto eight counties north of New York City. "It's very difficult in this economy to get financing for a major transmission line, and we've been concerned for a long time about the region's transmission capacity."
With only a limited number of high-voltage lines, a power failure can spread more quickly when generators try to send their power to areas that need it, overloading the lines that remain. Generators are designed to switch off if their power cannot be transmitted, which is apparently what happened to dozens of turbines and nuclear plants around the Northeast and upper Midwest today.
"If there had been more lines available at the time this event occurred, it's possible they could have absorbed the load and kept the failure from spreading," said Jack Hawks, vice president for planning of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade association of generators.
The inability to pinpoint the exact site of the failure led to an unusual flurry of accusations on both sides of the international border. The office of the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, initially said the failure originated in a fire in a power plant near Niagara Falls on the American side, possibly caused by a lightning strike. Later, the office withdrew that statement.
A short while later, the Canadian cabinet defense minister in charge of emergency preparedness, John MacCallum, said that the power failure originated at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He did not explain his remarks. 
American officials denied both charges. A statement from New York State's power grid system shortly before midnight said that the event began somewhere west of the Ontario power system at 4:11 p.m., immediately taking out electric power in Ontario and parts of Michigan and Ohio. Blackouts in the Northeast and New York followed quickly, as generators there tried and failed to send power westward to the affected areas.
"It is not believed that the disturbance initiated in New York State," said the statement from the New York Independent System Operator, the consortium of power companies and state officials who manage the state grid. "Reports that the occurrence began in Niagara are not supported by the facts currently available." 
New York State officials said later that the event might have begun with a power surge at the Perry nuclear power plant near Cleveland.
President Bush said tonight that he had heard the reports of a lightning strike in the Niagara area and would have federal officials investigate the precise cause.
By 8:30 p.m., power was being restored to many areas in a ring around Manhattan, beginning with the southern Bronx and Westchester County and spreading to Queens, Brooklyn, and northern New Jersey. Mike Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the restoration process was not an easy one.
"Plants shut down, or go on standby, more or less automatically in a situation like this, to avoid pumping excess power into the grid that has nowhere to go," he said. "Then, when they come back on line, it isn't just a matter of flipping a switch. It can take hours to make sure equipment is O.K.."
The problem of preventing such power failures no one has an incentive to invest billions of dollars in new wires, new towers and new transformers, which are often opposed by residential neighbors. The old utilities have sold off their power plants but still hold a highly regulated monopoly on the network of lines, and they would only invest in new transmission if state regulators would guarantee them rate increases to pay for it.
That is the last thing the regulators, who deregulated much of the industry in hopes of lowering rates, would be willing to do. The entrepreneurial power companies that have bought up power plants have decided against building new transmission lines that would compete with existing ones, possibly driving down transmission charges, and would, at most times, be nothing more than "excess capacity."
Analysts said additional disruptions were quite likely as the economy begins to strengthen and the demand for electricity increases. 
"If the economy grows at 3.5 percent a year for the next several years, I would not be surprised if we don't have interruptions on a scale that is not acceptable to most Americans," said Irwin Stelzer, director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research institute. 
For several years, demand for power in the metropolitan area -- in fact, much of the Northeast -- has reached perilously close to the ability of existing plants to produce it. Experts have warned for years that at periods of peak demand, the failure of a single major power line could cause a blackout. So desperate was the Pataki administration to ensure adequate supply that it ordered 10 small generators installed around the city in 2001, over fierce opposition, to increase the available power.
After deregulation in the late 1990's, there was a burst of interest from many power companies in building new plants, but the collapse of Enron and the markets it had pioneered dried up much of the capital for such investments, and the recession curbed demand slightly. As a result, decisions on nearly all the plants proposed for New York City and surrounding areas are being delayed. 
In promoting deregulation in the 1990's, advocates had visions of vast waves of electrons being wheeled around the country on short notice, from producers to distributors to consumers, in rapid, highly efficient response to shifting supply and demand. In reality, the transmission system limits the ability to do that, especially when it comes to pushing power into and out of some major urban areas.
Energy legislation tied up in Congress for more than two years could lead to structural improvements in the nation's power infrastructure. But the electricity provisions are snagged in regional and political conflicts, with Southern lawmakers worried that their states will end up subsidizing Northern consumers. The House and Senate have passed separate energy bills, and the blackout is certain to figure prominently into negotiations over a final measure when Congress returns next month.
During the California blackouts of 2001, several members of Congress proposed spending $350 million to improve the nation's transmission system, but the measure was opposed by the Bush administration and was voted down by Congressional Republicans.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the blackout today caused seven nuclear power plants in New York and New Jersey and two in the Midwest to shut down automatically. 
The power plants feed electricity out into the wider grid of transmission wires, but they run their systems on power pulled back in from that grid. When there is a disruption in that incoming power, the plants automatically shut down their reactors and switch to diesel-fueled backup generators. 
The nuclear plants cannot be turned back on until the rest of the grid has power produced by other plants running on coal, gas or other fuels, said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the regulatory commission in its headquarters in Rockville, Md.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A map on Friday with the main article about the power failure showed incorrect locations for three nuclear power plants that were closed for their protection. They are in northern New York State, near Oswego and close to Lake Ontario, not in the southern part of the state, near Owego and Binghamton.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT OF 2003: NEW YORK CITY; 
In Frustration, Humor and Greed, A Powerless New York Endures

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW

 BODY:
A Times Square with no working traffic lights is not a pretty sight.
 But there stood Debra Ramsur, a traffic officer with spotless white gloves and a gleaming silver whistle, who for a time yesterday afternoon single-handedly tamed the great tides of cars and people. "Back it up!" she barked to a taxicab. "Let's go!" she bellowed to a laggard pedestrian. And then, a bit more sweetly, "Watch out, folks." 
 On a day of colossal disruption brought by an epic blackout, New York City was filled with similar scenes of stubborn resilience -- and also with moments of overheated frustration, spontaneous generosity, instant profiteering, anger and humor. 
It was also, as many residents were quick to note, a day with faint and unsettling echoes of the way the city felt and looked and acted on Sept. 11. Buses were packed, with commuters pressed right up to the front windshields. Mini-communities instantly formed near every car radio and boom box. People walked along dialing again and again on cellphones that did not work, trying to reach their families.
"People were freaking out," said Mike Tselnik, 21, an intern who works on the 38th floor of a Midtown high-rise for the Hess Corporation.
But if there was palpable relief as word spread that this was not the work of terrorists, there were also real though isolated moments of terror, and even tragedy. 
One middle-aged woman walked down many flights of stairs inside the darkened Met Life Building. Then she collapsed. A team of paramedics tried to resuscitate her. She vomited. She stopped breathing. The paramedics tried desperately to call for an ambulance. There were none to be found quickly on this afternoon of sudden chaos.
And so she lay there for more than half an hour, her body growing cold, in a dimly lit corner of Cafe Centro. The paramedics never gave up. Yet by the time an ambulance could be flagged down, it was too late.
The woman, whose identity was not released pending notification of her family, was pronounced dead at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. 
At the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue, waves of confused commuters were met by a small contingent of harried police officers trying, vainly, to push everyone back out.
"Where are we supposed to go!" one man shouted angrily, his buttoned-down shirt drenched with sweat. "There are a hundred thousand people out there on the street."
An officer wiped at his brow and blew his cool.
"What do you want from me!" he shouted, leaning into the man's reddened face. "I didn't cause this blackout. Now turn around and get out of the building."
Throughout the city, the strange economics of a blackout quickly took hold. On West 45th Street, the enterprising employees of the Dunhill Cafe quickly wheeled freezers of ice cream bars onto the sidewalk and shouted that prices had been slashed to $1 from $3. "Everything must go," Ranjit Singh, the manager, said. "We don't want to have to throw it out when it melts." Meanwhile, with virtually all restaurants closed, some hot-dog vendors doubled their prices.
On 125th Street near Lenox Avenue in Harlem, a young man walked around offering "flashlights -- $25; batteries -- $10." An elderly woman pushed a grocery cart filled with "ice-cold water." She was asking $5 a bottle. The bottles were hot.
Hotels scrambled to accommodate thousands of guests suddenly cut off from rooms by useless elevators and room keys.
"Some guests come up to us and ask if we're going to give them a discount, as if the Marriott caused the blackout," said Michael M. Manjon, captain of the rotating restaurant on the 46th floor of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square.
With darkness falling, though, conversations everywhere were filled with different versions of the same question: How would the city handle the night? Some veteran police officers saw reason to be hopeful.
"My feeling is there will be no disturbance tonight," said Officer Marc Donella of the Manhattan North Task Force. "This isn't '77. And listen, nobody's blowing the horn. They're all being very patient. Over on Lexington Avenue, there are civilians directing traffic."
Sure enough, in Central Park people lined up for a concert by the Indigo Girls, who were using a generator to run the sound system. On 110th Street and Lenox Avenue, the A&D Liquor store was still open at 6 p.m., as was Mama's Fried Chicken.
A few blocks further up Lenox, Officer Michael Meachem of the 28th Precinct sized up the scene. "Everybody's handling it well," he said. "At least till it gets dark."
Christopher Davie, 32, a hairdresser by profession, turned into traffic cop at Eighth Avenue and 29th Street, one of the most nightmarish intersections in the city even during the best of rush hours. 
Some shouted "Bravo!" to him. A grateful tourist from Montreal got out of her car and gave him a peach. Somebody gave him a whistle. "There were ambulances trying to get through," Mr. Davie said. "Somebody had to get out here and do this."
Charles Eads, a drapery installer in town from Utah on business, was another impromptu traffic cop. "Hold up at the crosswalk, please," Mr. Eads shouted politely at a throng of pedestrians crossing at the intersection of Eighth Avenue and West 56th Street. The Day-Glo yellow mesh vest he wore was a gift. "A woman walked by, took hers off and gave it to me," he said, waving cars along.
But for all the spontaneous good works, fear preyed on the minds of many. Chanel Johnson, 18, sat on the stoop on Lenox Avenue waiting for her mother, who works in a beauty parlor. "It's going to be crazy," she said. "They're going to be tripping. They're going to be bugging."
Still, the level of anxiety was clearly eased by the fact that so many crucial city institutions were continuing to provide some services because of backup generators.
"We've been able to start air-conditioning in patient units," said Lyn Hill, vice president for planning and public affairs at Methodist Hospital in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. "And the food line is moving. We have relatively normal operations. But we're trying to plan for what might happen if this continues, and there are problems at other hospitals." 
Bellevue Hospital Center has a 10-day fuel supply and a week's supply of medicine. Even the hospital's ventilators are attached to an emergency power supply that automatically switches over. 
Generators also provided limited electricity inside the city jails on Rikers Island. The cell doors are locked and unlocked manually. As of Thursday evening, said Thomas Antenen, a Correction Department spokesman, there had been no disturbances, although the department opened its emergency operations center as a precaution. 
Back in Times Square, where tourists usually flock to photograph the lights, this evening's attraction was the absence of light. The Nasdaq, Reuters and ABC billboards, normally garish displays of sensory overload, looked instead like great black tombstones.
"Are you scared?" Howard Rosen called out to his two boys, Ryan, 8, and Brandon, 12, stranded high up in the Ferris wheel that stands in the center of the Toys "R" Us in Times Square. 
"Yeah," they replied. They buried their heads in their arms, and store employees pulled out ladders to rescue those on the lowest cars. A small girl at the top began to sob.
"Dad," Brandon called to Mr. Rosen, visiting from Miami. "I'm never coming here again."
Still, the street sweepers in Times Square did not miss a beat. They pushed their brooms as if it were any other Thursday night. It was the same for the recruiters at the Armed Forces booth, and the break dancers and the portrait artists.
"I love New York for things like this," said Kevin Hein, a Manhattan graphic artist who had bought a disposable camera to snap a few shots of the black tombstone billboards staring down on Times Square.

To the Editor:
 "No Work, No Homes," by Bob Herbert (column, Aug. 14), etches the contemptuous stance of the Bush administration vis-a-vis the ranks of desperately poor and struggling working-class citizens. 
 The indifference of this president and his advisers is becoming more apparent. Indeed, the domestic ranks of the dispossessed and homeless are growing at an alarming rate.
One question looms: Will those same economically marginalized citizens bother to vote in the next presidential election?

 Bob Herbert ("No Work, No Homes," column, Aug. 14) laments federal inaction to curb unemployment. 
But what about states that make it worse? 
 California, for example, has a minimum wage 31 percent higher than the federal minimum. This increases existing payroll costs and depresses incentives for job creation.
The other West Coast states, with wage mandates far above the federal minimum, similarly have unemployment rates higher than the national average. Most economic models predict this outcome. The role of state governments in the cost of job creation should not be ignored.

Power Loss Hits Region; Authorities Dispute Cause
A surge of electricity to northern New York and Canada touched off a series of power failures and blackouts that left parts of at least eight states without electricity. In New York City, power was shut off by officials struggling to head off a wider blackout. Cleveland and Detroit went dark, as did Toronto and sections of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. A1

While energy experts disagreed on the precise cause of power blackout, they agreed that the extensive failure betrayed the age of the region's transmission system and its failure to keep up with demand. A1

The blackout in the Northeast stranded thousands of travelers as officials grounded planes taking off from the three major airports in the New York area as well as half-dozen others in smaller cities. A17

The Department of Homeland Security said that it determined within an hour that the huge power failure had not resulted from a terrorist attack and that the Bush administration moved quickly to offer assistance to state and local governments. A24

HEADLINE: City Seeking Court Backing For Bond Sale 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Lawyers for the city and state faced off in court today over whether a bond refinancing plan approved by the Legislature in May to help the city out of its financial crisis violated the State Constitution.
 The hearing was the latest round in an escalating legal and political battle between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki. At stake is nearly $500 million a year in savings the mayor is depending on to help the city balance its books. 
 Mr. Pataki has done everything in his power to block the plan, which the Legislature passed over his veto. He contends that it is fiscally irresponsible to refinance $2.5 billion in debt over the next 30 years -- debt that is left over from the 1970's.
Last week, he used his power over a little-known state authority, the Local Government Assistance Corporation, to scuttle the deal. That corporation was to have served as a conduit for state sales tax funds that the Legislature dedicated to back the new bonds.
Today, a lawyer representing the state argued before Justice Louis C. Benza in Albany that legislators had erred in drafting the law by inserting language that said the Legislature did not need to appropriate the sales tax money each year to pay off the new bonds.
In general, the Constitution says the state may not borrow money without a referendum. But in practice, the government has a phalanx of public authorities set up to circumvent that requirement, including the local assistance corporation itself. By law, the Legislature must appropriate the money each year to support the bonds that the corporation and other public authorities float.
The government's lawyer, Robert Smith, argued that by striking the requirement that the Legislature vote to appropriate $170 million each year to pay for the city's refinancing plan, the state was, in effect, committing itself to paying off long-term bonds without a referendum.
"The Constitution is clear: You can't have a 30-year commitment of the state without going to a referendum," said Mr. Smith, a private lawyer representing the local assistance corporation.
Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, conceded that the Legislature had made a mistake in drafting the law and that the city would have to ask lawmakers to approve the $170 million each year. But he said two other passages in the statute conflicted with the new language the lawmakers had inserted. Those passages, he said, made it clear that the state would have to appropriate the money every year, as did the city's prospectus for the bonds.
Urging the judge to clarify the existing law rather than strike it down, he said previousrulings had set a precedent that judges should assume that the legislature did not purposely set out to pass an unconstitutional statute. "I can't deny there is obviously a potential mistake here," he said to Justice Benza, "and it's your job to decide what did the Legislature mean."
Mr. Cardozo also reminded the judge that the stakes were high for the city. "If this is declared unconstitutional, the city will have a $500 million hole in its budget," he said. "You have to say, 'Did the Legislature intend to act unconstitutionally?' "
The judge did not rule from the bench, but asked the city to file a formal response to the state's complaint on Monday, and promised to rule by the end of next week. Earlier in the day, another Albany judge, Justice Thomas W. Keegan, ruled that the case should be decided in Albany rather than in New York City, and kept a restraining order that prohibited the city from the bond sale until a decision was made.
The city had intended to go ahead with the sale of the bonds on Wednesday, and the budget director, Mark Page, acknowledged that as a practical matter nothing could happen until Justice Benza ruled.
The attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, did not send deputies to the hearing to defend the state, as is customary. It was not immediately clear why.

To the Editor:
 Within Bob Herbert's Aug. 14 column are examples of why economists are misunderstood by most people, and why savvy politicians can connect with their constituencies even while offering nothing more than empty rhetoric. 
 Criticizing the Bush administration's policies, the economist Robert Solow characterizes the tax cuts as "redistributive in intent and redistributive in effect." While his contention may be on target, there is nothing in his quote that the average person can easily understand.
President Bush's assessment of the American economy is decidedly more upbeat and comprehensible: "This administration is optimistic about job creation." Mr. Bush may be ignoring the reality of today's job market, but you have no trouble understanding what he's saying.
Smart politicians understand that if you want to wag the dog, first get people to nod their heads.

 Bob Herbert's observations in "No Work, No Homes" (column, Aug. 14) are all too real to the middle class, the pillar of our economy in good times but the decaying foundation in bad. 
 The Bush administration refuses to understand the changes in this economy. We are no longer in the low-cost, high-demand times of the 20th century, when labor was the key component of efficiency.
Today, labor has become the enemy of efficiency, and industries want to automate. The increased life cycle of products like cars and computers means lower demand, so companies need to limit production. The end result? Fewer factories, which need fewer workers.
If President Bush can't open his eyes to the truth of this, the hemorrhaging may have only just begun.

HEADLINE: Host of Candidates Poses a Challenge for California Republicans 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Four prominent Republicans on the ballot and only one Democratic governor to throw out of his job.
 What's the California Republican Party to do? 
 As the campaign for the Oct. 7 recall election gets under way in earnest, Gov. Gray Davis and his fellow Democrats still have the biggest hurdle: keeping Mr. Davis in office while positioning Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante as a successor should Mr. Davis lose the recall vote. 
But the state's Republicans, who have taken delight in the Democratic squirming, are facing a monumental predicament of their own. They have four major contenders among the official list of 135 possible successors to Mr. Davis, and none of them seem prepared to back out.
Those four Republicans -- Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Simon Jr., Tom McClintock and Peter V. Ueberroth -- insist that they are in the race until the end. But some Republican strategists worry that their infighting might help hand victory to Mr. Bustamante and the Democrats.
"Every Republican has to be worried about Bustamante," said Shawn Steel, former chairman of the state Republican Party and one of the recall's original proponents. "We are not going to win this by having three perfect Republican campaigns and one mediocre Democratic campaign. That would spell victory for the Democrats."
There is no question that the early momentum among Republicans has gone Mr. Schwarzenegger's way, even within the state's Republican leadership and some of its elder statesmen. Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign announced today that George P. Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan administration, would serve as a chairman of an economic council advising him.
"I am grateful George has agreed to serve his state yet again," Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a statement.
In the week since Mr. Schwarzenegger officially entered the race, the state party has lost both its spokeswoman, Karen Hanretty, and one of its most visible consultants, Rob Stutzman, to the Schwarzenegger campaign. "Republican operatives move around," Mr. Stutzman said.
The ballot will have two parts: one that asks whether Mr. Davis should be removed from office, and another that asks voters to choose a successor from the 135 challengers should he lose. The Republican state chairman, George M. Sundheim III, long advocated a single Republican on the ballot, but gave up on the idea as it became apparent that there was no consensus candidate.
Since then, Mr. Sundheim has been careful to say the party remains welcoming to all the Republicans. He says the departure of Ms. Hanretty and Mr. Stutzman came about because of their individual decisions, "not by action on a party level."
But at the same time, the state's Republican Congressional delegation has made no attempt to appear evenhanded. Half of its 20 members have already lined up behind Mr. Schwarzenegger, with none of the others so far endorsing any other Republican in the race.
Representative David Dreier, a Los Angeles County Republican who heads the delegation and was the first to endorse Mr. Schwarzenegger, said he had spoken with Mr. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, and Mr. Simon, who lost to Mr. Davis in the election for governor last year, to encourage them to join the Schwarzenegger juggernaut. Mr. Dreier said today that he also intended to ask Mr. McClintock, a state senator with a long Republican resume, to do the same.
"I am not arm-twisting," Mr. Dreier said in a telephone interview. "But at the end of the day, I do hope that Bill Simon, Tom McClintock and Peter Ueberroth all rally around Arnold. We need someone who will be an amazingly successful, charismatic and exciting ambassador for California aroundthe world. And that someone is Arnold."
Mr. Sundheim said he had taken a different tack with the competing Republican candidates. "Right now," he said, "I am saying keep the message positive. The only way we can lose is if we start going at each other and tear each other down."
But the two prominent conservatives in the mix -- Mr. Simon and Mr. McClintock -- maintain that the party elders are misreading the recall effort's grass-roots conservative origin. Though the drive has grown well beyond those beginnings, the McClintock and Simon campaigns remain convinced that conservative Republicans are the most motivated voters in the recall. They see Mr. Schwarzenegger, a moderate, as beatable on the strength of that conservative base.
But even if they are correct, the two conservatives have been unable to sort through a fundamental problem: They are essentially competing for the same group of voters, which, if split, would most likely sink both candidacies. That situation has led to tension between the two campaigns.
K. B. Forbes, a spokesman for Mr. Simon, describes the recall election as "an A B C race" -- Arnold, Bill and Cruz; Mr. McClintock does not even warrant a mention. John M. Feliz, meanwhile, the McClintock campaign director, acknowledges the Simon factor but insists that if someone has to go, it must be Mr. Simon.
Asked if either Mr. Simon or Mr. McClintock would drop out of the race, Mr. Feliz replied: "One of them will. It is not going to be us."
As a practical matter, the Republicans face another obstacle that the Democrats do not. Even if the Republicans rally around a single candidate, it is too late to remove any of the candidates' names from the ballot, according to the secretary of state's office. That deadline passed last Saturday, when the final paperwork for candidates was due.
"If they choose not to campaign, that is their choice," said Doug Stone, a spokesman for the secretary of state's office, "but if they are on the certified list, they are on the ballot."
The abundance of candidates, Republican and otherwise, was one of the ticklish issues confronting the California Broadcasters Association today. The group, which represents nearly 1,000 television and radio stations across the state, announced that it would present a recall debate on Sept. 17.
The problem with the 90-minute debate, however, is trying to decide whom to invite. If all candidates appeared, each would get just 40 seconds of airtime. The association said it would narrow the field to "candidates who have a reasonable chance of winning."
But nothing about the recall is simple, even a debate. The association issued a complex series of criteria for candidates to qualify:
Anyone who receives at least 10 percent support as measured in one of the state's three major public opinion polls before Sept. 5 automatically makes the cut.
But if fewer than six candidates meet that criterion, an independent poll of undecided voters will be conducted by California State University to determine which of the remaining candidates -- those polling at least 5 percent -- "are preferred in the debate," the association said.
Winners -- of the university survey, that is -- would be announced on Sept. 8.

HEADLINE: Newark To Nepal And Back 

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
When Sherry B. Ortner was a bookish, secretly rebellious student in high school in Newark in the 1950's, she says, "I didn't even know what anthropology was.
 "I thought it was about insects. But I looked at a description in the Bryn Mawr catalog as a senior, and it sounded really interesting." 
 From that unlikely beginning, Ms. Ortner has become, in the words of The Chronicle of Higher Education, "one of the most prominent anthropologists of her generation." For 30 years she has studied gender and social and cultural theory, helping invent the field of feminist anthropology, winning a MacArthur "genius award" and traveling to the Himalayas to produce major works on Nepal's Sherpa culture and Mount Everest. 
And now, after much journeying, Ms. Ortner, 61, has returned professionally to the place she once dreamed of leaving to explore the world: her alma mater, Weequahic High School. In her new book, "New Jersey Dreaming: Capital, Culture and the Class of '58" (Duke University Press),being published next month, Ms. Ortner dissects the familiar contours of her graduating class.
She said she wanted to explore how her classmates were formed by the world of the 50's, with its rigid demarcations of class, gender and race, as well as how they "moved through history and made something else out of it," whether by burning their bras or marching for civil rights.
A short woman with short, blond hair, and a straight-forward manner, Ms. Ortner speaks with an unaffected New Jersey twang. Last month she was named chairwoman of Columbia University's anthropology department, where she has a spare office in a dreary corner of a scruffy building. She is married to a Columbia colleague, Timothy D. Taylor, a music professor, and has a 23-year-old daughter.
The idea for "New Jersey Dreaming" came to her after she was invited to her 30th-anniversary high school reunion. She had long been fascinated by the way class shapes people's lives, but did not know how or where to examine that idea. She decided to use her own high school class. Her classmates had managed largely to shuck their working- and middle-class origins to become part of the "white overclass," as she says in the book: doctors, lawyers, college professors.
That class of 304 students was 83 percent Jewish, with some black and gentile white students. She got information from about 250 of them for the book and conducted interviews with more than 100. Her own family was pretty typical, middle class and Jewish, she says, her father the owner of a small packaging business, her mother a homemaker. Ms. Ortner recalled not being quite a nerd but more smart than popular, the editor of the yearbook, not a cheerleader. Her big rebellion was secretly dating non-Jewish guys.
Weequahic (pronounced wee-QUAY-ic) High was considered top-notch. This neighborhood in the southwest corner of Newark was an American dream for the up-and-coming. Philip Roth graduated from Weequahic High, one of the city's five public schools. Allen Ginsberg grew up in the neighborhood. Now the whole area is predominantly black and economically struggling.
"I thought it was going to be extremely fraught, going back and talking to people," Ms. Ortner said. "I think I was kind of a snob. When I left high school I thought I was perhaps the only woman who made something of herself. When I left, I was really glad to get out."
But after being out of touch for years, the pleasant surprise was that her former classmates (the book uses pseudonyms) had led interesting lives and were intrigued by her project. Many were keenly aware of being shaped by the prefabricated possibilities of the 50's. In long interviews they talked about their families' class backgrounds, the meaning of success and their identity.
The women were propelled by the women's movement, the African-Americans took advantage of civil rights gains and the Jewish men capitalized on waning anti-Semitism and the blurring of boundaries "between Jewishness and Americanness," as Ms. Ortner put it. Everyone rode the winds of robust economic times. Only 27 percent of the parents of the class of '58 were members of the business and professional classes, compared with 58 percent of their children.
The most important point, she said, is how individual careers are not just a matter of personal timing but are shaped by larger historical forces. "I broke the class into groups connected to movements in the United States," Ms. Ortner said. "Class background had an impact but not enough to understand what happened to people."
Ms. Ortner vividly captured those days when girls took home economics and boys took shop, said some of the classmates who were interviewed. They also said that things like race and sex roles did not really impinge on their consciousness at the time.
"In 1963, with the King 'I have a dream' speech, I started looking at things a little differently," said Norm Willis, a lawyer at J. P.Morgan Chase and an African-American from a blue-collar family. In 1968, when he was hired at Chase, he was told that he would be the first black employee in the banking division. "You look at the old photos and you see no blacks, no Asians, no women," he said of Chase. "The opportunities just weren't there."
Ms. Ortner's own life was certainly changed by the women's movement. "I knew the minute I got to Bryn Mawr that I was not going to be a suburban matron," she said. "They had a lot of feminist ideology there: 'You young women can be anything you want.' "
A 1962 Bryn Mawr graduate, she received her doctorate from the University of Chicago (where one adviser told her that she smiled too much). Teaching jobs at Princeton and Sarah Lawrence followed.
She was just out of graduate school, looking at how anthropology can be used to explore women's roles in society, when she shook up the anthropological world with an article about women's social roles titled "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" That 1972 essay set off a fierce debate about whether female subordination is universal and linked to women's biology. At the time she was criticized for overstating the universality of male dominance.
Ms. Ortner now insists that the essay was widely misunderstood, although she concedes that there are some cultures without such emphatic gender asymmetry. "I wasn't really saying it was women's plumbing or genes that keeps them down," she said in a recent interview. "I was saying that because women's bodies are more biologically involved with human reproduction, they appear more mired in nature than men, who seem transcendent." That general pattern, she said, still holds.
From 1977 to 1995 she taught anthropology, then women's studies at the University of Michigan, where she also did a three-year turn as chairwoman of the Anthropology Department, hiring more women and shoring up its national standing. During those years she was back and forth to Tibet, producing two of her three books on Sherpa culture.
Besides throwing out challenges to stimulate feminist anthropology, Ms. Ortner is also credited with expanding "practice theory," an approach that synthesized competing views in anthropology and sociology. One school of analysis held that people's behavior is based on their understanding of the world, the other that people are unaware of how their behavior is determined by political and economic systems. In her empirical studies, Ms. Ortner considered how people are shaped by both internal forces and their societies.
The MacArthur award in 1990 gave her $295,000 over five years and "changed my life," she said. It eased the way as she worked half-time for eight years and raised her daughter, Gwendolyn Kelly, now a graduate student in archaeology.
In 1996, after two years at the University of California at Berkeley, Ms. Ortner was lured to Columbia by Nicholas Dirks, an old Michigan colleague who was rebuilding the faltering anthropology department.
"She is a major force in the field," said Mr. Dirks, her immediate predecessor as head of the department. "Her name and work is at the forefront of many fields, from the Sherpas to practice theory to feminist theory and now American culture. To be so approachable, so modest, so unassuming is extraordinary."
"She has always been critical in translating complicated debates in social theory in ways that are sustained and important," he continued. Her use of practice theory "become so influential that generations of graduate students referred to it," he said.
Faye Ginsburg, director of the Center for Media, Culture and History at New York University, recalled that when she began graduate school in 1979, Ms. Ortner was a key figure among feminists. "She was in the camp that we shouldn't just be talking among ourselves," Ms. Ginsburg said, "but about what anthropology can contribute to the world beyond anthropology."
Now Ms. Ortner is thinking about her next project, perhaps on Hollywood and class or the new American power elite.
"Class is the one big social force that keeps dropping out of the national discourse," she said of her continued fascination with the subject. "We talk about race, we talk about gender. Class is inside race, it's inside gender. I am just really trying to put it back on the table in a way without dropping the other things."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Saturday about Sherry B. Ortner, an anthropologist who has written a book about her high school class, the class of 1958 at Weequahic in Newark, omitted a word in describing the school system at the time. There were five public high schools, not five public schools.

HEADLINE: Large Gain in Factory Output; Consumer Prices Rise Slightly 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Companies showed the biggest gain in production in six months in July, paced by demand for cars, electronics and electricity, and American consumers paid more for goods and services, the government reported yesterday.
 Industrial production at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.5 percent last month, more than expected and the most since January, the Federal Reserve said. Higher costs for gasoline and health care helped lift the Consumer Price Index by 0.2 percent in July, matching the rise in June, the Labor Department said. 
 The reports add to evidence that the economy is improving in the second half. The price figures may ease concern among investors and Fed policy makers that inflation may slow so much that it would hurt companies and sap the recovery.
"Stronger activity will help to support firms' ability to raise prices modestly, very modestly," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Connecticut. "It could help firms continue to repair profit margins."
The government was able to produce its reports yesterday because Washington escaped the power blackout that swept through the Northeast and Canada. The University of Michigan, however, delayed its August consumer sentiment report until Tuesday.
Companies increased production as retail sales posted the biggest gain in four months in July and inventories were kept near record lows compared with sales. The proportion of the nation's factory capacity in use rose to 74.5 percent from 74.2 percent in June, the Fed said.
Work at factories, which accounts for almost 90 percent of industrial production, rose 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in June. Production of consumer durable goods, which includes automobiles, furniture and electronics, jumped 2.3 percent after increasing 1 percent the previous month.
The rise in the Consumer Price Index matched analysts' forecasts, while the core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 percent, more than the forecast 0.1 percent. Industrial production exceeded forecasts of a 0.2 percent increase.
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at a 2.2 percent annual rate. For all of last year, prices rose 2.4 percent, the Labor Department said. Compared with 12 months ago, core prices were up 1.5 percent, matching the smallest annual gains since 1966, which were recorded in June and April.
"Consumer inflation remains restrained," said Steven Wood, principal economist at Insight Economics in Walnut Creek, Calif. "Despite the current acceleration in business activity, the substantial slack in the economy will continue to limit pricing power. Even with faster G.D.P. growth over the second half of the year, further deceleration in core consumer prices is likely."

HEADLINE: The Day the Lights Went Out; 
We're All On the Grid Together

BYLINE:  By Albert-Laszlo Barabasi; Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame, is author of "Linked: The New Science of Networks."

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind. 

 BODY:
Once power is fully restored, it will take little time to find the culprit: most likely, it will be a malfunctioning switch or fuse, a snapped power line or some other local failure. Somebody will be fired, promotions and raises denied, and lawmakers will draw up legislation guaranteeing that this problem will not occur again.
 Something will be inevitably missed, however, during all this finger-pointing: this week's blackout has little to do with faulty equipment, negligence or bad design. President Bush's call to upgrade the power grid will do little to eliminate power failures. The magnitude of the blackout is rooted in an often ignored aspect of our globalized world: vulnerability due to interconnectivity. 
 In the early days of electricity, all power was produced locally. First each neighborhood, later each city, had its own power plant. Local generators had to satisfy the peak demands of hot summer nights, when everything from air-conditioners to televisions run full power. That means that the generators were idle most of the time outside of peak hours.
That extra capacity was shared as utilities learned to decrease costs by connecting their facilities and helping each other out during peak-demand periods. The current power grid linked up formerly isolated systems with enough wire to stretch to the moon and back. It requires only a computer keystroke to redirect power produced in New York to the Midwest.
With thousands of generators and hundreds of thousands of miles of lines, the network became so interconnected that even on a normal day a single perturbance can be detected thousands of miles away. This created a whole new set of problems and vulnerabilities, the effects of which have been felt by millions in the past two days.
Because electricity cannot be stored, when a line goes down, its power must be shifted to other lines. Most of the time the neighboring lines have no difficulty carrying the extra load. If they do, however, they will also tip and redistribute their increased load to their neighbors.
This occasionally leads to a cascading failure -- a series of lines becomes overburdened and malfunctions in a short period of time. This is exactly what happened in August 1996 when, because of unusually warm weather, a 1,300-megawatt power line in Oregon sagged, hit a tree and went dead. Power was redistributed automatically but the other lines also failed, causing a blackout in 11 Western states and two Canadian provinces.
Cascading failures are common in most complex networks. They take place on the Internet, where traffic is rerouted to bypass malfunctioning routers, occasionally creating denial of service attacks on routers that are not equipped to handle extra traffic. We witnessed one in 1997, when the International Monetary Fund pressured the central banks of several Pacific nations to limit their credit. That started a cascading monetary failure that left behind scores of failed banks and corporations around the world.
Cascading failures are occasionally our ally, however. The American effort to dry up the money supply of terrorist organizations is aimed at crippling terrorist networks. And doctors and researchers hope to induce cascading failures to kill cancer cells.
The effect of power blackouts, economic crises and terrorism can easily be limited or even eliminated if we are willing to cut the links. Strictly local energy production would guarantee that each blackout would also be strictly local.
But severing the ties would also cripple the network. Shutting down international trade would surely eliminate the impact of the Japanese central bank on the American economy, but it would also guarantee a global economic meltdown. Closing our borders would reduce the chance of terrorist attacks, but it would also risk the American dream of diversity and openness.
The events of the past few days -- unwanted side effects of our network society -- are just one of the periodic reminders that we live in a globalized world. While celebrating that everybody on earth is only six handshakes from us, we need to accept that so are their problems and vulnerabilities.
Most failures emerge and evaporate locally, largely unnoticed by the rest of the world. A few, however, percolate through our dense technological and social networks, hitting us from the most unexpected directions. Unless we are willing to cut the connections, the only way to change the world is to improve all nodes and links.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: BUSINESS LOSSES; 
Insurers Say Most Policies Do Not Cover Power Failure

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Insurance experts said yesterday that there probably was no coverage for most of the business losses resulting from Thursday's power failure, which forced tens of thousands of shops, restaurants and factories to close and widely disrupted airlines and other transportation companies.
 Most policies for individual homes provide some protection for damage from loss of electricity, the experts said, especially for damage to refrigerators and other appliances. But the experts said they expected relatively few claims from homeowners because jolting power surges were not a main part of the latest failure. 
 Lawyers specializing in collecting insurance claims said that neither businesses nor homeowners should assume their losses are not covered, but should carefully review policies. "You may well have enhanced coverage," said David Steuber, a partner in Los Angeles in the firm of Howrey Simon Arnold & White. 
Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said that most commercial insurance policies specifically ruled out payment for losses for power failures. But, he said, perhaps 10 to 15 percent of commercial insurance customers buy supplementary policies that provide the coverage, compared with 20 percent that have bought terrorism coverage.
The coverage is not included in most policies, he said, because, while major power losses are infrequent, they can be extremely widespread -- as the latest one has been -- and can result in gargantuan losses.
"It would be difficult," he said, "for us to provide the type of coverage we would want to provide at a reasonable price." 
All kinds of businesses were harmed, but researchers said the effect was probably greatest on small businesses -- those with fewer than 50 employees -- which are less likely to have the special coverage. 
"They haven't been doing particularly well because of the overall economy," said William J. Dennis, who is in charge of research at the National Federation of Independent Business, adding, "I don't think probably a lot of folks are covered."
Small businesses, often strapped for cash, routinely buy only the most basic insurance. When disaster strikes, they may become eligible for government assistance, which often consists of low-cost loans and usually leaves the small businesses with unreimbursed losses. 
Mr. Hartwig said the most likely customers for the supplementary coverages were restaurants and florists, and companies that manufacture and store perishable foods and medicines and depend on refrigeration or heaters. But even among those kinds of businesses, he said, supplementary coverage is not widely bought. "People tend to say, 'Whatever it is, it's not going to happen to me,' " he said.
The main hope for insurance customers without supplemental coverage is the discovery of some obscure section in a policy that explicitly provides coverage in certain situations. One example, said Gregory V. Serio, the superintendent of insurance in New York, is coverage in some policies for damage occurring during the restoration of electricity. 
Because of many possible exceptions in the coverage, one Wall Street investment research firm, Fox-Pitt, Kelton, estimated that insurance companies could wind up paying out up to $3 billion. By contrast, the insurance industry lost an estimated $40 billion in the World Trade Center disaster, its biggest single loss ever.
The heaviest losses in the World Trade Center attack were about $11 billion in claims for the interruption of normal business and the loss of income. Mr. Hartwig said about 80 percent of the businesses in New York had that coverage at the time of the attack. Afterward, he said, some that had gone without the coverage bought it and others extended their coverage.
But business interruption insurance will not help those who lost sales because of the power failure, Mr. Hartwig said. Because the failure itself is not covered, he said, other ramifications like the loss of sales are not covered either.
On the other hand, in cases where the power failure caused a fire or where high temperatures after the loss of air-conditioning set off water sprinklers and caused water damage, the standard fire and water coverage in every commercial property policy would pay. Any business interruption resulting from the fire or water damage would also be paid even though a loss of sales or extra business expenses would not be reimbursed because of the power failure alone.
Mr. Hartwig said he expected a surge in sales of protection against power failures. "After earthquakes, we sell more earthquake insurance," Mr. Hartwig said.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: NEW JERSEY; 
Economic Toll 'Devastating,' A Troubled McGreevey Says

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Electrical service was restored to nearly all New Jersey homes by this afternoon, but the state's roadways, beaches and tourist destinations were still coping with serious disruptions from Thursday's blackout.
 Curtailed rail service led to sporadic traffic jams on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, particularly as the weekly pilgrimage of beachgoers headed for the Jersey Shore in the late afternoon. In Atlantic City, casino operators said their business had been slowed because some tour bus companies had been unable to ferry gamblers from New York City. 
 Gov. James E. McGreevey, who interrupted his own vacation at Cape May to respond to the situation, lifted the state of emergency this afternoon and ordered turnpike and parkway officials to resume charging tolls, which were suspended on Thursday. But Mr. McGreevey said he was troubled that the failure of the electrical grid left a million homes without power on Thursday afternoon, especially because the North American Electric Reliability Council, which has established rules for managing the system, had repeatedly assured state officials that it could prevent widespread power failures.
Mr. McGreevey, Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York demanded that federal officials investigate the cause of the blackout.
"When there is a crisis, that crisis must not be allowed to trip and cascade to affect the entire Northeast portion of the United States," Mr. McGreevey said this afternoon at a news briefing outside the ferry terminal in Hoboken. "There was a devastating toll. Not only in terms of the business community, but to the State Police, National Guard and Office of Emergency Management."
Mr. McGreevey said he would also request financing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay for the cost of responding to the blackout.
State officials said there were no known fatalities attributable to the blackout, and the governor said the state's emergency response plan, which was revamped after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, operated smoothly.
But even as lights and air-conditioners resumed working across the state, there were abundant signs of turmoil. Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's largest utility, reported that power had been restored to all but 5,000 homes by 2 p.m. But the company was nonetheless urging customers to use electricity sparingly to avoid overburdening the system.
Newark Liberty International Airport was operating, said Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, although many flights were delayed.
PATH trains and New York Waterway ferries were operating on normal schedules, but New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains offered only limited service. After the upheaval of Thursday, when thousands of New Jersey commuters endured epic journeys home, many heeded the advice of Mr. McGreevey and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, and took today off.
"I spent eight hours making it back last night," said Brian Frank of Ewing Township, whose trip home from an insurance firm in Manhattan included a four-mile walk, a cab, a bus, a ferry and a three-hour crawl down the turnpike as part of a group that squeezed into the car of a man he had met in a parking lot in Hoboken. "That's enough for one week."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: COMMUNICATIONS; 
Cellphone Failures Cause Many to Question Systems

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
As cellular telephone carriers labored to restore service yesterday, voices of concern were raised in Washington and elsewhere about the continued fragility of the nation's wireless networks even as the public grows more dependent upon them.
 Cellular service remained spotty throughout much of the Northeast and parts of the Midwest yesterday, despite the restoration of electrical power in many of the areas affected by Thursday's blackout, as heavy usage and continued problems at some transmitter stations continued to tax the system. 
 Service in New York City, which had been especially hard hit by power losses and high calling volume, had returned to normal by yesterday afternoon as power was restored across most of the city, according to local cellular carriers.
But the industry has drawn criticism for its networks' performance after the blackout, particularly in comparison to the land-line telephone system, which generally stayed in service. 
An aide to Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said yesterday that Mr. Tauzin wanted an investigation. "The big question we want answered is why there aren't better backup systems," the aide, Ken Johnson, said. 
After coming under fire for its massive service failures in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, the cellular industry, which is only partly regulated, had promised to upgrade its networks to better handle emergencies. Janee Briesemeister, a senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, said the service disruptions during theblackout proved that cellular companies required more public oversight. 
"It appears they didn't fulfill their promises," she said. "The industry markets cellphones as good for emergencies."
Assessments yesterday indicated that the number of cellular transmitters that failed was greater than industry officials had estimated late Thursday, in part because electrical power remained off longer than many had expected. Cell sites, which are essentially radio receiving and transmitting stations, generally have backup batteries that last only several hours before they need to be recharged. 
"The cellular network is designed for power outages of minimal duration," said Michael Grossi, a principal at Adventis, a Boston-based management consulting firm that works for mobile telephone providers.
"The system isn't fragile," he said. "But it has an Achilles' heel."
The land-line telephone system has a primary advantage over wireless ones because its network of wires can carry a small electrical power current along with conversations. As a result, many fewer, centrally located backup generators can keep the wired network operating. But if the electric utility system fails with the cellular network each cell site needs its own source of backup power. While batteries can work for short blackouts, industry analysts say it may not be economically feasible to have backup generators for every one of the hundreds of cell sites necessary for a city the size of New York.
Mr. Grossi said that the same economic limits meant that cellular networks are not built to sustain the huge spikes in traffic that can occur during emergencies. Verizon Wireless said its network experienced four times ordinary call volume on Thursday in Manhattan, while Sprint PCS in Manhattan had three times the normal call volume. 
During events like the blackout, Mr. Grossi said, the antennas at the various cell sites are unable to accept the sudden traffic surge, which he compared to a highway on-ramp becoming jammed with automobiles. Nor is various other equipment in the network built to sustain such bursts of activity, he said.
"The system isn't designed for that kind of wear and tear, or that radical of an event," Mr. Grossi said. It simply would not be cost effective for wireless carriers to gird the networks against such anomalies.
And yet, Mr. Grossi said, in light of the public's increasing reliance on the wireless networks, the companies need to find more effective power backup for their systems.
"With more and more people moving from wire line to wireless, there is probably a greater need to have more redundant systems," he said. 
Over the past several years, a small but growing number of people have completely given up their land lines in favor of using cellular phones exclusively. That trend is expected to continue, according to the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company in Boston, which estimates that nearly 3 percent of telephone users have made wireless phones their primary telephone.
Andrea Linskey, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, said that a number of cell sites ran out of battery power during the blackout, predominately in Manhattan and Detroit, although she declined to say how many. She said that the company deployed generators in some instances to revive dead sites. 
Sprint PCS said that it, like Verizon, had backup batteries at each cell site, but when those batteries expired, so did the sites. Dan Wilinsky, a Sprint PCS spokesman, said that the company had sent trucks with mobile generators to various cell sites to revive them. But even with a generator on the scene, once a site is dead it can take several hours to recharge the batteries.
Customers of the wireless carriers T-Mobile and Cingular were also affected in the blackout areas -- particularly in New York City and other parts of the Northeast, where Cingular uses T-Mobile's network. 
But users of Cingular's wireless Mobitex network, which transmits data to BlackBerry's and other hand-held devices, were well served during the blackout. Federal Express, which uses the network to track packages in the United States, said it did not experience any problems.
The Mobitex network is based on pager technology and has greater backup capabilities.

HEADLINE: Herb Offers Hope to Africans Ravaged by Malaria 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: BUJUMBURA, Burundi 

 BODY:
Surrounded by scores of ailing children at a makeshift health clinic, a white-coated nurse moved quickly from one to the next, putting his hand on each little forehead.
 "I don't use a thermometer at first," said the nurse, Theodore Bitangi, who has grown used to the huge crowds. "Just by touching I can tell if they're too hot." 
 The rebels who have rampaged through Burundi for the last decade may seem this country's most ominous killers, with their automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Even more dangerous, it turns out, are malarial mosquitoes, which thrive in Lake Tanganyika and buzz across Burundi with a vengeance exceptional even on a continent where malaria kills about a million people a year. 
An epidemic from late 2000 to the summer of 2001 generated 3 million cases in a country of 6.5 million people. Some 85 percent of people live in areas at risk of the disease, often overshadowed by AIDS, which preys on those who have not yet built up natural defenses, particularly children. 
The rate of resistance to common malarial drugs like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has grown so high in Burundi that they are now deemed ineffectual here. 
The severity of the problem has placed Burundi in the vanguard of a new treatment, one that health professionals are saying could be as life-saving as the most far-reaching peace accord. 
Increasingly, health experts are recommending a combination treatment, called artemisinin, that comes from a Chinese herb. Burundi is one of just a handful of African countries to adopt the method officially. 
The approach is costlier than others and requires more pills, leading some critics, especially in the United States, to question whether it is right for the remotest reaches of Africa. 
But as it has become clear that other approaches are failing, artemisinin has emerged as the consensus choice among the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and others. Doctors Without Borders began issuing the pills in Burundi several years ago, even before the government finally endorsed them last year. 
Still, the treatment does nothing to stop the spread of the disease. The first line of defense is keeping the mosquito off human skin. That is no easy task. 
Most Africans do not bother with the mosquito repellant creams or prophylactic drugs that foreign visitors insist on. For those living in affected areas for long periods, insecticide-treated nets remain the cheapest and most effective way of containing the spread of malaria, experts say. But only about 15 percent of African children sleep under nets and only 2 percent have their nets doused with insecticide, according to a survey by Unicef. 
So the feverish and crying children continue to show up every morning at clinics like this one in the Kiname neighborhood of Bujumbura.
A hand on the forehead detects the hint of a fever. Then a rapid test allows the medical staff to know within minutes whether the mosquito-borne parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has infected a patient.
A child's finger is pricked, a drop of blood is put on a plastic card, and much like an at-home pregnancy test, a clear indication of yes or no appears. This can be done even in the most remote places. 
"It's positive," said Esperance Simire, a nurse who tested Brice Ndagizimana at the Kiname clinic. Just 15 months old, the boy had already tested positive for malaria four previous times, said his mother, Lydia Ndayisaba, 21, who cradled the listless baby close to her.
For Brice and other youngsters, the disease is life threatening. But malaria affects Ms. Ndayisaba no more severely than the flu. She has come down with it at least twice a year for as long as she can remember.
Still, the malaria symptoms weaken victims so they are more vulnerable to other ailments. The disease also saps already ailing African economies by keeping workers home in bed.
"There are some who say that without getting rid of malaria you don't have enough healthy workers to sustain an economy," said Dr. David Olson, an American who is the medical coordinator for the French chapter of Doctors Without Borders in Bujumbura. "It costs to treat them again and again, and they're always off work."
The civil war in Burundi and other conflicts across Africa only compound malaria's impact. The tens of thousands of people in Burundi's hillsides displaced by the war are often forced to sleep in the open air, with the mosquitoes. Relief workers are often unable to reach war-torn areas in the interior of the country to distribute bed nets and teach locals the basics about the disease. 
"I think it's malaria," said Victoire Nyandwi, 30, thrusting her shrieking 9-month-old boy at a visitor to the clinic. "He's shaking and he throws up a lot. He's getting pale and he stopped taking milk."
Asked how her son Shadrak had come down with the ailment, Ms. Nyandwi offered the same explanation as many other mothers: drinking dirty water. While that causes many ailments in developing countries, malaria is not one of them. 
But one thing no African mother has to be taught is how quickly malaria can kill. They have seen too many babies who are healthy one day and unable to move the next. When an intense fever hits, mothers strap their infants to their backs and trek to the nearest clinic, only sometimes making it in time. 
Little Brice was badly dehydrated when he arrived the other day, and the nurses decided his condition was so severe that he needed to be treated with a malarial drug intravenously. He yelped when Mr. Bitangi, the nurse, tried to insert a needle in a vein in his tiny arm. He yelped even more when the nurse opted instead for the vein in his temple.
"It's over, it's over," Cecile Richard, the field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, told Brice gently, stroking his forehead. "You're going to be O.K." 
As the boy starred wide-eyed at those who were treating him, his face covered with sweat, Ms. Richard relished the expected arrival of the new antimalaria drugs. "If we can control malaria," she said, "we can focus on everything else."

 THE POWER SYSTEM B2-4
Restarting power after a staggering blackout is a matter of precise choreography among often-distant power generators. A misstep can send the system back into the black. Through the years, improvements that might have prevented the blackout have been largely ignored, engineers and others with expert knowledge of the North American system of transmitting electricity said. When power does stop flowing, some people are certain to remember two things, the second of which is the answer to "Where were you when the lights went on?"

TRANSPORTATION B5
The New York region's transportation system began to stagger back to life, with one formidable exception: the subways. For the most part, commuters tended to stay away from the city, taking advantage of the first day of a windfall three-day weekend. At airports from New York to Los Angeles, travelers seemed to spend more time camping out than boarding planes. Swarms of international travelers were stranded without water for a second day at John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT B6-7
In terms of the effect on the economy, the blackout is nothing more than a bad snowstorm, economists said. But for some businesses, the impact may be greater: insurance experts said there probably was no coverage for blackout-related losses. Broadway slowly crept back to life ("Gypsy" and "The Producers," were sold out). Cellphone service rebounded, too, but not without concerns about the fragility of the nation's wireless networks. Restaurant owners around New York returned to find unspeakable puddles and odors in their walk-in refrigerators.

THE NEW YORK SCENE B8-11
The lights were out, but hey! Was that the Big Dipper? There were other trade-offs. You could see the moon clearly, but you couldn't get cash from a cash machine. Titanic mountains of pungent trash baked in the summer sun, but an armada of garbage trucks, litter basket collection trucks and street sweepers advanced to make pickups. High-rise dwellers learned to appreciate what electricity can do for water pressure -- provide it -- yet the blackout did not encourage an onslaught of crime, just as in 1977.

MEDICAL CARE B12
At hospitals, backup generators were the difference between disaster and business as usual. The blackout cost one woman the chance for a liver transplant; the donor liver was taken to Pittsburgh instead, for another patient at a hospital with a reliable power supply.

POLITICS B13-14
After a deliberative step into the spotlight, President Bush offered details, promises of aid and a pitch to improve the nation's electricity grid. One supporter said Mr. Bush is sensitive that local officials, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, should be on the air first. Mr. Bloomberg, even if many of his constituents were unable to see or hear him through the normal media channels, has been energetic in trying to project calm in the face of adversity. In Congress, lawmakers said the blackout would give new importance to elements of an energy plan aimed at upgrading the power grid.

THE NATION B15
Lakeside Avenue in Cleveland, right across from the football stadium on the downtown waterfront, was strangely barren. But though the empty streets, deserted parks and darkened offices seemed strange on a weekday afternoon, Cleveland was, in truth, returning to normal. Government offices were closed, as were many shops. But yes, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was open.

Blackout's Greatest Cost May Be Just Inconvenience
For all the inconvenience and disruption that the blackout of 2003 inflicted on the Northeast, the damage to the national economy is not likely to be any worse than damage from a bad snowstorm -- a blip in the statistics that soon disappears.
 The potential for denting the nation's economic growth came not from New York, but from Detroit and Cleveland, where power might not be fully restored until Monday, disrupting production at the auto assembly and parts plants in those cities. Page B6. 

Many experts say that it is far too early to calculate the overall economic effects of the blackout. But as always in New York, the blackout produced economic winners and losers; and as always, hustle helped. B1.

Insurance experts said there probably was no coverage for most of the business losses resulting from the power failure across the Northeast that forced tens of thousands of shops and restaurants and factories to shut down and widely disrupted airline operations and other transportation companies. B6.

As cellular telephone carriers tried to restore service, voices of concern were raised in Washington and elsewhere about the continued fragility of the nation's wireless networks even as the public grows more dependent upon them. B7.

Investigation at American Capital
A company that is dependent on repeated access to the capital markets may be more vulnerable than most to any hint of a problem. That may be the problem confronting American Capital Strategies, an investment company that reports profits from loans to companies it controls but does not report the operating results of those companies to its investors.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: THE ARTS; 
Broadway Is Back, but Many Museums Stay Dark

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY; Ben Sisario and Emily Eakin contributed to this article.

 BODY:
Broadway and the city's other cultural institutions slowly crept back to life yesterday after across-the-board cancellations caused by Thursday's blackout. 
 All 23 productions currently running on Broadway performed as scheduled last night, after power was restored to most of the Theater District just past noon. Several sold out, including "Gypsy" and "The Producers." 
 Some economic damage, however, had already been done. Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, Broadway's major trade group, said yesterday that the industry had probably lost $1 million from Thursday's canceled performances, though producers hoped that some patrons would exchange their tickets rather than ask for refunds. 
Insurance may cover some losses, though many companies require a theater production to miss at least two performances before a policy takes effect. Ticket exchanges may also prove difficult for several productions scheduled to close this month, including the hit revival of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Man of La Mancha," both of which close on Aug. 31. 
Still, Mr. Bernstein seemed positively bullish that theatergoers would return in droves after an evening devoid of song and dance. 
"I think the shows will be sold out tonight," he said late yesterday afternoon. "I think every ticket out there will get bought by someone who is either hunting for a deal or who has had their travel plans delayed."
Other cultural institutions, however, were still struggling to reopen, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum, both on the Upper East Side; after being closed yesterday, both were expected to reopen today. The New Museum of Contemporary Art, in SoHo, was also shut yesterday.
Elsewhere, a Thursday night performance of Mozart's opera "Il Re Pastore" at the Mostly Mozart Festival at La Guardia High School near Lincoln Center was canceled, but the Divine Divas of Oriental Bellydance went on as planned at 5:30 P.M. in the main plaza, as part of Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival.
Other performers also seemed to embrace the show-must-go-on ethos. At Central Park's SummerStage, the folk rock group the Indigo Girls played for some 1,300 people who braved the dark stroll through the park, said Alexa Birdsong, the executive producer of the series. Once they arrived, fans were treated to a 45-minute set and -- of all things -- lights, fueled by a diesel generator. (A spokeswoman for SummerStage said that another Indigo Girls concert would be scheduled for a later date, and that anyone with tickets or stubs for the original show would be able to get in free.)
And even as Broadway went completely dark on Thursday night, some smaller theaters thrived. The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, a improvisational comedy haven on West 26th Street, was part of a patch of lucky buildings in Chelsea that had full power, even while most of the city sat in darkness. As the sun set, members of the troupe took to the streets with megaphones announcing the theater's attractions -- "We have power and air conditioning," was the gist -- while the theater's concession stand did a brisk business in cold beer and soda. 
Still, for others, quirks of geography were proving vexing. Even as some uptown neighborhoods got their lights back in the morning, downtown neighborhoods were still without power late yesterday afternoon, and many Off Broadway theaters in those areas remained closed. 
At the New York International Fringe Festival, which performs in 20 theaters in Manhattan, yesterday's performances were canceled. 
Elena K. Holy, the festival's producing artistic director, said several Fringe productions had just finished on Thursday afternoon when the lights went out. "It was surreal," she said. "The house lights went down. And they just stayed down." Ms. Holy said today's Fringe performances should go on as scheduled.
On Broadway, meanwhile, officials were still in customer-service overdrive. The TKTS discount ticket booth in Duffy Square opened at 10 a.m. yesterday -- five hours earlier than usual -- so customers could return tickets they were unable to use on Thursday. 
Michael Kane, the head treasurer for TKTS, said the ticket booth sold between 2,000 and 3,000 tickets worth between $100,000 and $150,000 on Thursday afternoon before the blackout forced it to close early. At midday yesterday, Mr. Kane said refunds had been given on some 800 of those tickets. 
And true to Mr. Bernstein's prediction, some theatergoers were indeed at the booth looking for bargains, though the selection of Broadway fare there was thinner than usual, with discounted tickets for only six shows.
Some customers weren't taking the disruption in good humor. Kwang Uk Suh, 30, a client representative for I.B.M. from Seoul, had just received a refund for six tickets to "The Phantom of the Opera" but still wasn't happy. 
A first-time visitor to Manhattan, Mr. Suh said he had planned to take five clients to the Broadway musical on Thursday, but instead he and his guests endured two anxious hours stuck in a subway tunnel.
"We came to hate New York City," Mr. Suh said. "For foreigners, it's kind of a dream to visit New York City. But the power was gone, and we spent a dark night in the hotel. It was really awful." 
But for others, the blackout provided unexpected pleasure. James Ludwig, who lives with his wife just off Times Square, said they had planned to see the Broadway revival of "Gypsy" on Thursday. After their show was canceled, the couple decided to go for a stroll instead. 
"We figured it would be the only time in this century that we'd see what Times Square was like without the lights," Mr. Ludwig said. "What we saw last night, we'll probably never see again."

Short-Term Gain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The blackout is the inevitable outcome of a lack of investment caused by the fact that electric utilities historically pay high dividends rather than invest in new plant. 
 The dividend-tax changes of the Bush administration induce corporate America to adopt the same "short-term dividend gain over long-term productivity-enhancing investment" philosophy. Dollars that go into dividends do not go into the kind of infrastructure modernization that could prevent blackouts.
The dividend-tax break gives investors a choice: the instant gratification of dividends over the productivity-enhancing and job-creating effects of long-term development. 
How will America's economy fare when there are intellectual blackouts at Intel, Microsoft and I.B.M. because their investors think that dividend-tax breaks are more important than ever-faster chips and more productive software?

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: THE GRID; 
Warnings Long Ignored On Aging Electric System

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE and ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
For years, the nation's electrical engineers and planners have warned that the North American system of transmitting electricity was becoming the orphan of the digital era, approaching a serious failure if not significantly upgraded.
 For the most part, however, their pleas to improve the system have been ignored, mired in political and regional disputes, or caught up in debates about regulating private industry. As a result, experts said today, improvements that might have prevented the largest blackout in American history have stalled. 
 "This outage will cost consumers millions of dollars, and it would have been far less expensive if we had just made the system robust enough to meet their needs," said Peggy Welsh, senior vice president of the Consumer Energy Council of America, a research group that represents residential and business consumers of power. "We have a system built 50 years ago for an analog society, and it can't handle the demands of a digital society." 
It was five years ago that a federal task force of prominent experts warned the Department of Energy that the reliability of the electrical system was based on a mishmash of voluntary standards, and that Washington needed to impose mandatory rules on the electric industry.
"Failure to act," the task force wrote, "will leave substantial parts of North America at unacceptable risk." Its report was written at the Energy Department's request by prominent engineers and policy makers.
As recently as last month, however, the Energy Department was saying exactly the same thing. While electricity demand has shot up by 25 percent since 1990, construction of transmission systems has declined by 30 percent, the department said. 
"The nation's aging electromechanical electric grid cannot keep pace with innovations in the digital information and telecommunications network," the department said in a report that called for massive investment by the industry and government in a new system by 2030. "Power outages and power quality disturbances cost the economy billions of dollars annually. America needs an electric superhighway to support our information superhighway."
Standards for a more reliable system were not opposed by the industry, and were included in an energy bill that came before Congress in 2001. The bill never passed because of disputes over matters like drilling in the Alaskan wilderness and efficiency standards for cars. Such disputes are holding up a similar bill that is pending in Congress.
The exact reason why a single failure in the Midwest on Thursday afternoon led to a disastrous cascade of blackouts has still not been determined. Industry officials said that an elaborate set of rules and procedures has been developed to allow one regional system to automatically cut itself off from others when a failure occurs. Those rules are voluntary, however, and are followed to different extents by different regions. 
The 1998 task force on electricity reliability recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission be given legal authority to impose rules on the industry. It also said that several newly developed technologies were available to prevent single failures from expanding into widespread blackouts, if utilities could be persuaded to invest in them.
The commission, however, was never given the authority to impose rules on the industry by Congress, and few utilities have made significant investments in their transmission systems. Philip Sharp, a former Indiana congressman and Harvard lecturer on energy policy who headed the 1998 task force, said that deregulation had led to a patchwork of rules that gave some companies an incentive to improve their systems but discouraged others. "There's a crazy-quilt system of rules that govern markets in different parts of the country," he said. "It shapes what people invest in, and whether they will make upgrades in their transmission systems and get their power plants online. It's foolish not to have a system in place that could reduce our risk for these kinds of events."
Experts also said that energy deregulation, which has been at the heart of most disputes over the future of power in this country, has produced great strains on the system even at times when demand has not reached its peak by providing incentives to build more generating plants without encouraging the building of transmission systems. In the days of regulation, a company would recoup its investment in a generator through rates set by a state commission. Now, private companies make money on generators by selling power, giving them an incentive to produce more than transmission facilities can handle, some experts say.
"Since deregulation, people have been pushing the system too hard," said Dr. Richard Rosen, a utility planning expert at the Tellus Institute, a research group in Boston. "They tend to overload it to too great an extent. Instead of loading lines to close to 100 percent, there needs to be some extra room allowed for problems."
The strain on transmission capacity is particularly acute in New York State, which is known in the industry for having far too few high-voltage power lines. A report issued this spring by the New York Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, said the state's reliability rules were developed to respond to the blackouts of 1965 and 1977, and have not been changed since then. "New York has stayed just ahead of potential reliability problems for the past three years by utilizing some stopgap measures and by driving the existing electrical infrastructure harder and harder," the report said.
Among other factors, community resistance to new lines has been high and continues to prevent new lines from being built, particularly in high-density areas like the northeast. While the federal government can step in and insist on construction of natural gas pipelines, it has no such power related to electrical transmission lines. "People want more power, but they don't want those lines," said Stephen Floyd, a nuclear engineer and a vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Washington lobby for the nuclear-power industry. "Something's got to give sometime, because the system is really reaching its capacity in terms of what you'd like to have for a margin of safety."
One top power company executive in New York State said that some of the state's biggest power producers actually prefer an inadequate transmission system, because it gives them a captive market and the ability to charge more. At the same time, he said, state regulatory officials have no interest in taking the political heat from community residents for approving new lines. Other states, like Texas and Virginia, routinely approve new transmission systems to go with generators, he said.
Better conservation is another way to reduce the load on power systems, but when deregulation divided the power industry between generators and purveyors of electricity, it also reduced the incentive for utilities to entice customers to conserve, many energy experts said.
Now, in deregulated states, plant owners tend to focus on supplying the most profitable electricity -- produced during periods of peak demand -- while owners of distribution systems, experts say, have to pare costs and keep cables and other equipment running.
Other energy experts say there are many effective ways to insure stability, mostly involving either distributing the generation of power so that less needs to flow long distances or reducing electricity use, particularly in peak periods. "This event underscores the need to reduce the overload on the system, and there are other ways to do it besides building new transmission capacity," said Ralph Cavanagh, energy program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "There are elegant ways of doing it, such as electronic controls that allow the system to carry more power safely, or increasing standards for efficiency of air conditioners, which consume a third of the peak demand. The challenge is picking the best solution."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: THE ECONOMY; 
The Greatest Cost Over the Long Term May Be Inconvenience

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the inconvenience and disruption inflicted by the great blackout of 2003, the damage to the national economy is not likely to be any worse than that from a bad snowstorm -- a blip in the statistics that soon disappears. 
 The potential for doing more serious damage to economic growth comes not from New York, but from Detroit and Cleveland, where power might not be fully restored until next week. 
 "Blackouts are economically like snowstorms," said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, referring to the 1965 and 1977 power failures, as well as this latest one. "They are a nuisance, but not a measurable one in the statistics that record the year's economic activity." 
Airlines, restaurants and retail stores have clearly been hurt. But for the economy as a whole, blackouts and snowstorms mostly delay economic activity and rearrange it, taking from one sector and giving to another, economists say. For every suit not sold at Saks, a generator may be sold at Lowe's to someone newly interested in protection from the next blackout.
The lost power closed retail stores and halted Internet shopping, canceling purchases or delaying them until next week or next month. The same thing happened after the blizzard in the Northeast on Feb. 17, which was the Washington's Birthday holiday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year. The lost business was enough to make national retail sales for February dip by $4.3 billion. But in March they rebounded, rising by $6.3 billion.
Much of the revenue from canceled airline flights is recovered; the disappointed ticketholders eventually travel. Their tickets are mostly "prebooked and nonrefundable," said Robert W. Mann, an aviation industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y. What the airlines do not recover, though, are the considerable sums for hotel rooms and meals for passengers whose flights are canceled, Mr. Mann said.
Restaurants and theaters forced to close suffer a similar loss in revenue. It may be partly offset in several ways. Thousands of police officers, for example, will get handsome overtime checks, which they will spend, said Lee Price, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. Spending is also likely to rise for flashlights and batteries, and for improvements to the nation's power grid.
"It is a wash, and you really cannot see it in the aggregate statistics," Mr. Price said. Or as Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting and forecasting firm, put it: "The blackout is going to be lost in the rounding."
The blip in the national economic statistics from the power failure this week is likely to show up not in retail sales, as it did after the February snowstorm, but in the industrial production numbers for August, including the output of utilities. Manufacturers consume 40 percent of the electricity generated in the United States, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, and the blackout almost certainly delayed production at dozens of plants.
Among the manufacturers, the Big Three automakers were forced to shut plants in Michigan. Operating at less than full capacity, they have been producing 11,000 to 13,000 cars a day, according to Rebecca Lindland, senior automotive analyst at Global Insight, a consulting and data-gathering firm. The power failure meant the loss of about 18,000 vehicles from late Thursday through yesterday, a drop likely to show up as a downward murmur in the industrial production report for August.
But that is probably a good thing, Ms. Lindland said. Assuming the blackout does not extend into Monday, the Big Three might actually benefit from the opportunity to reduce excess inventories. The industry has 66 days' worth of sales, with a disproportionate share being vehicles made by General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. The norm is 55 to 65 days.
"The blackout does potentially fix some excess stockpiling problems that the Big Three might have," Ms. Lindland said.

HEADLINE: Idi Amin, a Brutal Dictator Of Uganda, Is Dead at 80 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Saturday, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Idi Amin called himself "a pure son of Africa," but his bizarre and murderous eight years as president of Uganda typified the worst of the continent's military dictatorships. He was 80.
 Mr. Amin died today at King Faisal Specialist hospital, a hospital official said. He had been hospitalized on life-support systems since July 18. He was in a coma and suffering from high blood pressure when he was admitted to the hospital. Later, hospital staff said he suffered kidney failure. 
 A onetime heavyweight boxing champ and soldier in the British colonial army, Mr. Amin seized power on Jan. 25, 1971, overthrowing President Milton Obote while Mr. Obote was abroad.
What followed was a reign of terror laced with buffoonery and a flirtation with Palestinian terrorism that led to the daring 1976 Israeli raid to rescue hijacked hostages in his country.
Mr. Obote once called Mr. Amin "the greatest brute an African mother has ever brought to life." President Jimmy Carter said events in Uganda during Mr. Amin's rule "disgusted the entire civilized world."
Ugandans initially welcomed Mr. Amin's rise to power, and his frequent taunting of Britain, the former colonial ruler of much of Africa, often played well on the continent. But his penchant for the cruel and extravagant became evident in 1972, when he expelled tens of thousands of Asians who had controlled the country's economy. Deprived of its business class, the East African nation plummeted into economic chaos.
Mr. Amin declared himself president-for-life of his landlocked country of 24 million, awarded himself an array of medals and ran the country with an iron fist, killing real and imagined enemies.
Human rights groups say that from 100,000 to 500,000 people were killed during his eight-year rule.
Idi Amin was born into the small Kakwa tribe in Koboko, a village in northwestern Uganda. His mother was a self-proclaimed sorceress of the Lugbara tribe and he was in his 30's before he had regular contact with his peasant father.
A semiliterate school dropout, Mr. Amin boasted that he knew "more than doctors of philosophy because as a military man I know how to act."
He was a well-regarded officer at the time of Uganda's independence from Britain in 1962, and Obote made him military chief of staff in 1966.
The 250-pound president called himself Dada, or "Big Daddy," and in 1975 was even chosen as for the one-year rotating chairmanship of the Organization of African Unity despite objections from some member states.
But mismanagement and corruption of his entourage drove Uganda into an abyss and its economy tumbled toward subsistence levels. The United States and Britain severed ties during Amin's rule.
His overreaching designs led to his downfall after his troops failed in their attempt to annex parts of Tanzania in Oct. 1978. Tanzanian troops counter-invaded, routed Amin's Soviet- and Arab-equipped army and reached the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in April 1979.
Mr. Amin, a convert to Islam, fled to Libya, then Iraq and finally Saudi Arabia, where he was allowed to settle provided he stayed out of politics.

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
How India's Mother of Invention Built an Industry

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
LIKE father, like daughter, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw thought in the 1970's, when she set out to become a brew master just as her father had been. She left India to train in Australia, then returned home to find that daughters were not welcome in India's breweries. 
 That door closing for her opened another one for India. Unemployed, she followed a love of biology and a chance referral to an Irish biotechnology company. At 25, she started their Indian operation from her garage, successfully extracting from papaya an enzyme used to tenderize meat, among other things, and from the swim bladders of tropical fish a collagen that helps clear beer. 
 It was the beginning of India's biotechnology industry. 
Twenty-five years later, Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw, 50, has become a symbol of sorts for that industry. Her now independent company, Biocon India Ltd., of which she is chairwoman and managing director, employs almost 900 people, making it among India's largest biotechnology companies.
From this capital of the southern state of Karnataka, which is now home to 85 biotechnology companies, Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw is among those trying to shape a nation's approach to uncharted scientific and commercial terrain. It is both promising and risky. 
Across India, states are racing to set up biotech parks, hoping to mimic the success of the information technology industry that defined India as a global knowledge powerhouse. 
But biotechnology touches human lives in a way that information technology does not, and that is at the heart of the debate over its benefits and risks for developing countries.
That debate heated up with President Bush's charge that Europe's resistance to genetically modified foods has made African countries reluctant to accept bio-engineered foods despite widespread hunger there. Similar concerns have arisen in India, which rejected a donation of a soy-corn blend this year because the United States could not certify that it had not been genetically modified. 
The worry in the developing world, said Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw, who does not share the concern, is this: "Why has Europe banned it? It must be for a reason. Why are we being fools and embracing it?"
She passionately believes that India must embrace biotechnology, with the proper precautions. She believes it can change the way this country of more than one billion people, at least one-fourth of them deep in poverty, eats and farms, researches and cures disease. 
"Today anything can be done -- we have the techniques," she said.
Biotechnologists are working to develop high-protein potatoes and high-nutrient rice that could help address the country's malnutrition problem. They have developed a vaccine for leprosy, which was not being researched in the West, and are working on biofuels from local crops like sugar cane. 
But such ventures, if done badly, could also cause damage, sending new genetic strains into the country's basmati rice crop, for example, threatening a staple food. It is a new frontier characterized by excitement, but also uncertainty. 
MS. MAZUMDAR-SHAW seems well-suited to both. She is possessed of what she calls a "spirit of adventure," along with a deep determination to succeed. Her family was unconventional, not least in her father's choice of profession as a master brewer. They were Brahmins originally from the state of Gujarat, which even today prohibits alcohol. 
"My parents were today's people," she said. 
Unable to get into medical college, she focused on zoology and other biosciences at Bangalore University, and she became fascinated by fermentation science. She earned a scholarship to Australia, only to meet disappointment at home in her quest to become India's first female master brewer. 
But the setback was only temporary. Today she has capitalized well on the abundance and affordability of Indian biologists and chemists, building a loyal team. She is simultaneously warm and controlled, a gracefully aggressive entrepreneur who favors scarves and pearls. 
Her company resembles a large family -- her husband, John Shaw, an exuberant Scotsman, is on the management team. She eats lunch in the cafeteria with everyone else, and has decorated the company's walls with her personal art collection. 
Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw has taken a lead in trying to shape policy and perception toward biotechnology. Over a recent breakfast, she explained to the former American ambassador, Robert D. Blackwill, why Western companies' fear that their intellectual property would not be protected in India was misplaced, and asked him to spread the word. 
She has few illusions that the industry is anything but nascent -- it will take another 10 to 15 years before there is a thriving biotech industry in India, she predicts. "I've taken 25 years to get to where I am," she said. 
From extracting enzymes, she moved into fermenting them, developing and patenting a novel technology to do so. Biocon extracted and manufactured enzymes used in everything from Lipton Ice Tea to tomato puree. 
Now Biocon has moved onto even more complex challenges. By year's end, it will begin using an innovative technology to manufacture recombinant human insulin. The product will pit Biocon against multinationals like Eli Lilly, which have already started lowering their prices, apparently in anticipation. It is only one piece of Biocon's focus on diabetes, which also includes efforts to produce oral insulin and clinical trials on diabetics. 
SUCH clinical trials, she believes, are another potential gold mine for India. The country has one of the world's largest populations of "naive" patients on whom no medicine has ever been tried, making them ideal for study. In addition, it has a large population of intermarried relatives, allowing for the study of genetic defects, as well as innumerable ethnic and tribal communities whose genomics can be studied. 
"The kind of patient populations, the diversity of patient populations -- we could have so much data exclusivity to lease out to the rest of the world," Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw said. 
Not surprisingly, such notions have many opponents, who argue they amount to exploitation of India's people and resources, and could threaten the very biodiversity they seek to capitalize on. 
Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw recognizes the concerns, and believes companies must demonstrate their intentions. But, she asks: "What's wrong with Indian guinea pigs? There have been American and European guinea pigs. It's a very important cause: alleviating diseases." 
She is eager to win over the critics. "You can't do every experiment to show genetically modified products are safe," she said, "but are you going to abandon it because of the fear it could be bad?"

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Closing V.A. Hospitals Has Congress Squirming

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The Department of Veterans Affairs is relearning a truism about Congress the hard way: Nothing gets a lawmaker riled up faster than a plan to shut something down.
 Always available for a ribbon cutting, members of Congress have a pathological fear of seeing the doors shut to any federal facility back home, whether it be a military base, Social Security office, or in the relevant example, a veterans hospital. 
 So it is no surprise that the department's new proposal to close seven hospitals and change the services available at dozens of others landed with a thud on Capitol Hill this month, even though the plan called for spending billions of dollars to build new centers and open scores of outpatient clinics in areas where veterans have migrated. 
Senators and representatives fired off angry letters, vowing to fight any closings. Emergency community meetings were convened. Advocacy groups were mobilized. 
"There is a lot of unhappiness," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who noted that a potential cutback at three sites in his state ranked right up there with the economy as he held town meetings in the past week. "You are talking about a huge veterans population, and they basically have no place to turn."
In New York, the Congressional delegation is fuming about the department's plan to close or eliminate inpatient care at three hospitals -- Canandaigua, Montrose and Manhattan. Lawmakers are also upset in California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and other states with hospitals on the block. 
Peter Gaytan, a deputy director at the American Legion headquarters, said, "We don't see how closing a hospital can solve any problem when we have 100,000 veterans standing in line waiting for appointments." 
Given the hopeful acronym of Cares (Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services), the plan is the department's most ambitious effort to date in its struggle to put its services where the veterans are and catch up to the shift of medicine to outpatient care.
It is also an effort to get a grip on what has been an embarrassing problem -- vacant and underutilized veterans centers built in the Northeast and Midwest decades ago when veterans were clustered there before they retired to the Sunbelt. The object of the plan is to save $45 million a year over the next 20 years by reducing the department's vacant and little used space by more than 40 percent -- to 4.9 million by 2022 from 8.5 million square feet in 2001. 
"Bottom line -- the draft plan will allow us to avoid imbalances between the size and location of health care facilities and veterans' demand for care tomorrow," said Dr. Robert H. Roswell, the department's undersecretary for health.
The agency's report concedes that closing hospitals is touchy in the extreme. "Disposition of capital assets traditionally has been a difficult process in the federal sector in general, and in the V.A. in particular," it says with bureaucratic understatement.
Many lawmakers would acknowledge that some veterans facilities should have been mothballed long ago or transformed into something other than 1950's-style hospitals. But they also know their communities expect them to put up a fight. More is at stake than providing care. In some towns, the veterans center is the major employer. Losing jobs is as painful as losing health care.
In a letter to the department secretary, Anthony J. Principi, Mr. Wyden the economic consequences of closing a rehabilitation center in White City, Ore. "In all of White City, there are 2,152 residents with jobs," he wrote. "The domiciliary alone employs 400 people."
Congress has conceded in the past that it is almost incapable of closing down anything. To cut the number of military bases, lawmakers establisheda special commission to recommend the targets. Then -- in their best "stop us before we spend again" mode -- they limited themselves to a straight up or down vote, knowing that was the only way they would get anywhere.
But some lawmakers are now summoning the nerve to shut down one thing -- there is a move afoot to eliminate the next round of base closings in 2005.

HEADLINE: The Day the Lights Went Out; 
An Industry Trapped by a Theory

BYLINE:  By Robert Kuttner; Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and author of "Everything for Sale: The Virtues and Limits of Markets."

 BODY:
In the search for the source of Thursday's blackout, the underlying cause has been all but ignored: deregulation. In principle, deregulation of the power industry was supposed to use the discipline of free markets to generate just the right amount of electricity at the right price. But electric power, it turns out, is not like ordinary commodities. 
 Electricity can't be stored in large quantities, and the system needs a lot of spare generating and transmission capacity for periods of peak demand like hot days in August. The power system also requires a great deal of planning and coordination, and it needs incentives for somebody to maintain and upgrade transmission lines. 
 Deregulation has failed on all these grounds. Yet it has few critics. Evidently, even calamities like the Enron scandal and now the most serious blackout in American history are not enough to shake faith in the theory.
Ten years ago, most public utilities were regulated monopolies. They were guaranteed a fair rate of return, based on their capital investment and costs. So the government compensated them for building spare generating capacity and maintaining transmission lines. Regulators, of course, sometimes made mistakes and the industry oversold technologies like nuclear power. Even so, in the half-century before deregulation, productivity in the electric power industry increased at about triple the rate of the economy as a whole. 
However, the wave of deregulation that culminated in the late 1990's broke up the integrated utilities like Con Ed that once generated power in its own plants, transmitted it and sold it retail. It ushered in a new breed of entrepreneurial generating and trading companies. However, the prices the local utility companies could charge consumers remained partly regulated. The theory was that local utilities, no longer producing their own power, could negotiate among competing suppliers for the best price and pass the savings along to the consumer. 
But deregulation hasn't worked, for three basic reasons. First, there is a fairly fixed demand for electricity and generating capacity is tight, so companies that produce it enjoy a good deal of power to manipulate prices. The Enron scandal, which soaked Californians for tens of billions of dollars, was only the most extreme example. California authorities calculated that a generating company needed to control just 3 percent of the state's supply to set a monopoly price.
Second, the idea of creating large national markets to buy and sell electricity makes more sense as economic theory than as physics, because it consumes power to transmit power. "It's only efficient to transmit electricity for a few hundred miles at most," says Dr. Richard Rosen, a physicist at the Tellus Institute, a nonprofit research group. 
Third, under deregulation the local utilities no longer have an economic incentive to invest in keeping up transmission lines. Antiquated power lines are operating too close to their capacity. The more power that is shipped long distances in the new deregulated markets, the more power those lines must carry. 
In addition, in the old days of regulation, a utility like Con Ed would be required to regularly submit a resource plan to a state's public service commission. The two organizations would forecast demand and decide how much money should be invested in power plants and transmission lines. Rates would be adjusted to cover costs. Under deregulation, however, nobody plays that crucial planning role. 
Much of the Southeast, by contrast, has retained traditional regulation -- and cheap, reliable electricity. 
When the blackout hit on Thursday, many of us first thought of terrorists. What hit us may be equally dangerous. We are hostage to a delusional view of economics that allowed much of the Northeast to go dark without an enemy lifting a finger.

HEADLINE: Read His Lips 

 BODY:
After presiding over a two-year binge of tax cuts, a rocketing federal deficit and job losses that recall the Herbert Hoover era, President Bush appears ready to step away from the supply-side gaming table, at least for a while. Mr. Bush announced Wednesday that he sensed enough of an economic upturn to reject any immediate plans for yet another tax cut. He estimates that the effects of two years of giddy revenue-slashing -- geared heavily toward the wealthiest Americans -- are looking "robust enough" to hold off on more cuts. 
 We accept the respite as an act of fiscal mercy rather than a cause for economic celebration. The Republicans' chokehold on the nation's revenue flow is doing far more to create debt and deficits than to create jobs, but it is a relief to know that Mr. Bush is not planning to do any more major damage in the immediate future. 
 Certainly things are bad enough as it is. Over nine million Americans are unemployed, and close to three million jobs have disappeared during Mr. Bush's incumbency, leaving him in danger of facing the voters next year as the first president since Hoover to preside over a net job loss. The Democratic candidates in the current scrum are rubbing their hands at this prospect. But most of them have been unwilling to call candidly for the tax cuts' repeal, and so far none have been able to attract much attention above the din of California's recall.
Strutting forth in the Texas heat this week, the president and his chief economic advisers looked like a "Magnificent Seven" tableau of economic optimists marching toward the looming campaign. "Hold the line" was Mr. Bush's surreal spending advice for a Republican-controlled Congress that has been more co-conspirator than deficit hawk in Washington's detax-and-spend mania.
As Mr. Bush's "growth" program rolls out, the richest 1 percent of Americans can expect an estimated 17 percent cut in their taxes by 2010, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The other 99 percent get a 5 percent cut -- along with accumulated deficits of $4 billion or more across the next 10 years and the lost chance that the now-vanished surplus might be used to protect their future Social Security benefits.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Rumpled and Groggy, Wall Street Resumes Trading

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Wall Street traders are not known for their sartorial splendor on their best days and yesterday certainly was not one of them. On the morning after a blackout that left the hub of the financial markets without power, hundreds of traders, many unwashed and most of them groggy from lack of sleep or arduous commutes, staggered to their posts at the New York Stock Exchange and brokerage firms around the city.
 The financial markets answered the opening bell about 15 hours after the lights went out and trading proceeded without interruption, but the effort took a physical toll on people like John Conlin. On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Conlin, 40, and his family were just about to celebrate his induction into the exchange -- whose memberships have recently sold for as much as $2 million -- when the power failed. 
 Instead of taking his wife and parents to dinner downtown, he treated them to a sleepover on chairs in the luncheon club upstairs from the exchange's trading floor, where dozens of exchange employees spent the night. Elsewhere in the building, which for a night became a hostel on Broad Street, as many as 300 people bunked in any available space, from the boardroom to the trading floor. Richard A. Grasso, the chairman, and the exchange's co-presidents, Robert Britz and Catherine Kinney, slept on couches in their offices. 
Although she lives in the city and could have gone home, Ms. Kinney said, "I wanted to make sure I was here for the opening." And she was, wearing the pale suit she had worn to work on Thursday, but looking none the worse for wear.
In the morning, Mr. Conlin's family headed home to New Jersey and he, unchanged, went to work buying and selling stocks. "It was an unusual way to start my career as a member," Mr. Conlin said in an interview from the exchange floor.
Odd circumstances abounded yesterday for the people who work on Wall Street, but, operating largely on diesel-fueled generators, the financial markets muddled through the blackout without fail. With the exception of the American Stock Exchange, which could not muster enough steam to open trading until 3:45 p.m., the stock markets operated through a full session of light, directionless trading. The bond market closed early, at 2 p.m., but only to give traders and other workers a headstart on the commute home.
The American Exchange had generators to power its computers but Consolidated Edison could not supply the steam it needed to run its air-conditioning system, exchange officials said. While the New York Exchange, a few blocks away, got its power back at 6 a.m., the American was still waiting on Con Ed as the end of the trading day -- and week -- approached.
Peter Quick, the American exchange's president, may have been more frustrated with Con Ed than any other executive on Wall Street. The utility said it could not provide the steam until it had restored electricity to the exchange's neighbors, Mr. Quick said. "Even now," he said at 3:30 p.m., "we're still the only building in our immediate neighborhood with power."
By late in the afternoon, the exchange had parked a portable steam generator in the street in front of its building and announced that it would start taking orders at 3:45 p.m. and executing trades at 3:55, or five minutes before the usual 4 p.m. closing bell. The super-abbreviated session may have been the shortest in the exchange's nearly century-old history.
A spokesman for the exchange, Robert Rendine, said that trading appeared to go smoothly. He said the exchange expected to open for trading at the normal time on Monday.
At the New York exchange, trading was so orderly that two big brokerages, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns, pulled off the sale of 50 million shares of the MBNA Corporation, a large issuer of credit cards, for about $1.1 billion early in the morning. Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of Bear Stearns, said he got a fright Thursday afternoon just minutes after agreeing to terms of the deal.
Working from Oklahoma City, where he was visiting his 96-year-old mother, Mr. Greenberg heard from a client that the power was off back in New York.
"In my 55 years in this business this was a first for me," Mr. Greenberg said. "At 4:12 p.m. we agreed on the trade. At 4.14 p.m. the power went out. I thought it was divine intervention."
Despite frayed nerves, MBNA and the two firms agreed to proceed with the deal. Some of the traders involved slept at the firm to ensure they could complete the deal by the time the market opened.
Even with that large trade, though, the volume of trading on the New York exchange, at about 636 million shares, was the lightest since 461 million shares changed hands on Christmas Eve and about half the average daily volume this year. The major stock indexes barely changed: The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.13 points, or 0.12 percent; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.16 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index ended up just 1.67 point.
Trading was also light in the bond market, but several traders said there were no problems completing transactions. In trading around 2 p.m., the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was up to 4.53 percent, from 4.49 percent Thursday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, was down 10/32 to 97 24/32 . In the currency market, the dollar was little changed against the euro, with one euro worth $1.1256, unchanged from Thursday.
Some big brokerage firms had trouble connecting through phone lines to the New York exchange and the Nasdaq stock market's electronic trading system. And some smaller firms, without secondary sources of power or enough people to staff their trading desks, could not operate at all yesterday. But the Nasdaq's system, a network of computers that allow brokerage firms around the country to buy and sell stocks from afar, worked smoothly, said its chief executive, Robert Greifeld.
Mr. Greifeld, who spent the first hour of the blackout helping to extract a man trapped in an elevator, said his market switched to backup generators at its primary computer center in Trumbull, Conn., but was running on electricity again by yesterday morning's opening at 9:30 a.m.
"The vast majority of market participants got to us on a fairly seamless and easy basis," Mr. Greifeld said.
The Nasdaq had never had both sources of electricity to its six-year-old data center fail at once, but it was prepared for that double whammy when it hit on Thursday. Every Friday night, the Nasdaq's operations staff practices cutting off power from both of the substations in Connecticut that supply it, said Steve Randich, the chief information officer.
The center's four generators automatically kick on, as they did on Thursday, he said. With 50,000 gallons of fuel on site, the Nasdaq could run for more than a week without electricity, said Mr. Randich, who was heading to Connecticut from lower Manhattan when he got a call in his car notifying him of the blackout.
While Mr. Randich was directing the Nasdaq's recovery as he wended his way north, Mr. Greifeld and David Warren, the Nasdaq's chief financial officer, were searching their offices for tools to pry open an elevator door on the 50th floor of 1 New York Plaza. The two executives were following their staff toward the stairs for the long walk down to the street when they heard a cry for help.
Lacking a toolbox, they wedged the handle of a paper slicer between the outer doors, providing air and a sliver of hope to the stranded passenger. Needing a pole to pass to him, they settled for one designed to lower a screen for PowerPoint presentations in a conference room.
"I was racking my brain, saying what have we got in here," Mr. Warren recounted. "These pagers and laptops don't work. I need a good 10-foot section of 3-inch pipe in my office."
Eventually getting help from the building's security staff, they managed to create enough space for the man, a worker in the building whom they could not identify, to jump free. After escorting him down 50 flights, Mr. Warren spent the rest of the evening walking to the Nasdaq's Marketsite in Times Square. He borrowed a car, drove home to Westchester County by 1 a.m., and was back at his office in lower Manhattan at 8 a.m. to make sure the market was ready to reopen.
Arthur Cashin Jr. was already at the New York exchange by then, having arrived around 7 a.m. after a trip into the city that was smoother than his commute home the night before.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS Financial Services, arrived at Pier 11 to catch a ferry to Jersey City and found, he said, about 1,000 people lined up. He boarded a ferry to Liberty Harbor instead and walked a few miles to his car, not getting home until 9 p.m.
Still, Mr. Cashin slept in his own bed. Stephen Kurlowicz, an insurance broker who works at 40 Broad St., across from the exchange, had it harder.
Unable to take the Long Island Rail Road home to Suffolk County, Mr. Kurlowicz, 63, decided to spend the night in the J. P. Morgan building nearby.
"I was in J. P. Morgan laying on a slab of granite," Mr. Kurlowicz, 63, said. "They had air. They had security guards, and they had water, so what else did you need?"
But when he went back to his office, he and his co-workers were not allowed to enter the building because there was no electricity. They were sent home.
"This is why commuters are tough," he said. "They put up with a lot. This is nobody's fault unless you want to blame God."

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: GOVERNORS; 
Colleagues Shiver From Chill of Bid to Recall Davis

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Gov. Mike Johanns of Nebraska seems torn when it comes to the recall election that is taking place in California, half a country away.
 Surely, Gov. Gray Davis could not deserve all the blame for California's budget woes, Governor Johanns said, since, after all, almost every state has had financial strain in recent months. "When the economy went south as badly as it did, we're all going to have a bad time," Mr. Johanns said the other day. 
 "It strikes me a little bit as shooting the messenger," he said, adding, "I have to tell you, you're not going to find this governor standing up and cheering for recalls."
Such empathy might not sound odd, except that Mr. Johanns is a Republican, who acknowledges that he usually fits, philosophically, on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Mr. Davis, the beleaguered Democrat. 
What is happening to Mr. Davis could not happen to Mr. Johanns because Nebraska has no provision for the recall of a governor, but it is possible in 17 states besides California. And though there is no rush to recall governors elsewhere, it is clear that as the nation's governors gather in Indianapolis on Saturday for their annual meeting, there is an awkward question lurking, if rarely mentioned: Might recall elections, like so many things from California, turn into a trend and spread to other states?
"This whole thing certainly makes people nervous around the country," said Thomas E. Cronin, the president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., who wrote "Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative, Referendum and Recall" (Harvard University Press, 1989). "This is not something that governors are going to be enthralled with."
Even some Republican governors who want to see a fellow party member take the helm in Sacramento seem slightly queasy about what has occurred in California.
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas is already an outspoken supporter of Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the major contenders to replace Mr. Davis, and has little sympathy for the California governor. "You always grieve when one of your colleagues is going through something, but at the same time, we all make our own beds," Mr. Huckabee said. 
Still, he said, he did have a slight concern about the number of signatures needed in California to force a recall election -- just 12 percent of the votes cast in the previous election. "If they were going after me," Mr. Huckabee said, "I'd like it to be higher than that. In my state, you could get enough hardcore Democrats together to get 12 percent."
In the 17 other states that do allow recalls of governors, most have tougher requirements to force a recall than California's. Many of those states, including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin, require signatures from 25 percent or more of voters in recent elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
And seven of the states also require that a governor be found to have met some specific grounds for recall, like committing crimes, corruption, or other malfeasance in office.
While recalls for local offices -- school boards and town mayors -- are common, only one effort to recall a state's governor has ever been successful. In 1921, voters in North Dakota got rid of Gov. Lynn J. Frazier and other state leaders. The recall hardly ended Governor Frazier's political career; he was later elected to the United States Senate.
In the late 1980's, Arizona voters gathered enough signatures to force a recall election of Gov. Evan Mecham, a Republican, but he was impeached before the election took place.
Some experts said the tight requirements for recall elections in most states would probably keep such movements as rare as they have been -- especially because of the high costs. "I don't think we're going to now see a lot of statewide recall elections, but I wouldn't be surprised to see more threats of recalls," said Jennie Drage Bowser, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. By threatening a recall and gathering signatures, she said, voters often make their point to politicians.
Gov. Judy Martz of Montana, a Republican, said last week she had heard of someone "taking out papers" to consider a recall move against her at one point. The move went nowhere, she said.
And despite it, Governor Martz said she strongly favors the notion of recalls, generally. "People should have that right," she said. "If people are given the correct information, I think it's a good process."
Governor Martz said she would support a "good, conservative, Republican candidate" to replace Governor Davis in California. This week, meanwhile, she announced that she herself would not run for re-election, saying that she wanted to spend more time with her family. 
Some political scholars even think the California recall election might have the opposite effect on other states: People elsewhere would not want to follow the example of such a quirky, Hollywood-style affair. 
"I just don't think anybody's saying, 'Hey, we want to look like California,' " said Elisabeth R. Gerber, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. "I don't think the circus nature of California's experience does a lot to make recall look like a credible choice, but still, you never know. This could be seen as an unsavory, but effective, way of changing political power in other states."
John Mark Hansen, dean of the social sciences division at the University of Chicago, suggested that the danger of recall fever might not be to other states, but to California, over and over.
"Once the genie is out of the bottle, the bigger question is: will it happen again in California?" he said. "If the situation again turns against a sitting governor, someone facing a difficult political situation, what will happen then? It also makes it harder to do brave things as governor."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: LEGISLATION; 
After 2 Years, Energy Bill Is Getting New Urgency in Congress

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The blackout will give new urgency to an energy plan that has languished in Congress for more than two years, lawmakers said today, and they asserted that elements of the plan aimed at upgrading the power grid will gain in importance.
 "We simply cannot afford to wait any longer," said Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "Our economy and our way of life are at stake." 
 Mr. Tauzin said his panel would open an investigation into the cause of the blackout, convening a hearing on the massive power failures within days of Congress's return after Labor Day. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat on the Senate energy committee, called for similar hearings in the Senate. 
When they return the week of Sept. 2, House and Senate negotiators are to begin already scheduled negotiations to merge broad energy bills that have been stalled since 2001 over a range of environmental, partisan and regional disputes.
The Senate measure became so bogged down this month that Republican leaders, eager to pass something just to start talks with the House, agreed to pass the bill from last year, even though it was written when the Democrats were in charge.
The House and Senate plans contain provisions intended to increase the capacity for power transmission and to protect against widespread failures. But a serious disagreement remains over a plan by a federal energy panel to require utilities to participate in regional power organizations able to share electricity nationwide. Many southern and western lawmakers oppose that approach.
In addition to the disputes over transmission, passage of the overall measure, which grew out of the 2001 energy report by the Bush administration, depends on the ability of its authors to work out resolutions to unrelated fights over oil and gas exploration, subsidies for nuclear power, global warming and other contentious issues.
The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said that the insistence of President Bush and his Congressional allies on approval for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge had helped stall measures that could have led to improvements to the power grid. 
"President Bush and Tom DeLay put the interests of the energy companies before the interests of the American people by insisting we drill in A.N.W.R. and other environmentally sensitive areas rather than modernize our energy system," said Ms. Pelosi.
Mr. DeLay, the House majority leader from Texas, is a strong advocate of increased energy production.
Republicans said improvements in the power delivery system had been held up by environmental and other resistance. 
A spokesman for the House energy panel, Ken Johnson, said: "If the accepted public policy in America becomes 'not in my backyard,' there are going to be a lot of people walking home from closed businesses to dark homes in the future." 
There was wide agreement that the blackout would give new momentum to the energy bill, which has been a secondary priority of Congressional leaders who for much of the year focused on other issues.
"This outage clearly demonstrates how close the nation is to its energy production and distribution limit," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "I hope that when Congress returns in September the House-Senate conference on an energy policy bill will make rapid progress."
But the prospect of agreement on an energy bill was worrisome to environmental groups, which have opposed both the House and Senate bills and contend that they are backward looking on energy issues.
"Everyone is going to jump on this, and the problem is that neither the House or Senate's energy bill nor the president's energy plan is going to do what it takes to give us a cleaner energy future," said Anna Aurilio, legislative director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
The electrical provisions of the bill had taken a back seat to issues like oil drilling and gas mileage. But they were followed closely by the industry, state regulators and lawmakers. 
To move the Senate energy measure, the leadership agreed to requests from lawmakers, including Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, to seek a lengthy delay in the new transmission market that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed. Mr. Shelby and others say the plan, the Standard Market Design, would usurp state authority and penalize local utilities that have made their own investments in upgrades. The critics prefer new enforceable standards of reliability for the grid. 
"It appears," a spokesman for Mr. Shelby said, "that the cascading power outages throughout the Northeast only reinforce our need to focus on reliability and transmission infrastructure development rather than creation of a new national market system." 
But Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, senior Democrat on the energy panel, said the blackouts should push lawmakers to consider changes in a grid that has been largely built and regulated state by state.
"Times have changed, and our policies need to change with them," Mr. Bingaman said.
Mr. Schumer urged Congressional negotiators to drop all the electricity provisions from the bill until a cause of the blackout is pinpointed, to make certain that the legislation does not worsen the problems.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: VOTERS; 
Poll Finds Governor's Support Still Eroding and Likens Him to Nixon in '74 Resignation Crisis

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
A new statewide opinion poll shows that Gov. Gray Davis of California continues to lose support in his effort to keep his job, while Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor, are at the top of the list of possible successors. 
 Mr. Davis, who faces a recall election on Oct. 7, has become so unpopular among registered voters that the pollsters, Field Research, likened his standing to that of President Richard M. Nixon before he resigned in August 1974. 
 "We've been doing polling for 56 years, and the current rating of the governor, 70 percent disapproval, is equivalent to the lowest job rating we have ever measured for an elected official," said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field (California) Poll.
In the first half of the poll of 1,036 Califorinians, which was released today, 58 percent of likely voters said they favored removing Mr. Davis from office, up from 51 percent last month. 
Asked whether they thought he would be recalled, 68 percent said yes.
In the second half of the poll, to be released on Saturday, Mr. Bustamante, a Democrat, and Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, placed well ahead of the 133 other candidates on the ballot. The recall ballot will pose two questions. First, should Mr. Davis be recalled, and second, who should succeed him if he loses?
The survey showed that 25 percent of likely voters favored Mr. Bustamante, while 22 percent said Mr. Schwarzenegger was their first choice. Three other Republicans followed the front-runners, with State Senator Tom McClintock picking up 9 percent, Bill Simon Jr. 8 percent and Peter V. Ueberroth 5 percent. 
The margin of error in the poll was plus or minus 5 percent.
Mr. DiCamillo said the ranking of the candidates, even with the margin of error, showed that Republicans voters were dividing their votes among the top four Republican candidates and that Democrats had more or less settled on Mr. Bustamante, the lone prominent Democrat on the replacement ballot.
"It is one of the problems that the state Republican Party has had over the years, that they have not been able to come up with consensus candidates," Mr. DiCamillo said.
That said, the poll suggested that many voters had yet to settle firmly on one candidate. Forty-four percent of likely voters indicated that they might change their mind before Oct. 7. 
Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Californians Against the Costly Recall, a group formed by Mr. Davis, said the recall had been so volatile that it would be unwise to place much credence on any poll.
"It is like trying to grab a fistful of water," Mr. Ragone said. "It is so fluid. The polls that have been out there have been all over the map for the past several weeks."
Mr. Davis, in an appearance in Los Angeles, did not talk about the polls. Instead, he criticized remarks by Warren Buffett, a newly named economics adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, about property taxes.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Buffett suggested that the state's property taxes were too low, something that Mr. Schwarzenegger's opponents portrayed today as an assault on Proposition 13, the ballot measure from 1978 that limits on property taxes.
"The people spoke," Mr. Davis said, "and all of us who have held office since then have honored the will of the electorate. Lord knows, we have some things that cost a lot of money in this state. But property taxes are not one of them, and no one is about to change that."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: POLITICAL STRATEGIES; 
Which Party Gets the Blame? They Agree: It's the Other One

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
With tens of millions of Americans left powerless, the blackout gave Democrats what they hoped would be a huge new political opportunity -- and they wasted little time in seizing it.
 On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential contenders assailed President Bush for focusing too heavily on drilling for new sources of energy, instead of on a power grid they called too old and overburdened to meet the nation's electrical needs. 
 In Congress, Democrats accused Republicans of blocking modernization of the nation's power-transmission system in 2001.
At the same time, Republican leaders in Congress and conservative talk-show hosts mounted a counteroffensive, charging that Democrats and environmentalists had colluded to prevent the overhaul of the power-transmission grid and blocked legislation on a national energy plan.
"Passage of the energy bill is a vital national interest, and partisan Democrats stalling it should work with the House to get a realistic program to the President's desk," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader. 
Even as the nation waited to learn its exact cause, the blackout promised to heat up a political issue, energy policy, that until now had seemed remote to many Americans outside of California, which suffered an energy crisis and rolling blackouts two years ago. 
Democratic strategists said the crisis could enable their party to question whether President Bush was adequately safeguarding the nation's energy and economic security and to bring back to center stage his administration's ties to the energy industry. 
Mr. Bush himself seemed sensitive to that possibility when two days in a row he said that he favored modernization of the electrical grid. "I view it as a wakeup call," he said yesterday about the blackout.
Regardless of who turns out to be at fault, voters often blame whomever they perceive to be in charge when the lights go out -- a fact of political life with potential ramifications even at the Congressional-district level for incumbents in areas affected by the blackout.
"Millions of Americans are now well acquainted with our old, antiquated, not up to par energy system that they have not been paying attention to," Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential contender, said in a telephone interview. "And this is not a forward-looking administration that tries to eliminate problems before they occur."
Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant based in California, said: "Nothing gets people going faster than not having power. Just ask Gray Davis. Before the energy crisis, his approval rating was consistently in the 50's. Then it just plummeted."
Two years ago California suffered a series of temporary blackouts as demand for electricity outpaced older power plants, while a botched experiment with partial price deregulation and environmental opposition created disincentives to build new plants. Wholesale electricity prices spiraled out of control, pushing the state's two private utilities to the brink of bankruptcy as they were left buying power at market rates at costs they could not pass on to the consumer.
Although Mr. Davis, who is fighting a recall effort, is the prime example of how an electrical crisis can harm a public figure, he also seemed likely to benefit somewhat from the blackout in the Northeast. His allies were all but claiming vindication, with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, sending out a press release noting, "Gov. Davis Kept the Lights on in California During the Energy Crisis."
David Freeman, chairman of the California Power Authority, said of Mr. Davis, "Everyone's counting him out, but I think he got a break yesterday.
"Now his performance will be appraised in light of some real failure. Seeing a far worse electrical emergency elsewhere does put in perspective what we went through, and that we licked it in a fairly short period of time." He noted that California officials had predicted 200 days of blackouts, "and we haven't had any."
Mr. Freeman said that the latest blackout "puts this whole deregulation phenomenon on trial."
"What's lacking in this deregulated world is someone to take responsibility," he said. "No one is responsible for beefing up the system or building power plants. We're talking about the lifeblood of our economy, and there has to be a sense of legal responsibility for keeping the lights on, and that's what we lost with deregulation."
At the national level, some political consultants cautioned against seeking political advantage from the blackout before its cause was determined. "The Democrats, if they try to turn this into a political issue against President Bush, will just look absolutely desperate, like they're flailing at anything that moves," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. "Let's go out and spout off and take some political shots before we have any idea where the fault lies."
But most of the Democratic presidential candidates were undeterred. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, claimed credit for saving New England from disaster and argued that the administration was going in the wrong direction by trying to expand the national grid.
"I think they should stop trying to link every bit of the grid together," Dr. Dean said in Iowa. "I stopped New York, Vermont and New England from linking up by threatening to sue, and they rethought it. If that had happened, New England would have gone out last night. The idea that bigger is better and that we need a national grid is just foolish."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut asked the Department of Homeland Security to assess the vulnerability of key electric infrastructures and devise a plan to protect them from attack. He also asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to probe the causes of the blackout.
"It is disconcerting that the president would describe yesterday's events as a 'wakeup call,' " Mr. Lieberman said in a statement. "The reality is that the administration has simply failed to provide the leadership or resources necessary to ensure that our critical infrastructure is adequately protected."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri called the blackout "further evidence that the Bush administration is inexorably tied to Persian Gulf oil and old energy, and is incapable of devising a comprehensive, forward-looking energy strategy." 
Senator Bob Graham of Florida tied the overburdened grid to Mr. Bush's tax policy. "His $900 billion in tax giveaways to the richest Americans have left America without the resources to rebuild this nation's infrastructure," Mr. Graham said in a telephone interview.
As Republican leaders in Congress said that environmentalists and Democrats had blocked the improvements to the nation's power grid, conservative talk radio hosts amplified their message.
"We've got to set the record straight," said Sean Hannity on his syndicated program yesterday. "What party is it that is opposing all attempts for us to move toward energy self-sufficiency? What party is it that refuses to allow us to drill in the second-largest oil field in American history, known as ANWR, which is a vast wilderness?"
What seemed clear as the day wore on was that millions of Americans -- and in particular, their leaders -- would become newly sensitized to the politics of energy infrastructure.
"There may have been an elected official who has been arguing for improvements in the grid, or warning of danger ahead," said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist in New York. "Before yesterday no one would have known or cared. Tomorrow, I can guarantee you, they will."

 I recently visited New York after a 19-year hiatus to pay my respects at ground zero, spend money in your town to support your economy and attend the David Letterman show, whose host, to me, epitomizes the strong spirit and good humor of New Yorkers. 
 I have been watching New Yorkers' response to another emergency, not nearly as horrifying as 9/11, but certainly frightening, disruptive and potentially dangerous. In watching the news, what I observed was a sense of acceptance on the part of New Yorkers, and I admired the good judgment, calm, dignity and respect with which you worked through this latest crisis.
New York, you have had enough, but your spirit is inspirational to the entire world.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: COST; 
While Businesses Suffered, a Few Made Out

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Almost all the fancy stores on Fifth Avenue were still shuttered yesterday afternoon, Day 2 of the big blackout. But in front of Fendi, a slightly furtive-looking fellow hissed "Prada!" as he stood over a grimy sheet piled with handbags. He had plenty of customers (as did the nearby Prada store, selling the genuine article, which opened at 2 p.m. and was mobbed, despite the lack of air conditioning).
 Many experts say it is far too early to calculate the overall economic effects of the blackout. But as always in New York, the blackout produced economic winners and losers, and as always, a little hustle did not hurt. 
 Take Ken Ford, who sells jewelry and other trinkets at a table on Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing, Queens. "The blackout helped," he said yesterday. "People swarmed to my table and bought everything." And when his table was bare, he continued, he went to an all-for-a-dollar store, bought flashlights and sold them for $3.
To be sure, many more traditional small businesses suffered from the blackout, especially restaurants, which lost both customers and food when the electricity went out. Such businesses are also less likely than big corporations to have insurance that will help cover their losses.
But even among the biggest companies in the region, there were winners and losers. Among the winners was Verizon, which raked in a sea of quarters from its 20,000 pay phones in the city and suburbs. "I wouldn't be surprised if the traffic was double the normal," said James A. Smith, a Verizon spokesman, adding that solid figures will not be available until Monday.
Among the losers, count Consolidated Edison. The utility has not yet calculated its costs from the blackout, but it is paying overtime to thousands of employees who are working 12-hour shifts to try to restore power, said Chris Olert, a company spokesman.
New York City also faces increased expenses for overtime, among other things, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, though the exact amount is not yet known. About 10,000 police officers patrolled the dark streets on Thursday night, more than double the usual number.
Those expenses may be bad for taxpayers, but they are not necessarily a bad thing for the regional economy, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist for Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate company. "It comes out of the city coffers," she said, "but it goes back into the economy" as people spend their overtime earnings.
And the city may be able to recoup some of its costs from the federal government. Gov. George E. Pataki has asked President Bush to declare a federal emergency in New York, which would make it eligible for disaster aid, a request seconded by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer. 
While the true cost of the blackout will not be known for a few days, Senator Schumer said in a statement, "This is the worst blackout in American history, and I think it's safe to say that by the time we finish tallying the cost of responding to this crisis, its expense is going to make the record books."
Larian Angelo, finance director for the City Council, estimated last night that the blackout would lead to a loss of $30 million to $40 million in sales and income tax revenue for the fiscal year, although she stressed that her calculations were preliminary. Her back-of-the-envelope projection is that city residents' personal income will be down by $500 million to $750 million because of decreased economic activity. On the other hand, total personal income for the year is estimated to be $325 billion, with a B.
"So it's not nothing," she said, "but it's not devastating."
On the other hand, economists are fairly sanguine about the overall economic effects of the blackout, which they note struck in the late afternoon and late in the summer (and not, say, three days before Christmas).
"Aside from some discomforts, like food spoilage, it's probably not all that significant," said Jason Bram, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Tell that to businessmen like Gerry Hayden, owner of Amuse, a restaurant at 18th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. He said he lost at least $12,000 because he was closed on the busiest night of the week, Thursday, and had still not reopened by last evening. His hourly workers get paid only if the restaurant is open.
Bruce Sterman, who owns two Manhattan Chili Company restaurants near Times Square, was back in business yesterday. He said he hoped that his insurance would cover the costs of the food he had to dump, but was less hopeful about getting a claim paid on his business interruption policy, in part because he would have to have been closed for 24 hours.
On the other hand, when he reopened in the afternoon, a lot of people came in the door, Mr. Sterman said. "We're definitely doing more bar business than we usually do in the midafternoon," he said. 
There were also winners and losers in the financial services industry, sometimes at the same company. The Wall Street side of the business generally functioned smoothly; for example, the Bank of New York's securities processing business, one of the largest in the country, was operating normally, said Jeep Bryant, a spokesman for the bank.
But on the consumer banking side, only about a third of the bank's 375 automated teller machines were working yesterday morning, though the number that were spitting out cash rose through the day to 236. Other banks in the area had problems as well, leaving angry customers shaking the locked doors of branch offices.
Transaction volume for the NYCE Corporation, the largest processor of A.T.M. and debit card transactions in the Northeast, was 30 to 40 percent lower than usual in the New York metropolitan area from 4 p.m. Thursday to 7 yesterday morning, said Dennis F. Lynch, chief executive of the network.
The hardest-hit sections of the economy were probably retail and travel, said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents many of the city's largest businesses. 
For thousands of tourists and their all-important dollars, it was a case of plenty of time, nothing to do and nothing to buy. Even tourist attractions that had backup generator power could not open, like Madame Tussaud's wax museum, where most of its 50 employees could not get into Midtown to work. 
"Normally we'd have 4,200 visitors today," said Janine DiGioacchino, general manager of the attraction. 
Kembree Darakshani, an athlete's representative from Memphis, spent $10 for an animal-name painting on Broadway and 42nd Street (you know, painted lobsters, dolphins and butterflies in the shape of letters). "Today was supposed to be my shopping day, but there was nothing to buy," she said, "so this is my consolation prize."

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE CANDIDATES; 
California Voters Wonder: Is Anyone Not Running?

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Bill Simon walked in from the broiling afternoon to the cool onion-scented air of an In-n-Out Burger, a couple of aides at his elbows, on Tuesday. Smiling, he surveyed the clusters of people hunched over their thick, dripping sandwiches. "How are you?" Mr. Simon said, holding out his hand to a wary-looking Jesse Young, seated at a table facing the freeway in Stockton, just over 300 miles north of Los Angeles. "My name's Bill Simon, and I'm running for governor."
 Mr. Young replied: "No kidding. I'm running for governor, too." He turned to the man across the table, Jim Eakes. "How about you, Jim -- you running for governor?" 
 Mr. Eakes set down his No. 3 burger (single patty, no cheese) and wiped his hands on a paper napkin. "Sure, I'm running for governor," he said. 
Apparently, it's going to be that kind of election.
Even a studiously serious candidate like Mr. Simon finds himself treated like one of the flakes from fringeville.
With just 53 days until the voters in the nation's largest state decide whether to kick Gov. Gray Davis out of office and, if so, which of the 135 accredited candidates will replace him, the great recall election of 2003 is creaking to life.
Governor Davis, who won re-election a year ago by trouncing Mr. Simon, finds himself fighting an uphill battle against a recall insurgency that has pitted him not only against his former adversary but also a virtual menagerie of potential governors, including the man who hasbeen sucking up most of the media oxygen and leading in all the early polls, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is the campaign's missing man, who has managed to dominate the discussion while barely appearing in public.
The power blackout of 2003 even wormed its way into the fracas, with Governor Davis insisting that it would force a fresh assessment of how Enron had manipulated the state's power system two years ago and force Mr. Schwarzenegger to explain how he would have handled such a crisis. Another candidate, Arianna Huffington, the political commentator and agitator, demanded that Mr. Schwarzenegger explain just why he had met with Kenneth Lay, the Enron chairman, and other big shots in 2001.
On Thursday, the crisis actually flushed out Mr. Schwarzenegger for the first time since Monday. Meeting briefly with reporters today, he said he did not remember any meeting and did not intend to answer anyone's charges.
Among the other candidates are a stripper, a young woman who is publicizing her campaign by handing out thong underwear with her name on it, a rock star, a comedian, a former television star, a smut publisher and an aging billboard queen. 
There are so many candidates that if as many people vote in the recall as did in last year's gubernatorial election -- about eight million -- and the votes are split evenly among the candidates, the new governor of the nation's most populous state could potentially be chosen with as few as 60,000 votes, less than the number of people who attend the average N.F.L. game.
Yet despite the delighted California-bashers who call this election a national embarrassment, the people who spurred the the recall effort say they believe it is essential to put California back on its fiscal feet. 
"The national media tend to focus on the eccentric and colorful personalities in the race, making fun of it," said State Senator Tom McClintock, a conservative Republican from Ventura who, yes, is also a candidate for governor. "It's obvious to me that unless you are living in California you don't understand just how serious this is."
Mary Carey, 26, a pornographic actress and erotic dancer whose professional name exploits her resemblance to the pop singer Mariah Carey, paused while putting on her frilly costume for a show at the Gold Club in Sacramento to say that, indeed, she was very aware of how serious this all was. That's why she decided to run for governor, for heaven's sake.
Some of her campaign platforms are for fun, like wiring every room in the governor's mansion with closed-circuit Internet cameras (so "Californians can see their government in action -- literally!"), but others are meant seriously. Ms. Carey just had another idea that morning, she said: As soon as a person signs up for unemployment relief they should be placed in a jury pool. Why should people have to take off work to serve on a jury when there are unemployed people who can do it? 
"It's been a lot of fun, and I've already learned a whole lot," she said.
Such as?
"Oh, I learned how an ordinary person can go about getting on the ballot," she said. "It's easy!"

The Logistics of Democracy
On Monday, most of the serious campaigns were still setting up their offices, hiring staff members and figuring out how to conduct such a crowded, truncated election. At the new Schwarzenegger headquarters on Main Street in Santa Monica, before a news media blackout restricted access at midweek, young fund-raisers and software engineers huddled over laptops discussing how to structure the campaign's Internet site to collect as much money from donors as possible through the Web. At Ms. Huffington's new offices, posters were already neatly stacked against the wall as desks and computers were being hastily assembled. 
"The campaign so far has been a circus," Parker Blackman, Ms. Huffington's press spokesman, said. "But our strategy will be to try to highlight how California's budget crisis is having a real-life impact on people."
Although the impression given by the nearly nonstop television coverage of the recall -- and the Schwarzenegger phenomenon -- was of frenzied activity, there was fairly little outright campaigning going on in the early days.
Governor Davis arrived at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles on Monday morning with a full phalanx of aides and armed guards. He smiled happily as he was greeted at the door by high school students brought in to meet the governor and provide uplifting background for the cameras.
Then he went upstairs to spend a few minutes with a sensitivity class for police officers, which was part of a program that he had initiated, and to take a tour of a new exhibition on families that he also helped get off the ground. Afterward, the cameras were assembled again and he announced from beneath his trademark helmet of gray hair that he would sign legislation offering tolerance training for teachers.
It was all part of the governor's plan to appear extragubernatorial these days. Monday was just the beginning. On Tuesday, he was backing more bills in Los Angeles, then did the same on Wednesday in San Francisco before coming back to Los Angeles to do even more of it. But everywhere he went, of course, the questions quickly turned to the recall -- and to Arnold.

What Voters Will See
The recall voting will have two parts. First, voters will be asked whether the governor should be removed from office. A simple majority gets that job done. Only then will voters be asked to choose from among the scores hoping to replace him, and in that race the candidate receiving the most votes wins.
Polls around the state in recent days have shown varied results, but have agreed on the main points: About three-fifths of the voters want Governor Davis out of office, a formidable number to overcome in such a short election. (A statewide Field Poll today, for instance, said 58 percent of voters wanted him out and 68 percent expected him to lose.)
And of the other candidates, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, held a commanding early lead, followed by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat who says he opposes the recall but entered the race to give anti-recall voters a haven for their second vote. Mr. McClintock and Mr. Simon, rivals for the conservative Republican vote, also received some support in the polls.
"There will be a lot of polls over the next few weeks," Governor Davis said as he was ending his visit to the Wiesenthal Center. "My focus is to do my job."
Sharon Davis, the governor's wife, made pretty much the same point as she visited the annual picnic of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor under sagging white tents behind the musician union hall in Hollywood. 
"It's early days," Ms. Davis said. "Those poll numbers are going to turn around."
There were barbecued ribs and sausage on the folding tables, the potato salad was served with an ice-cream scoop and a rubber children's swimming pool was overflowing with cans of beer and bottles of water.
As a white-haired folk singer entertained the crowd ("I'm voting for the governor, Gray Davis/Stranger days than these I've never seen/But I'll save my protest vote for Howard Dean"), Miguel Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the federation, spelled out how the anti-recall effort would be structured.
"The first thing we're going to do is we're going to reach out to our members," he said. "We have 800,000 members, and 580,000 of them are registered voters. We're going to engage them at the work sites, we're going to send out mailings, and we have a phone bank of 250 computerized lines."
Then in the campaign's final three weeks, anti-recall volunteers will go door to door and organize carpools for election day. "It is our belief that the key is going to be voter turnout," he said. "The bigger the turnout, the better for us."
As Ms. Davis hit the stage, yellow-and-black "Vote NO on Recall" posters suddenly materialized in the crowd. 
"Yes, it seems as if there is a circus going on," Councilman Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles said. "Because there are so many clowns on the ballot. But make no mistake, this is not a circus. This is a very serious situation."
He and Mr. Contreras led the union crowd, chanting "Three more years," a reference to the remainder of Governor Davis's second term, should he survive the recall.
There were only a handful of other campaign events in the early days, partly because, even while doing his impression of the invisible man, Mr. Schwarzenegger was able to command the spotlight. 
Most of the opening salvos took place on television and radio -- where the numerous all-news channels and round-the-clock punditry looked upon the recall in pretty much the same way that a wolf looks at a wounded rabbit.
"Because of the national media attention on the race, there are many more opportunities for radio and television appearances and those certainly trump your conventional campaign appearances that are limited to a single assembled audience," Mr. McClintock said. "My schedule today included two satellite broadcasts for Fox affiliates, a radio interview in San Francisco, another TV interview with a statewide news service, something with National Public Radio, an appearance on MSNBC and then a nationally syndicated radio show."
Mr. Simon, whose visit to the In-n-Out Burger in Stockton was part of a three-city swing up the state's agriculture-dominated Central Valley, seemed almost defensive when asked by a local television reporter why he was engaging voters one-on-one rather than doing television interviews like everybody else. 
"I do that, too," he insisted. "I was on two programs yesterday, and another the day before that, and I'm going to be on 'Meet the Press' this Sunday. But I also like to go out and meet the people."
Some of the more colorful fringe candidates were also getting as much airtime as they could handle. Ms. Carey visited, among others, Bill O'Reilly. "I'm sure he just wanted to have me on so he could make fun of me," she said. "But I don't care. I can hold my own."
Gary Coleman, the former sitcom star who has repeatedly said that he was unqualified for the job and would probably vote for Mr. Schwarzenegger, was on several channels, defending his presence in the race. Gallagher, the comedian, bashed a few melons. And Michael Wozniak, a former Oakland police officer, complained that the news media always focused on one item in his platform, the legalization of ferrets as house pets. "It's become a hot button issue for me," Mr. Wozniak said.
Several candidates with deep pockets, who might have an impact on the race, like Peter V. Ueberroth, former baseball commissioner, have been hanging back in the early going. Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine, said he didn't want to waste his money.
"We're going to do some polling, and if the polling puts me in the double digits, I'm gonna spend some money and we're gonna go the distance," Mr. Flynt told CNN.
Others were struggling to come up with ways to maintain their moment in the limelight.
Georgy Russell, a 26-year-old from Mountain View, publicized her campaign with "Georgy for Governor" thong underwear. Now, however, she says she needs money to keep going. And since she has been surprised by the number of men who are suddenly trying to date her, she said, she is going to sell T-shirts saying: "I asked Georgy out and all I got was this lousy T-shirt."
Ms. Carey was publicizing her campaign during her striptease shows, but she also plans a rally for families on Saturday in Sacramento.
"I'm having fun, but I'm definitely serious, too," she said. "I know I'm probably not going to win. But maybe I can show people that you don't have to be the son of someone famous or married to a Kennedy to run for governor. In a way, I think I can be a role model for young girls, even though I am in the so-called adult industry, which some people frown on."

What About the Budget?
Ms. Huffington kicked off her campaign with a daylong swing through the Bay Area on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and with the Green Party's Peter Miguel Camejo, who shares some of her views. On the sun-baked concrete esplanade outside Oakland Technical High School, she joined a rally by community activists urging the reinstatement of free bus passes for students.
For Ms. Huffington, it was a perfect opportunity to focus on the victims of the budget crisis, so she showed up with a handful of aides and a trunkful of "Arianna for Governor" posters. "In the middle of the circus atmosphere of the recall is a serious opportunity for change, and we've got to go at it," she said.
Only about a dozen voters showed up and were quickly swallowed up by the crowd of journalists and protesters who swarmed around Ms. Huffington.
Marian Baldwin of Oakland said she heard about the rally on television that morning and decided to wander over during her lunch hour. 
She said she was not particularly concerned about the circus atmosphere that has developed around the recall or the derision the state is receiving from elsewhere around the country.
"What with all the cults and the celebrities and what have you, I guess we've gotten pretty used to it here in California," Ms. Baldwin said.

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: THE MIDWEST; 
Detroit Sweats While It Waits For Electricity

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN and DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
As power was restored throughout most of the Northeast, this city sweated through its second day without lights, air conditioners and, in many cases, even drinking water. Officials estimated that parts of the electrical system here would remain down through the weekend.
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan declared a state of emergency in five counties, and sent thousands of gallons of water and gasoline, along with state police officers and some National Guardsmen, to metropolitan Detroit from across the state. Detroit's police chief, Jerry Oliver, promised that the city would aggressively enforce an 11 p.m. curfew for anyone 16 or younger. 
 By 9 p.m., officials at DTE Energy, the main utility here, said that power had been restored to 1.5 million of its 2.1 million customers across 7,600 square miles in southeastern Michigan, five times the number that had electricity at noon today. All five of the city's water pumping plants were also back in use by late tonight, though officials warned residents to boil before drinking and said taking showers, washing cars and watering lawns should be limited. 
Anthony F. Earley, DTE's chief executive, would not predict when all the lights would be back on, but urged those with electricity not to overuse it, saying, "The customers hold the key to the speed of the restoration."
As dusk fell on the nation's 10th-largest city, bus service was suspended until 3:30 a.m. Saturday, tonight's Aerosmith concert at Comerica Park was canceled, the opening of the Michigan State Fair was postponed until Saturday, and Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick urged Detroit's one million residents to stay home.
"The party has to happen in your homes tonight," the mayor said at an afternoon news conference outside police headquarters in the eerily quiet and empty downtown. "Continue your family time. Love thy neighbor -- in your own home, your own neighborhood."
Thrilled that the number of arrests was at a typical level through the first 24 hours of the nation's worst blackout, Detroit officials said the weekend would serve as a referendum on Mayor Kilpatrick's leadership and on his efforts to rehabilitate Detroit's reputation, from that of a city decimated by violence and poverty to that of a cultural hub with a revitalized economy.
"Either the people of this city believe in this city's future and are going to rally around this mayor or they're not," said Michael Duggan, the county prosecutor, who stood with Mr. Kilpatrick and Mr. Oliver at the news conference. 
Although city officials said there had been virtually no violence or looting Thursday night or Friday, Mr. Duggan issued a stern warning to residents of a city still scarred from the riots of the 1960's. Noting that civil disobedience felonies carry a 10-year prison term, Mr. Duggan added, "Before you pick up a brick and throw it, before you tip over a car, before you take a TV, you better ask yourself, is this worth 10 years of my life?"
Elsewhere in the Midwest, Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio declared a state of emergency in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, where an order to boil the city's water was in effect through Sunday, though power had been restored by midafternoon to nearly all the 1.5 million area residents who had lost it and to the city's four water pumping stations. In Akron, power was restored in all but a four-block area by 11 a.m., and the mayor sent water and engineers to help Cleveland. Neighboring Cuyahoga Falls, population 50,000, never lost power.
"It was almost like when you land in Las Vegas and see all the lights," the mayor, Don Robart, said of driving home to Cuyahoga Falls from Akron, in a telephone call to National Public Radio. "It was nice to come home to."
In Melvindale, Mich., a Detroit suburb, 2,000 people were shut out of their homes until 1:35 p.m., after an explosion at an oil refinery on Thursday night caused by a buildup of pressure inside a boiler. It appeared unrelated to the blackout but compounded the misery.
Across the region the blackout caused all sorts of disruptions and inconvenience and prompted a variety of improvised remedies. 
At St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., Robert Moore, a courier, got stuck in traffic while trying to pick up platelets for a cancer patient. He borrowed a bicycle and a helmet and made the eight-mile trip. Meanwhile, Grace Elizabeth, the second child of Carrie Lint, a nurse practitioner at the hospital, would not wait for electricity to be restored before she entered the world.
"I ended up delivering my five-pound child in the dark and in the heat," Ms. Lint said. "It was back to the days of Laura Ingalls Wilder."
Also in Ann Arbor, 48 cars and trucks waited outside Malleks, the lone gas station functioning this morning, courtesy of a generator the owner had bought a few years ago, anticipating computer disasters at the start of 2000.
Three plumbers and pipe fitters in town for a training session were waiting to fill a rental car, while an Anglican priest in a sport utility vehicle sought gasoline for his generator to protect his son, who needed stable temperatures. "We have to have air conditioning for him, or he'll have multiple seizures," the priest, Doug Carson, said. The generator also saved 25 salmon in his freezer.
All along Interstate 94, gasoline stations and hotels were overrun, with dozens of cars and motor homes blocking offramps, as people fled the darkened areas. Nearly 150 miles from Detroit in Kalamazoo, which never lost power, the Amoco on Sprinkle Road received several calls from people heading to Chicago from Detroit asking whether they could stop there for gasoline. Eight crates of 99-cent gallons of water had sold out this morning at the station.
In Chelsea, Mich., a town of 4,300 about 50 miles west of Detroit, two of the three stations ran out of gasoline long before noon, and by lunchtime the third, an Amoco station, had sold 10,000 gallons more than its daily norm of 2,000. But three pumps had stopped working, and a fourth was acting up, too.
"We've got plenty of gas in the ground, I don't know what the problem is," said the manager, whose name tag read Barb. "The pumps are just worn out. They're tired."
At least they had power. Here in Detroit, residents were still stuck deep in emergency mode, scratching for a patch of shade as they gobbled the melting ice cream being given away at convenience stores.
Ford and General Motors closed 40 parts and assembly plants on Friday, giving some 100,000 workers the day off, though company officials said some factories might be running again as soon as this evening. The city's African cultural festival was canceled, but the Dream Cruise, an annual classic-car convention expected to draw two million people to a 16-mile stretch in the suburbs, was scheduled to go on Saturday, if slower than usual, because many traffic lights remained out along the route.
Mayor Kilpatrick said at the afternoon news conference that the city had 210,000 bottles of water, 53,000 gallons of gasoline and 83,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and that the sewage treatment plant was running again.
"Detroit, you can flush the toilet," he said. 
City workers had visited the 1,200 elderly people living in six public housing buildings, bearing water and helping them up stairs, he said.
Mr. Oliver, the police chief, described the mood on the city streets as "calm -- not serene, but calm." There were 118 arrests for felonies and seven for misdemeanors, but there was little looting, he said. Those arrested included 15 juveniles.
Throughout the quiet streets of downtown this afternoon, people sat wherever they could find a patch of shade, trying not to move much in the humidity. At the BP station at the corner of First and Fort Streets, one of few working gasoline stations in the area, police officers were on guard to keep people from cutting in line or stealing from the minimart. Perhaps 100 cars stretched around the corner, as people waited for more than three hours.
"You would think everyone would stick together after Sept. 11 stuff, everyone holding hands and hugging," said Martin Hale, 33, who lives on the East Side and waited two hours to fill his tank. "That's just right out the window. Everybody out for themselves." 
Throughout the afternoon, lights began to flicker on sporadically. The MGM Grand Casino's billboard flashed "Big Arm Challenge." Some traffic lights began to work normally, while others were still flashing red, requiring four-way stops. Mayor Kilpatrick said there were just 52 traffic accidents, far fewer than on a normal Friday, because most people stayed off the streets.
In Greektown, where the casino was shuttered for the first time since its opening in 1999, Gregory Alexander was surprised when the lights and air conditioning suddenly came on in his flower shop, in time to keep his roses from frying. He quickly ran a 100-foot extension cord across the street to try to save the freezer at the Yaka Cafe, and then kick-start the sump pump in the flooded basement of the New Parthenon restaurant, but there was not enough power.
"I have no idea why we have power," Mr. Alexander said. "We just got it. So I'm sharing it with my neighbors."
Though DTE Energy said this morning that it did not expect power to be back on until Sunday night, the grid returned, bit by bit, throughout the day. About 130,000 customers had lights when they woke up. By noon, the number was 330,000. By 5 p.m., 700,000; by 7 p.m., 1.2 million and by 9 p.m., 1.5 million.
In St. Clair Shores, a resort community about 20 miles northeast of here, that meant the Saturday evening wedding of Eric Herman and Lisa Tarsi was canceled, and then uncanceled.
"We've got so many candles at our wedding, the lighting was going to be fine," said Mr. Herman, who had scrambled to find generators for the food and music, all for naught after power returned this afternoon. Thursday's rehearsal dinner for 50, though, was scrapped.
"Instead we just bought pizza and subs and came back to our house," he said. "We just realized you have to make do with what you have."

HEADLINE: THE BLACKOUT: OVERVIEW; 
LIGHTS GO ON AFTER BIGGEST BLACKOUT, BUT NOT WITHOUT 2ND DAY OF SUFFERING

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Lights went on again yesterday for millions of people in the Northeast, the Midwest and Canada, as utilities struggled to recover from a power failure that cast its shadow over eight states and played havoc with everything from traffic lights and telephones to manufacturing schedules at automobile plants.
 Power was restored to all of New York City and Westchester County, and most of Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey by last evening, utility officials said. Service had also resumed for most people in northern Ohio and southern Michigan, two other hard-hit areas. New York's subways, idle since the blackout hit on Thursday afternoon, slowly began to resume operations starting at midnight, transit officials said. 
 But as the sweltering new day began yesterday, millions of people were still in the dark, without air-conditioners or fans. Electricity was restored piecemeal, sometimes on one side of a street but not the other, as officials tried to avoid overloading the power-sharing system and triggering another collapse like the chain reaction set off on Thursday. 
The effects of the failure, the largest in American history, remained worst yesterday in Detroit and Cleveland, where some customers still faced the possibility of a weekend without power. The two cities were also coping with a drinking-water crisis because the blackout hobbled stations that pump water from the Great Lakes to millions of homes and businesses. Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio ordered National Guard tanker trucks to distribute thousands of gallons of water in Cleveland.
In New York, Broadway lights, and shows, went on. The stock markets were open, and the Mets played their scheduled game against the Colorado Rockies.
But hospitals struggled to treat patients suffering from heat-related ailments and anxiety, and many telephones, automated teller machines and cable-television systems were still not functioning. Trash piled up on streets alongside stranded tourists who camped out in parks and outside hotels and train stations.
At least four deaths, two in New York City and two in Canada, were attributed to the power failure, and two others to fires, many of which were traced to the candles or generators pressed into service overnight. Many offices, stores and factories closed for the day, and hundreds of flights were canceled.
President Bush called the blackout "a wake-up call" to modernize the nation's power-sharing system. "We will respond," he said during a trip to California. "We will figure out what went wrong and we will addressit."
Elected officials from Washington to state capitals demanded investigations, and assurances that something would be done to prevent another power failure on so large a scale. Govs. George E. Pataki of New York, James E. McGreevey of New Jersey and John G. Rowland of Connecticut wrote to Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, saying that similar promises had been made after blackouts in 1965 and 1977.
"There should never have been that instability in the grid that we saw across the Northeast," Mr. Pataki said during a briefing at the State Emergency Command Center at state police headquarters in Albany. "We have to have answers."
Power officials said yesterday that the blackout began shortly after 4 p.m. Thursday with a power failure somewhere in the Midwest -- a surge of electricity that pushed into Ontario, Canada, then into New York State and New England, tripping circuit breakers designed to prevent an overload by knocking generators out of service.
But they had no explanation for the size and scope of the blackout. Nor could they explain why it did not spread south from North Jersey into the Middle Atlantic states, or why systems designed to confine problems to relatively small areas suddenly failed. In all, about 100 power plants shut down in about nine seconds, cutting off electricity to tens of millions of people.
Even as many generators were going back into service yesterday, officials urged consumers to go easy on appliances and to use only those that were necessary. And there were scattered new problems: In Connecticut, a transmission line to the southwestern corner of the state failed.
Officials who oversee the power-sharing system ordered rolling blackouts -- cutting power for several hours in several places, including the Cleveland area, Westchester County and upstate New York -- to allow more utilities to ease back into the grid without causing fresh disruptions.
Air traffic remained chaotic, with airlines canceling about 400 flights bound for cities from New York to Ottawa. And there were long lines at service stations in Detroit and in Manhattan, among other places, because the electric-powered pumps would not work. Supplies ran short and tempers boiled.
"There've been a few fights," said Mohammad Khan, who works at a station on West 96th Street near West End Avenue. "But it wasn't too bad."
Buses and ferries were crammed as New Yorkers dealt with the unthinkable: life without the subway. But a New York City Transit spokesman, Paul Fleuranges, said there was a "firm belief" that the system would resume full operations this morning.
Among the officials who oversee the power network that failed on Thursday, there was some disagreement yesterday about exactly where the problem had started. New York State officials said they believed that the sudden voltage fluctuation that triggered the dominolike shutdown began at the Perry nuclear reactor near Cleveland.
But the plant operators said other transmission lines had shut down before theirs, suggesting that Perry was not the source of the problem. Other power industry officials said there were some signs that the trouble might have started in Michigan.
That state's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, declared a state of emergency in five counties yesterday. She also signed an executive order intended to speed the delivery of nearly a million gallons of gasoline from western Michigan to the Detroit area. Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick of Detroit urged elderly people who live in public housing to seek temporary shelter in designated "cooling centers" around the city.
Mr. Pataki, who declared a state of emergency on Thursday, also asked the president to declare a federal emergency in New York State. He and New York's two United States Senators asked for federal money to cover the costs of emergency services.
New York City mobilized 10,000 police officers on Thursday, Senator Charles E. Schumer said. "I think it's safe to say that by the time we finish tallying the cost of responding to this crisis, its expense is going to make the record books," he said.
Economists warned that the blackout's effects would reach far beyond municipal budgets once companies accounted for the time lost at everything from oil refineries to chemical plants. On the other hand, some said that the blackout, which interrupted production at automobile factories around Detroit, might trim excessive inventories that had been filling dealers' lots.
Complicating the estimates of lost productivity is uncertainty about how soon some factories can be restarted. That, in turn, reflects the time needed to get power plants going again. Governor Pataki noted that it takes 24 hours to restart nuclear plants like Indian Point, which provide a critical part of the electricity for southern New York State.
Although he urged people not to use too much power until the system had had time to stabilize, he said that he had requested and received federal approval to use the Long Island Cross-Sound Cable, which runs under the water between New York and Connecticut and has drawn local opposition. He described the step as temporary and said it would provide additional emergency power for New York City and Long Island.
In New York, a 17-year-old fell to his death from a roof after trying to loot a Brooklyn shoe store, the police said. A 72-year-old Manhattan man died of smoke inhalation from a fire caused by a candle, one of the 60 serious fires reported on Thursday, officials said. In Brooklyn, a 6-year-old boy died in a fire he accidentally set with a cigarette lighter. A firefighter and a police officer were also injured in fires.
The mayor said the 911 system had handled 90,000 calls, with 5,000 requiring emergency medical personnel. The police said they arrested 50 to 60 people on burglary charges related to looting.
But the 250 blackout-related arrests overnight were nowhere near the thousands that occurred during the 1977 blackout, Mr. Bloomberg pointed out. And even the total number of arrests overnight, 850 in all, was less than the average of 950 on most nights.
"New Yorkers showed that the city that burned in the 1970's when facing similar circumstances is now a very different place," the mayor said.
For New York City, the slow restoration of electric service was a result of a basic fact: The city needs its local plants operating, as well as the tie lines from outside the region that deliver power generated hundreds of miles away.
Mr. Bloomberg said Con Edison had "done as good a job as could be hoped for." 
Progress was slower in Michigan, where officials of the local utility, DTE Energy, said that service had been restored to 1,5 million of its 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan by 9 p.m.
In Cleveland, about 1.5 million customers lost power when the blackout hit. Utility officials in Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, said that by last night, most of them had electricity again. But Cleveland's water-pumping problems led Governor Taft to issue an order to boil drinking water. The water problems sparked a run on bottled water at supermarkets. The boil-water order covers Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, and will be in effect through Sunday.
Detroit residents were also warned to boil water before drinking.
Efforts to restore power in the Canadian province of Ontario continued. Premier Ernie Eves declared a state of emergency and told nonemergency workers to stay home. The police in Ottawa arrested 23 people for looting and reported two deaths related to the blackout.
As power was restored in many cities yesterday, elevators started working again. For tourists who had slept on the sidewalks on Thursday, that meant they could go to their hotel rooms. For more than 100 miners at a nickel mine in Falconbridge, 200 miles north of Toronto, that meant they could go home. The Associated Press reported that they had been trapped below ground for more than 12 hours because the blackout halted the elevators they use to go to the surface.

HEADLINE: An Intensive Hunt Led to a Terror Suspect and, Officials Hope, Details of Future Plots 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS with RAYMOND BONNER; Eric Lichtblau in Washington contributed to this report.

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
In an intensive terrorist manhunt, the Central Intelligence Agency had been tracking the movements of one of Al Qaeda's top operatives for weeks. Agents knew that he had left Malaysia on a boat, later crossed into Thailand, and was using prepaid telephone cards to make his calls, according to Western intelligence officials and the Thai police.
 The final tip-off to the exact location of the operative, Riduan Isamuddin, an Indonesian better known as Hambali, came with an ill-considered call he made from Thailand's ancient capital, Ayutthaya, to a number in Indonesia that was monitored by American agents, a Western intelligence analyst said. 
 Mr. Isamuddin, 39, was quickly seized on Tuesday by the Thai police working with C.I.A. agents and immediately flown on an American plane from Thailand to an undisclosed location, American and Australian officials said. 
The capture is one of the most significant in the pursuit of terrorist leaders around the world, the officials said. "This man is a very big fish," said Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, which suffered 88 deaths in the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali last October.
In Washington, American officials said today that they believed Mr. Isamuddin could provide a wealth of information on both past attacks in Southeast Asia and future plots within the United States.
Officials are particularly interested in determining whether Mr. Isamuddin had been organizing recruits for future hijackings of commercial airlines, as intelligence officials suspect. 
"That's something we're going to be very interested in pursuing with him," said an American official. "The name of the game is to prevent future attacks, and it's likely that he has very extensive knowledge of past and present Al Qaeda activities against U.S. interests."
The American official said: "You really can't overestimate the significance of the capture of this guy. He doesn't have the name recognition of an Osama bin Laden, but this guy was a big deal."
American officials are seeking to get Mr. Isamuddin to talk about what he knows of Al Qaeda's future plans. But it was unclear today whether he had begun to cooperate with his American captors, and American officials remained tight-lipped today about the conditions of his captivity.
The capture decapitates Al Qaeda's operations in Southeast Asia, which have been carried out by Mr. Isamuddin's group, Jemaah Islamiyah.
Mr. Isamuddin, who trained with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, is believed to have been the leader in organizing and financing a number of attacks that include the bombings of the Bali nightclubs, which killed 202 people, and of the J. W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, last week, in which 10 people died. 
Mr. Isamuddin has also been described in court records in the United States as participatingin the preparations for the 9/11 attacks, as well as the suicide attack in October 2000 on the American destroyer Cole and a plot in 1995 to blow up airliners over the Pacific.
From Malaysia, Mr. Isamuddin traveled by boat to Myanmar, the former Burma, said the Western intelligence analyst, who works in the region. He then walked into Thailand at a small border crossing as recently as two weeks ago.
In his travels, Mr. Isamuddin was carrying a large amount of cash that came from confederates in Pakistan, the intelligence officials said. He used the untraceable phone cards to escape detection, but slipped up when he called a number in Indonesia that was being monitored by American and Australian intelligence agencies.
Mr. Isamuddin is believed to have been arrested in Thailand by the local authorities. The C.I.A. helped the Thai authorities to plan and execute the arrest, but did not take part in the capture itself, officials said. 
"They weren't the ones that banged down the door," said an official with knowledge of the operation. 
A senior Australian official said Mr. Isamuddin had been preparing an attack on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here in October that is to include President Bush and other national leaders. 
Mr. Isamuddin is a charismatic and commanding figure who has controlled the flow of money from Al Qaeda to Southeast Asia, one senior Western intelligence official said. He described him as Al Qaeda's point man in the region as well as the operational chief of Jemaah Islamiyah.
Officials say he led a meeting of Qaeda operatives in Thailand early last year at which a decision was taken to focus attacks on "soft targets" like nightclubs, resorts, hotels and schools.
Mr. Isamuddin is close to Abu Bakar Bashir, a fundamentalist Indonesian cleric who directs Jemaah Islamiyah and who is now facing trial for treason in connection with a series of bombings.
Qaeda prisoners like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have provided their American interrogators with leads that American officials say have proven helpful in investigating plots and suspected operatives, and they say that they are hopeful information from Mr. Isamuddin will prove equally valuable.
Mr. Isamuddin, one of the few non-Arabs to make it into Al Qaeda's inner circle, was close to Mr. Mohammed, who is regarded as the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks.
American officials said that although Mr. Isamuddin's capture was expected to severely damage Al Qaeda's operations in Southeast Asia, a strong network of militant Islamists remains intact. Officials estimate that about 100 members of Jemaah Islamiyah have been apprehended in Southeast Asia in the last several years but that more than 500 militant members of the group remain at large, many with links to Al Qaeda.
Many separate cells are believed to be in place, primarily in Indonesia, and may still be capable of carrying out operations on their own. In a series of raids last month, Indonesian officials discovered that some of these cells had large amounts of explosives.
Indeed, according to one analyst, these cells could now be more difficult to monitor if their ties to a centralized organization have been cut.
Terrorism analysts said that the arrest also offered further evidence of the close links and common leadership between Al Qaeda and groups like Jemaah Islamiyah outside Al Qaeda's traditional base of power in South Asia.
"It goes to show that there remains a whole underground network of groups that share the same philosophies and co-mingle their ideas and support each other both financially and logistically," said Neil Herman, a former F.B.I. counterterrorism official who supervised the investigation into the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
Al Qaeda, Mr. Herman said, "is like a sophisticated corporation with a bunch of subsidiaries each with its own responsibilities."
There is a small Muslim community in Ayutthaya, 50 miles north of Bangkok, where Mr. Isamuddin was captured. Thailand is an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation but it provides a convenient staging point for terrorists because of its porous borders, its corruption and the easy availability of false documents.
"Thailand has long considered that it did not have a terrorist problem here, and therefore its security posture has been lower," said Paul Quaglia, a security expert with the consulting group PSA Asia Ltd. He said Thailand was less a target than a convenient transit point and hiding place for terrorists.
Mr. Isamuddin is wanted in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines in connection with the planning of a series of bomb attacks.
He was among eight people indicted in the Philippines for the bombing of the Manila overhead railway that killed 22 people in 2000.
He is believed to have been an important planner of a series of bombings and attacks on priests and churches in Indonesia that killed 19 people in 2000.
"When the United States no longer needs Hambali we will ask for him to be delivered here," said the Indonesian foreign minister, Hasan Wirayuda. "Many countries want him, not just us, because he is linked with international terrorist acts."
In Jakarta, the police announced today the arrest of a suspect in the Marriott hotel bombing and said a number of other people were being questioned.

TILTING AT MILLS
Green Dreams, Dirty Dealings,
and the Corporate Squeeze.
By Lis Harris.

 IN 1992, Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, proposed building a paper mill in the South Bronx. It would harvest the immense amount of wastepaper (used newspapers, junk mail, office detritus) New York City generates each day, recycle it into newsprint using ecologically sound methods and sell the product to local consumers, notably newspapers. Such a mill would address two city woes: the continuing slump, particularly severe in places -like the South Bronx -- long dependent on the shrinking manufacturing sector (joblessness there hovered around 20 percent, 50 percent for teenagers); and the loss of traditional outlets for the city's waste stream (ocean dumping, hauling to putrid landfills and burning in dioxin-spewing plants). 
More grandly, Hershkowitz's Bronx Community Paper Company would serve as a world-class demonstration project. He wanted to prove the viability of green capitalism -- a marriage of economic development and environmental remediation+- to a host of unbelievers in the business world and the environmental movement, who were locked (he believed) in unnecessary combat. Hershkowitz knew the city presented a host of special obstacles to eco-industrialists, but if a mill like this could make it here, he reasoned, it could make it anywhere. He came amazingly close to pulling it off, as "Bronx Ecology," by Hershkowitz himself, and "Tilting at Mills," by Lis Harris, for many years a staff writer at The New Yorker, show. 
To guarantee good relations with the plant's neighbors, Hershkowitz found a local sponsor in Banana Kelly, one of the community development corporations that had sprung up in the 70's, and vested ownership in it. Determined to resuscitate urban brownfields (polluted and abandoned industrial sites), the paper company settled on the derelict Harlem River Rail Yard. And to transform what others saw as waste into valuable raw material -- a key precept of the sustainable economy movement -- he insisted the mill use recycled water from a nearby sewage treatment plant instead of river water. 
Hershkowitz found a receptive Swedish paper company, and with a corporate anchor secured, investment bankers came on board, as did construction companies and engineers. He got Maya Lin, the architect of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to design a striking complex. The Natural Resources Defense Council put up seed money and helped clear regulatory hurdles. A bevy of foundations gave predevelopment grants. The state offered loan guarantees and helped with cleanup costs, and the city's economic development arm provided expertise. On paper, it looked like a half-billion dollar enterprise was taking off.
Almost immediately it slammed into problems. 
Businessmen's support proved fickle: from their perspective Hershkowitz had overburdened the project with costly, time-consuming and risky furbelows on behalf of extraneous, if not alien, social and ecological goals. Worse, when the Swedish firm withdrew (new management wanted to concentrate on European ventures) it proved impossible to find another big paper company, the kind Wall Street would approve (one potential replacement declined after calculating it could clear more than 30 percent in the Bronx, but 40 percent in South Korea). Besides, in the 90's boom, higher profits were available outside the industry altogether, in tech stocks or hedge funds. After 1992, moreover, the supply of newsprint outran demand, so producers began consolidating; the last thing they wanted was a new plant online.
And there were local competitors. In 1995, an Australian company built a recycling mill on Staten Island and won the right to process up to 50 percent of the city's wastepaper. Though not in direct competition -- it produced liner board (used, for example, for shoe boxes), not newsprint -- it lobbied hard against any municipal deal with Hershkowitz, just in case one day it might want the remainder. Also opposing the Bronx project were commercial carters linked to the mob, and waste haulers whose profits were linked to exporting the trash, including giant multinational corporations like Waste Management, whose campaign contributions gave them considerable clout at City Hall. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was already predisposed against the project because the Bronx was the domain of a rival, Fernando Ferrer, though in fact Ferrer too was an opponent, miffed he hadn't been allowed to pick the participating community groups.
Some of Hershkowitz's biggest headaches came from his presumed community ally, whose new leadership proved undependable. Other community groups were also on the attack, some because the building trades refused to give construction jobs to neighborhood people, others because they wanted a slice of the development pie. (Once he was told that $70,000 would make his problems go away; when he refused to come across, Hershkowitz says, it was publicly implied that the plant was environmentally genocidal.) 
Despite all this, Hershkowitz and the project plowed on, year after year, nimbly escaping one crisis only to tumble into another. Finally, just after having found a large construction company willing to undertake the project, the backers were sued by a rival construction firm (a common way to grab a piece of the action). Now the Natural Resources Defense Council itself wanted out, and its employee off the case. The paper company was handed over to the contractor-developer in 1999 and struggled on one more year before Giuliani pulled the plug.
Of the two accounts, Harris's "Tilting at Mills" is much more smoothly written, a refreshing departure from hairy-chested accounts of the 80's and 90's booms that focus on mano a mano combat between tycoons. Harris is writing broad social history here, and her book embraces the remarkable range of players. Basically in Hershkowitz's corner, she emphasizes the self-interest of many of the plant's opponents, but does allot him some of the blame. Hershkowitz is often critical of his environmentalist confreres for making the perfect the enemy of the good, but his own insistence on having the mill be an exemplar of perfection in so many spheres at once might well have made it too easy a target for its myriad enemies.
Hershkowitz admits to faults -- naivete and ignorance are high on the list -- and indeed, developing a critical perspective on the experience is the whole point of "Bronx Ecology." It's not meant to be a narrative or a memoir, but rather a scientist's write-up of a failed experiment, to provide successors (as his subtitle has it) with a "Blueprint for a New Environmentalism." So we get checklists of things to keep in mind, and checklists seldom make absorbing reading (though it is also the case that his text is more repetitious, his points more belabored, than they need have been).
The real question is how useful his blueprint for a greener future really is. Here, it seems to me, Hershkowitz pulls back from confronting the implications of what he's laid out, particularly the key question of who exactly might be the agent to make his vision real. It's clearly not the corporate world: "green capitalism" stands revealed as a patent oxymoron. He urges environmentalists to step forward, but there's no sign that major environmental groups will soon venture again into eco-industrial waters (certainly not if they read "Bronx Ecology"). As forlabor, union pension fund managers proved even more conservative than investment bankers.
Hershkowitz comes closest to the mark when he wonders if the state might not expand its role, either building green projects as public works or committing public capital as lead investor. Certainly -- pace current free-market pieties -- government is capable of ambitious enterprise, viz. the Manhattan Project, the the space program, the Internet and the New Deal. Moreover, putatively private industries (notably pulp and paper, petroleum and highway construction) are, Hershkowitz reminds us, heavily subsidized by various levels of government. Why not be transparent about public investment, and establish a federal development bank like, but better than, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that underwrote much of the New Deal and World War II? That might yet make Hershkowitz's bold blueprint a reality.

HEADLINE: Arms and the Man 

BYLINE:  By Peter Landesman; Peter Landesman writes frequently for the magazine. His last article was about mass rape in Rwanda.

 BODY:
Victor Bout, by most accounts the world's largest arms trafficker, had agreed to meet me in the lounge of the Renaissance Hotel in Moscow, a monolithic post-Soviet structure populated by third-tier prostitutes and men in dark suits. Bout's older brother, Sergei, waited with me, as did Richard Chichakli, a Syrian-born naturalized American citizen who lives in Dallas. Sergei helps run Bout's many air-cargo companies. Chichakli, an accountant, calls himself a former business associate of Bout and his "friend and brother." 
 As we waited, Chichakli tried to discourage me from pressing Bout about his connections, suggesting that there were some things I didn't want to know. "They'll put you on your knees before they execute you," he said. Then he nodded toward the doorway. "Here he comes. Does he look like the world's largest arms dealer to you?" 
 Bout, who is 36, six feet tall and somewhat expansive in girth, nimbly made his way through the crowded lounge. He didn't shake my hand as much as grip it, with a firm nod. Icy blue eyes like chips of glass punctuated a baby face. We sat on one of the lounge's dingy couches, and he placed a thick folder of papers on his lap. 
"Look, here is the biggest arms dealer in the world," Chichakli said, half mocking me and half mocking Bout. Bout opened his blazer. "I don't see any guns," he said with a shrug. Then Sergei raised his arms. "None here either." (Both spoke excellent English.) "Maybe I should start an arms-trafficking university and teach a course on U.N. sanctions busting," Victor Bout said. The brothers looked at each other and laughed.
No one in the lounge seemed to be paying attention to Bout. Behind us sat four Israeli men who may or may not have been listening. Chichakli, who says he speaks Hebrew, said they were waiting for a phone call to confirm a deal for diamonds.
Bout leaned forward. "I woke up after Sept. 11 and found I was second only to Osama." He put his hand on the papers. The truth, he said, was much bigger than his personal story. "My clients, the governments," he began. Then, "I keep my mouth shut." 
Later he said, "If I told you everything I'd get the red hole right here." He pointed to the middle of his forehead. 
The world of the arms trafficker often feels like the script of a bad Hollywood thriller come to life. At times you are tempted to laugh at the B-movie dialogue and cloak-and-dagger intrigue. But the political and financial stakes are high. And, as a Western intelligence agent in Moscow told me, this isn't celluloid, and the dangers are of a much more complicated sort. 
In the summer of 1999, faced with multiple conflicts in West and Central Africa, the National Security Council authorized electronic surveillance of government and militia leaders in war zones like northeast Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Every morning, N.S.C. officials cross-referenced transcripts of overheard telephone conversations with American satellite imagery and with field reports by British spies on the ground. The documentation was massive, without obvious patterns, until, finally, astute analysts noticed that every conflict had something in common: Victor Bout.
The name surfaced in various permutations, and always in one of three contexts: airplanes, diamond transport or weapons shipments. Gayle Smith, the N.S.C.'s top Africanist, whose staff uncovered the Bout connection, sent an e-mail message to her fellow N.S.C. members: "Who is this guy? Pay close attention to this. He's all over the place."
An answer was provided by a C.I.A. aviation expert from Langley, who showed up at the White House with covert photographs shot at various African jungle airstrips between 1996 and 1999. The photos, according to a former White House official who studied them, show different Antonovs and Ilyushins, Russian cargo planes built to land on (and escape from) almost any surface. In the pictures, the planes' bellies are open. African militiamen in fatigues are off-loading crates of weapons. One photo shows a younger Bout standing before one of the planes. The White House official said the planes were traced to Bout. 
"Bout was brilliant," Gayle Smith said recently. "Had he been dealing in legal commodities, he would have been considered one of the world's greatest businessmen. He's a fascinating but destructive character. We were trying to bring peace, and Bout was bringing war."
C.I.A. and MI6 agents on the ground in Africa first picked up Bout's scent in the early 1990's, when his fleet of planes began crisscrossing the continent. In the early days, they transported gladiolas; later, frozen chickens and then diamonds, mining equipment, Kalashnikov assault rifles, bullets, helicopter gunships and even, Bout says, U.N. peacekeepers, French soldiers and African heads of state. The names of the men Bout came to count as his personal friends and customers included Massoud, Mobutu, Savimbi, Taylor, Bemba. It was not until the summer of 2000 that the N.S.C. realized it had stumbled on not only the most prolific arms trafficking operation in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan but probably the best connected (and protected) private-weapons transport and brokering network in the world. 
Smith and others took their information to Richard C. Clarke, then the chief of counterterrorism for the N.S.C. "Get me a warrant," Clarke responded.
But because Bout's reputed crimes were committed outside United States borders, the N.S.C. had no U.S. law to use on him. Instead, the N.S.C. initiated an operation that drew on the resources of intelligence agencies in at least seven countries and sparked cabinet-level diplomacy on four continents. Belgium issued its own warrant for Bout's arrest a year later -- not for arms trafficking but for crimes related to money laundering and diamond smuggling. In the end, the pursuit failed. Victor Bout is still at large, a fugitive from international justice. But unlike Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, he lives in plain sight -- in Moscow, under the apparent protection of a post-Communist system that has profited from his activities as much as he has.
He has also evaded journalists, U.N. investigators and watchdog organizations like Human Rights Watch. Until now, the only publicly available photo of him was secretly taken by a Belgian journalist in March 2001 on an airstrip in Congo. His only statements have been brief denials of his role in arms trafficking. He walked out of a CNN interview in March 2002. That same month, six weeks after a Los Angeles Times article connected Bout to shipments of arms and recruits to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, he released a statement in which he described himself as a father, husband, entrepreneur -- and a scapegoat. Since then, he has been silent. 
Though Bout denies his involvement in arms trafficking, he has been persistently and publicly linked to weapons shipments, charges supported by paper and money trails, confessions, eyewitness accounts and multiple intelligence reports. The longer Bout has remained out of the reach of international law, the bigger his legend has grown. In many ways, he is now the public face of a giant international criminal structure.
In the eight months between the time I first asked Bout for an interview and when he finally granted it, I came to understand the general shape of the political and criminal twilight that conceals the commerce of arms trafficking. In June, I laid out some of what I believed in a letter. Two days later, Bout called and asked me to come to Moscow.
'Flowers, that's where it all started," Chichakli said. It was midnight, and we had moved on from the hotel lounge to an Italian restaurant in downtown Moscow full of people drinking vodka and eating pasta and pizza. Bout ordered a carrot juice and an arugula salad. "He's a vegetarian," Chichakli said. "He's an ecologist. He believes in saving the rain forest."
Bout nodded. "I've been given a chance to reinvent myself." It was not immediately clear why he had chosen to see me. He seemed intrigued by his legend, yet wanted simultaneously to fan it and diminish it.
Over the previous 10 years, he explained, whenever he accompanied one of his planes into the remote jungles of Africa, he spent time photographing wildlife and studying isolated African tribes. "In the middle of nowhere, you feel alive, you feel part of nature." His favorite authors, he told me, were the New Age novelists Paulo Coelho and Carlos Castaneda. "What I really want to do now is to take one of my helicopters to the Russian Arctic north and make wildlife films for National Geographic and the Discovery channel." When Chichakli leaned forward, I noticed that the label on his tie said "Unicef." He gestured toward Bout. "He gives Unicef money." We all laughed; I suspect for different reasons.
Chichakli began rehearsing Bout's career for my benefit. He struck his first business deal in 1992, when he was 25. He bought three Antonov cargo planes for $120,000 and then brokered their services for long-haul flights from Moscow, leasing the planes both "wet" (with a crew) and "dry" (plane only). His maiden voyage was to Denmark. 
"I never had investors," Bout said. But where does a 25-year-old Russian get that kind of start-up money? I asked. "It was never difficult finding money," he said, refusing to say more.
In 1993, he moved his operations to the United Arab Emirates, a critical trade and transportation hinge between Asia, Africa and Europe. Newly rich Russians eager to spend their dollars had begun to flock to Dubai to shop duty-free. "They bought everything from pencils to cars to electronics to Ikea furniture," Bout said. "I saw a gap in the transport market and flew it all back for a premium." Business really started to boom when he began filling his planes with South African gladiolas. "Vic bought a day-old flower for $2 and sold it in Dubai for $100," Chichakli said. "Twenty tons per flight. It's better than printing money."
Bout made his base the emirate of Sharjah, with its notorious "airport of convenience" for planes registered in countries like the Central African Republic and Liberia. It was here that he met Chichakli, who was the founding director of Sharjah's free-trade zone. (Chichakli says he is a nephew of the former president of Syria and the son of a former Syrian under secretary of defense; he also did a stint in the U.S. Army and "trained in aviation and intelligence," he told me. He agreed that he seemed overqualified for his work as a Dallas C.P.A.) 
By 1996, Bout was running the biggest of the emirate's 160 air-cargo companies, employing 1,000 air and land crew members. "The idea was to create a network of companies in Central Africa, Southern Africa and the Emirates. I wanted to make a cargo and passenger airline like Virgin Atlantic."
By 1997, Bout's operations had expanded to an abandoned airfield in Pietersburg, South Africa. He built a refrigeration facility in South Africa to freeze and store chickens, which cost a little over $1 a kilo in South Africa and sold for $10 in Nigeria. He talked openly about his early commercial exploits but was more reserved when it came to his personal life. "It's painful to have your private life exposed," he said. 
He was born, the record shows, to Russian parents in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, on Jan. 13, 1967. A voracious reader of Russian classics, he attended the Soviet Military Institute for Foreign Languages in Moscow and then went to a Russian military college, earning a degree in economics. He speaks six languages fluently. (He told me he learned most of them "traveling.") He served in a military aviation regiment until 1991. Two of those years he spent in Mozambique, at the end of that country's civil war. 
Bout is said to have been working for the K.G.B. in Angola when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Bout insists that he never had any connection with the K.G.B. and that he had only spent a couple of weeks in Angola. "My mother cried when the newspapers connected me to the K.G.B.," he said. He was eager to show me a statement on what he said was the letterhead of the Federal Security Services -- formerly the K.G.B. -- dated October 2002. It says that the agency "has no information regarding Mr. Bout's connections with the K.G.B.," a statement that means little in a country where anything, especially a document, can be bought. 
Reflecting on his travels, Bout said he saw firsthand in Angola, Congo and elsewhere how Western donations to impoverished countries, often in the form of state-of-the-art industry, lead to the destruction of social and ecological balance, mutual resentment and eventually war. Philanthropy creates addiction, he said. "Once countries give money, they control you." He admiredthe isolated Pygmy tribes he visited during his jungle runs, he said, because they lived in perfect harmony with their environment, immune from conflict and diseases like AIDS.
He also spoke glowingly of Congo's late president, Mobutu Sese Seko, and of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan Northern Alliance commander, both of whom he said he knew intimately. He was attracted to Mobutu's common sense and Massoud's integrity. Combined, they would have made the perfect leader. They also made fine customers.
Starting in 1995, Bout expanded his air-freight operations to Ostend, Belgium, and later to Odessa, Ukraine. Eleven years earlier, Ostend had been a transit point for weapons in the Iran-contra operation, leaving behind a comfortable precedent and logistical mechanisms for arms traffickers. So did Belgium's lax arms-trafficking laws. From Sharjah and South Africa, and now from Ukraine and Ostend, Bout did indeed tap into what Africa and the Middle East needed. But it wasn't gladiolas and frozen chickens. 
Most people think that controlling arms shipments is merely a matter of international diplomacy. That may have been true during the cold war, when traffickers were often subcontractors of the superpowers, feeding the proxy conflicts Washington and Moscow wanted fought. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the exclusive club of arms brokers metastasized. Some brokers still work at the behest of governments and intelligence agencies. But most are now entrepreneurial freelancers who sell weapons without regard for ideology, allegiance or consequence. They have only one goal in mind: profit. 
"Victor Bout is a creature of the Yeltsin era, of disorganized crime, who adapted to live in the era of Putin and more organized crime," according to Jonathan M. Winer, deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the Clinton administration. In the wake of the cold war, to adapt meant to exploit the chaos. The Soviet Army's massive arsenal ended up in the hands of former Soviet republics. Desperate for hard currency, they sold off weapons the same way they sold off other resources and products they inherited from the defunct Soviet empire. "Who owned what and who ran the fire sale was a free-for-all," Winer said. 
Of all the republics outside of Russia, Ukraine got the most -- and most lethal -- weapons, enough conventional firepower, by many accounts, to sustain a million troops. The Ukrainian government made a public show of transferring its vast nuclear arsenal back to Russia. But between 1992 and 1998, it has been reported, $32 billion of large- and small-scale Ukrainian weaponry and ammunition, as well as other military property, simply disappeared. 
"The Ukrainian military was turned into a tool for revenue by a generation of politicians who took advantage of the factories and used them to manufacture and ship weapons for money to anyone who wanted them," Winer said. 
Representatives from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Yemen, the Taliban and Pakistan came calling. So, perhaps, did North Korea, by way of Pakistan, and Al Qaeda, through the Taliban. "Whatever country has the worst governance but the best infrastructure becomes a honey pot," Winer said. "In the 1980's, it was Central America. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it became Ukraine. There's concentrated power, resources in very few hands, no oversight, no separate functioning judiciary, a huge porous border, huge inherited military facilities, lots of airstrips, a bunch of old planes. Ukraine is the epicenter for global badness. It's worse than Pakistan. It's a one-stop-shopping infrastructure for anyone who wants to buy anything."
Ukraine became the deepest and most reliable source of supply in the arms-trafficking underworld. What was missing was a way to move and sell the product. That's where Victor Bout and others came in. And the world was soon awash in weapons.
Last February, months before I met with Bout, I went to Kiev. The year before, Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, had been caught personally directing illicit weapons sales. From 1998 to 2000, Kuchma's bodyguard, a former K.G.B. employee and Ukrainian intelligence officer named Mykola Melnychenko, had bugged the presidential office and then turned over tapes to an opposition member of Ukraine's Parliament. The tapes caught Kuchma apparently approving the sale of four world-class radar systems to Saddam Hussein for $100 million and ordering the director of Ukraine's intelligence agency to "take care of" a Ukrainian journalist who had been following the government's connections to illegal arms sales. Two months after that conversation, the journalist, Georgy Gongadze, vanished. His headless, acid-scorched corpse was found in a forest glade two months later. He was one of at least three Ukrainian journalists and five members of Parliament who died in the last few years under mysterious circumstances. 
Before I left for Ukraine, I met with Melnychenko, who had taken refuge in the United States. He agreed to meet me at the information booth at Grand Central Terminal, and we moved on to the bar at Michael Jordan's restaurant to talk. A pale, nervous man, he seemed an unlikely candidate to try to topple the tyrannical Ukrainian president by himself. Had anyone put him up to the bugging, I asked? He shrugged: "I'm an officer. I wanted to stop the crime." Asked if he knew Victor Bout, he at first said no, then yes and later, in a phone conversation, no again. Recently he said, "I don't know him in person, but I know a lot about him." He told me that he is frequently warned by the United States about assassination plots against him.
Whether Melnychenko worked independently or for the K.G.B. or for the C.I.A. (I was told all three), the tapes are real, and "Kuchmagate" -- as the Ukrainian press has dubbed it -- provides a glimpse of the anatomy of the arms-trafficking underworld, of which state-sponsored arms trafficking is just one thread. 
Arms traffickers inherited not only the Soviet Union's cold-war weapons supply but also its fully operational systems of clandestine transport, replete with money channels, people who understood how to use them and, most important, established shipping pipelines -- what Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement under President Clinton, calls "the tubing." "The tubing can carry different kinds of things," he told me, "drugs, humans, money -- or weapons." Victor Bout was master of the tubing.
"By 2000, Victor Bout had become the McDonald's of arms trafficking -- he was the brand name," said Alex Vines, an arms investigator for Human Rights Watch who first picked up signs of Bout's operation in 1995. A conversation with a Kenyan diamond trader and mine operator named Sanjivan Ruprah offers insight into Bout's techniques. Ruprah was arrested in Belgium in February 2002, accused of money laundering, and later released. "I met Victor to discuss airlifting a hundred tons of diamond mining equipment from South Africa to Kananga in the Congo to start a new diamond mine," Ruprah said by e-mail. (He said he was traveling in Africa, but wouldn't say in which country.) Ruprah told U.S. investigators that in June 2002 he told Bout that the embattled Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was losing the fight for the Liberian north and asked him to arrange for an emergency delivery of weapons. In an interview with U.S. officials, Ruprah described how Bout offered to quickly fill Taylor's shopping list in exchange for a promise of future business in Liberia. Ruprah said that Bout told him he had a way around the U.N. embargo. Bout told him he had end-user certificates, required for any legal sale of weapons to a legitimate government. False certificates, which is what Bout had, can be bought from corrupt governments for as little as $50,000. Djibouti is a popular false destination; so is Peru, according to one well-known arms trafficker.
Bout told me the deal simply didn't happen. "How do you think a plane can fly to Liberia, which is under U.N. embargo, without being tracked?" he said. To illustrate, Chichakli opened his laptop and started a program that charts the myriad air-traffic control centers a plane is required to contact as it flies through one country's airspace into another's. For the sake of argument, they asked me to suggest an itinerary. "From where?" Bout asked. I said Ostend, Belgium. Chichakli typed in the airport code for Ostend, OST. "To where?" Bout said. I suggested Monrovia, the war-ravaged capital of Liberia. Bout and Chichakli looked at each other. They hesitated. "Monrovia, let's see," Chichakli said. "Do you know the code, Victor?" Bout shrugged, "I have no idea." I watched as they tried to look as if they were struggling, typing in various permutations. Sergei finally gave them the code, ROB, for Roberts International in Monrovia.
Arms traffickers use what looks like legitimate business activity to disguise the smuggling. Weapons shopping lists are quietly passed through webs of people who fill orders, often for cash on delivery. Usually, the first link in the chain is military; bribes are paid to officials and officers to look the other way, or soldiers are paid to play warehouse stock clerks. Sometimes crates of weapons are labeled perishable fruit. Or waiting air crews switch cargo at "refueling" stops. A pilot might fly into an airport under one registration number and fly out under a different one. Or he might start off on an openly planned flight from, say, Ostend to Peru, then double back and dogleg south to a war zone in West Africa. Payments are wired from a buyer's shell company into a seller's shell, often in money-laundering havens like the Isle of Man or the Caymans or Dubai, or money is wired to quasi-legitimate cargo companies. Sometimes weapons are simply traded for bags of cash or sockfuls of diamonds. 
"Bout's procurement and logistics network is fully integrated, which made him so attractive and so successful," said Lee S. Wolosky, former director of transnational threats at the N.S.C. under both Clinton and Bush, who directed the U.S. campaign against Bout. "Weaponry is harder to both get a hold of and to transport than women and drugs. There is really no one in the world who has put it all together the way he has."
Often, traffickers simply assume that authorities won't bother to check their cargo. In late September 2001, two weeks after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, a Hungarian trading company in Budapest filed a request to ship Ukrainian cargo to an American firm based in Macon, Ga. No one had ever heard of the Ukrainian company with the vanilla name -- ERI Trading and Investment Company -- and for good reason. A Hungarianbureaucrat making a random inspection of the cargo discovered that the shipment included 300 Ukrainian surface-to-air (SAM) missiles and 100 launchers. SAM's are light, mobile and easily hidden, and American agents later feared that they were going to be distributed to terrorists near America's major airports. (The cargo wasn't permitted to take off; the American buyer was arrested in June.)
When I was alone with Bout and his brother, I put on the table a copy of an invoice for another weapons deal, obtained from European intelligence sources. The invoice, on the letterhead of San Air General Trading, one of Bout's Sharjah-based companies, was for two Russian MI-8T "helicopter gunships," four missile launchers and three bomb launchers, all for $1,900,000, plus spare parts for an additional $90,000. The weapons were ostensibly for delivery to Ivory Coast, but in reality, the sources said, the destination was Liberia. Bout picked it up, stared at it and coolly declared it a forgery. "Anyway, MI-8T's aren't gunships; they're cargo helicopters." After an uncomfortable silence, he added, "Though they can be outfitted with rockets and the proper guns to make them into gunships."
U.S. officials have connected Bout to both Alexander Islamov, a notorious Russian arms dealer, and Leonid Minin, a Ukrainian version of the same. I asked him if he had flown cargo for them. "These are my clients," he said. "But who cares? It's not my business to know what's on board. It's not the captain's job to open the crates and know what's inside." (In fact, a pilot considers it an almost religious duty to know what his plane is carrying.) Then he changed his tack, abandoning his half-hearted denial that he moved weapons. O.K., he said, the point isn't whether or not he delivers weapons; the point is, what's wrong with it? "Illegal weapons?" he said. "What does that mean? If rebels control an airport and a city, and they give you clearance to land, what's illegal about that?" After all, he said, rebels become governments, which have a right to defend themselves. What Bout didn't say was that the people receiving the weapons are often under U.N. arms embargo. Or they are rebels slaughtering their way into power. 
"The problem is the system," Bout argued. "Arms is no different than pharmaceuticals. Actually, pharmaceuticals can be more dangerous than arms."
Sergei was nodding in agreement. I said that coming from the mouth of a self-professed ecologist, humanist and admirer of Pygmies, that sounded at best like a cold rationalization. "Look, killing isn't about weapons," Bout replied impatiently. "It's about the humans who use them."
Bout fell silent. His wit and his insider's perspective on international geopolitics suddenly coalesced into the cynical visage of a drug dealer peddling crack in a schoolyard. He was just a businessman selling his wares. Who was he to be the arbiter of good and evil? 
On that, he was technically correct. He was different from a drug pusher in one crucial way: what he was doing might be repugnant and contributing to savagery, but it didn't necessarily make him a criminal. There is simply not a lot of law -- American, international or otherwise -- on arms trafficking. Since the mid-1990's, not one U.N. arms embargo has resulted in the conviction of an arms trafficker. The U.N. has no power to arrest. Interpol depends on the cooperation of local authorities. Astonishingly, despite having the toughest arms-trafficking laws in the world, the U.S. has not prosecuted a single case of arms trafficking. This is true partly by design. "Governments create rules that allow arms deals to happen," said Lisa Misol, an arms researcher for Human Rights Watch. "And traffickers rely on the fact that countries don't consider arms shipments originating somewhere else their problem." 
In other words, the most repugnant kind of commerce is usually not illegal. And if arms trafficking is not illegal, how can it be stopped? Why should it be stopped? When confronted by images of child soldiers in Liberia, the question seems naive, if not specious. But when it comes to weapons sales, the notion of "national interest" becomes a hall of mirrors. The top arms manufacturers -- and the U.S. sells more weapons than the rest of the world combined -- have a vested interest in keeping their product on the move, legally or otherwise. And aren't there also simply times when a government decides it's in its best interest, and its citizens' best interest, to let traffickers traffic? Governments are reluctant to restrain arms traffickers who might serve their own geopolitical or national-security interests in the future. "It's the disposal problem," said Jonathan Winer. "What do you do with people after you've trained them to be killers, traffickers, smugglers and criminals in the cause of a just war? Ask Manuel Noriega. He'd know."
In Africa, by all accounts, Bout sold and delivered to anyone who could pay. But Afghanistan was different. He said that he helped arm only the Rabbani government, which was then clinging to power. "I took sides because I knew what the Taliban was," Bout told me. "Rabbani and Massoud were the only hope. I had a major pact with the Rabbani government. We sustained them. My aircraft was the last one out of Bagram air base before the Taliban came." In the mid-1990's, he flew four shipments a day into government-controlled Jalalabad, he said: weapons (probably from the former Soviet republics) and TV's and radios from Dubai. 
In August 1995, 13 months before the Taliban took Kabul, Taliban aircraft intercepted one of Bout's Sharjah-based planes loaded with ammunition for the government. The MIG's forced the plane down in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. What happened next has become arms-trafficking folk lore. The plane and its cargo were seized, and the crew of seven imprisoned at the airport for over a year. Eventually, the story goes, the crew members overpowered their captors, started up Bout's plane, took off under heavy fire and escaped back to Sharjah. 
Bout tells a different story about the escape. He flew to Kandahar a few times over the course of that year to negotiate his crew's release, he told me, but not alone. He was accompanied by officials from the Russian government. The negotiations failed. (The story up to this point has been reported.) The reality of the plane's escape, he went on, is more interesting than the lore and more politically fraught. "Do you really think you can jump in a plane that's been sitting unmaintained on the tarmac for over a year, start up the engines and just take off?" He paused. "They didn't escape. They were extracted." 
By a Western government, I asked? "No," Bout said, clearly agitated. Was it a Russian government operation? At first Bout didn't answer. Then he said: "Until now you've been digging in a big lake with small spoons. There are huge forces. . . ." He broke off midsentence. Then he explained that this incident revealed too much about the triangulated relationship between him, governments and his rogue clients. He said he was protecting himself and me. 
Before September 2001, Russia was arming Massoud andthe Northern Alliance with tons of weaponry, the former N.S.C. official told me. Many of the deliveries were made by Bout. "Bout wanted to play a more clean game, to arm the American allies," Johan Peleman, a U.N. arms investigator, said. Bout flatly refused to discuss any such relationship. 
Bout flew U.N. peacekeepers to East Timor and Somalia, and possibly to Sierra Leone. ("The U.N. always goes for the cheapest contracts," Peleman said.) In 1994, during the Rwandan genocide, Bout said, the French government asked him to help implement Operation Turquoise to halt the fighting and facilitate aid shipments to refugees. Bout told me that he flew in 2,500 elite French troops. He also told me that he extracted Mobutu from Congo.
"Bout is encouraged by Western intelligence agencies when it's politically expedient," a British arms investigator said.
The governments and rebel groups Bout supplied knew enough not to antagonize him, Gayle Smith, formerly of the N.S.C., told me. "You wouldn't want to be on his bad side. He's wily; he's hard to catch. He was always several steps ahead. He would acquire anything and move it anywhere for anyone. While Victor Bout might be running arms to your opposition, you know he'll also ferry arms against a U.N. embargo for you."
In February, I went to the Ukrainian port city of Odessa to meet a pilot I was told had flown planes into Liberia for Bout. As a major transport link between Europe and the Middle East, Odessa is the central smuggling tube in Europe and a favorite port of call for pilots and traffickers of all stripes. 
The pilot was waiting for me in an icy wind at the top of the Odessa steps made famous in Eisenstein's film "Battleship Potemkin." We nodded to each other, and I followed him to an empty cafe. He talked in a low voice, describing how planes sometimes landed and took off amid raging gunfire. The hulls of those planes were known to often be sheathed in lead to deflect bullets. He nodded at Bout's name. He said pilots earned $10,000 per shipment. He had quit a few months before after being strafed by machine-gun fire one too many times. Half an hour after we met, the pilot led me out and brusquely said goodbye. 
He had reason to be nervous. Even hard-core arms traffickers shun the country. Earlier in the year, I met with the notorious Sarkis Soghanalian in the balmy Jordanian port city of Aqaba, where he spends his days sitting by the sea before an array of satellite and cellphones. A ziggurat-shaped Armenian-American with Arafat stubble and sausage-link fingers, he is both a longtime ally of American intelligence and an occasional target of law-enforcement agencies. Soghanalian was well known for, among many other things, being Saddam Hussein's major supplier of weapons during the Iran-Iraq war years. When I asked him for advice on navigating the former Soviet Union in general and Ukraine in particular, he shook his head and said he never did business there. "No one can be trusted. They only work for money there."
A U.S. government adviser in Kiev told me, "Odessa's an open sewer and criminal outlet." Eight hundred shipping containers are off-loaded at the port every day. Among other contraband like cigarettes and bootleg pharmaceuticals and CD's, weapons are smuggled in and then transferred from ship to ship or ship to plane. "We've had a hundred seizures of radioactive material over 10 years," the adviser said "But we don't know what we're getting because we don't know what we're missing." 
In one sense, Odessa is merely the gateway to a weapons source potentially even more valuable. Fifty miles up the Dniester River from Odessa, in neighboring Moldova, the breakaway province of Trans-Dniester falls under the overlapping control of Ukrainian and Russian organized crime syndicates, a Bolshevik-style administration, the Russian Army and a private corporation named Sheriff. The Russian-speaking Trans-Dniestrians fought Romanian-speaking Moldova to a stalemate in a vicious war for independence in 1992, carving out a 250-mile-long wedge of land along Moldova's border with Ukraine. Its 600,000 people are destitute and isolated. 
Frozen in a state of neither war nor peace, with zero international presence or accountability, there might be no other place on earth that better represents the overlapping interests of governments, organized-crime syndicates and arms traffickers like Victor Bout. Odessa is only 50 miles of good road away. "Trans-Dniester is patrolled by the Odessa mafia," Eduard Hurvitz, Odessa's former mayor, told me. The enclave is so lawless that the United States Embassy in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, discourages its personnel from going there, and staying there overnight requires the ambassador's permission.
"We're a bastard child born unofficially, but we believe we're an official state," Vladimir Bodnar, Trans-Dniester's minister of defense, told me. Bodnar and I were sitting in the Parliament Building in Tiraspol, Trans-Dniester's grim and sparsely populated capital. The city is peppered with valorous Soviet statuary, including a colossal monument to Lenin outside the Parliament Building. Across the street was a gas station with a sign showing an outsize five-point sheriff's badge, the logo of the Sheriff Corporation, said to be controlled by Trans-Dniester's ex-Communist president, Igor Smirnov, a former Russian factory manager. Sheriff owns many businesses in Trans-Dniester. U.S. officials have linked Russian organized-crime groups to the smuggling of radiological materials and have little doubt that the trail leads back to Trans-Dniester. 
Before the Soviet Union's collapse, Tiraspol was home to the Soviet 14th Army, which left behind 40,000 tons of weaponry, the largest arsenal in Europe. Russia had only begun to repatriate that weaponry by the time Trans-Dniester grabbed its quasi-independence. The lightly armed Trans-Dniestrians -- and the various criminals who controlled the territory -- refused to let the Russians leave with the remains. Or so Moscow says. Others disagree. "The Russians could pull out tomorrow," said Mark Galeotti, an adviser to British intelligence on Russian organized crime. "Smirnov is a puppet in the hand of Russian intelligence," said Ion Stavila, Moldova's deputy minister of foreign affairs. 
At last count, stored in a complex of bunkers and berms and guarded by a skeleton crew of Russians are enough explosives to make two and a half Hiroshima bombs, tens of thousands of Kalashnikov assault rifles, millions of rounds of ammunition and huge numbers of antitank missiles, grenades and Scudlike rockets. Trans-Dniestrian factories may still produce weapons. 
But Trans-Dniester is more than just the Wal-Mart of arms trafficking. Experts are concerned that terrorists -- or ambitious middlemen -- could find more sophisticated and dangerous things to buy. The Soviet military couldn't guarantee that all of the nuclear weapons had been removed. And hundreds of canisters of cesium-137, used by Soviet scientists to test the effects of nuclear war on plants, are unaccounted for. According to Russian documents I obtained, one 14th Army officer warned the Moldovans that in 1992 24 Alazan rockets in Trans-Dniester had been tipped with radioactive warheads. An adviser to British intelligence confirmed that some of the cesium is still inside Trans-Dniester.
In Moscow, over a drink, I asked Bout if he had been to Trans-Dniester. He shook his head no and shuddered. But British agents, who have tracked weapons from Trans-Dniester to the Balkans and beyond, have documented Bout's involvement there for years. "It's clear that Ukrainian weapons Bout trafficked came through Trans-Dniester," Galeotti said. Not just things that have disappeared out of arsenals. Sophisticated surface-to-air missile systems to the Middle East. Vehicle-mounted and artillery systems. "Large, high-tech kits. Flatbeds' and trainloads' worth. Bout's fingerprints are all over them."
On the evening of my third day with Bout, the phone in my hotel room rang. A voice said, "I understand we have things to talk about." At first I was taken aback, even amused, by the melodrama. But the voice was coldly sobering. "Tomorrow, 1700 hours," the caller said. "Go to the McDonald's on Pushkin Square. Buy two cups of coffee and sit at a table. I'll find you." Then he hung up. 
At 5 p.m. I went to the McDonald's. It was vast, multitiered and crowded with Russian teenagers. Techno-pop was playing loudly. It was the perfect place for a private conversation.
I put two coffees on a random table and waited. At 5:02, I looked left and right into the crowd, then turned back. A man in his early 40's was in the seat across from me. "Thank you for the coffee," he said.
The man didn't identify himself, but his knowledge of arms trafficking and its various players was expert. He told me that Bout was merely the public face of something much larger and that I was just getting through the surface and that to go further was very dangerous. 
He alluded to two assassinations that had taken place 10 days before. Both victims were executives of a huge air-defense contractor involved in export of antiaircraft weapons and other systems. 
He said to imagine the structure of arms trafficking in Russia like a mushroom. Bout was among those in the mushroom's cap, which we can see. The stalk is made up of the men who are really running things in Russia and making decisions. Looking from above, he said, you never see the stalk.
Earlier, in Kiev, Grigory Omelchenko, the former chief of Ukrainian counterintelligence, had said that traffickers like Bout are either protected or killed. "There's total state control."
Said E.J. Hogendoorn, the former U.N. arms investigator: "There was the sense that there were bigger and murkier forces involved in this. Bout's being protected by highly influential people." 
I began to understand why Bout was both eager to talk and reluctant. Cornered by multiple governments, selling off his assets and hounded by the press, he wanted to complain that he had merely become the fall guy for a criminalized -- and quasi-legal -- political structure much larger and more significant than Victor Bout. But if he revealed too much, he said, he would be perilous.
Between the summers of 2000 and 2001, Western intelligence agencies targeted Bout with listening devices. Agents eavesdropped on his phone conversations. The stakes were raised even further in early 2001, when the N.S.C. was shown materials that led it to believe Bout had sold planes to Ariana Afghan Airlines, the national flagship airline that had been taken over by the Taliban. U.S. intelligence was reporting daily Ariana flights from the Emirates to the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, and U.S. officials said that these aircraft may have been delivering weapons, gold and jihadis. Though there was no evidence connecting Bout to actual weapons sales to the Taliban or Al Qaeda, the U.S. government became convinced that Bout was at least servicing the planes -- enough to make him an Al Qaeda accomplice. "What we saw led us to think that Bout had something to do with terrorism," Lee Wolosky told me. "It was handled by the part of the White House associated with terrorism. There were enough indicators that set off alarm bells. The U.S. government decided to act on that basis."
The question was, act how? The U.S. government had no legal architecture to fight an arms network that operated across international borders in the political twilight. "Big arms are the province of individual countries," Jonathan Winer said. "But no country is configured to deal with it because its jurisdiction stops at the border."
Said Lee S. Wolosky, the former director of transnational threats at the N.S.C.: "Bout represented a post-cold-war phenomenon for which there was no framework to stop. No one was doing what he was doing. And there was no response. We needed to build a response."
The N.S.C. consulted with officials in the British, South African and Belgian governments to find a way to shut Bout down and apprehend him. Intelligence agents tracked Bout's planes from Sharjah. Arms shipments were interdicted at airfields in Moldova, Slovakia and Uganda. Officials from the United Arab Emirates offered to capture Bout in Sharjah and hand him over to U.S. officials. At one point, an elite detachment was in place to make the arrest. 
With Bout now under close surveillance, however, the White House made the last-minute call to pursue a classic narc strategy instead. It wanted to wait to see if Bout could take them higher up the arms-trafficking food chain.
In February 2001, the U.S. government sent a delegation to Brussels to ask prosecutors there to cooperate with their operation against Bout. The Belgians refused without explanation. Within a week of the meeting, the head of the U.S. delegation learned that Bout knew about the meeting. (Belgium did issue a warrant against Bout in February 2002, for money laundering in connection with diamonds. Bout was in Sharjah at the time, but fled to Russia before he could be apprehended.)
According to Clinton administration N.S.C. officials, from its first days the Bush administration didn't see transnational crime as a national-security issue, and it didn't share their fixation on Victor Bout. Condoleezza Rice instructed the N.S.C. to work the Bout problem diplomatically. "Look but don't touch" is how one former White House official put it to me. 
After Sept. 11, Rice called off the Bout operation altogether. Moscow was not to be pressured on arms trafficking in general and Victor Bout in particular. The reasoning, according to a source who talked to Rice, was that they had "bigger fish to fry." (Rice refused to comment for this article.) 
My last night in Moscow, Bout drove me to a restaurant outside the city that specializes in wild game. He ordered a dish of roasted vegetables. After days of discussing his life's work and the charges against him, he appeared relaxed, as though he felt he had sufficiently justified himself and set the record straight. He had done neither, or course, but he seemed relieved to have talked. After a few vodkas, he turned philosophical. "It's easy to make war, to play the political game," he mused. "But to be at peace within yourself. . . ." 
After dinner, we drove down a dirt track into the woods to a walled compound. Inside was an expensive private club for banya, the traditional Russian sauna. Bout told me that when Russian men negotiate or prepare for difficult conversations, they share a banya. They are naked, and after the heat, they are defenseless and cannot hide anything. "If you don't have a good marriage or you want that kind of thing, then you can have the girl upstairs," he added.
Inside the hot box it was 170 degrees. A man in a towel pounded Bout and me with eucalyptus leaves. Then we submerged in an icy dunking pool. We repeated the cycle twice more. Afterward, we sat on a couch, and he talked about literature and his admiration of the Pygmies. He spoke of Massoud, his brilliance and dependability. But he also thought Massoud was naive, and this was why he was dead. There was a television suspended in a corner showing a wildlife channel. We sat for an hour, watching animals in the African veldt hunting and devouring one another.
Sitting there naked except for a narrow strip of towel, Bout seemed the personification not of the world community's inability to stop him but of its reluctance. Bout the trafficker seemed diminished in comparison to the larger hidden system. If he was indeed the public face of arms trafficking and if he couldn't be caught, or stopped, what, I wondered, does this say about the mammoth volume of amoral transport around the world, and the huge profits at stake for individuals and governments alike? 
I remembered something Richard Chichakli had said that morning: "Victor is the most politically connected person you have ever seen, but he's not here to change the world."

HEADLINE: Lost in the Music 

BYLINE:  By Stephen Rodrick; Stephen Rodrick is a frequent contributor to the magazine. He last wrote about Dennis Rodman.

 BODY:
A few moments before his regular Friday-night show at Largo, a club in Los Angeles, Jon Brion tries to conjure a catchy name for the music he loves. As a producer, Brion has collaborated with Fiona Apple, Aimee Mann and Rufus Wainwright, constructing eccentric albums that evoke the Beatles, Aaron Copland and a pawnshop band. "If it had a label, it could help," Brion says. He is almost 40, mop-toppish and currently without a permanent address. "Look what 'alt-country' did for Lucinda Williams and Wilco." Sipping a Guinness, Brion comes up with one. "How about 'unpopular pop'?" he asks. He takes another sip of his beer and turns glum. "God, that's too depressing."
 Unpopular pop is a new name but not a new genre. Even when Motown and the Beatles ruled the charts, perfect pop songs -- defined by liner-note-reading geeks as intricate rhymed verse accompanied by a melody that emotionally underscores the words -- often didn't match the sales of, say, "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy." The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds" took 34 years to go platinum. Big Star, the most influential unpopular pop band in America, couldn't get its records distributed. Except for the novelty hits "Short People" and "I Love L.A.," Randy Newman, lauded as one of the country's treasured songwriters, released a half-dozen "pop" albums in the 60's and 70's that barely earned back their advances. 
 Like Newman, Brion comes from a family of musicians who share a reverential appreciation for Americana music. His songs evoke images of a bygone era: a carnival organ on one track, a melancholy woodwind section on another. And like Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Brion has a savantlike ability to process melodies and turn them inside out. Sam Jones, who directed the Wilco documentary "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart," and is raising money for a Brion film, plays a musical game with Brion. He leaves a stretch of music by Glenn Gould on Brion's answering machine. Brion calls right back playing the piece note for note. It is talent like this that has helped make Brion a Phil Spector of unpopular pop.
Occasionally, like Newman, Wilson or Big Star's Alex Chilton, Brion has managed to make popular pop. Using a screwdriver instead of a slide, Brion created the distorted guitar lead on the Wallflowers' "One Headlight," a single that propelled the band to multiplatinum success in 1997. The session lasted less than an hour, and Brion nailed it on the first take. Normally, he declines lengthier commercial commitments. His manager fields calls from industry heavyweights like Clive Davis requesting Brion to produce his latest ingenue. Brion always says no.
"If the songs aren't great, I can't do it," Brion explains. "I live with these songs. They're moving through my head constantly, even when I don't want them to. If they're bad, I'm throwing myself out a window after 48 hours."
Recording studios are dreary places: bunkers filled with wires, smudged glass partitions and ashtrays. The Paramour, where Brion is at work, is not like that. Nestled in the Los Angeles hills, the grounds resemble Norma Desmond's spread. There is an ominous iron gate, an ancient lap pool illuminated by torches at night and a garishly decorated ballroom.
Down one dark hallway, music can be heard. There are red walls, a fireplace, a Scrabble board and left-over Cuban pastries gnawed by Charlie, the Paramour's half-wolf, half-German shepherd. A Hawaiian guitar rests against some Chinese gongs. In front of a Beatles-era E.M.I. console, an Apple computer displays a screen saver of David Bowie, Brian Eno and Robert Fripp at Bowie's "Low" sessions. 
It's 1 p.m., and Jon Brion is still in his pajamas and slippers. For the past three months, Brion, Tom Biller, an engineer, and the singer Fiona Apple have been living at the Paramour. Right now, Brion is noodling at a Casio keyboard, playing along to a mix of Apple's "Oh Well." "I cried the first time I heard her play this," Brion says. "We were at Ocean Way, Sinatra's old studio, and I just put my head down on the table and cried."
As "Oh Well" plays repeatedly, Brion tries to conceive an arrangement that won't disturb the power of Apple's vocals. He says he thinks her delivery on the current version might be too slow for the anger of the words. To help, Brion has written out the lyrics in color-coded fashion on two giant pieces of white paper. Blue represents sad passages, red anger and green the resignation of Apple's whispering "Oh, well" in the last line. 
"There's a space between this line and that line, and it's this continual sort of push and pull," Brion says. "If she's not singing, I offer something to carry the listener through to the next moment where she returns."
Apple's first release, fueled by her ethereal vocals and a video with her in her underwear, sold three million copies. Brion played on it, and they became close friends. After a rambling acceptance speech at the MTV awards, Apple absorbed a media assault. In 1999, she recorded the follow-up, "When the Pawn . . . " -- the full title stretches to 90 words -- which Brion produced and played most of the instruments on. It featured a hybrid of hip-hop beats and Brion's skewed instrumentation. Like most Brion-produced projects, it was hailed by critics. And like most Brion-produced projects, it was a commercial disappointment, selling fewer than a million copies.
Apple contemplated never recording another album. Then, in the spring of 2002, Brion and Apple met for their weekly lunch. Brion had recently been ejected from a five-year relationship with the comedian Mary Lynn Rajskub. Making matters worse, the breakup occurred while he was scoring Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love." Rajskub had a large role in the film, and Brion spent hours watching his ex on celluloid. Now finished with the score, he was at loose ends.
"Please, please make another album," Brion begged Apple. "I need work that can save me."
Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, Sony Music, with strict stipulations. There would be no deadline. If a Sony rep wanted to check on progress, he would have to fly to Los Angeles. Brion requested renting a wing of the Paramour rather than recording at a conventional studio. The label agreed.
In an era of industry bloodletting, Sony's acquiescence to Brion's demands demonstrates how highly respected Brion is in the industry. In addition to his production work, Brion scored Anderson's last two films, "Magnolia" (for which he also produced some of Aimee Mann's career-making tracks) and "Punch-Drunk Love." For the latter, he helped the filmmaker in unusual ways. In an early scene, Anderson was having difficulty communicating the emotion he wanted Adam Sandler to bring to his role. He asked Brion to come down to the set. The next morning, Brion returned with a 10-minute percussion track that captured the manic anger of Barry Egan, Sandler's character. Anderson had his star listen to the track repeatedly through headphones. Sandler got it, and filming resumed.
At the Paramour, the days effortlessly merge like the unchanging Southern California weather. Nine months after Apple played the first five songs for Brion, the album is maybe half-done. In the morning, Brion draws or works on his own songs. In the afternoon, he fiddles with backing tracks. Maybe around midnight, Apple will appear in sweats and bunny-rabbit slippers and record vocals for an hour. 
"Jon's put in hundreds of more hours," Apple said one sunny afternoon on the lawn. "If I could, I'd release this as a Jon Brion-Fiona Apple record. I keep borrowing his socks. He thinks it's because I don't have my own socks. It's because I want to be Jon Brion."
Brion is contemplating the abandonment of all his ancillary projects so he can concentrate on his own material. Which is either brave or quixotic. Brion's only solo record was rejected by an Atlantic Records subsidiary and sold just a few thousand copies. Still, songs he has written with Mann, Evan Dando and Eels are the equal to anything they've done on their own. Every Friday night, Brion plays a sold-out show at Largo, whose guests vary from Rickie Lee Jones to Pink. He mixes Kinks and Costello songs with his own compositions. Regular attendees argue that Brion's songs compare favorably.
"Jon has at least 10 albums' worth of material," says Mann, a longtime collaborator and a former girlfriend. "He blends the mood of the melody and the mood of the words in a way that no one else can do." She sighs. "And he writes them so quickly."
And yet Brion has released only one new song in the past four years, a track called "Here We Go," a wedding song for a second marriage, on the "Punch-Drunk Love" soundtrack. If the song hadn't been dropped from the film, it might have earned an Academy Award nomination. "Why finish a song when you can start a new one?" Brion says with a laugh. "I picked the hardest art form with the least amount of respect. The economy of language you need to get emotion across is so hard. You have to find rhymed verse, then match it with a melody. And then it's dismissed just as 'a pop song.' It is so sad." 
Brion can't let go of his songs. Or the songs of his disciples. For more than a week, Brion toyed with Apple's "Oh Well." He spent one night moving equipment to his study at the Paramour to record a guitar part. "The acoustics will pick up the reverb differently," he explains. The next day, Brion discarded the guitar. Then he laid down another basic track with himself on drums. He wasn't happy with the result. "It sounded like a metal ballad," Brion says. "I fired myself." A call was placed to the legendary session drummer Jim Keltner. 
"The song is missing 'it,"' Brion says. "Right now, I don't know what 'it' is. When you find it, everyone's physiology in the room changes. 'It' is a real, ephemeral thing."
It's not uncommon to hear "it" on a Jon Brion-produced song many years after buying the album. More than a decade has passed since I first listened to Aimee Mann's "I've Had It," from her 1993 album, "Whatever," Brion's first major production. The subject of the song, as is often the case with Mann, is the music industry. The troops gather for a pointless New York gig as Mann muses that her chance at the brass ring may have passed. On perhaps the 400th listen, I pick up a ticking clock that moves from left to right in your headphones and underscores the fatalism of the lyrics. When Mann sings "And Dan came in from Jersey," Brion plays the opening bars to Springsteen's "Born to Run" on a glockenspiel. 
When he was 5, Brion wrote "I am Jon Brion. I am a musician" on a piece of paper. A few years later, his mother, LaRue, a club singer while in college, bought him his first Fats Waller record. Brion's father, Keith, was director of Yale University's concert and marching bands, and his parents introduced their son at age 13 to the jazz musicians Willie Ruff and Dwike Mitchell, who were known equally for their playing and for their jazz evangelism tours to China and Russia. 
As he grew older, Brion refused to do any schoolwork other than music. The school district placed him in special-education classes with mildly retarded and emotionally disturbed teenagers. "I was in with a kid who had seen both her parents killed in front of her," Brion recalls. On Brion's 17th birthday, his father signed the release papers, and Brion dropped out of high school.
At a recent Largo show, Brion began by laying down a drum track and looping it. He did the same with a jaunty piano part. He then picked up an electric guitar. He closed his eyes and resembled the kid from "Tommy" as he played a crunchy guitar part. Finally, he performed "I Was Happy With You," a new song, picking through a melody that captures the post-anger wistful stage of heartbreak.
The next day, Brion told me that he has written a dozen new songs about his breakup. "I'm trying to approach them from a realistic point of view," he said. "I want songs that suggest, O.K., maybe it was 60 percent your fault, but I was there, too. Those songs aren't being written." 
Another day, I heard "Citgo Sign," which was recorded in 1991 and would not be out of place in a musical. "That may be my best album's worth of material," Brion said. He also has notions of turning a batch of songs written since 1995 into "an Internet-only EP." When I mentioned this to Mark Flanagan, his manager, he laughed: "You realize, that's not going to happen."
Brion's inability to release his own songs is a hushed subject of conversation among his friends and musicians. When I asked Mann, she began: "I think he has a hard time saying anything is finished whether he's producing or doing his own songs. Jon's a perfectionist." She hesitated and stopped. "I'm not going to say any more."
Part of Brion's procrastination is an inability to say no. "Whenever I get a message from another musician, I know it's because they want something," Brion says. "They want me to play on a track or produce. It's never just to say hi." 
His point was made when Grant Lee Phillips stopped by the Paramour for advice on his next album. They talked for an hour, and Brion grew increasingly animated. "You must have a great drummer -- he captures the mood of the song," Brion advised. "You have a bad drummer, you're going to be spending days trying to find that mood." Then, Phillips sheepishly asked, "Hey, do you want to captain this ship?" Brion said yes (though Phillips later proceeded without him). 
"There's a thing called a heat sink," Brion says. "It's a piece of metal attached to a machine. It draws heat away and keeps it from blowing up. That's what I do as a producer. It's up to me to let the artist know things are O.K. I'm the one who has to go home with the stomachache."
Brion plays the role well. Last year, while he was producing an album for an alt-country songwriter named Rhett Miller, a real-estate agent showed up at the studio. He needed a signature finalizing the sale of the house Brion and Rajskub jointly owned. Brion excused himself, went to the bathroom and cried. Five minutes later, he was singing backing vocals on one of Miller's love songs.
Sessions with Rufus Wainwright, a talented and flamboyant piano pop singer, were turbulent. It was only the pleading of DreamWorks Records' co-chairman Lenny Waronker that kept Brion from leaving. "Rufus had all these beautiful songs, but every time the vocals would kick in, he'd write some complicated keyboard part so you couldn't hear them," Brion says. "He wasn't interested in listening to ideas about simplifying the arrangement." 
In 2000, Brion collaborated with David Byrne. Those who heard the Brion-produced songs said they were the best Byrne had done since the Talking Heads. Byrne rejected them by fax. 
I ask Brion if he has considered hiring a producer for his own work. He answers in a sad voice. "I don't have a heat sink for myself," he says. "I don't have anyone who can tell me, 'This is good, this is a great song, let it go.' With my songs, I go home with the stomachache."
A month later, I met up with Brion at Abbey Road Studios in London, where he was recording orchestration for Apple. He was exhausted from testing every microphone in its storied collection, cataloguing each of their shortcomings. "If I reach a point where I want a voice to sound a little fuzzy, I'll know which microphone to use," Brion said. 
In Studio 2, Brion sat behind an old piano and doodled a section from "Here We Go," which was recorded there. "I just had the major chords, and I knew I wanted to write a song that said, Even though my heart had just been broken, I'm not going to be cynical about love," Brion said. I remarked that the piano sounded like the one from "Fool on the Hill." His eyes lighted up. "Because it is!" he said. 
The next day, a full orchestra arrived, with "Oh Well" first up. Brion had Apple do another vocal take on which she almost growled the lyrics. He asked the violinist, Eric Gorfain, to add an arrangement. After listening to a rough mix, he offered only a little criticism. "Don't place too much activity around her voice," Brion said. "There's nice tension in the second verse, but tension is activity that draws away from her voice, so we have to lose it."
The next day, Brion led the orchestra through "Oh Well" for two hours. Midway through, Apple arrived. Painfully shy, she sat on the floor, covering her eyes and peeking through fingers as Brion conducted. Eyes closed, he entered a blissful state. When the music stopped, he flashed a beatific grin. "I don't think I have ever seen a human being look happier," Apple said.
Later that night, Brion, trying to relax with a beer, was still frustrated with the song. "I can't figure it out," he said. "It just isn't all there. Every album has a problem child. Maybe I want it to be a lawyer, when it wants to be a painter."
Eventually, Apple's release date was pushed back from September to February. If that date holds, it will be 20 months from the time Apple played the first songs for Brion, or roughly 60 days per song. A month after the Abbey Road session, Brion told me he was done producing for the foreseeable future and will concentrate on his own songs. He even bought a powder blue van for touring. Of course, this means that songs will have to be released. For three months, Brion promised to send me demos of his new songs. They never arrived. In a final effort, I made an impromptu trip to Los Angeles. At Largo, Brion handed me a CD of seven demos. He looked miserable. The next day, I told him how much I liked them. He still seemed morose. "When the album comes out, these songs are going to be ruined for you," Brion said. "You're not going to be able to really hear the final versions." He grinned. "If there ever are final versions."

HEADLINE: FOOD; 
Dog Days

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Reynolds

 BODY:
Back in the day, an expression that according to my son can mean either last week or the moment in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the cathedral door and began the Reformation but that in this case refers to the mid-1950's, hamburgers had underground cachet. The elite never admitted to eating them, but everybody cool did, from Jughead (America's first slacker) in the Archie comics to Kerouac and Cassady. Hot dogs were nowheresville, eaten only by baseball umpires. In the semi-holy war of hamburgers versus hot dogs, you could choose your friends by their preference: burgers were for winners, dogs were for also-rans. 
 Yankee fans ate burgers (though not at the stadium), Dodger fans ate hot dogs. In those days, Brooklyn was a barometer of the low-rent and got the same laughs in Jack Paar's monologues as Burbank does in Jay Leno's today. The cool also preferred Mickey Mouse to Donald Duck, who was too often incomprehensible. 
 Boy, have things changed. Now Brooklyn is cool, possibly cooler than Manhattan (certainly cooler than Burbank), and it's clear that the Duck was always more cerebral than the Mouse. Today, the truly hip would rather get a hot dog from a cart outside Tiffany's or head to Gray's Papaya for the Recession Special (two dogs and a baffling plastic drink like pina colada or coconut champagne for $2.45) than wrestle the throngs of the attitudinal at the Corner Bistro. (The Recession at Gray's Papaya has lasted more than 15 years.)
If, as my friend the novelist and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias says, movies were ruinedthe moment they began being studied in college, the same may be said of burgers. Too much attention has made them narcissistic and self-referential. Worse, people keep trying to improve them by grinding up sirloin or even filet mignon, when everyone knows the best are made with chuck. Most ludicrous has been the combat between Daniel Boulud and the Old Homestead to dethrone the "21" Club's claim of the most expensive burger in town. Back in the day (a different day, or a different back) the burger at "21" used to run you $21, and you paid it because it was outrageous and you liked the place (and the burger was great). But a couple of years ago, Boulud, at his DB Bistro Moderne, created a tower of ground meat and charged $27 for it because it included foie gras. Much press was made of this, though neither the burger nor the foie was improved. Old H trumped it with its tarted-up Kobe beef burger and charged $41; then DB retaliated with a foie-gras-AND-truffle-shavings burger costing $50. OH has yet to retaliate with a blowfish burger, but God bless its marketing ingenuity (the slab is a huge hit). But the whole point of Kobe beef is its tenderness, not its flavor, and all burgers -- even the ones made with $1.59 beef -- are tender because they are ground. 
Hot dogs don't put up with this sort of thing. For one thing, it's almost impossible to get a bad one in this city unless you go to Yankee or Shea Stadium (Shea's sleepy, flabby dog confirms the ballpark's position as purveyor of the worst food in the world), and you can get bad hamburgers anywhere. There is no such thing as a gourmet hot dog, and there shouldn't be. They are a thick, phallic crescent of chopped up but indescribable pig or cow parts, salty and delicious, at their best with a sturdy natural casing for a sheath and a soft, processed center. You do not want to know what's in them. Only know that if they're very pink, they probably contain saltpeter.
Although technically a member of the Bruhwurst family and originating in or around Frankfurt, Germany, in the mid-17th century (hence the official name, "frankfurter"), the first hot dogs were made with pork and bacon. A variation was then brought to Vienna (hence the name "weiner") by a wily butcher in 1904, but the dog was ultimately refined (or de-refined) at Coney Island by Nathan Handwerker in 1916 (hence the name "Nathan's"). Because of its resemblance to a dachshund, it became known as the hot dog. I don't know where the name Hebrew National came from, but it has a great ad campaign. 
To qualify as a genuine hot dog, the crescent must be smoked or boiled or in some way precooked before it is again boiled or grilled or fried or baked or nuked. In short, you can prepare hot dogs just about any way thus far invented, even with a Zippo. You just can't ruin them except by overcooking or serving them with jam or by too much bread or topping. The best, I think, are grilled till brown, but even if the skin turns black, the burn can't kill the flavor and sometimes adds to it. And boiling, which diminishes just about any meat dish except pot-au-feu, doesn't harm the dog's salty, meaty, cushy pleasures in the least.
Of course, equally important participants are the bread on which the dog is served and the myriad relishes, sauces and goos you choose to put on them. I prefer lightly grilled and buttered buns right out of the supermarket bag, but I've also had steamed or heated bread and appreciate how it doesn't fight the beast. More exotic breads and rolls can work, too, like Daniel Boulud's homemade buns. He is just as much a hot dog enthusiast as a burger man, and a photo of him brandishing a dog adorns the cover of his book, "Cooking in New York City." 
As for toppings, all sorts of mustards and cheeses and sauerkrauts and relishes and onion concoctions abound. Although the "Chicago" and "New York" smorgasbords being sold this summer in Madison Square Park overwhelm the meat, one of the most interesting toppings is the crisp dried onion served on grillpolses, the Norwegian cheese-filled and bacon-wrapped hot dog -- which should be imported here not only because it's a paradigmatic frank, but also because it's the best food the country has to offer. And a superb sauerkraut from La Coupole in Paris actually improves the weiner instead of camouflaging it. 
Alas, the marketeers must keep busy. The Old Homestead, heady with its Kobe hamburger success, has made an enormous Kobe beef hot dog that is a winner -- a much better hot dog than the Kobe beef hamburger is a hamburger -- but again, the Kobe beef has nothing to do with it. The other meat parts and seasonings easily overwhelm it, the way Sichuan chili sauce would boiled cod. At $19, you are helping to pay the rent, and there's nothing wrong with that. The thing measures a foot long and is wonderful, but it would be just as wonderful without the Kobe and twice as wonderful at half the price. 
I've pretty much given up on burgers outside of "21," a few tiny places in Manhattan, Taylor's Refresher just outside of Napa and a lunch-only cafe in L.A. called Cassell's. And I wouldn't go near one outside this country. The French, Germans, Belgians, Canadians, Mexicans and Myanmars can't make a hamburger any better than they can a martini, despite hours of kindly instruction -- and that was before the war in Iraq, when they were still on our side. But every one of those countries has an admirable hot dog. In Berlin, where I couldn't find a decent meal in a month, the street bratwurst is brilliant. I'm not actually sure about the Myanmars, but I bet theirs isn't highfalutin, either. And my, how Martin Luther loved his little dachshunds.

Choucroute-Style Sauerkraut
(Adapted from La Coupole, Paris)
5 pounds green cabbage (about 2 large heads)
1/2 bottle (about 1 3/4 cups) Riesling
3 slices bacon, coarsely chopped
1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste
14 juniper berries
1 ounce fatback, finely diced
1 large onion, thinly sliced.
1. Quarter the cabbage heads, cut out and discard the tough cores and rinse the cabbage well. Cut into thin wedges and combine in a large pot with the Riesling, bacon, coriander, peppercorns, white pepper, salt and 10 juniper berries. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring very occasionally.
2. Meanwhile, heat the fatback in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until you have about a tablespoon or more of fat. Add the onion and remaining juniper berries. Cover and cook until onions are almost completely melted, 30 to 40 minutes. Add onions to the cabbage and continue cooking.
3. When the cabbage is extremely soft, remove it from the heat, allow to cool slightly, then season to taste with more salt and white pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature, preferably with a zesty mustard.
Yield: About 7 cups, enough for a lot of hot dogs.

Hot Dog Buns
(Adapted from Daniel Boulud's "Daniel's Dish")
1 package active dry yeast
3 1/3 cups bread flour, plus more as needed
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup milk, at room temperature
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon plus one pinch salt
1 large egg
1 tablespoon heavy cream.
1. Stir together the yeast and 1/4 cup lukewarm (105 degrees to 115 degrees) water in a small bowl; let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour, sugar, 1 cup lukewarm water, milk, butter, 1 tablespoon salt and the yeast mixture in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low until the dough comes together, about 3 minutes.
2. Increase speed to high and mix for 8 minutes. Stop the mixer, wet your fingers and pull off a small piece: it should be shiny, elastic and smooth and not break apart. If it is not elastic enough, mix for a few more minutes; if too wet, add a little more flour.
3. Transfer dough to a floured baking sheet, cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
4. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut dough into 12 equal pieces (each weighing approximately 2 3/4 ounces). On a lightly floured work surface, using the edge of your hand, roll each piece of dough firmly in a circular motion, curling your fingers to create a mold. The dough should pop up into your palm, having formed a tight, smooth skin. Cover balls with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes. 
5. Using your palms, roll each ball out to sausage shape about 5 inches long. Transfer to the prepared pans, leaving a few inches between each. Cover buns with a damp towel and let rise until almost doubled in volume, 1 to 3 hours. 
6. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Whisk together the egg, heavy cream and pinch of salt. Very gently brush the top of each bun with the egg wash. Bake until buns are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool, then slice.
Yield: 12 hot dog buns.

HEADLINE: The Probability That a Real-Estate Agent Is Cheating You 

 BODY:
 Stephen J. Dubner's fine article (Aug. 3) highlighted a maxim in Steven Levitt's work: when the right question is asked, it has more power than the answer. A prime example is Levitt's linking of the drop in crime to the rise in abortion. For years, while working in prisons, I have noticed the unusually high percentage of men and women inmates who never knew who their fathers were and sometimes not even their mothers. All they knew was that they were unwanted. I doubt that this has ever been documented in the corrections field, but it is time that human services and corrections agencies begin to collaborate more closely. The path of unwanted children can all too often lead to the jailhouse.

HEADLINE: THEWAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-17-03: THE ETHICIST; 
Don't Go There

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
My fiancee is eager to visit the Galapagos Islands, but I've read that tourism can damage this ecologically sensitive area. It can also have questionable economic effects, increasing the number of local people who serve tourists at hotels and restaurants and such. She disagrees, countering that tourism gives locals incentives to protect the environment. What is an ethical tourist to do? Anthony Wahl, New York
 There are really two issues here -- tourism's environmental effects on local tortoises and its economic effects on local humans. If you believe that visiting the Galapagos will damage an ecologically sensitive area, then you've resolved the first issue: you can't go. Fortunately, much has been written on this subject, so that when you and your girlfriend debate the matter, you'll each be able to arm yourselves with impressively fat dossiers. 
 As to the second matter, the humans, well, some people share your belief that a tourist economy is a dreadful thing and locks residents into low-wage service jobs. Others believe that a properly managed tourist economy is benign. Many people in Las Vegas, for example, are delighted with their town, citing the success of recent unionization drives in gaining good pay and benefits for service workers. (And, until recently, frequent opportunities to get a glimpse of William Bennett.) This is a matter on which honorable people can differ, and one way you can resolve it is to heed the wishes of local folks. That is, if there were a continuing boycott or other organized effort to resist a tourist economy, you should honor its strictures. However, if local people embrace tourism's economics, you are free to grab the first plane south.
What makes your decision difficult are the uncertain effects of your actions. 
It's tough being a consequentialist (doing cost-benefit ethics) when the consequences are unpredictable. Too many tourists might damage the Galapagos; too few might mire it in poverty, prey to more devastating development schemes. (I'm no ecologist, but I suspect that turning the isles into a bombing range, for instance, even with a Starbucks, could harm its flora and fauna.) But while such a judgment is imprecise, it is necessary. Hence an ethical obligation not to be a knucklehead. 
You must -- as you have -- learn enough to make an educated decision.
I am the sole proprietor of a carryout and catering business. Occasionally my brother, who lives in another city, will give one of our business cards to acquaintances who may be visiting my city and scribble a 10 percent "family discount" on the back to encourage folks to try my place. Recently a woman contracted us to cater a $13,000-plus event and mentioned that she had one of these cards. What is my obligation? John Snedden, Washington
I'm not sure of your legal obligations -- for that you'd have to consult a lawyer -- but in some jurisdictions a merchant must honor any price he or his agent posts.
As an ethical matter, you should tell this woman that your brother erred, that these discounts were meant only for individual carryout orders, not catered affairs. And you should tell her promptly, so she has a chance to make other arrangements. In ethics, intent counts, and neither you nor your brother meant to run the old bait-and-switch. What's more, ethics must allow for the possibility of foul-ups and relatives. But do warn your brother to alter the wording of his hastily scrawled discount offers to avoid any such blunders in the future.
One bright spot: you can look forward to a lifetime of joy teasing your brother at family functions, and you can't put a price on that.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-17-03; 
Help Wanted

BYLINE:  By Walter Kirn; Walter Kirn is the author, most recently, of "Up in the Air," a novel.

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago the secretaries of commerce, labor and the treasury took a two-day bus trip through the Midwest to talk up their boss's economic policies and confront, as sensitively as possible, the festering unemployment issue that may prove decisive in choosing the next president. Given that the current jobless rate hovers a little above 6 percent (a good 2 points higher than when Bush took office), the cabinet members' choice of transportation was a thoughtful touch. If the jobless rate were much higher -- say, 8 or 9 percent -- old bicycles would have been more appropriate, or maybe even a walking tour, but as things stand motor coaches were just right, evoking a nation that's still on the move but just not quite as quickly as it might be. 
 Like the Democratic presidential hopefuls who've also been talking nonstop about unemployment, the road-tripping cabinet members all agreed about the solution to joblessness: more jobs. Much as happiness is the solution to depression and tallness the remedy for shortness, this answer makes sense on the surface, if not beneath it. The only dispute among the politicians is over how to get these extra jobs: through plucky, old-fashioned economic growth (the Republican way) or by fetching the jobs back from China and India, where American industry has been sending them (the populist Democratic way). Both methods promise the same result, of course: a drop in the jobless rate of a couple points or so to a level we needn't fret so much about -- never mind that for people out of work, unemployment is always 100 percent, while for people who do have work it's zero, even if only three of them remain. 
 This talk about jobs as the be-all and end-all of American economic welfare has a fundamental limitation, though: except for certain hardcore puritans, it isn't jobs that people want; it's money. In the summer of 1978, when I was 16 and starting my working life, my goal was not to find a job at all, but to own a tricked-out Camaro with custom chrome wheels. Short of devising a surefire blackjack system, the only practical way to reach this dream was to take paid employment. The job I landed, pumping gas, was not only tedious, it turned out, but also, as self-service stations have proved, unnecessary in the scheme of things.
I hate to seem cold, but as far as I'm concerned, there are plenty of jobs that foreigners can have. Assembling Happy Meal toys, for starters. Filling snow globes with whatever that clear liquid is. For a while, that was the major type of work they did over there, and no one I know appeared to miss it much -- if it ever even existed in America. Cheap overseas labor has created products that costly labor would never have bothered with -- those flexible phosphorescent light sticks, say. Those jobs weren't stolen but invented.
But when Asians start doing our good jobs, it's another story. According to company executives, I.B.M. is considering shifting white-collar positions to India, where a competent novice computer programmer costs $5,000 a year instead of $60,000. Such a move would help keep the firm competitive and mean lower prices for consumers. But which consumers, you might ask. Laid-off I.B.M. managers? I wish the candidates would address this paradox instead of recycling rah-rah capitalist nostrums and nostalgic tariff schemes: at what point does remaining competitive dry up and dissipate the disposable incomes being competed for?
Such troublesome macroeconomic conundrums as how China's gains can't, in some sense, be our losses -- at least in the short term and to a degree -- are just what the politicians are avoiding by talking asininely about "jobs" when they ought to be talking about wealth, which is the only reason people take jobs other than to get away from nagging spouses. Sure, someday globalism and free trade may lift all boats equally, and to the heavens, but until our economies reach that blessed point of exalted, utopian equilibrium, isn't it true that more goodies in others' stockings naturally calls for fewer goodies in ours? No one will ever get elected for saying so, but don't tides go out before they rise again?
Maybe a redefinition of "work" is called for so that the term will no longer refer to making things (or to manipulating symbols) but only to buying and using them up -- tasks we still excel at. Maybe Americans should be paid consumers, retained by China to absorb the output of the factories that closed here and opened there but won't be able to stay in operation unless the American workers who got canned can purchase the things they no longer get paid to make. How about a Marshall Plan for Cleveland financed by Beijing?
If the work that remains when the money washes away mostly involves swabbing toilets at Dunkin' Donuts, even full employment will be no blessing. Yet the mantra never changes: more jobs, more jobs. But what jobs, and paid for out of whose accounts? Bailing water from a sinking ship is a job that could keep us all busy for years to come, but will it help buy that Camaro I still want?

HEADLINE: FILM; 
For Chaplin, This Is Just the Latest Of Modern Times

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
IT is time again to talk of Charles Spencer Chaplin, as it is every decade or so when the group of Chaplin films owned by his estate return to distribution. In the early 1970's, the occasion was the return of Chaplin's major features to American movie theaters, after he had withdrawn them in bitterness over his political persecution by the United States government in the 1950's for suspected Communist leanings. In the 1980's, CBS-Fox released the films on VHS and Laserdisc. And now, a first group of four Chaplin features -- "The Gold Rush" (1925), "Modern Times" (1936), "The Great Dictator" (1940) and "Limelight" (1952) -- has been issued on DVD by Warner Home Video in magnificently restored versions produced by the current license holder of the films, the French company MK2. 
 Each time the Chaplin films reappear, they encounter a new generation of filmgoers, by now quite distant from the original audiences who made Chaplin's Little Tramp perhaps the most famous figure in the world in the 1910's and 1920's. (His early one- and two-reelers are in the public domain and are available in a number of video versions that vary widely in quality.) For the general public of 2003, Chaplin's image is probably more familiar from its use in a series of IBM commercials than from any of his own work. 
 Does Chaplin still matter? For anyone concerned with the art of the movies, the answer must be yes. Certainly, some of the content of these films has dated. Chaplin was himself a product of the late Victorian era, born in 1889 into Dickensian squalor (his father was an alcoholic music hall entertainer, his mother was confined to an asylum). And the reference points in many of his movies -- orphanages, workhouses, impossibly innocent heroines and moustache-twirling heavies -- must have seemed even to the audience of the 1910's like relics of Victorian stage melodrama. 
But Chaplin's themes are timeless and universal. The "Modern Times" DVD includes, among a wealth of other extras, an interview with the Belgian filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, whose own socially engaged cinema finds many intersections with Chaplin's. As the Dardenne brothers point out, the essential crisis facing the tramp is to find something to eat and someplace to sleep, a topic that continues to be of the most immediate concern to a large and growing portion of the world's population. Chaplin's ultimate subject is both the survival of an individual in a vast, uncaring social and economic system and the survival of a human spark -- of invention and revolt -- within a mechanized mass culture.
"Modern Times," Chaplin's most overtly political film, is one of only a handful of movies from the Depression years to cast the nation's economic woes as the outgrowth of class divisions; one of the few to raise the specter of Communism (albeit comically, in a sequence in which the tramp finds himself leading a strike march when he accidentally picks up a red flag); and perhaps the only one to show policemen as thuggish enforcers for big capital.Only Chaplin's special position in Hollywood -- he owned his own studio, financed his own films and released them through a distribution company, United Artists, which he helped found -- allowed him to handle such touchy subjects, and allowed him, as well, to include sexual and scatological jokes that would not have passed most studio censors. 
Chaplin was also powerful enough to resist the talkie revolution of 1927, releasing both "City Lights" (1931) and "Modern Times" (1936) essentially as silent films accompanied by music, sound effects and a few snatches of dialogue.
But by going back in time, Chaplin could also seem strikingly modern. In the 20's and 30's, when Hollywood had perfected the techniques of invisible editing and seamless narrative structure, Chaplin continued to insist on conspicuous camera movements, emphatic editing and a distinctive, episodic structure that rendered his work not so much a smooth succession of scenes flawlessly melded together as a succession of more or less self-contained segments. 
"Modern Times," for example, can be divided into a series of all-but-independent short subjects -- "Charlie and the Assembly Line," "Charlie in Jail," "Charlie the Night Watchman," "Charlie the Singing Waiter" and so on. For a few Chaplin bashers (including Pauline Kael), this was proof of his inability to transcend the format of his early one- and two-reelers. But the format is also that of the English music hall tradition into which Chaplin was born (and which he entered professionally at the age of 8). Here is the succession of acts, mixed and matched with the skill of an impresario: a slapstick comedy routine, followed by a romantic interlude, a musical number, a comic character sketch, a dance routine and a bit of old-fashioned melodrama.
Even Chaplin's most bombastic film, "The Great Dictator," finds room for everything from lowbrow slapstick (storm troopers banged on the head with frying pans) to a dance sequence. The storytelling stops cold for five minutes while Chaplin's Hitleresque dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, performs an elegant, lyrical solo with a balloon painted to resemble a globe, a moment of pure grace that would not seem out of place at the ballet. 
A wholly self-educated man, Chaplin instinctively resisted the literary models that the Hollywood studios forced more and more on movies in the 20's and the 30's, and arrived at an alternative structure that bore more than a passing (though probably coincidental) relationship to Brecht's epic theater, a form that emphasized its own artifice, that declined psychological realism and scrambled high and low culture into a melange not far removed from today's post-modernism. All this, in a frontal attack on European fascism and anti-Semitism that none of the studios, terrified by the prospect of losing their overseas markets, had dared to make before the official declaration of war (one exception was Warner Brothers' "Confessions of a Nazi Spy," released as Chaplin was filming "The Great Dictator").
The four films in this first set (other volumes are forthcoming) have each been transferred to video with tremendous care. The "Modern Times" disc uses, for example, the new digital restoration of the film just completed by the Bologna Cinematheque, with a full range of gray tones, sharp grain and a crystal-clear soundtrack. "The Gold Rush" is presented in both its original 1925 silent version and the 1942 reissue version, which Chaplin narrates with charmingly belated verbosity. "Limelight," the last film that Chaplin was to make in America (1952), comes with "The Professor," an unfinished 1919 short that became the basis for the flea circus routine in "Limelight," as well as 16 minutes of Chaplin family home movies.
Six more titles will be released by Warners, including "The Kid" (1921), "City Lights" (1931) and "A King in New York" (1957). On film, on tape or on discs, these idiosyncratic films continue to delight and fascinate. Chaplin was one of the cinema's first artists; he will always be among its greatest.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
The Risk Of Insolvency

BYLINE:  By BARRY ESTABROOK; BARRY ESTABROOK is a writer and editor who lives in Vermont.

 BODY:
FOR those aboard the ship World Discoverer, this spring's Around the Ring of Fire cruise proved memorable -- perhaps too much so.
 The small luxury ship sailed from the Japanese island of Hokkaido with a full complement of 140 passengers. About 70 of them had booked the cruise through Victor Emanuel Nature Tours, an established purveyor of high-end eco-tourism and birding packages. The Emanuel group included luminaries like the author Peter Matthiessen, the wildlife artists Robert Bateman and Lars Jonsson, and Victor Emanuel, the tour company's owner. The average price for a berth on the 18-day cruise was $8,000. 
 The passengers passed remote islands in the Bering Sea and sailed by ash-spewing volcanoes, sea lions and Lapland longspurs. But when they pulled into their final port of call, Nome, Alaska, on June 14, the passengers were greeted by representatives of the Bank of Scotland, there to seize the World Discoverer over nonpayment of a loan by the British owners of the vessel. 
 Fortunately, the members of the Victor Emanuel group toured the Nome area as planned and caught a charter flight to Anchorage. By the end of June, Society Expeditions of Seattle, operator of the World Discoverer, had arranged financing to buy the $33 million vessel outright. The company put the ship back in operation on Aug. 5. 
 According to Jessica Triebold, the marketing director of Society Expeditions, customers who had paid for any of three Bering Sea cruises that were canceled after the World Discoverer's seizure could book other cruises or get their money back. Their prepayments had been held in a Federal Maritime Commission escrow account, she said. 
 But the incident raised a troubling question for anyone planning a cruise or tour vacation. If such close calls can happen even on a trip operated by an exclusive and well-established cruise line, how does a traveler get protection from the possibility of a tour operator going bankrupt or becoming insolvent? 

Increase in Bankruptcies
 Travel insurance has become more important than ever, and travel insurers are doing record business. The chances of a travel provider encountering financial difficulties are increasing as the industry suffers from the effects of terrorism, the war in Iraq, SARS and the continuing economic downturn. In 2002, six members of the National Tour Association became insolvent. "It was the worst year we have ever had," said Hank Phillips, president of the association, which represents 640 tour operators. 
 So far this year, one member, Custom Tours Ltd., based in Oregon, has declared bankruptcy.
 In March, the association's board voted to end its 15-year-old Consumer Protection Plan, a program that issued rebates of 90 percent of any prepayments or deposits a customer had made to a member company if the company went bankrupt before delivering on the promised trip. The plan, capped at $200,000 per bankrupt company, paid out $565,000 as a result of the six insolvencies in 2002, affecting 484 travelers.
 The United States Tour Operators Association, which represents 140 large tour operators, still requires that its members maintain $1 million consumer protection bonds to repay customers in the event of bankruptcy. But such bonds are no guarantee that consumers will get all their money back, according to Alexander Anolik, a San Francisco lawyer specializing in travel who is also an author of "Traveler's Rights" (Sphinx Publishing, 2003).
 "An operator can have prepayments from clients that exceed the amount of protection, so a traveler can still be left on the hook for a portion of what he has prepaid," Mr. Anolik said.
 He recommends always using a major credit card when prepaying for a trip. Under the Fair Billing Credit Act, credit card customers can get refunds for goods and services they do not receive provided they dispute the charges within 60 days (some card companies extend this period) after the charges appear on the cardholder's statement. 
 But for a higher level of comfort, Mr. Anolik suggests buying travel insurance that protects against default by the operator. He says travelers should be certain that they are buying third-party insurance, which is insurance issued by a company other than the one selling the tour or cruise. "Self-insured product may be a few bucks cheaper, but if the tour company is bust, so is their insurance," he said.

A Boom in Insurance
 Companies that sell third-party travel insurance say that business is booming. At Travel Guard International, which has been in business since 1985 and writes about 60 percent of travel insurance policies sold in the United States, business rose by 78 percent in 2002 over 2001.
 Before Sept. 11, 2001, about 8 percent of American travelers took out policies on their trips, said Scott Adamski, vice president for national retail sales at Travel Guard. Now the level is around 20 percent, he said.
 Travel insurance companies refuse to write policies for operators they consider too much of a risk. Travel Guard maintains a list of these companies under the heading "Travel Guard Alerts" on its Web site (www.travelguard.com). In early August, 31 companies were on the list. They included tour and cruise operators like Tourlink and Regal Cruises and financially troubled airlines like Air Canada and United. 
 Comprehensive travel insurance, which typically covers such things as lost baggage, cancellation because of sickness and default by the provider, can be bought through a travel agent or through online sources like www.insuremytrip.com, which allows customers to compare the offerings of several major insurance companies. "It is important that people buy from an insurance company that is licensed in their state," said Jeanne Salvatore, vice president for consumer affairs at the Insurance Information Institute, which has information about travel insurance online at www.iii.org/individuals/otherinsurance/travel. 
 Such policies are expensive; Ms. Salvatore said that the cost was 5 to 7 percent of the cost of the trip. At that price, travel insurance obviously is not for everybody, or for every vacation. 
 "Some tour operators do inexpensive day trips," said Mr. Phillips of the National Tour Association. "It might not be worthwhile. But if you're doing a seven-day European tour, you're going to be paying a pretty good price for it."
 Mr. Emanuel of Victor Emanuel Tours said that he protected his clients by placing prepayments to cruise lines into escrow accounts until the ships sail, but that he still advocated getting travel insurance. "These are expensive trips," he said. "The air fare alone would justify third-party insurance." 
 His company is planning another trip to the Bering Sea and Russia next summer, but he may use a ship other than the World Discoverer.
 "The whole travel industry is a lot more dicey now, Mr. Anolik said. "My advice is take as many potential worries off the table as you can. This is supposed to be a vacation."

Addicted to Work? Sure, Isn't Everyone?

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHILE many people will spend Labor Day weekend closing down their summer homes or taking final splashes in the pool, I will probably be at my computer, well, laboring away.
 I have always been a hard worker. Sure, I've been known to cancel plans if I'm on deadline (which is often), and I often travel with my laptop computer. And, yes, there are friends whom I haven't seen in ages because I'm just too busy. But I thought that's what we do here in the big city. We work. What else would we do? 
 But now I wonder if I might have a problem, if I might be a -- gasp! -- workaholic. The word has always amused me. It never seemed serious, just another term created by society's apparent addiction to 12-step programs. Unlike, say, an active alcoholic, a workaholic is productive, driven and ambitious. A workaholic has goals.
Besides, I have always reasoned, I'm a freelance writer. I simply cannot afford to turn down assignments because I never know when the well might dry up. Quite frankly, I derive a great deal of my identity and self-respect from my work.
Recently, though, after an especially maniacal workweek, I went to the Workaholic Anonymous Web site (www.workaholics-anonymous.org) and found a section that can help determine whether you may have a work-addiction problem. Among the 20 questions posed are these:
* Do you take work with you to bed, on weekends, on vacations? (Uh, yes.)
* Is work the activity you like to do best and talk about most? (Usually.) 
* Do you work more than 40 hours a week? (Doesn't everyone?)
American culture, after all, breeds what may be perceived as workaholic behavior. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says Americans work 49 hours a week, on average -- 350 hours a year more than most Europeans do. A recent survey by the online travel company Expedia.com found that about 12 percent of American workers took no vacation because they were too busy working. 
Young people grapple with what I believe is a special type of workaholism, one generated by uncertainty about the job market and a desire to get ahead in a fiercely competitive world.
"I'm afraid that if I don't see this show or read this script I'll miss something, and it'll take me out of the running," said Lily Hung, 29, a theatrical production associate in Manhattan now working on the Broadway musical "Hairspray." Ms. Hung says that she puts in at least 60 hours a week, and that although she enjoys her job, it does get in the way of her personal relationships. "My friends complain all the time that they don't see me," said Ms. Hung, who calls herself a workaholic.
"I find if I have a break, I don't know what to do with myself," she said. "You get caught on that work rush. You're used to working at a certain pace and level and when you have space to breathe, it's a bit of a letdown. It's a terrible drug."
Marc Sturm, 35, an information technology engineer in New York, often works Sundays, even when he isn't obliged to. "I'm afraid to slow down," he said. "There's pressure to keep current with technology, plus, I have to make a living."
Of course, not everyone who works a lot is a workaholic. Addiction experts say that true workaholics may be trying to hide anxiety and low self-esteem. Perhaps most telling, they say, workaholics can't enjoy their accomplishments. They constantly crave more. They get a high from doing their jobs and are often oblivious to the negative effect their work life has on the rest of their lives -- if they have any.
DIANE FASSEL, the author of "Working Ourselves to Death: The High Cost of Workaholism and the Rewards of Recovery" (iUniverse, 2000) says that workaholism affects all walks of life, not just high-powered executives, and that it can affect physical health. Often, she says, "a workaholic will die before an alcoholic." 
Now that's a scary thought. But what are the options? How do you get ahead in a competitive job market without working 24/7? Doesn't contentment breed stagnation?
The goal is to strive for balance, that elusive state of being that we're all supposed to seek. While there is nothing wrong with pushing yourself to meet a deadline, the experts say, you have to learn to appreciate the down time. Slow down. Work to live; don't live to work.
Those thoughts are all very nice, but in a weak economy, when people are lucky to even have jobs, I'm not so sure that the advice is realistic. 
"I go above and beyond," said Jennifer Richards, 27, a Boston lawyer. "My company is laying people off right and left. If I want to keep my job, I need to prove myself. I work like a dog, but I don't see any other option."
Me, too, although I must confess that there are times when I hide out in my work. Still, unlike other addictions, it's friendlier to my bank account, and it doesn't make me fat.

 CORRECTION:
The Preludes column on Aug. 17, about causes and effects of long hours on the job, misstated the number of hours that Americans work per week, on average. It is 39, not 49, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The column also referred incompletely to figures showing that Americans worked 350 more hours per year than Europeans. That was in 1999, the last year for which the International Labor Organization has statistics comparable to the bureau's.

As Factories Move Abroad, So Does U.S. Power

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
MANUFACTURING is slowly disappearing in the United States. That does not mean we should rush to preserve the remaining factories as historic landmarks. America will still be a manufacturing power in our grandchildren's lifetime, but that status is gradually eroding.
 Why does this matter? Well, the essence of a great world power is its edge in producing not services but manufactured products that other people want -- Boeing's airliners, for example, Intel's semiconductors and Caterpillar's earth-moving equipment. To the extent this output passes to foreign manufacturers, or even to Americans operating abroad, we lose the means to buy what we, in turn, want from others. 
 More than half of the manufactured goods that Americans buy are made abroad, up from 31 percent in 1987. If we continue on our path of ceasing to make merchandise that others want to buy from us, the danger is that these imports will be unaffordable for our descendants. 
For that to happen, "you have to assume that manufacturing will continue to disappear," said David Heuther, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. He does not make that assumption himself. He contends that America's high-tech advantage and its ingenuity will sustain the nation's manufacturing base.
Maybe. Right now, however, the exodus continues, at a stepped-up pace, government data show. The proportion of the work force employed in manufacturing has fallen to 11 percent from 30 percent in the mid-1960's. Two of the 19 percentage points disappeared in just the last 28 months. On another level, manufacturing's share of real gross domestic product -- representing all the goods and services produced in the United States -- has edged down, even including in the count the output of foreign manufacturers operating here. The share of real G.D.P. has dropped to between 16 and 17 percent, from 18 to 19 percent in the 1950's. 
Given manufacturing's importance in maintaining our status as a world power, the downward trends are alarming. The public, nevertheless, focuses only occasionally on the dismantling. It does so when lots of people are suddenly hurt, as they were in the early 1980's, when an onslaught of high-quality foreign imports coincided with a severe recession. The combination forced plant closings and layoffs on a scale not experienced since the Depression.
"Rust belt" and "deindustrialization" were coined in the bitter debate that surrounded that frightening national experience. Those were the years when wage inequality became too persistent to ignore. Blame fell partly on the destruction of factory jobs, and the relatively high wages earned by those workers.
Two decades later, the shrinking manufacturing sector is again a source of public agitation, this time because so many American manufacturers are decamping to China and India, where they employ increasingly skilled but inexpensive workers to make merchandise that is then shipped back to the United States, swelling imports and subtracting jobs at home.
What's to be done? Many economists bank on the marketplace for a solution. They note that the growing volume of imported merchandise would not be possible without loans from abroad to buy these goods. As this debt balloons, foreigners will lose confidence in the United States as a place to put their money, these economists reason. As foreigners retreat, their demand for dollars to lend to America will drop off, and so will the dollar's value.
THAT will make imported manufactured goods prohibitively expensive, while merchandise exported from the United States will fall in price, when sold in yen or euros. Responding to this price incentive, manufacturers will rebuild in America, says George A. Akerlof, a Nobel laureate who is an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "Manufacturing has to come back," he said. No other sector is likely to be as responsive to dollar devaluation. 
For Mr. Akerlof, retooling is the easy part. Other experts disagree. Too many products are no longer manufactured here, they argue, and the skill to make them has disappeared. Resurrecting that skill is difficult. Dollar devaluation does not easily overcome that barrier. Nor does it easily woo back American companies that have invested huge sums in large, modern facilities abroad. Getting them to abandon those facilities and rebuild in the United States might require an outsized 60 percent devaluation of the dollar as an incentive, says Daniel Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Plymouth.
The fallout would be painful. The Nissan Maxima, made in Japan, that I bought in 2000 for $25,000 would cost at least $40,000 to replace. That's over my head.

How to Avoid Cracking the Retirement Nest Egg

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN

 BODY:
AS David Colescott approached retirement as a real estate broker in June 1999, he assumed that the stock market would rise by an average of 10 percent a year. Based on that belief, Mr. Colescott, now 68, said he had expected to withdraw 8 percent of his nest egg's initial value in his first year of retirement and take out slightly larger amounts, to allow for inflation, in subsequent years.
 But he decided that he should live on less after a financial planner at T. Rowe Price Advisory Services warned him that he might run out of money if he withdrew more than 5 percent of the portfolio's initial value each year. The stock market, of course, declined for three consecutive years starting in 2000, and Mr. Colescott's portfolio lost about 20 percent of its value in that period. He is thankful that he took a conservative course. 
 "I would have run into real problems down the road," he said. "In a few years, I would have been eating my seed corn." 
Mr. Colescott's experience highlights some important advice from many financial planners. Along with diversifying among stocks and bonds, retirees who want their money to last must limit their initial withdrawal from their portfolios to 4 to 5 percent of the portfolio's value, many experts say. Those withdrawals may then be adjusted annually for inflation.
"An initial withdrawal rate of a little over 4 percent virtually guarantees you'll get 30 years out of the portfolio," said Bill Bengen, a fee-only financial planner in El Cajon, Calif., who in October 1994 published one of the first studies on sustainable withdrawal rates, in The Journal of Financial Planning. 
Self-restraint alone doesn't ensure that retirees will be able to live off their investments. Other important steps, Mr. Bengen and other advisers say, include keeping a healthy part of one's portfolio in income-producing investments, and to avoid holding a high percentage of wealth in an employer's stock.
Elaine Seckler, a 16-year employee of AT&T from Bernards Township, N.J., had almost all her retirement portfolio invested in AT&T and other telecommunications stocks when she walked into the office of Al Zdenek, a fee-only financial planner in Flemington, N.J., in late 2000.
The telecom sector was falling, and Mr. Zdenek convinced Ms. Seckler of the danger of her approach. By June 2001, she had sold her telecom holdings. She repositioned her portfolio, with 20 percent in dividend-paying stocks and 80 percent in corporate and municipal bonds. Ms. Seckler, who retired in January 2002 at age 54, now has a portfolio that yields 6 percent a year in dividend and interest income. She lives on 80 to 90 percent of that income and reinvests the rest. 
"I have many friends who have told me there's no way they can even think of retirement at 55; they've lost so much money," she said. "The big thing for me was to be open to change." 
AVOIDING big losses is particularly important for retirees. "By not losing a lot of money in the really negative years, you don't have to take a lot of risk to make the portfolio whole again," said Ray Mignone, a fee-only financial planner in Little Neck, N.Y.
Holding substantial amounts of bonds helped cushion many portfolios in the market's down years. A portfolio invested entirely in the Wilshire 5000 stocks would have lost a total of 37.2 percent from 2000 through 2002, but one allocated 40 percent to the Wilshire 5000 and 60 percent to the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index would have had a positive return of 5.2 percent, said Rande Spiegelman, vice president for financial planning at the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.
A portfolio with 40 percent in bonds and the rest in dividend-paying stocks and stock funds helped Annasaheb Anuje, 62, ride out the last three years with minimal concern.
"My peace of mind comes from having income-producing stocks and bonds and withdrawing less than what they're producing," Mr. Anuje said. "I'm eating the fruit off the tree, not the seeds." 
Ultimately, the key to keeping secure in a market downturn is a conservative withdrawal rate, several financial planners said. 
In the bull market, many people assumed that stocks would return 10 percent a year, and that they could safely withdraw 7 or 8 percent of a portfolio a year without cutting into principal. But stocks do not consistently earn 10 percent a year: in some years, they earn 20 percent; in others, they lose that much.
Someone who retired in early 2000 and assumed that her $500,000 portfolio could earn an average of, say, 9 percent a year could withdraw 7 percent the first year, increase the dollar amount of the annual withdrawal by 3 percent a year for inflation and have that nest egg last 27 years, according to an analysis by T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.
But if that portfolio had experienced the real market losses of 2000 through 2002, it would have been worth only $331,502 by the end of last year. If the retiree continued to take annual inflation-adjusted withdrawals based on the initial 7 percent rate, she would be destitute by the end of 2014, even if the portfolio started earning 9 percent a year in 2003, according to T. Rowe Price data.
By contrast, someone who withdrew 4 percent of the initial value of the portfolio each year, with a 3 percent annual inflation adjustment, would still have had $371,954 by the end of 2002. Assuming that the portfolio resumed annual growth of 9 percent in 2003, she would still have $495,549 at the end of 2014. The portfolio would not be depleted until 2051. 
More realistically, according to T. Rowe Price, investors might expect a return of about 8 percent a year. At that return, annual inflation-adjusted withdrawals based on a 7 percent initial rate would deplete the portfolio in 2013. At an initial withdrawal rate of 4 percent, however, the portfolio would last for 20 more years, until 2033.
"If you want to be pretty sure of not running out of money, and keeping up with inflation, you've got to keep withdrawals within a range of 3 percent to 5 percent in the first year," said Christine Fahlund, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price.
Many people are shocked that the recommended rate is so low, she added.
To arrive at its figures, the company ran dozens of portfolio strategies through hundreds of economic possibilities, aiming to find strategies in which the probability of outliving one's money is very low, usually less than 10 percent. The analysis generally assumes that men will live until age 90 and women until 95. If a portfolio's return exceeds expectations, or the life span is shorter than estimated, the investor will leave money to his heirs.
TO tell people with $1 million portfolios that they can spend less than $4,000 a month is "absurd," said Dr. Philip Cooley, the Prassel Professor of Business at Trinity University in San Antonio, who has published several papers on sustainable withdrawal rates in the last five years.
"When you recommend such low rates, you cause the retiree to forgo a joyous life in early retirement," he said, "and they end up with a lot of money later on, when they can't take advantage of it." 
He said his research indicated that over 30 years, a withdrawal rate of 7 percent of the initial portfolio value, without adjustments for inflation, is sustainable 86 percent of the time for a stock-dominated portfolio. 
"This is not a contract," Dr. Cooley said. "We're talking about a financial plan." People who retire into a bear market can cut back on their withdrawal rate, he said. Then, when things look better, why not bump it up again? 
To a limited extent, that is what Mr. Colescott and his wife, Joan, have decided to do. They began withdrawing money from their nest egg at a 4.8 percent rate in 2000, but this month, they began to bump up their withdrawals by $200 a month, to about 5 percent of the initial value of the portfolio. That withdrawal rate should sustain the portfolio until 2024, according to T. Rowe Price. "I'm pretty comfortable," Mr. Colescott said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 24, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A chart with an article about the effects of withdrawal rates on a hypothetical retirement portfolio misstated the effect of a withdrawal rate of 4 percent of the initial amount, plus an inflation adjustment each year. If the account holder retired in 2000 with $500,000, his account would be depleted in 2035, not 2033. The example that used a 7 percent withdrawal rate was accurate. Here is a corrected chart.

Graph tracks and estimates initial withdrawals at 7% and 4% from 2000-2035.

Portfolio invested 60 percent in stocks, 30 percent in bonds and 10 percent in cash; market returns used in 2000 through 2002; 8 percent annual return subsequently. Withdrawals increase by 3 percent each year as an inflation adjustment.

In this example, the portfolio of an investor who retired in 2000 with $500,000 in a tax-deferred retirement account would run out of money in 2013, at a withdrawal rate equal to 7 percent of the initial portfolio, plus an inflation adjustment each year. The portfolio would last 20 years longer, to 2033, at a withdrawal rate of 4 percent. Graph tracks 4% initial withdrawal and 7% initial withdrawal from 2000 to 2033.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Mortgage Markets Are Out Of Control

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
SINCE interest rates began surging a few weeks back, the folks wearing the rose-colored shades have said the climb is proof that an economic recovery is nigh.
 But there is something more than a nascent rebound driving rates today. It is a force so large and brutish that it could propel rates higher and faster than many investors expect. 
 The market-roiling force in question is the huge mortgage-backed securities market and the leveraged traders who call it home. 
Although many investors think that the Treasury market sets mortgage rates, mortgage-backed traders are the ones who hold sway. Their hegemony is a function of two things: the runaway growth in the mortgage market and the way mortgage portfolio managers must respond when rates rise or fall.
Until 2000, the United States Treasury market was the world's largest and most liquid. Now the government bond market is overshadowed by the mortgage-backed securities market. Treasuries and corporate bonds each account for about 22 percent of the Lehman Brothers United States Aggregate Index, a measure of the whole fixed-income market; mortgage-backed securities make up almost 35 percent.
This would not be a problem if mortgage traders and managers of big loan portfolios, like Fannie Mae, did not typically hedge their holdings with Treasuries. Holders of mortgages hedge by selling short Treasury securities with maturities roughly equal to the average life of the mortgages in their portfolio. 
Now, the hedgers' needs can swamp the market they tap. This exacerbates moves in interest rates, producing a snowball effect that can push rates far lower or higher, and faster, than in previous years.
Mortgage-backed securities respond violently to moves in interest rates. When rates fall and homeowners refinance, some of the mortgages in large portfolios held by banks, hedge funds and mortgage originators are cashed in. That requires the managers of these portfolios to rebalance their hedges by buying Treasuries. Such buying helped push interest rates down to ridiculous levels earlier this year. 
When rates rise, refinancings drop, and the average life of a mortgage grows. That forces traders to rebalance portfolios by selling Treasuries. Selling begets selling; interest rates spike. 
Last week, the Federal Reserve rattled the bond market by promising to keep rates low for as long as possible. Traders feared that the accommodative stance could be inflationary. They sold Treasuries, and rates rose.
James A. Bianco of Bianco Research in Chicago pointed out that the last time interest rates moved up -- in the mid-1990's -- the mortgage-backed securities market was much smaller and more manageable. "Back in 1996, the mortgage market was roughly half the size of the Treasury market," he said. "Now it is 125 percent of the Treasury market."
Mr. Bianco fears that the size of the market and the fact that so many players are heavily leveraged make a disaster almost inevitable. "If you look at the last 15 years of bond market derivative debacles, a lot of them involved mortgages," he said. "These things have killed more people than any other trade."
The people running big mortgage portfolios would tell you that hedging allows them to manage away their risks. 
Mr. Bianco argues that the extreme volatility in the market suggests that the players have not properly managed their risks. "We wouldn't see these wild undulations in interest rates if they had already been hedged," he said.
It is unfortunate that the problems of mortgage traders can create such havoc. But these traders drove down rates, benefiting consumers, companies and bondholders. Now, it is higher borrowing costs -- and their grimmer implications -- for which everyone must prepare.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
Some Health Discounts May Be No Bargain

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Mary Crownover saw a flier for a program called MediSavers that advertised savings of up to 80 percent on medical care and prescription drugs, for a one-time broker fee of $29, she thought it was too good to pass up. It was late 2001 and Ms. Crownover was uninsured and more than a year away from qualifying for Medicare. Her MediSavers card sat in her wallet until one evening last April, when chest pains sent her to the hospital emergency room near her home in St. Charles, Mo. She presented her card and then spent the night undergoing tests at the hospital.
 Doctors ultimately gave Ms. Crownover a clean bill of health, but then came the bill, for $5,061.80. So what kind of savings did she get from her card? Just $278, around 5 percent of the invoice. "I was shocked," said Ms. Crownover, now 65. Every procedure she said she saw on the company Web site showed a savings of at least 56 percent. 
 Asked about Ms. Crownover's smaller-than-expected savings, Alvin Konigsberg, the president of MediSavers in New York, said: "There's very little savings in emergency room visits." It would have been difficult for her to know ahead of time what the savings would be, he said, because prices vary from place to place. Her savings would have been as high as 80 percent if she had gone for testing to a medical facility other than a hospital, he said. Savings by users of his plan can be up to 80 percent, and are generally 50 percent, Mr. Konigsberg said. 
Medical discount plans like the one Mrs. Crownover signed up for are spreading faster than a winter flu. As companies cut back health care coverage, more people are casting about for alternatives. But as many disgruntled people have learned, it's essential to read the fine print in a plan before signing on. To receive a discount, for example, some programs require patients to pay the entire amount due upfront by credit card, as MediSavers did with Ms. Crownover. Depending on your credit limit, such requirements can be a problem. Other programs make patients get the plan's approval before seeing a provider and to make appointments up to 30 days in advance. Some have back-end administrative fees that reduce discounts substantially.
Even if a plan seems solid, consumers may be able to do better on their own. "For an uninsured patient, we'd give better than a 25 percent discount," said Carol Plato Nicosia, director for patient financial service at Martin Memorial Medical Center in Stuart, Fla. "We might give them the Medicare rate -- as much as a 50 percent discount -- if they're near Medicare age."
Charles Martin, 61, of of Mobile, Ala., said he received a 20 percent discount from the hospital he visited for a knee problem after explaining that his $30-a-month discount-card program would shave only 12 percent off his $692 bill.
Sometimes the provider network in a discount program proves as elusive as the savings. Discount companies assemble their networks by buying or leasing lists of medical providers from preferred provider organizations. Some card companies take the additional step of contracting directly with the providers on the list, but problems often occur when this step isn't taken.
Cynthia Ketchum, 40, signed up for a medical discount plan with Family Care to supplement the high-deductible insurance policy she carries for herself and her 4-year-old son, Alberto. She said representatives from Family Care in Houston promised to send a list of participating doctors who were near her home in Arlington, Va., where she works as a client services manager for a law firm. But more than a month and several phone calls and e-mail messages later, she said, she still didn't have the information. Finally, Family Care gave her the name of a single doctor. But when she went to her scheduled appointment, the doctor said he had never heard of Family Care. "I was just furious," said Mrs. Ketchum, who was refunded her $99 enrollment fee and first month's payment of $69.
Jaren Current, vice president for marketing at Family Care, said, "Sometimes it's a little difficult for members to find a doctor in their area." He said that the company had added many more providers since Mrs. Ketchum's difficulties in April.
Some consumers may be led to believe through a plan's advertising that they are getting more protection than the cards provide. "It's certainly not the answer for catastrophic health care needs, or for people with chronic diseases," said Joseph Baker, health care bureau chief for the New York attorney general's office.
THAT office plans to release guidelines this fall for medical discount card companies. The guidelines are likely to include a requirement that companies state clearly that their product isn't insurance, disclose all fees and restrictions and provide a toll-free number for complaints and inquiries. A few states have adopted laws related to discount card company practices. But because the plans are not subject to state insurance laws, "they often fall through the regulatory cracks," said Jim Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, an alliance of consumer groups, insurers and state regulators based in Washington.
Last year, in an effort to police its members and to educate consumers, the industry formed the Consumer Health Alliance. The group is completing a code of conduct that sets standards for discount companies. "We want to take the confusion out of all this," said Barbara L. Flood, president of the alliance and chief executive of Careington International, a discountcard company.
That's a laudable goal. For the millions who have joined or are considering a medical discount plan, it can't happen soon enough.

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
A Silk Purse From a Safety Net

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
IT was right there on the factory floor all the time, but Julian Gordon didn't notice.
 For many years, Mr. Gordon's privately held Boston company, Gordon Industries, a maker of metal doors and stairs that he founded in 1970, was a cash cow. At the height of the 1980's building boom, Gordon Industries had revenue of $3 million and was so profitable that Mr. Gordon could take weekend jaunts to Europe on the Concorde and build up his collection of vintage Mercedes-Benzes. What would be the point of innovating when tried-and-true worked so well? 
 But nothing gets the entrepreneurial juices flowing faster than desperation. In the early 1990's, the Bank of New England closed, brought down by the cumulative failure of many of the developers and speculators it had financed. "It all turned off in a 90-day period," said Mr. Gordon, 59, whose loans were called in by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "We never missed a payment to the bank for 20 years, and all of a sudden I was threatened with liquidation."
As new construction ground to a halt, Gordon's sales plummeted by two-thirds, and Mr. Gordon spent the next two years worrying about meeting his payroll. With no bank backing, he poured his savings, as well as money borrowed from family and friends, into the business. He went without a salary for a year.
By 1993, the belt-tightening began to pay off as the construction market started to turn around. Mr. Gordon turned his attention to an old puzzle: how to create a steady stream of revenue in a business subject to the vagaries of the housing market. 
It was time, he decided, to branch out. He needed to create a useful product that nobody else had thought of, to patent it and to gain a niche market for himself. In other words, he needed to act more like an entrepreneur, even at the risk of failure.
Sure enough, his initial forays flopped. First, he created a martial-arts training device -- a sort of metal tree with pads that students could kick and punch -- and signed up a husband-and-wife team of trainers to market them. They sold a few hundred, but their marriage unraveled, and sales dried up. Then, his company came up with a steel security screen that shop owners could roll over display windows at night. His target market was New York City, but because the crime rate was falling there, interest in the product was negligible.
Then, in 1996, when his company fought its way back to about $1.75 million in sales, Mr. Gordon received a call from a man who had spotted the portable metal ramps that his company sold to construction sites for wheeling heavy material up to workers. Could he buy one for his aging mother so she could navigate her front steps in a wheelchair? It would be easier and cheaper to install, the man figured, than building a permanent concrete ramp.
At first, Mr. Gordon said no. Then the light bulb went off. "If this guy was so hungry to get one of these ramps, I wondered if maybe other consumers would be, too," he said.
Mr. Gordon, realizing he was onto something, spent the next two years doing market research, getting his patents in order and putting together a business plan.
Hospital stays, he figured, were becoming shorter, so more patients with temporary disabilities were being released while still confined to a wheelchair. The number of elderly homeowners was surging. And federal law was forcing business and government to make their buildings accessible to disabled Americans.
In 1998, Mr. Gordon patented his ramps and began renting them out for about $60 a week and selling them for $2,000. He also persuaded his son Jon to quit his advertising job in Arizona to help sell them. "At first I was skeptical,"' said Jon Gordon, whois now a vice president at the company. "I thought to myself: 'It's just a ramp. No big deal.' "
BUT consumers didn't agree. Sales of the ramp shot up 30 percent in 2000, 50 percent in 2001 and 50 percent in 2002, by which time they had accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company's total revenue of $4 million and had spawned a separate unit -- American Ramp Systems. Julian Gordon expects overall sales to rise to $6 million next year, with all the increase attributable to the ramp.
The elder Mr. Gordon has also sold 11 franchises for the product in Ohio and Pennsylvania and expects to expand that number to 100 nationally within five years.
Barbara Reeve, the mother of the actor Christopher Reeve, was one of the Gordons' first customers, renting out a ramp over Christmas of 1998. Others followed. Skiers with broken legs clamored for the device; other big buyers were churches and other organizations that needed ramps only at certain times. The City of New York ordered several.
Because many Americans confined to wheelchairs are on Medicaid or Medicare and cannot afford the ramps, Julian Gordon has taken steps to help them. Whenever a nonprofit group buys a ramp, he said, "we call the organization and ask what their mission is." He includes the names of likely donors in a "funding source kit" that he mails to low-income people who can contact them for financial help.
The elder Mr. Gordon also fusses over his franchisees, giving them training courses and feeding them leads. "I get e-mails from him at 4 o'clock in the morning," said Keith Rielag, co-owner with his wife, Louella, of a new Cincinnati franchise. "He's so available for me that it's almost ridiculous."
Julian Gordon says he feels that he is close to achieving immunity from the economic quirks that used to plague his business. But he isn't slowing down. He arrives at his office by 6:30 each morning and is the last to leave, Jon Gordon said.
The elder Mr. Gordon pleads guilty to workaholism. "It's not something that I'm proud of," he said, "but hard work seems to work better than wishing for lucky breaks."

Yes, Assembly Lines Can Mix Apples and Oranges

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: EAST LIBERTY, Ohio 

 BODY:
SHOPPERS for new cars are often frustrated when they can't get the newest model exactly when they want it. Their fickle tastes will be much easier to satisfy, however, as plants like the Honda Motor Company's sprawling factory here become the norm in the industry. 
 In this factory 35 miles northwest of Columbus, the small Honda Civic and the big, boxy Element are being made not only in the same plant, but also on the same assembly line, a radical departure for the auto industry in the United States. Historically, the industry has had a method of one plant, one car. 
 As the cars roll down the miles of conveyor belts here, their differing sizes are made abundantly clear by two racks of roof liners -- soft fabric that stretches the length of a car, against the metal top -- which stand waiting to be installed inside the metal frame. 
The roof liner for the Element is 9 feet long, versus 6 feet for the Civic's; next to each other, they look like two garment bags -- one for a ball gown and one for a blazer. Depending on the vehicle that glides in front of them, workers take a roof liner off a rack and staple it into place.
The East Liberty plant is at the front of a trend that is spreading rapidly through the American automobile industry: flexible manufacturing. It allows automakers to satisfy the rapidly changing desires of consumers, and it provides new vehicles nearly as often as fashion designers turn out new clothes.
Every major company, from the Big Three automakers in Detroit to companies in Japan, Germany and Korea, is embracing the concept. In theory, flexible manufacturing will let them build any combination of vehicles in one factory, regardless of size, design or body style.
The concept lets auto companies meet customer demand quickly, without wasting time and money tearing up factories. Companies that can put new vehicles on the market first stand the best shot at earning the highest profits.
"None of us know four years from now what the right mix will be," said Dennis C. Cuneo, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America. "That's why you have to be flexible."
Dennis K. Pawley, the former head of manufacturing at Chrysler who is now a consultant, said: "Products are coming faster than you can blink an eye. If you don't have flexibility now, you're dead."
There is already proof of the payoff. This year, in an industry where each tenth of a market-share point is fought over like gold, Honda has picked up an impressive 1.1 points primarily because of two new vehicles: the Element and the Honda Pilot, a large S.U.V. Both are built in flexible plants: the Element in East Liberty, and the Pilot in Alliston, Ontario.
The potential savings are enormous, too, wiping out the industry's long-held perception that flexible factories are too expensive to create and maintain. Three years ago, when General Motors started production of the latest version of the Chevrolet Impala, it spent $240 million to retool its assembly line to add the vehicle at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant. But, thanks to the flexible-manufacturing system that it is installing in its plants, G.M. is spending just $45 million now to add new vehicles at its factories. And it estimates that the cost will drop to $20 million by 2005.
"We will be prepared to move with the market," said Gerald L. Elson, G.M.'s vice president in charge of vehicle operations.
Traditionally, entire factories have been used exclusively for a single kind of vehicle, like the endless rows of Model T's that Henry Ford churned out a century ago. Even today, Ford Motor has six factories devoted solely to the F-series pickup, of which it sells more than 750,000 a year. 
And, until this spring, the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler had three factories in the United States and Europe that built only minivans, while its Jeep plant in Detroit operated 24 hours a day throughout the 1990's building only Jeep Grand Cherokees.
The single-vehicle plant was designed for economies of scale. "The only priority was to be the low-cost producer," Mr. Pawley said.
The big problem comes when those vehicles don't sell, and the factories have to be shut down. Labor contracts require Detroit auto companies to pay laid-off union members practically their entire wages and all their benefits when plants are not operating. This need to keep factories going also makes it costly for companies to introduce low-volume vehicles, because their limited sales cannot pay for keeping an entire plant running.
In installing flexible-manufacturing systems, the Big Three are aiming to race against Japanese auto companies. In a research report titled "The Joy of Flex," Michael Bruynesteyn, an industry analyst at Prudential Securities, wrote that Toyota and Honda were ahead of the Big Three automakers in adopting flexible-manufacturing concepts, in part because of the demands those companies face in Japan.
There, customers' tastes change even faster than those in the United States, meaning that automakers have to offer wide-ranging lineups with dozens of cars and constantly introduce new products. Many will be sold only in Japan, and for no more than a couple of years. 
Even a decade ago, Mazda was able to build up to 14 different vehicles at its plant in Hofu, Japan, and eight at its factory in Hiroshima. 
That expertise did not show up when Japanese companies first came to the United States. In earlier years, Japanese companies primarily produced high-volume cars, like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, taking time to figure out the American market, and to train their work forces. But as they have expanded their lineups and gained market share, the companies are flexing their plants with a vengeance.
One example is Nissan Motors, repeatedly ranked as the most efficient producer of vehicles by the Harbour Report, an annual manufacturing study.
Between its plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and its just-opened factory in Canton, Miss., Nissan can produce 10 different automobile nameplates. "People want a high degree of personalization in their cars, and flexibility is going to be the key to that," said Jed Connelly, Nissan's senior vice president for North American sales.
Likewise, flexible manufacturing is allowing Toyota to shuffle its vehicles between its North American plants, as if they were a deck of playing cards. This year, it switched the Toyota Sienna minivan from its factory in Georgetown, Ky., to one in Princeton, Ind., where it makes pickups and S.U.V.'s.
Caught off guard by the soaring popularity of the new version of the Sienna, which is sold out for up to 10 weeks at some showrooms, Toyota has increased Sienna production at the Princeton plant by about 18 percent, dialing back on the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia S.U.V. in order to do so.
Flexibility still poses tremendous challenges to auto companies. In making it work, an important role is played by the body shop -- the area where the different metal pieces of a car ortruck are welded together by robots, before the body moves off to be painted and the interiors installed. Imitating the humans that once performed those tasks, the robots were each programmed to do one task, again and again, on a fixed assembly line, with fixed conveyor belts.
Now, thanks to improved technology, manufacturers can program robots to handle many different welding tasks, at different places on a car body. And they are now using lighter body carriers, which hang from above the assembly line and gently support the vehicle rather than clamp onto it. This means that width and length aren't important as long as the vehicle can fit into the space provided on the assembly line and the robot knows where to weld.
THIS month, at G.M.'s factory in Lansing, Mich., the bodies of Cadillac CTS sedans and the new SRX crossover vehicle were gliding down the line next to one another, processed without a hiccup thanks to a system that G.M. calls C-Flex. In the fall, G.M. will merge in a third model, the STS luxury sedan.
The only part that the three vehicles have in common is a single metal piece that sits below the windshield, through which warm air from the engine compartment is expelled.
G.M.'s ability to pull this off starts at the beginning of the assembly process, where a worker slaps a sticker with a bar code on a rail that runs beneath the vehicle. Along the way, scanners read the information on the sticker and signal to robots down the line the type of automobile that is coming their way. As the body slides into place, the robots automatically align themselves to make the correct welds.
G.M. officials hope to have a flex system in all of its plants, in some form, by 2005. United Auto Workers officials declined to comment on what that might mean for its members, who now number 400,000, down from 1 million in 1978. 
Though local U.A.W. leaders cooperated with G.M. in building the Lansing plant, it employs half the numbers of workers of an old-style G.M. plant.
GARY CHAISON, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., says some workers view the stampede toward flexible manufacturing as the industry's latest effort to eliminate their jobs.
"In the past, auto workers were the aristocrats of manufacturing," he said. "But flexible manufacturing not only makes the employer more profitable and workers more productive, it takes away power from the union. They're really worried about that."
Yet unions cannot ignore the increasing sales and growing market share of foreign manufacturers who use the system, Professor Chaison said.
Indeed, Toyota plans to include its flexible system in a new factory -- its seventh in North America -- under construction in San Antonio. There, it will build big pickups, planning to challenge the Detroit companies in a market that they have dominated for years.

HEADLINE: Betting the Ranch, a Really Big One 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: KINGSVILLE, Tex. 

 BODY:
AUGUST in South Texas, with temperatures soaring above 100 degrees and the humidity forming a dew that simmers on the mesquite brush, is not the easiest time for cowboys on the King Ranch. On such days, the tools of modern ranching, like air-conditioned pickups and helicopters used to shoo cattle, help only so much.
 "There's no good explanation for why we do this work," said Joey Salazar, 34, a leathery fifth-generation kineno, as the residents and employees born on the legendary 825,000-acre ranch call themselves. "I was born on this ranch, and I expect to die on it," Mr. Salazar, sweat-drenched and clad in chaps and boots with spurs, added in Spanish while taking a break from castrating a group of young calves. 
 Watching Mr. Salazar and other kinenos, one might think that little has changed since Richard King, a New York-born steamboat pilot, recruited vaqueros, as cowboys are still called in South Texas, and their families from northern Mexico 150 years ago to form the backbone of what is now about a $300 million-a-year business empire. Kinenos, in fact, translates as king's men. 
The King heirs branched out over time into racehorse breeding and oil and gas exploration and acquired large ranching interests overseas. The Kleberg family, descended from Richard King, held sway over the family's holdings from an austere whitewashed mansion on the ranch.
Were he alive today, Richard King would hardly recognize the enterprise. King Ranch Inc., the privately held company that controls the ranch, is run by a Harvard M.B.A. from outside the Kleberg clan who conducts business from a corporate suite in a Houston high-rise.
And now the King Ranch is betting its future on areas that have nothing to do with cattle, from leasing land to quail hunters to lending the ranch's name to a line of luxurious Ford pickup trucks.
The King Ranch, like some of the nation's other large ranching empires, is confronting a whirlwind of change. Some, like the Waggoner Ranch of North Texas, have been roiled by protracted family feuds. Others, like the Parker Ranch of Hawaii, with its own colorful cowboys called paniolos, have been buffeted by falling beef prices. Not surprisingly, rivals wonder whether King Ranch, too, will stumble.
CHIEF among the challenges, perhaps, is a lawsuit that threatens to tear asunder a chunk of land at the heart of the ranch. Another pressing issue is how to keep cattle relevant in an age of skepticism over the benefits of eating beef. 
Already, the legal assault by descendants of Maj. William W. Chapman has frayed the King Ranch's iconic status by raising questions about its legitimacy. William Chapman, a veteran of the Mexican War, was a business partner of Richard King when the ranch was formed in the 1850's. 
The lawsuit, which appellate decisions have upheld in favor of the Chapman descendants, is under review by the Texas Supreme Court. Reduced to its essentials, it contends that Robert Justus Kleberg, the lawyer who took over the King Ranch after marrying Richard King's favorite daughter in the 1880's, may have swindled William Chapman's widow of half of a roughly 15,000-acre holding at the ranch's core, known as the Rincon de Santa Gertrudis, after an old Spanish land grant. 
According to the Chapman descendants, Robert Kleberg had represented William Chapman's widow, Helen, while secretly working on retainer for Richard King, an accusation that the King Ranch contests. Thus, they argue, a conflict of interest clouded a settlement in the 1880's granting the King Ranch full control of the Rincon de Santa Gertrudis.
Edward Caleb Coker, a descendant of William Chapman and a lawyer and amateur historian in Charlotte, N.C., said he accidentally stumbled upon Robert Kleberg's dual role in the legal challenge while working on a book a decade ago about Helen Chapman, his great-great grandmother. 
Since then, Mr. Coker said, he and other family members have spent $300,000 in legal fees to advance their claim. The lawsuit has ensnarled not only the King Ranch but also Exxon Mobil, which has leased the mineral rights on the ranch since the early 1930's, when it was known as Humble Oil. 
Just half the original Santa Gertrudis land parcel is at stake, about 7,500 acres, or less than 1 percent of the King Ranch's total in South Texas. But losing that land could weaken the ranch, because it includes areas where the Kleberg family has collected payments for decades from Exxon Mobil for energy exploration leases; parts of downtown Kingsville, the Victorian-style town of 26,000 founded on the edge of the ranch a century ago; and the Kingsville Naval Air Station, a top center for pilot training.
It is unclear what damages the Chapman descendants could receive if they win or whether the lawsuit is even valid more than a century after the events in dispute. Mr. Coker said in an interview that he believed a statute of limitations did not apply to the lawsuit because statutes could relate to the time of the discovery of fraud, not the date of the event. 
If Mr. Coker and the other Chapman heirs prevail and the lawsuit is allowed to go to trial, the ruling could set an important precedent for questioning the legitimacy of land titles secured in Texas in the 19th century, especially for Hispanic families who contend that land grants dating to the Spanish empire were taken over by white settlers through fraudulent methods.
King Ranch executives bristle at the mention of the lawsuit. At different times in recent years, the ranch and other parties named in the suit, including Exxon Mobil, have had a combined team of more than 20 lawyers employed to defend their interests from the Chapman heirs' claim.
"We think their claim has no merit whatsoever," said Jack Hunt, the Harvard-trained chief executive of King Ranch Inc., who came to the company after running the large Tejon Ranch in Southern California. "This is a matter that the King Ranch settled more than 100 years ago."
Whatever the outcome of the legal battle, the King Ranch faces challenges on the business front as well, most notably the sluggish demand for beef.
Although per-capita consumption of American beef has recently flattened out, and perhaps even risen in the last year or two as some people switched to meat because of the popular Atkins diet, it remains more than 10 percent lower than it was in 1980.
ALTOGETHER, the King Ranch has a herd of more than 60,000 cattle, preserving its place among the nation's largest active cattle ranches. And some Texas-size superlatives still apply to the ranch, parts of which are near Corpus Christi: it is about the size of Rhode Island, and its fences, if put in a straight line, would stretch from New York City to Fargo, N.D.
In response to the changing business climate, the King Ranch has sold all its properties abroad -- from Australia to Venezuela -- to focus on domestic operations. 
Even as it shed these businesses, King Ranch bolstered its agricultural operations apart from livestock, seeking to lessen its dependency on the volatile and cyclical cattle industry. In doing so, it has become one of the nation's leading agricultural companies in some areas.
Through its control of Consolidated Citrus in Southern Florida, for example, King Ranch has emerged as the nation's top citrus producer. So today Mr. Hunt, a soft-spoken 58-year-old, is as likely to expound on competition from corporate orange producers in Sao Paulo as from Brazil's commercial cattle herd.
In Florida, King Ranch also has about 12,000 acres for growing sugar cane and 3,000 for sod, in addition to large parts of the ranch in South Texas for cotton. Agricultural operations excluding cattle are now responsible for more than half the company's revenue, according to people familiar with King Ranch's finances.
The company's decision to hire Paul Genho, 61, several years ago as vice president and general manager for livestock operations ended an internecine struggle over King Ranch's direction as a family-owned company. Ultimately, the board approved a coup that ousted Stephen J. Kleberg, the great-great grandson of Richard King and the last family member to manage the ranch directly, replacing him with Mr. Genho. To some, including Mr. Kleberg, who became a director at the time of his removal, the move ended an era.
"Sure, I'm nostalgic about the way it was, and I'm sure my grandfather or his father would also feel nostalgic if they were alive," Mr. Kleberg, known around the ranch as Tio, said. "There's always something passing in the ranching life, like the era of the cattle drives, which is just history now. We just need to look ahead to make sure we don't miss out on the changes that will keep us competitive."
The descendants who control the ranch still gather at least once a year in Kingsville to discuss King Ranch affairs. Richard Sugden, a Wyoming physician and Kleberg heir, said he was generally pleased with the direction the company had taken since nonfamily managers took charge.
"The other stuff makes more money, but I see cattle remaining part of the mix for both economic and traditional reasons," said Mr. Sugden, the largest individual shareholder in King Ranch, with more than 5 percent of its stock.
Navigating the desires of the 100 or so heirs who own King Ranch shares falls to Mr. Hunt and, to a degree, Mr. Genho, who has a Ph.D. in animal science from the University of Florida. Mr. Genho speaks passionately about the need to find a balance among cattle raising, hunting and ecotourism.
On the ranch itself, hunting accounts for a growing portion of revenue, about equal to cattle raising. Some pay handsomely to hunt everything from quail to javelinas, the wild pigs also known as peccaries. Large companies account for most of the hunting leases on the ranch.
"Nothing beats quail hunting for entertaining customers," said Bill Davis, a hunting manager for a Louisiana mining company with a lease to hunt on the King Ranch.
The ranch also employs an ornithologist to lead bird watchers on tours, though the ecotourism operations involving the ranch's wildlife still account for a small portion of overall revenue. Wild-animal enthusiasts can also pay for private tours to see, not shoot, bobcats, coyotes and mountain lions.
"I see a day when nonconsumptive wildlife ops outstrip consumptive ops, but it ain't happening yet," said Butch Thompson, King Ranch's director of security and wildlife.
As King Ranch veers into new directions, some elements of its culture are bound to come under pressure. Nowhere are the changes more apparent than among the kinenos.
THE patron system that allowed Richard King and the Klebergs to rule the ranch in an almost cradle-to-grave fashion is slowly being replaced by contemporary management practices. Gone, for instance, are the days when ranch employees were each given 60 pounds of beef and 10 gallons of milk a month as part of their salary.
Salaries remain relatively low, with cowboys earning as little as $20,000 a year, but nearly all the ranch's employees have health insurance and are enrolled in retirement plans. About 300 families continue to live on the ranch and receive free housing, though some employees prefer to live in Kingsville.
A few college-educated kinenos have also risen to management positions, overseeing areas like human resources and financial audits. That is different from the days a century ago when Hispanics were not allowed to become foremen in charge of cowboys and other employees. 
Some things will never change, however, as long as vaqueros are needed to work among the cattle herd under the South Texas sun. Robert J. Cavazos, a retired cowboy foreman and kineno who recently completed a book on the King Ranch, compared working on the ranch to "feeling like a superman."

It took months for Catalyst, a nonprofit research group that focuses on women in business, to find a successor to its president of 10 years, Sheila Wellington. Its choice is Ilene H. Lang, 59, the founding chief executive of AltaVista, the creator of the search engine. 
 Ms. Lang, who has also led several dot-coms, run her own consulting practice and been a partner of First Light Capital, a venture capital firm, has one qualm: trading her beloved Boston, where she has lived since 1961, for New York. But the opportunity to take charge at Catalyst, she said, "is just so compelling." 
 Glenview State Bank in Chicago is making less of a fuss over its departing president, who noted approvingly in a bank newsletter article that Hitler had "reduced unemployment in Germany three times as fast as America's Roosevelt." The Anti-Defamation League and others complained, the article was pulled, an apology was made, and David Raub, who is away on vacation, is now a senior executive vice president.

To the Editor:
 Re "What Investors Should Do Now" (Aug. 10), which described possible investment alternatives in a period of low interest rates: 
 The Federal Reserve's relentless lowering of interest rates has bolstered consumer spending in the short run while clobbering senior savers. To older Americans struggling to live on Social Security and certificates of deposit, the Fed says it's the price that must be paid to stimulate the economy.
Longer-term consequences have been ignored. Because of low interest rates, homeowners have been enticed into buying much more expensive homes and have taken on huge amounts of both new and refinanced mortgage debt.
If the current housing bubble bursts and prices fall below mortgage levels, will the Fed tell stunned homeowners that the surge in foreclosures is the price we have to pay to stimulate the economy?

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Flash Mobs; 
Guess Some People Don't Have Anything Better to Do

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
THE messages come by e-mail or cellphone, with instructions to meet at a specific place and time. Once there, participants in flash mobs, the compulsively deconstructed geek-chic game of the summer, briefly perform some collective activity, then flee.
 Since the first one in mid-June in New York, hundreds of strangers in more than a dozen cities have engaged in such gatherings. The mob in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park last weekend played duck-duck-goose. Last Wednesday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, people took off their shoes and banged them on the street. In one of New York's six flash mobs, the crowddutifully followed instructions to mimic bird calls in Central Park for 20 seconds. 
 Inspired by dozens of media reports and many more Web log postings, enthusiasts in Portland, Ore., Tempe, Ariz., and Toledo, Ohio, are planning their own flash mobs.
But the flash mob juggernaut has now run into a flash mob backlash that may be spreading faster than the fad itself. The collision has ignited a decidedly Internet-style debate on the nature of social connection in the digital age. 
Anti-mobbers lump the flash mobs in the prank tradition of phone-booth stuffing, streaking, flagpole sitting and goldfish-swallowing. E-mail lists like "antimob" and "slashmob" have sprung up, as did a Web site warning that "flashmuggers" are bound to show up "wherever there's groups of young, naive, wealthy, bored fashionistas to be found." And a new definition was circulated last week on several Web sites: "flash mob, noun: An impromptu gathering, organized by means of electronic communication, of the unemployed."
Flash mobbers make no apologies for their lack of political mission, but stake a claim to significance nonetheless. They invoke Dada, the Yippies and "smart mobs," a term coined by the author Howard Rheingold, to describe the use of digital technology to mobilize people quickly for spontaneous creative gatherings.
The organizer of the first flash mob in New York, who will identify himself only as "Bill," argues that flash mobs exploit a desire to escape the virtual world of the Internet and join a real-world electronic underground.
"This isn't a movement, it's a pre-movement," said Bill, a New Yorker who says he works in the "culture industry." "People intuitively understand that it is a powerful thing to very quickly and surprisingly transform a physical space, and one reason they keep coming back to the mobs is there is this feeling that something is being created that can't be ignored."
Critics acknowledge the powerful combination of physical and electronic connection that the mobs thrive on, but many see them as disturbingly empty of purpose. If people are willing to abandon their computer screen only to open umbrellas en masse -- as they did in Austin, Tex., last Monday -- what is the point, critics wonder. 
"From our point of view it's a wasted opportunity," said Tom Sander, executive director of a project on civic engagement conducted by Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. "It's great to have fun, but it would be a lot more interesting if the people organizing this tried to think of ways to utilize it to have people come together to build social networks." 
Some anti-mobbers say the phenomenon is an example of the herd mentality. "How is it possible that a technology with such potential to empower the individual has turned into an irritating clique-machine for the hipster sheep?" asks the Web log flashhack.blogspot.com. 
Others just find the events hopelessly contrived. (The organizers take pains to protect their identities, and instructions on the activity of the moment are typically handed out on pieces of paper to people who respond to the anonymous e-mail invitation.) 
FLASH mob organizers admit to being a bit taken aback at how quickly their game has been adopted. When "Jane," a San Francisco organizer, sent out anonymous invitations to her friends in June, they deleted the e-mail, she recalled. When she asked about it, they told her that they thought it was silly.
But after Wired News, an online publication, posted an article about flash mobs on its Web site, interest began to spiral upward. Now, Jane says, "I'm getting invited by my friends to my own mobs." About 350 people showed up for the flash mob in Golden Gate Park. 
Jane, 29, says the mobs answer a yearning for basic fun in a time of war, terrorism threats and recession. That it is a new kind of fun, not controlled by the usual entertainment conglomerates, adds to the appeal.
"We have protests in San Francisco all the time," she said. "The whole point of this is that there is no point." 
But that may not be for long. 
Paul Resnick, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information, says the flash mob is simply one of several early forays into building stronger ties between strangers by way of computer. Flash-mob organizing, Mr. Resnick argues, will inevitably be used in political campaigns and corporate marketing. 
Even some who have enjoyed participating in the mobs say the trend is winding down. Fears that the mob mechanism is already being taken over by corporate interests have surfaced on Web logs. A mob planned for Toronto was called off when it seemed that it could be overrun by the news media and the police.
"The flash mob seems to be finished," wrote Christina Ray, an artist in Brooklyn who attended two New York mobs, on her Web log last week. 
"I think people will remember it as a great social experiment with the technology we have right now," Ms. Ray said. "But it's beginning to get sort of goofy."

Chief executives, be warned: Graef Crystal's calculator is humming again. And the latest statistical salvo from Mr. Crystal, that relentless tallier of corporate pay, could give them red faces to match their bulging wallets. 
 By Mr. Crystal's reckoning, the average chiefs total compensation is a staggering $12 million, with stock options accounting for 60 percent. Mr. Crystal, applying a complex formula to data provided by Equilar, figures that when pay is higher than average, fully 86 percent of the difference cannot be explained by the company's size or performance.

Ah, Parisian Ambiance; Oh, Manhattan Regulations

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
Even on a sunny day, Al Roker won't be dining outdoors at Ferrier Restaurant this summer. 
 The French bistro, a favorite of the weatherman and other Upper East Side notables, was stripped of its cafe license this summer. The ensuing spat has become a cause celebre among restaurant owners, who say the harsh treatment points to the unfairness of cafe enforcement rules that went into effect this year. 
 For 14 years, Ferrier has operated a 12-table sidewalk cafe on East 65th Street near Madison Avenue. When the restaurant applied for a license renewal this year, Community Board 8 gave it unanimous approval, saying it had received no complaints about the place. 
 But the city's Department of Consumer Affairs rejected the application, anyway, saying no sidewalk cafes were allowed in the area, in the Madison Avenue Preservation District. Apparently, the city erred in giving Ferrier a sidewalk license in the past. 
 Thinking it was a bureaucratic oversight, the owners went ahead and set up a cafe, as they do each spring. They quickly received two violations. Invoking the new law, the second called for $2,000 in fines and padlocking the entire restaurant for 30 days. Ferrier is appealing the penalties and is fighting to reinstate the cafe license. 
 "It's so crazy," said Irving Sutton, an owner of Ferrier, who added that he planned to lay off 10 people because of lost income. "This really killed the business." 
 Elected officials have rallied to Ferrier's side. "I believe the Department of Consumer Affairs has picked the wrong restaurant as a target of its new enforcement powers," said Borough President C. Virginia Fields. "With our sluggish economy, I should think the city would be interested in resolving this issue, especially since jobs, tax revenue and a viable business are at stake."
 This is not the first time restaurant owners have criticized the new sidewalk rules. In March, the city agreed to scale back the fees for new licenses after restaurants complained of 600 percent increases. 
 But city officials say the new rules are addressing residents' complaints about noisy andillegal cafes. In the case of Ferrier, they argue, the city is simply enforcing the rules evenhandedly. 
 "We are hoping this will get the attention of restaurant owners," said Dina Improta, a Consumer Affairs spokeswoman. "Before this legislation was enacted, the only thing we could do is issue fine after fine. We would seize their furniture, and they would replace it the next day." DENNY LEE

Economic Slump? Umbrella Sales Are Great

BYLINE:  By ERIN CHAN

 BODY:
It's nice to let a smile be your umbrella, but sometimes you need an umbrella to be your umbrella. Especially this summer.
 As the storm clouds roll endlessly across the city sky, there are those who actually delight in the deluge because they profit from the downpours. And chief among the precipitation profiteers is Burt Biderman, umbrella maker and wholesaler. 
 This summer, when carrying an umbrella seems as essential as wearing underwear, Mr. Biderman has watched sales at his Liberty Umbrella Company in Midtown soar 50 percent from last year, a statistic that almost makes this company president -- who wears gold wire-rimmed glasses and normally exudes seriousness -- want to, well, sing in the rain. 
 "We've been going crazy filling orders, but it's a good crazy," Mr. Biderman said. "No rain makes you feel old, oh my God. I feel bad for resort people, but economically, I'm very happy." 
 From the beginning of June until last Wednesday, New York received 19.48 inches of rain, already making it the seventh wettest for those three months since Central Park started measuring precipitation in 1869, according to Peter Wichrowski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
 If the skies squeeze out three more inches of rain by the end of this month, the record for the wettest June, July and August -- set in 1975 when 22.4 inches of rain fell on the city -- will be broken, said Stephen S. Fybish, a local weather historian. The average for those three months is 12.68 inches.
 For Mr. Biderman, there is no question that the rain has driven up sales, but his company also holds the license that allows it to turn the prints of the London designer Lulu Guinness into patterns for umbrellas. These handbag-turned-umbrella prints do not mirror the mundane black of those $3 street umbrellas but rather radiate in bright red with Scottie dogs, in Paris street scenes with blue Vespa-like scooters and in almost everything else that would make one forget about the rain.
 Those umbrellas were especially popular at Liberty's booth last week at the New York International Gift Fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. "Oh, my god, yesterday, we were so busy," said Bonni Orloff, a company vice president who lives in Midtown. Rain aside, it did not hurt that the Guinness designs had been seen on HBO's "Sex and the City." 
 Corinna Vere Nicoll, also working at the Liberty booth, did not act quite as charitable toward the rain.
 "It's very irritating," said Ms. Vere Nicoll, who lives on the Upper East Side but comes from London. "You just don't know what to wear. If you wear jeans, your pants will get wet, but if you wear a skirt, your shoes will get wet. It's depressing for summer, especially since it's my first summer in New York. Americans think London is the city that always rains, but since I've been here, this is more rain than I've ever seen in London." 
 By the way, Ms. Vere Nicoll attended the fair as the sales assistant for Lulu Guinness handbags -- not for the umbrellas. And even the most ardent purse lover knows that plopping a handbag over your head in the rain will do about as much good in keeping dry as smiling will. ERIN CHAN

HEADLINE: BRONX UP CLOSE; 
Retail Chains Arrive, but With Weak Links

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
WHEN Starbucks opened its first Bronx store at 314 East Fordham Road in 1999, it added an upscale touch to a bustling commercial strip and was heralded as another sign of economic revival. Fernando Ferrer, the borough president then, brewed a ceremonial first espresso. 
 Four years later, the lines of customers at 314 East Fordham Road are longer than Starbucks' marketers could have dreamed. But it is no longer a Starbucks. The coffeehouse declined to renew its lease and slipped out quietly in May 2002 and was replaced by a T-Mobile store. 
 Interviewed last week, a Starbucks spokesman cited "competitive reasons" for the closing, but refused to give details. Prevailing wisdom on the streets of the Bronx, however, goes something like this: rushed families looking for bargains on clothes were unwilling to slow down and squander those savings on Frappuccinos. The T-Mobile store offers a more popular service: a place to pay cellphone bills in cash. 
 The experiences of Starbucks and T-Mobile underscore just how tricky the Bronx has been for national chains. There has been a lot of success in a borough once ignored by big retail names. Two Home Depots have opened since 1997. Kmart came to Bruckner Plaza in 1999; Barnes & Noble opened in Bay Plaza the same year, with nary a locally owned bookstore for miles around to complain. (The only neighbor to put up a fight was Nobody Beats the Wiz, worried about CD sales.) A Target is under construction near Marble Hill; BJ's signed a lease in the southeast Bronx. And even Starbucks was successful on its second try, with a booming store in diverse, middle-class Parkchester.
 Rafael Salaberrios, president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which advises the borough president, said retailers abandoned the inner city so completely that they finally realized they had gone too far. "Now they're seeing an immense underserved population," he said. His organization conducted a study that found that from 1996 to 2001, retail employment in the Bronx rose 12.5 percent. The corporation is producing a CD-ROM to attract businesses to the Bronx.
 But the market is complex, and the borough still battles an outdated -- or at least greatly exaggerated -- reputation for urban decay. Ikea passed over the Bronx after plans for a nearby store in New Rochelle fell through. Local groups have had a tough time getting Marriott to look seriously at a South Bronx hotel. And after a decade of stumbles, the New Horizons Retail Shopping Center, with Pathmark, GNC and Radio Shack, is supposed to open in Crotona Park East in November. But so many other projected dates have come and gone, it is hard to say what will happen.
 Gary Axelbank, host of the BronxTalk cable television shows, said the failures are in part attributable to local politics. "You need good urban planning, and that falls to the community boards and City Council people to be well organized and not do things in a haphazard way," he said. "We haven't always had that in every neighborhood in the Bronx."
 Retail, of course, is not an economic cure-all. Unemployment in the Bronx is still the highest in the state, and efforts to attract company headquarters or back-office operations in the Bronx have not yet born much fruit. The lack of bigger firms is a sensitive issue. When it was suggested that McDonald's, with 2,250 employees, might be the Bronx's biggest for-profit employer, Mr. Salaberrios said he doubted it, but could not cite a bigger one.
 The borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., said retail is not a priority -- he would like to see medical laboratories move in to serve the borough's mammoth hospitals and art-handling companies take over empty warehouse space. But Mr. Carrion, an urban planner by trade, said bringing in retail chains boosts the Bronx's image. "There's a ripple effect to this that defies the stereotypes and image of the Bronx," he said.
 Mr. Carrion's definition of success underscores just how far the Bronx has to go. Earlier this year, even the opening of a Mail Boxes Etc. merited a presidential news release and a ribbon cutting.
 One contributing factor may be the lack of an active chamber of commerce in the Bronx. There was no chamber for years, and even though a new chamber started in March, five months later it is virtually impossible for an outsider to get in touch with it: it has no Web site and no listed phone number, and an e-mail address found on several Bronx Web sites is inactive. 
 That leaves the work to politicians and nonprofits. Assemblyman Carl E. Heastie, who represents the northeast Bronx, procured financing for the North Bronx Business Outreach Center, which he hopes will lure a better mix of businesses and a big retail name to the not-so-bustling northern reaches of White Plains Road. "We have three hair salons on the same block," he lamented.
 The arrival of Barnes & Noble is at least in part attributable to Assemblyman Stephen B. Kaufman. In 1998, he publicly and vociferously denounced Barnes & Noble for ignoring the Bronx. The company's chairman, Leonard Riggio, shot a nasty letter to him. "Do you have some sort of misplaced crusader complex which needs fixing?" he wrote. But 21 months later, Barnes & Noble opened its store to rave reviews. 
 Although local merchants often fear the competition of big-box stores, and residents fear traffic and construction, community leaders and academics generally say a mix of big and small businesses is the key. 
 "From where we stand it's an absolute necessity," said Neil Parriser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Development Corporation, or SoBro. "To not have large names is a big mistake. It relegates you to a whole different psychology and you lose out on the market, because people want to come to the Kmarts, they want to come to the Staples." Staples, in fact, plans a store in the long-troubled Hub shopping district, in an unused three-block stretch that has long been marked by SoBro for development.
 And even though chains siphon profits to headquarters elsewhere, they do bring jobs. "The reason big retail chains are good," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, "is that they employ lots of people and lots of youth. Retailing is a gateway job."
 What kind of retail, of course, also matters. While McDonald's flourishes, the Bronx has the lowest Starbucks per capita ratio in the city. Even affluent Riverdale, where many residents refuse to use the word "Bronx" in their mailing address, has not attracted one. The result: in Manhattan, there is a Starbucks for every 11,000 people; in Staten Island, one for every 150,000, in Queens, one for every 185,000 and in Brooklyn one for every 500,000. In the Bronx, the lone Parkchester location theoretically serves 1.3 million.
 Yet a recent visit revealed a scene strikingly similar to any other Starbucks. On a lazy summer weekday afternoon, the store was busy. A family stopped by after shopping, teenagers gossiped, an opera singer relaxed with coffee, a teacher took notes.
 The teacher, Anthony Lett, who had made the long trip from his home halfway across the Bronx, near Yankee Stadium, said the borough could support just about any retail operation. The singer, Johnny Maldonado, agreed. "I understand the stereotype, but it's really a misconception," he said, nestled into a chair by the window. "You have all kinds of people living in the Bronx. Our money is just as green as anyone else's."
