HEADLINE: Judge Rules Against City On Welfare

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
A federal judge has rejected the Giuliani administration's efforts to move ahead with its sweeping welfare-to-work project, ruling that the city cannot turn any more of its welfare centers into job centers, which discourage the poor from seeking public assistance.
In the ruling, made public yesterday, the judge found no reliable evidence that the city had stopped illegally denying emergency food stamps, Medicaid and cash aid to eligible applicants -- like pregnant women with young children and disabled, homeless adults -- and refused to lift the temporary ban he imposed last year on the conversion of welfare offices. 
 The judge, William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan, ruled that the audits the city gave the court to show improvement in its practices were "hastily conceived" and "fundamentally flawed" and that "the deck was stacked in favor of job centers."
The judge said he rejected the city's argument "that errors and deficiencies at job centers were isolated problems."
"On the contrary, the evidence pointed to systemwide failures resulting from H.R.A.'s hurried conversions," he added, referring to the Human Resources Administration. The court, he said, "declines the city's invitation to take a leap of faith" that its plan of correction is now working.
In a victory for the lawyers for the poor who brought the case, Reynolds v. Giuliani, the judge granted class-action status to the plaintiffs. That allows them to sue the city and the state for violations of their civil rights under federal law on behalf of all poor New Yorkers who have sought aid at job centers or may in the future.
The city had taken the unusual step of hiring a top Washington law firm, Covington & Burling, to help lawyers for the city present its case that it should be allowed to turn 12 remaining welfare centers into job centers like the 16 converted since the program began in April 1998.
The city has made job centers the heart of an effort to discourage people from seeking cash assistance, as allowed under the federal welfare overhaul of 1996. Job centers require that applicants look for work or prepare for jobs and pass rigorous eligibility tests before their applications are accepted.
But in his decision last year, the judge found that in the process the city was routinely delaying or denying applications for food stamps and Medicaid in violation of federal law, and denying cash aid to many who were eligible under state law. At welfare offices, all applications for benefits are processed with fewer hurdles.
Mr. Giuliani belittled the judge's new ruling against the conversions, calling it "irrational" and "rambling." He maintained that it would have little or no effect, because the job centers operating now have already worked.
"The city has been transformed," he said during a news conference at the Seaport Job Center, pointing to a chart that showed welfare caseloads had shrunk to 572,872 as of June from 1,160,593 in March 1995.
"This job center is part of that transformation," he said. "Now, when you come in here and you want welfare, the first thing we try to do is try to find you a job, because we really care about you, we really love you and we really understand the human personality a lot better than the people who brought us dependency."
But more than two years after the welfare commissioner, Jason Turner, began the ambitious welfare overhaul, the judge's detailed and highly critical assessment of the Human Resources Administration's auditing methods renews questions about the city's welfare statistics.
"If the city's claiming success, I don't know what data they're relying upon," Hwan Hui Helen Lee, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, said yesterday. "The decision shows the city is not really taking a serious look at who is being denied the opportunity to file an application for these benefits.
"These are hungry people who are coming to job centers as a last resort, as a safety net, because they have not been able to take advantage of this economic revival that's happening in New York City."
One problem cited by Judge Pauley was that a city computer system automatically purged the record of welfare applications withdrawn the same day they were filed, and wiped out any evidence of multiple applications made by people who had been wrongly rejected the first time.
Judge Pauley also cited affidavits filed by the plaintiffs' lawyers, who interviewed applicants at job centers in October, November and December and outlined probable violations in 61 out of 225 cases.
Those cases included a 24-year-old woman in her ninth month of pregnancy who was told she was ineligible for food stamps because she was not a citizen, and a 17-year-old woman who had no milk or pampers for her 10-month-old baby and was turned away after waiting all day to apply for emergency aid because "the worker told her she was in the wrong center for her zip code."
According to federal regulations, both women should have received assistance. Instead, the women withdrew their applications.
Experts for the plaintiffs said such cases were unlikely to show up in the city's sample of 1,893 cases, drawn from about 168,000 public assistance applications filed last year, because the sample excluded all but a dozen cases that had been withdrawn.
One method the city now uses to monitor welfare workers is sending "spot-checkers" who pose as poor people and ask for an application form. But the judge said the program's effectiveness had been tempered by "the failure of spot-checkers to adequately vary the scenario they present," suggesting that workers learn to recognize the testers. Also, he said, since checkers do not turn in those forms, the city never finds out whether such applications would have been accepted.
The city said the job centers were performing better than traditional welfare centers, and had improved their practices.
But the judge ruled that because of the array of problems in the audit, "it is difficult to trust any of the extrapolations made by the city defendants comparing the performance of job and income support centers, or assessing the performance of job centers over time."
"It is safe to conclude only that the centers' true performance figures are probably much different than those presented by the city," he said.

HEADLINE: Seton Hall Professor Is Killed With Family in Copter Crash

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE, N.J., July 24

 BODY:
The usual stillness of summer on the Seton Hall University campus here was broken over the weekend by news that a popular economics professor, his wife and their two children had been killed on Friday in a helicopter crash in Hawaii.
John Jordan, 55, of Shrewsbury, a professor at the university's Stillman School of Business, and his family were killed while vacationing on the island of Maui. The pilot and two other passengers of the sightseeing helicopter also died. 
 "Many days we have wonderful things happening here, but like any family we have highs and lows," said Prof. Karen E. Boroff, the acting dean of the business school. "So we take time to grieve."
The deaths are the fourth sorrowful incident at the university this year. On Jan. 19, three students were killed and dozens injured in a dormitory fire that led to revelations of dozens of fire code violations. In March, a small fire in a campus laundry room injured nine students and workers. And in May, a 23-year-old student died two days after being abducted from a street near the campus and shot in the head by a former boyfriend.
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the helicopter crash, which occurred around 1 p.m. in a mountainous region near the northwest coast of Maui.
Because of poor weather, fading light and steep terrain, rescuers were not able to reach the crash site until 7 a.m. Saturday, when members of the Maui Police and Fire Departments used ropes to descend to the scene, the police said.
The crash victims, in addition to Professor Jordan's wife, Jan Herscovitz, a psychiatrist in Monmouth County, and their children, Maxwell, 16, and Lindsey, 15, were the pilot, Lawrence J. Kirsch of Kihei, Hawaii, and two passengers whose identities have not been release pending positive identification, the police said.
Today, the Seton Hall campus was typically quiet for July, except for members of the Class of 2004, who were already present for orientation. Some of them would have been students in the two freshman microeconomics classes that Professor Jordan, known as an enthusiastic teacher and natural mentor, was scheduled to have this fall, along with a graduate course in microeconomics and finance.
Professor Jordan earned a doctorate in economics from the State University of New York at Albany, and arrived at Seton Hall in 1977 as an associate. He was granted tenure in 1983, and a professorship in 1989.
But his enthusiasm was not confined to economics. Friends and colleagues described him today as an adventurous traveler who took advantage of his academic schedule to take his family on prolonged, often educational journeys. He was an avid wind surfer and basketball fan, and when he traveled to Australia on sabbatical in 1992, a friend said, he had someone videotape all the home games of his beloved Seton Hall basketball team.
Kristin Kucsma, a former student of Professor Jordan's who is now an adjunct professor at Seton Hall, said he was "dedicated beyond belief" to his students and his family. She described Ms. Herscovitz as "a very down-to-earth person and always very welcoming."
The president of Seton Hall, Msgr. Robert Sheehan, said, "This is a huge loss for our community."
The helicopter in which the family was flying was registered to Blue Hawaiian Company, which also does business under the name D.B.A. Helicopter Services, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Blue Hawaiian would not comment.
The pilot was involved in a midair collision in Healy, Alaska, on Aug. 4, 1996, according to the F.A.A. In that accident, for which Mr. Kirsch was grounded for 45 days, the rotor blade of his helicopter swiped the landing gear of a Cessna he had failed to see because of what he said was sun glare, according to F.A.A. records.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE POLL;
POLL FINDS VOTERS RELYING ON ISSUES TO SHAPE THE RACE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush prepare to frame their messages at the national conventions, most Americans say they already perceive pronounced differences on how they would handle health care, taxes, the environment and the selection of Supreme Court justices, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll showed.
For all the focus on how the candidates are dashing toward the center politically and in some cases sounding alike, more than 7 out of 10 Americans said there were genuine differences between them. More than half of the public thinks those contrasts are more about issues than about personal qualities. 
 For instance, 58 percent of Americans said that if Mr. Gore was elected president, he would make health care more affordable for everyone; 36 percent said that of Mr. Bush. Forty-four percent said Mr. Bush would be more likely to reduce taxes; 25 percent said that of Mr. Gore. Seventy percent said Mr. Gore would be likely to make real progress in protecting the environment; 44 percent said that of Mr. Bush.
The biggest split came over abortion. Sixty-two percent said Mr. Gore would probably pick Supreme Court justices who would vote to keep abortion legal; 43 percent said Mr. Bush would be unlikely to do so.
While impressions of the candidates seemed to be taking shape, voters indicated that they were far from having made up their minds. Several signs, in fact, pointed to a competitive contest. About a third said they could switch their votes before Election Day. And significant portions of each candidate's supporters said they had reservations with their current favorite.
Mr. Bush continued to lead Mr. Gore among all registered voters, but his advantage was within the poll's margin of sampling error. In a two-person race, registered voters said they would back Mr. Bush over Mr. Gore by 46 percent to 40 percent. In a four-way race, with Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the expected Reform Party nominee, Mr. Bush would draw 44 percent; Mr. Gore, 38 percent; Mr. Nader, 5 percent; and Mr. Buchanan, 3 percent.
The nationwide telephone poll was taken Thursday through Sunday with 953 adults, including 743 registered voters. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus four percentage points for each candidate.
"The jury is still out with this campaign," Samuel Hathaway, 36, a poll respondent from Vancouver, Wash., said in a follow-up interview. Mr. Hathaway said he planned to vote for Mr. Gore but added that could change his mind.
"I just want to hear more from the campaign itself," he said. "Right now I usually vote Democratic. Al Gore has been around for eight years as vice president so I'm sure he knows how to do the job. But I also like the Reform Party, and I want to hear them out as well."
A poll respondent who backed Mr. Bush, Kay Wimberly, 47, also said her leanings are by no means irreversible.
"The primary reason I might change my mind is because it's so early on in the campaign," said Ms. Wimberly, a graphic designer from La Crosse, Wis. "A lot of things can come to the surface between now and then. The candidates will make their positions more well known as the election draws nearer. Education is an important issue to me and to the future of this country. I'm not entirely sold on Bush's position because I feel some of his claims are somewhat vague."
In another finding that carried significant implications in the battle for control of Congress as well as the presidential campaign, the poll found that the Republican Party had recovered from the negative image it had after the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
Yet a heartening sign for Mr. Gore as the candidates compete for independent and moderate voters is that the public's impression of Mr. Bush's ideology, while once equally divided between moderate and conservative, is increasingly conservative.
By contrast, the perception of Mr. Gore is that he is becoming more moderate and less liberal.
A majority of Americans, 54 percent, now hold a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. During the impeachment proceedings last year, only 33 percent held a positive view of the party. Democrats had hoped to use the Republicans' handling of impeachment as a campaign issue.
The survey also underscored that critiques the Republicans and Democrats have made about their opponents may not be convincing.
Efforts by Republicans to link Mr. Gore to the scandals of the Clinton administration do not seem to have worked. A plurality of voters said the November election was not about Mr. Clinton. And majorities gave Mr. Gore high marks for personal integrity and character -- something they never did for Mr. Clinton.
The argument of many Democrats that Mr. Bush lacked sufficient command of issues did not seem to be working either. Despite Mr. Gore's eight years of involvement in policy at the White House, that has not convinced voters that he is any more prepared for the presidency.
Sixty-six percent said Mr. Bush has strong qualities of leadership; 55 percent said that of Mr. Gore. More people think Mr. Gore understands the complicated problems a president has to deal with, but the difference was not especially significant. Eighty-four percent said Mr. Gore understands those problems; 73 percent said that about Mr. Bush.
And while even Mr. Bush has acknowledged that "my foreign affairs experience is Mexico," voters said they have as much confidence in him as they do in Mr. Gore's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis. For both candidates, voters were roughly split in whether they were confident or uneasy about how they would handle foreign crises.
One of Mr. Bush's strengths is that people still see him as eminently likable, while one of Mr. Gore's best assets is that he is seen generally as being on the right side of issues.
Mr. Bush drew high marks for straight talk, leadership and trustworthiness, while Mr. Gore was viewed as caring more about the needs and problems of voters.
In some areas, the differences were largely of degree. For instance, both men were seen by a majority of voters as pandering -- saying what they think voters want to hear. But Mr. Gore was viewed that way by a larger majority. Mr. Bush continued to be seen favorably by a majority of voters who have formed an opinion of him. Mr. Gore was seen equally favorably and unfavorably, but that was a small improvement from the primary season.
While the Times/CBS Poll showed no appreciable tightening of the race, other national polls have shown that Mr. Gore has made some progress in reducing Mr. Bush's advantage. For example, the most recent Gallup Poll measured 48 percent for Mr. Bush and 46 percent for Mr. Gore. Earlier in July, the margin was 9 percentage points.
Mr. Gore's supporters said they were marginally more certain about sticking with the vice president than Mr. Bush's backers were. But 4 in 10 of each candidate's supporters said they had reservations about their candidate. One bright spot for Mr. Gore was that he has made inroads in the Northeast since May, when the last Times/CBS poll was taken.
But Mr. Gore cannot seem to shake a perception that he is the inevitable loser. Only 29 percent of the voters polled said they expected him to win, compared with 49 percent who said Mr. Bush would win.
For all the differences between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, the one issue on which the public sees them both as responsible is on the economy. Roughly three-quarters of Americans think either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would likely make sure that the country's economy remained hearty.
The public continued to put health care, Social Security and Medicare at the top of the list of problems they wanted the next president and Congress to work on. Those issues are all viewed as Democratic strong points.
But taxes, an issue Mr. Bush has championed for months, is beginning to make its way onto the public's list of most pressing concerns.
While the survey found that the Republican Party had rebounded, Democrats also were held in high esteem, with 56 of those polled registering a favorable view of that party.
More people said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for the House in their district than said they would vote for the Republican. But the spread -- 41 percent to 37 percent -- was well within the margin of error. And national polls cannot predict an election in an individual district. But they can provide some insight into the general trend.
The Democratic Party continued to hold the advantage on many issues that voters said they were concerned about, including Social Security, making the tax system fair, improving education, providing affordable health care, protecting the environment and caring about the average person. The Republican strengths, according to those polled, are keeping the military potent and preserving family values.
The two political parties that have not fared well are the Reform Party and Green Party. Both are seen negatively by most people. While poll respondents said they had a pretty good sense now of the parties and the candidates, several acknowledged that their views might change.
Duane Taff, 33, a radio station music director in Grand Rapids, Mich., said he was leaning toward Mr. Gore. "If there is an issue between now and November that I feel passionate about, I might go the other way," Mr. Taff said. "Two months ago, an issue like that would have been gas prices, but that's starting to stabilize. Something like that might come up a week before the election. And if one of the candidates makes an effort, and I like his idea on it, I could easily go either way."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Sunday with 953 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 743 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to account for household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For registered voters, for example, it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for instance, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Environmentalist Gore Gives Salve to Labor

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, July 24

 BODY:
With three weeks left before the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Al Gore turned his focus today to uniting two important Democratic constituencies that have sometimes been at odds: environmentalists and labor unions.
At an event on the tree-lined banks of the Grand River in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mr. Gore picked up the endorsement of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's most politically potent environmental groups. But the crowd of nearly 200 people was filled with unionized workers, and Mr. Gore devoted much of his speech to assuring them that strong environmental policies would not necessarily hurt companies or their employees. 
 "We're here today to tell America that as we move toward a cleaner, safer, healthier environment, we are going to create more jobs, not fewer jobs, for American families," he said. "A stronger economy and better environment go together."
Mr. Gore is trying to win the endorsement of the United Automobile Workers, a political powerhouse in Michigan, where he and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, are in a closely contested race.
The U.A.W.'s leaders have been angry with the vice president over his strong support for global trade, and some of them worry that administration policies intended to reduce air pollution and slow global warming could drive up the cost of cars and hurt the auto industry.
But in recent weeks Mr. Gore has had several conversations with Stephen Yokich, the union's president, to try to work out their differences, Democratic officials said. Mr. Gore's aides are hoping that the union's executive committee will vote to endorse him at its next meeting, on Aug. 8, six days before the Democratic convention opens.
This afternoon Mr. Gore also took a poke at Governor Bush for the intense media attention that has been attracted to his efforts to choose a running mate. Mr. Gore suggested that the governor had purposely played out his deliberations in public, in an effort to build excitement about his campaign.
"I've handled my process differently than the Bush campaign has handled theirs," the vice president told reporters. "I've kept it private and, I hope, dignified, out of respect for the individuals, the men and women, who are under consideration. And I am going to continue to approach it that way."
But just minutes before, in what seemed like a clear attempt to stoke interest in his own deliberations, Mr. Gore's aides notified reporters that he would be meeting on Tuesday morning with former Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, who is helping him cull his list of prospective vice-presidential nominees.
Asked what qualities he was looking for in a running mate, Mr. Gore replied: "I'm going to pick the person who I believe can become the president on a moment's notice, if necessary; who also has a good working relationship with me, or the prospect of one; and who shares my values, someone who's willing to fight for people and not the powerful."
His appearance in Grand Rapids today was hardly the only one this week devoted to his shoring up the Democratic base. Afterward he flew here to Cleveland, where he campaigned among hard-hat workers at a construction site and then met with steelworkers as well as a police union chief. And on Wednesday, he flies to Chicago to address the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.
Today Robert Cox, president of the Sierra Club, picked up on a theme Mr. Gore has been sounding recently, arguing that Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas proves that he would support federal policies that would help corporate polluters and ruin the environment.
"If we fail to elect Al Gore, if George Bush becomes president, we could face a very different America," Mr. Cox said. "We could face what the people of Texas face now: air pollution, water pollution, toxic waste, record numbers of violations of our clean-air and clean-water standards, environmental laws unenforced, and corporate polluters unchecked and out of control."
In reply, Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the governor had actually reduced air and water pollution in Texas, and he ridiculed the Sierra Club's endorsement of Mr. Gore.
"It's amazing that he's rolling out endorsements from traditionally Democratic groups," Mr. Bartlett said. "This is a campaign that's still trying to solidify its party and its base."
In his remarks at the Sierra Club event, Mr. Gore said he had been ahead of his time in understanding environmental problems, having learned about the dangers of pesticides and soil erosion as a boy on his father's Tennessee farm, and about global warming as a college student. In those days, Mr. Gore said, "if you believed in global warming, people thought you were part of the flat earth society."

HEADLINE: Musical Lease Game Over, Accounting Firm's Rent Soars

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The dearth of office space in Manhattan sparked a cutthroat game of musical chairs earlier this month among some of the city's top corporations that stretched from Fifth Avenue to Times Square and will cost both the winners and the losers millions of dollars.
When the music ended, it was clear that Arthur Andersen, the giant accounting company, would be bounced out of 14 floors at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, between 54th and 55th Streets, when its lease expired. With nowhere else to go, the company has been forced to begin negotiations with Boston Properties about taking an expensive 400,000 square feet in the developer's long-proposed 48-story Times Square Tower, on the south side of 42nd Street, between Seventh Avenue and Broadway. 
 "Andersen was outraged," said one real estate executive who had been working with the accounting concern. "They'd been a tenant for years. But the investment bankers probably gave the landlord the rent they wanted without quibbling."
Sanford C. Bernstein Inc., the money manager for wealthy clients that is displacing Arthur Andersen, won the game. But it will have to wait four years until Andersen moves out. In the meantime, Donald J. Trump, Bernstein's current landlord at the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue, wants to raise the rent from from $39 a square foot to $175 a square foot, or more than $27 million a year, when the company's lease expires in 15 months.
The costly nature of the game, which also involved Alliance Capital and the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation, is only the latest illustration of an overheated real estate market, in which large blocks of prime office space have all but disappeared from the city's skyscrapers as vacancy rates have dropped to all-time lows: 2.4 percent in Midtown and 2.2 percent downtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
"It's really crazy out there," said Jonathan L. Mechanic, a real estate partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. "You need to be decisive in this market. If you're not, the space won't be there."
Only a few years ago, one of four floors sat vacant in Lower Manhattan, and Midtown was doing only slightly better. With a resurgent economy and little new construction, companies have gobbled up much of what is available. The average rent for first-class office space in Midtown has jumped to $52.42 a square foot and as much as $100 a square foot in the most desirable buildings.
The competition for space has grown fierce. Earlier this year, iVillage Inc. thought it had a lease for 100,000 square feet at 1440 Broadway, near 40th Street. But at the last possible moment, Conde Nast jumped in, snatching the space away from the dot-com.
Arthur Andersen's troubles began about three months ago, when the accounting company began debating whether to stay in what is known as the Alliance Capital Building, the 50-story tower on the Avenue of the Americas, or move to a new location. The Fisher real estate family, which owns the tower, asked the company to decide by June 15. Later, Andersen asked for an extension until June 30.
But on June 20, Alliance Capital Management, an asset management company, announced that it was buying Sanford C. Bernstein for $3.5 billion. Bernstein had been negotiating a move to the old McGraw-Hill Building, a 54-story tower at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets, which the Rockefeller Group owns. But Alliance Capital insisted that Sanford Bernstein move into its building and opened talks with the Fishers about taking over the Arthur Andersen space, executives on both sides of the talks said.
"They were an eyelash away from finalizing the deal," said one executive at the Rockefeller Group. "Then the Alliance merger came up."
The Fishers quickly negotiated the terms of a deal with Alliance Capital just in case Arthur Andersen decided to move out. "June 30 came and went without a peep from Andersen," said one executive who works with the Fishers. "We were shocked that anyone in this market would let a major block of space slip away."
But one person working with Arthur Andersen said the company felt spurned by its longtime landlord, who "never even called" before signing a deal with Alliance Capital.
That forced Arthur Andersen to look at a costly alternative proposed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the co-chairman of Boston Properties, who has long sought a tenant for the proposed Times Square Tower. Mr. Zuckerman, who is also the co-publisher of The Daily News, is building a tower for Ernst & Young, another accounting concern, across the street at the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. Most real estate executives did not expect Mr. Zuckerman to find a tenant for the project, which sits over the subway and has relatively small floors. Andersen changed all that.
Today, officials from Sanford Bernstein will meet with Mr. Trump to talk about extending their lease at the G.M. Building until Arthur Andersen moves out. "We consider Sanford Bernstein a wonderful tenant," Mr. Trump said yesterday, "but we'd get more rent if they left."
But Alliance Capital may not be willing to pay the price. "I'm dubious about paying $175 a square foot," said Dave H. Williams, the chairman of Alliance Capital. "We'll move to curbside if that's the choice."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
On the North Fork, Dreams of Napa

DATELINE: PECONIC, N.Y., July 20

 BODY:
It's high summer out here on the North Fork of Long Island. The corn is sweet, the first peaches are in, and in the vineyards, the still-green merlot and cabernet franc are looking good. It will be long weeks, maybe two months, before the pickers arrive and the air grows heady with the seductive aroma of crushed grapes.
But don't be deceived by the bucolic calm. The Long Island wine business is booming; it's almost giddy from its own success. Handsome new wineries are opening, old ones are changing hands for astonishing prices, new vineyards are springing up from Aquebogue to Greenport, and suddenly, there isn't enough wine to go around. 
 What's more, these developments are not due to the hesitant little band of artisans and amateurs who started it all in converted barns and potato fields some 30 years ago, seeking a simpler agrarian lifestyle, so they thought. The current scene is made up of self-assured professionals backed by deep-pocketed investors, who are also seeking a different lifestyle -- as owners of Napa Valley-like showcase wineries making prize-winning and sought-after wines.
World-class wines may be a few years away, but the money, the talent and the will to make them are all in place. It is, everyone out here will tell you, just a matter of time.
I'm inclined to agree, with a few reservations. Seven of every 10 bottles of wine Americans consume is California wine. California wines, for the most part, are jammy, full-bodied, velvety and relatively easy to drink. Fat, buttery chardonnay is the paradigm. Long Island wines, at their best, are just as intense, but are leaner, less voluptuous. Perhaps more elegant. They are a different taste experience, and for many wine fans they take some getting used to.
The North Fork is a narrow strip of farmland on eastern Long Island between Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, about 70 miles from Manhattan. In 1970 it was on the brink of the same drab suburbanization that had already overwhelmed Nassau County and much of western Suffolk. Then the affluent and photogenic Alex and Louisa Hargrave, children of the 1960's, arrived, wanting to go "back to the land." They founded Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue, and almost miraculously, other vineyards soon followed, bringing new life to the faltering agricultural economy.
Today, vineyard land totals about 2,800 acres, of which about 2,200 are in production. Annual wine production, still negligible, is estimated to be 300,000 cases, about the same as for one medium-size California winery. It's hardly enough to supply a growing market and the hordes of tourists who descend on the tasting rooms each weekend, particularly in the fall, when some of the wineries receive 400 to 500 visitors a day. Not long ago, the Long Island wineries sold most of their production in their tasting rooms. Now, with their business growing in many markets, tasting room depletions are forcing some wineries to charge for what they once gave away free.
(Several of the region's 21 wineries are actually on Long Island's South Fork, which was once agricultural but is now given over principally to the Hamptons.)
If any North Fork endeavor symbolizes how the Long Island wine industry has progressed in less than three decades, it is the striking Italianate Raphael winery going up on the Main Road in this hamlet 10 miles east of Riverhead. It is a $6 million testimony to the faith that the owner, John Petrocelli, has in the Long Island wine industry. A year before its opening, it has already raised the bar on what is expected from Long Island's vineyards and fledgling wine producers in the years ahead. No expense has been spared by Mr. Petrocelli, a commercial builder in New York City.
At the same time, Raphael is based on what came before: the winemaker is Richard Olsen-Harbich, a veteran of 20 years in Long Island cellars.
Raphael, named for the owner's father, an immigrant and home winemaker, will be a one-wine winery, and that wine will be merlot. Of the 60 acres of vines planted, 45 are merlot. Small amounts of cabernet sauvignon and other Bordeaux varietals are cultivated, but only to enhance the merlot. There is -- hold on to your seat -- no chardonnay. In fact, there is no white wine at all, except a smidgen of sauvignon blanc for friends.
It was in deciding on merlot, and only merlot, that Mr. Petrocelli and Mr. Olsen-Harbich drew a figurative line in the sand to mark the spot where the old Long Island wine industry ends and a new one begins.
Mr. Olsen-Harbich has a foot in both camps. A 20-year veteran of the Long Island wine industry who was born in Queens and studied viticulture at Cornell University, he started as founding winemaker at Bridgehampton Vineyards, worked with the Hargraves for a time and spent several years as a consultant to newcomers eager to start up wineries. But the arrival of Mr. Petrocelli ratcheted up the stakes.
"Hit or miss experimentation, putting vineyards in and pulling them out -- those days are all behind us," Mr. Olsen-Harbich said. "We know this is merlot country now."
Does this sound rather like Bordeaux? It does, and with good reason.
Mr. Olsen-Harbich, 39, shares his Raphael responsibilities with Paul Pontallier, the 44-year-old managing director of Chateau Margaux, one of Bordeaux's legendary premier-cru wine properties. He has been a consultant to Raphael since 1996, when the project began.
"Our soil, our climate, both are Bordeaux-like," Mr. Olsen-Harbich said, "and our wines taste more like Bordeaux wines than California wines. We needed the Bordeaux influence. Before we planted a grape, Paul determined the vineyard layout and the spacing of the vines. He is here four, occasionally six times a year, and we talk, sometimes daily, on the phone."
Mr. Pontallier is circumspect: "The main problem on the North Fork is to get the grapes ripe," he said by telephone from Bordeaux. "The region has an interesting combination of warm and cold temperatures, and the grapes must struggle to get ripe. Often they are not picked until November. Our merlot here in Bordeaux is three to four weeks ahead of the merlot on the North Fork."
"We are not going to make great wine overnight," he added, "but we will make very good wine. Of that I am sure."
Raphael, using Pellegrini's cellar, produced 200 cases in 1997 and plans to make about 700 of the 1999 vintage. Eventually, the goal is around 10,000 cases. Compare that with Pindar Vineyards, the region's largest, which reports it produces more than 80,000 cases and plans to reach 150,000.
Even if its production is small, Raphael is a winery on the grand scale. It will be the goal for new investors to top.
Robert Entenmann, of the baked-goods family, who owns Martha Clara Vineyards in Mattituck, might be one of the first to do that. He has plans for a $4-million tasting room and a $2-million-to-$3-million winery. Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team, paid about $1.5 million last year for acreage in Cutchogue and Mattituck and is said to plan a winery. Marco Borghese, an Italian with a number of silent partners, last year bought the Hargrave Vineyard, also in Cutchogue, for around $4 million.
Other prominent Long Island wineries sold last year included Corey Creek, Laurel Lake, Peconic Bay and Bedell Cellars. Bedell went to Michael Lynne, a Time Warner executive, for about $5 million. Still on the block are two other Cutchogue wineries, Gristina Vineyards at $5.5 million, and Bidawell Vineyards for $3.5 million.
With most of these sales, the founders plan to stay on making the wine, while the new owners, mostly businessmen, take over management, marketing and promotion and enjoy the prestige that comes with being in the wine business.
At the same time, many existing wineries are expanding. Bob Pellegrini, who in 1982 started Pellegrini Vineyards in Cutchogue, recently bought 60 acres in two parcels "not to increase production, but to become totally estate," he said.
"Totally estate" means that he will own all his own vineyards and can call his wine estate-bottled. Pellegrini Vineyards currently buys about 40 percent of its grapes, Mr. Pellegrini said.
Buying new vineyards is not done casually. Twenty years ago, prime farmland sold for $4,000 an acre on the North Fork. Today, driven by competition among wealthy investors, the price can reach $20,000 to $30,000 an acre, Mr. Olsen-Harbich said.
Compared with, say, Pindar, Raphael is very small. But there are grape growers on the North Fork, many of them weekend farmers, whose vineyards are even smaller -- far too small to support wineries. For them, Russell Hearn, Pellegrini's Australian winemaker, is putting up the region's first custom-crush winery in Mattituck. Called the Premium Wine Group, it will produce, age, bottle and label wine for these owners of small vineyards. In California, similar operations, like the Napa Wine Company, produce wines for dozens of vineyard owners.
At least one longtime resident, Russell McCall of Cutchogue, has rejected all the conventional wisdom and has planted a dozen acres of pinot noir across the road from Pellegrini. Pinot noir is a temperamental grape with a high rate of failure. But then the experts said it would never succeed in California, and it has -- impressively. On the North Fork, they welcome a challenge like that.

HEADLINE: It's an Exclusive Shop: No Californians Allowed

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
THE opening of the only shop in the city devoted to wines from New York State might ordinarily attract attention for that alone. But what may cause the biggest stir is the fact that it is the only mainstream wine shop in the city allowed to open on Sunday.
The store, called Vintage New York, on Broome and Wooster Streets in SoHo, will eventually carry 150 wines from the state's four wine regions: Long Island, the Finger Lakes, the Hudson Valley and Lake Erie-Chautauqua. Every wine on hand can be tasted on the premises, a tempting possibility because so many of them are not otherwise available in shops or restaurants. 
 "In New York City you don't see New York wines," said Susan Wine, who opened the shop with her partner, Robert Ransom, last week. "We are bringing the country to the city."
In a way, they are. The couple also own the Rivendell Winery in New Paltz in the Hudson Valley, which is why Vintage New York is allowed to do things that wine and spirits shops in the city cannot -- like open on Sunday. In 1984, legislation deregulating the state's wine industry allowed farm wineries like Rivendell to sell wine in their tasting rooms, and to open as many as five stores across the state. (Farm wineries produce less than 150,000 gallons a year -- about 63,000 cases.) The stores were seen as tasting rooms, places where the wineries could sell their own wines as well as those from other New York producers.
In the 16 years since the law was passed, 20 such stores have opened across the state. The wonder is that Vintage New York is the first in the city. On Sunday, not long after the store opened, at least a dozen customers were prowling the aisles, audibly marveling at the idea of being able both to taste and to buy on a day when beer is ordinarily the only alcohol option at retail.
The shop, open on Sunday from noon to 9 p.m., and Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., is also allowed to sell food and carries artisanal products from New York State. They include Egg Farm Dairy cheeses, Hudson Valley Farmhouse Cider, organic duck breasts, Wild Thymes Farm salad dressings, fruit spreads and Wolffer verjus.
The three-level shop has two bars, on the top and bottom floors, where every wine can be sampled. A $5 fee charged for tasting five wines is refunded with a $50 purchase.
The airy 3,500-square-foot space is partly standard-issue SoHo (church-size windows, track lighting, brick walls painted cream) and partly Mendocino modern (giant photos of pendulous grape clusters; oak flooring and blond-ash shelves that resemble Champagne houses' cave racks; accessories and ceramics with vineyard themes). The arched basement, fitted out for catering, will be used for classes on food and wine and presentations by guest chefs.
Mrs. Wine, who owned the Quilted Giraffe with her former husband, and Mr. Ransom selected their inventory "after literally visiting every winery in the state and tasting their wines over two years," he said. They chose the SoHo neighborhood because a restaurateur friend told them that it represents "a mini-vacation, even for New Yorkers who go out to dinner." It also attracts hordes of travelers who might buy a bottle as a souvenir. Mr. Ransom said that if the store succeeded, he might open a second one in Manhattan.
Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at Montrachet in TriBeCa and an importer, visited the store and said he was impressed by the range of styles and varieties available. "People don't take New York seriously," he said. "But Long Island is serious. Millbrook in the Hudson Valley is serious. Of course, there can be inconsistencies and disappointments. People are fixated on big wines -- chardonnays and merlots. But they need to keep an open mind. The hybrids and fruit wines in New York can be wonderful."
Vintage New York's selection represents a tour d'horizon of grapes and wines, simple through sophisticated, that have governed the three stages of New York's wine industry, which began in the 1820's: Northeastern labrusca, like Wagner's 1998 Delaware from the Finger Lakes; French-American hybrids, like Rivendell's 1998 seyval blanc, from the Hudson Valley; and classical European vinifera, like Paumanok's 1997 merlot, from the North Fork of Long Island.
The lowest-priced beverage available is Warwick Valley's Doc's Draft Hard Apple Cider, from the Hudson Valley, which is $4.50 for 650 milliliters; the most expensive wine is the 1997 Wolffer Estate Selection merlot from the South Fork, at $30 for a 750-millilter bottle.
New York, in gallons of wine produced, ranks behind California and Washington and ahead of Oregon. But its wines have no unified image. New York City residents' impressions have most recently been influenced by the fast-growing Long Island wine industry, which has been cool to collaboration with other regions because it might blur the East End's image.
Vintage New York carries 13 categories of wines, defined not by grape variety but by style: sparkling; sweeter white; light-, medium- and full-bodied whites and reds; blushes and sweet reds; wines from native grapes; fruit wines and mead; fortified wines; and after-dinner wines.
With rieslings growing more popular, Vintage New York offers 11. Nine are from the Finger Lakes, which many experts think is the most promising cool-climate riesling-producing zone in the United States.
At least two previous attempts by upstate winemakers to drop anchor in New York City failed. Wagner Vineyards, on Seneca Lake, sold its own numerous wines in a shop on the East Side but closed it in 1988 after losing money for two and a half years. In 1994, Hunt Country, a winery on Keuka Lake, established a distributorship called Wineship to bring Finger Lakes wines to New York City stores and restaurants but shut it down after a year. "We didn't have the economies of scale to make a lot of money," said Arthur Hunt, an owner of the winery.
Vintage New York's Sunday advantage holds for now. On June 28, the State Liquor Authority voted to end Sunday openings, but on July 12 it delayed putting the decision into effect.
 
Getting to Know Your Local Winemaker
IN EARLY 3,000 wines are produced in New York State, according to the New York Wine & Grape Foundation, and the Vintage New York shop will eventually carry 150 of them. Here is a half-case selection that gives a sense of the styles and quality of the stock at the shop, and of New York wines in general.
Chateau Frank Blanc de Blancs sparkling wine, 1995 (Finger Lakes, $25), the single best Champagne-style wine made in New York State.
Hermann J. Wiemer dry riesling, 1998 ($10), from the most accomplished riesling producer in the Finger Lakes region.
Dr. Konstantin Frank Rkatsiteli, 1998 (Finger Lakes, $16), a popular wine with a lemon-lime flavor, made from an especially flavorsome grape found widely in the former Soviet Union.
Corey Creek reserve chardonnay, 1998 (North Fork, $17), a plainly delicious wine.
Schneider cabernet franc, 1998 (North Fork, $23), an outstanding example of a grape that may, in coming years, transcend merlot as Long Island's most significant variety.
Pellegrini unfiltered cabernet sauvignon, 1997 (North Fork, $18), a good example of the winemaker's opulent style. HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

HEADLINE: Seeking Laws For Disabilities Of the Attitude

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
Ten years ago today, when the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, the unemployment rate among disabled people was 70 percent. It still is, almost everyone agrees. And the stories of Sarah Triano and Richard Clark help explain why.
Mr. Clark, 36, was a five-year veteran of the Chicago police force when a car crash left him almost completely paralyzed. The police department put him on leave, and he has lived on Social Security since. Mr. Clark, who uses a wheelchair and can walk with a cane, argued, however, that he could do desk work, and he sought help from Equip for Equality, an advocacy group in Chicago, which sued for Mr. Clark's reinstatement in 1997. The United States District Court dismissed his claim once, but it is now scheduled for trial in October. 
 There are many throughout the department, Mr. Clark said, adding: "I've done a few of them before when I was in uniform, administrative stuff, like keeping logs and records. There's no question in my mind that there is a place for me where I can continue to make a valuable contribution."
A spokeswoman for the Chicago police force said Mr. Clark was offered a desk job but "he wanted to remain a sworn police officer," a title reserved for people who can respond to emergencies and fire their guns from a standing position. "This is mostly where the dispute comes from," she said.
As for Ms. Triano, she always wanted to be a lawyer, and after graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1996, she set out to take the law school admittance exam. But a hereditary immune-system disorder makes her highly susceptible to colds and infections and prone to diarrhea and vomiting when under stress. Because of that, she had always been given access to a bathroom while taking tests in high school and college.
The Law School Admission Council, which administers the Law School Admission Test, refused to grant her special privileges, she says, even after she submitted medical records from her immunologists and letters from Santa Barbara.
In frustration, Ms. Triano, 25, started an Internet support group for people who had had similar problems in taking the law exams, and 50 people joined, she says. She also complained to the Justice Department, saying her rights for reasonable accommodation of her condition had been violated. As a result of similar complaints, she says, the department sued the Law School Admission Council last year in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia to try to force it to change its policy on accommodating students with disabilities.
Not surprisingly, the council is "in extreme disagreement on whether or not we've violated the A.D.A.," said Joan E. Van Tol, its corporate counsel. "We've complied with all the requirements" in accommodating the complainants, she said, and "in responding to the thousands of other test takers who have requested accommodations."
Meantime, though, the experience so upset Ms. Triano that she abandoned law and enrolled in the Ph.D. program in disability studies at the University of Illinois.
"Most people with disabilities try and get into traditional employment fields like law and are getting turned down," Ms. Triano said. "So they're going into a field where they can get the accommodation they need, which is in the disabled community. I've seen this happen time and again."
The frustrations that Mr. Clark and Ms. Triano have encountered mirror a larger and troubling reality: despite federal law to protect them against discrimination in hiring and promotion, and despite efforts by companies to recruit and train them and make job sites more accessible to them, the disabled continue to face a huge struggle for full workplace equality.
The main reason seems to be that although the law has changed, attitudes have not. "Clearly, many employers don't know how to level the playing field and engage people with disabilities in jobs," said Dr. Susanne Bruyere, director of the program on employment and disability at Cornell. "We need to infuse all participants -- from upper management to supervisors to workers -- with new attitudes toward the one in six Americans with disabilities."
William G. Stothers, deputy director of the Center for an Accessible Society, a resource group in San Diego, says many employers are simply nervous about hiring disabled people. They wonder, he says, how much training and special attention such workers will need, whether they will be productive and how their presence will affect their colleagues.
"It can be a stretch for some employers to expect a person with disability to be a valuable employee," Mr. Stothers said. "That's the risk that needs taking."
Steven Odzer, the chief executive of Global Supply Net, a company in New York for the janitorial industry, says his managers sometimes question him for hiring so many mentally disabled workers. They say, "Let's get a regular person," he said. "I say, 'That is a regular person, it's just a person with a disability.' People are people, but not everyone sees that."
Another factor is the difficulty in enforcing the A.D.A. Indeed, just determining what constitutes a disability can be a problem. Obviously, paralysis and blindness qualify, but other conditions, like attention deficit disorders and alcoholism, are debated. As a result, the figures for the number of disabled Americans vary widely, though a generally accepted estimate is 54 million.
Activists say adverse rulings and contradictory federal policies add to the confusion. Almost 90 percent of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are rejected, and 98 percent of disability discrimination lawsuits are decided for the defendants, which are usually businesses, the American Bar Association says.
For all the obstacles they see, though, activists mostly hail the A.D.A. as a landmark in the struggle for full acceptance. Marca Bristo, 46, chairwoman of the National Council on Disability, who is paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a diving accident but can use her hands, says that discrimination against the disabled is rampant in the workplace and that she experiences it daily. Yet, she says, the A.D.A. has had a transforming effect on her and millions of others because it gives them hope.
"I've lived in three Americas," Ms. Bristo said. "The first was as a nondisabled person in a world where I didn't know there was discrimination against disabled people. The second was for the 13 years after I broke my neck but before there was an A.D.A. The third has been the America I've lived in since the A.D.A. The experiences have been like three different countries."

HEADLINE: North Korean Leader, Easing Isolation, Is Said to Plan Russian Visit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 25

 BODY:
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, is planning to visit Russia in September, Russian officials said today, in a further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome its isolation.
The visit is planned for Vladivostok, a port city in Russia's Far East. Arrangements for the visit were confirmed today by aides to Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the governor of Russia's Primorsky region, which borders North Korea. 
 The trip is being billed as an "unofficial" visit to the region, not a negotiating session with Kremlin leaders. But the agenda includes trade, economic cooperation and other measures to expand ties between Russia and North Korea.
Long one of the most insular of nations, North Korea has begun to break down the barriers that have separated it from the world. Last month, Mr. Kim was host of a summit meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with his South Korean counterpart. North Korea has also established diplomatic relations in recent months with Italy, the Philippines and Australia.
The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, recently visited Pyongyang. After meeting with Mr. Kim, he reported that North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would help it launch satellites into space.
While there was considerable ambiguity at first about the North Korean proposal, Russian officials later said North Korea was not asking Western nations to provide it with rocket boosters and would be content with an arrangement in which two or three of its satellites were launched each year in other countries.
"It is not a matter of launching from North Korean territory, but from the territory of other countries," Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said at the recent meeting of eight industrial nations in Okinawa.
The Russians have highlighted the North Korean offer in order to challenge the prime rationale for the American missile defense plan and to debunk the idea that North Korea is a dangerous "rogue state." Clinton administration officials acknowledge that the North Korean offer is potentially very significant, though it needs to be explored further in talks between the two sides.
Little is known about Mr. Kim's travels. It is a matter of public record that he has visited China. He has also said he has gone to Indonesia and other countries, sometimes incognito.
The invitation to visit Vladivostok was made by Mr. Nazdratenko, who accompanied Mr. Putin on his recent trip to Pyongyang, Natalya V. Vstovskaya, a spokeswoman for Mr. Nazdratenko, said in a telephone interview today. She said that Mr. Kim had accepted the invitation and that the trip was scheduled for the first few days of September. The North Korean consulate in the Primorsky region declined to comment on the visit.
Ms. Vstovskaya said Mr. Nazdratenko had proposed several agricultural projects to Mr. Kim during the Russians' visit to Pyongyang and hoped to encourage new business, including the use of Russian railroads for trade with North Korea. "We want our railroads and ports to work at full capacity so that North Korea's cargo is not going via China but through our territory," she said.
The Russian government has already granted permission for 5,000 North Koreans to work in the timber and construction industries in Primorsky, though the number of workers now is far less.
According to Russian news reports, Mr. Nazdratenko, an autocratic governor who has ridden roughshod over the region's press and political establishment, established a rapport with the North Korean leader. The 52-year-old Mr. Nazdratenko and the 58-year-old Mr. Kim have the same birthday -- Feb. 16. Mr. Nazdratenko, who rarely drinks, later said he had been forced to drink several toasts to placate Mr. Kim.
"I had to drink for the sake of peace at the border," he said.
Mr. Nazdratenko later called for expanded ties with North Korea.
"As a result of brainless politics, we literally abandoned this country, and we not only froze relations with it for 10 years, but nearly created an enemy on our borders," the Russian newspaper Konkurent quoted Mr. Nazdratenko as saying. "I am glad that there has been a breakthrough in relations with North Korea and that Putin did it."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Sudden Exit Still Stuns Addiction Specialist

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
THERE'S a whole lot of nervous pacing going on inside Dr. Alexander F. DeLuca's feline-dominated apartment -- we're talking digs where pets command one of the two bathrooms -- on the viewless side of Central Park West.
Watch out for the prowling cat quartet (Frenzy and Beast are his; Kate and Little Cat are his wife's) who used to have the place to themselves all day. Now they share space with an addled, idled addiction specialist who, until his dismissal two weeks ago, spent a decade at the Smithers Addiction Treatment and Research Center and was its director since 1998. "Frankly, I loved that clinic," he mutters. 
 Let's just say everybody's fur is ruffled, and when Dr. DeLuca, 45, finally settles down at the rickety dining table, he can't sit still. Instead, he methodically strips a real-life fruit still life of the red grapes in its bowl as he vents dismay over his firing (make that dismissal) and the "letter of recognition" (oops, he means resignation) he says his superiors coerced him into writing.
Neither absence nor abstinence (an Alcoholics Anonymous veteran, he knows sobriety and swallows his nightly Antabuse pill to keep it that way) has made Dr. DeLuca's heart grow fonder of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center officials who ousted him as chief and medical director a day after the Christopher D. Smithers Foundation ran full-page newspaper advertisements condemning his modernist methods.
Did Dr. DeLuca, who calls the clinic, which is no longer directly linked to the foundation, "his baby," resign voluntarily in the wake of the hospital's ire after New York magazine (and a New York Post follow-up) depicted him as a radical bent on replacing zero-tolerance abstinence with substance-friendly moderation management?
"I don't know what I ever did to earn their enmity," he muses. "But to announce I'd resigned when I hadn't resigned yet, and to say that they have a long tradition of abstinence-oriented treatment and I no longer believed in that philosophy, do you know what that does in this small pond? That makes me essentially unemployable!" Yes, unemployment of the public, reputation-damaging sort is driving him to hysterics (but not, he avers, to drink).
That's why he's beating his breastbone like Celine Dion at encore time, why his laughter bounces off these prewar walls like shrapnel. (Dr. DeLuca laughs the way he eats grapes: reflexively, and without relish.) And it's why, though litigation-shy, he's hired a lawyer. "We're on the side of the angels here," he told a Smithers colleague shortly before the hospital, which confirmed his hiring in 1990 and subsequent promotions but refused to elaborate on his dismissal, placed him on the side of sacrilege.
I DIDN'T even get a chance to do my own damage control," he asserts. "They did it. I'm it. That I gave an unauthorized interview, that's for lawyers to talk about. But this idea that I changed Smithers into a moderation management clinic without telling them about it is absurd. I spent 10 years changing Smithers. I know what it takes to turn around an ocean liner like that. Smithers was and is an abstinence-oriented, abstinence-based treatment program. Abstinence is the best way. It's the safest way. But it's not necessarily everybody's way."
Did Dr. DeLuca deal with substance abusers who weren't ready to embrace abstinence? Guilty as charged. Done, he says, in the spirit of early intervention: "Better you should come in and talk to me and still drink than not come in at all." Radical words, those. But irrational? They're a product, he says, of research, not proof of antipathy toward the benchmark approach: "My personal recovery was through A.A.," he notes. "The whole nine yards."
One minute, the doctor is reluctant to rehash his personal history for fear the details -- a druggie and drunkard by 16, an alcohol and cocaine addict through medical school -- will distract from his Smithers exit. The next, he's pouring coffee and reliving a risky youth.
The child of doctors and destined, at least in their dreams, to become one, too, he attended Riverdale Country Day School and earned an athletic scholarship -- swimming -- to the University of Chicago. Trouble was, he was drinking heavily and in no shape to swim after high school: "I thought my life was too easy, that I'd make my own friction. I was going to take all the drugs and pass all the tests, and I damn near died trying."
He attended Vassar. Then came the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and marriage: he drank, did cocaine, denied he had an addiction until he wrecked his car, and his first marriage, in 1986. He called his mother, asked her to come get him because he was an alcoholic and wound up going to his first A.A. meeting sponsored by "Jimmy the phone repair guy." It seems Jimmy fixed the DeLuca phone one day, said no to a beer because he was a recovering alcoholic, then left his number in case they had more phone trouble.
A.A. worked, but in 1988, supervising the methadone program at Montefiore in the Bronx, he fell off the wagon and checked himself into a 28-day detox ward. He dropped out of medicine and into computers for two years and, with his self-esteem invisible, answered a classified ad in 1990 and was hired to direct the Smithers inpatient detox unit.
"In addiction medicine, you're allowed to have had such a past," he says. "You're allowed to be your nice, wacky self."
But maybe not at Smithers.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Rates Hinge on Future Data

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge in large part on economic data released in coming weeks.
Repeating a message he delivered to the Senate Banking Committee last week, Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, an analysis that has fed hope in financial markets that the Fed is finished or nearly finished raising rates. 
 But the Fed chairman said the extent of the slowdown remained unclear, and he seemed to warn investors not to assume that the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee would make no changes when it meets on Aug. 22.
Reports in the next few weeks on the unemployment rate, job creation, compensation costs, the growth rate and inflation "will have a significant effect upon what action the committee chooses to take," Mr. Greenspan said.
At the meeting in August, he said, "we will make a judgment as to whether or not further action or no action is the more appropriate policy for the purpose of creating a more balanced economy which has the capacity to continue this quite extraordinary 112-month expansion."
The Fed has raised its benchmark short-term Federal funds rate by 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999, to 6.5 percent, in an effort to squelch inflation pressures before they take root in the economy.
Mr. Greenspan's comments came on a day in which two economic indicators came in slightly stronger than analysts had expected.
Existing-home sales increased 2.8 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.23 million. And the consumer confidence index published by the Conference Board, a business research group, increased to 141.7 in July, up from 139.2 in June, but still below the record level of 144.7 in January and May.
Asked about the consumer confidence numbers today, Mr. Greenspan said it was "clear that consumer confidence remains quite high in this country, and that despite the evidence of some slowing down in consumer buying, we're not confronted with a buyers' strike by any remote sense of the meaning."
In his appearance before the House committee, Mr. Greenspan repeated the prepared testimony he had delivered to the Senate panel last week, and answered questions for nearly three hours.
Asked about transcripts of Fed meetings in 1994 that portray him as eager to bring stock prices down, Mr. Greenspan said he had subsequently decided that monetary policy should not be aimed at Wall Street.
He said the rapidly increasing trade deficit was not an immediate threat because foreigners were eager to get their hands on dollars to invest in the United States, but he said that in the long run the issue was "probably the most difficult one" facing economic policy makers.
"At some point something has to give," Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the trade and current account deficits and the dollar, which so far has remained quite strong.
"We don't know whether it will be protracted over a very long period of time, in which case the adjustments will occur in the normal manner without any significance, or whether they'll occur more abruptly," he said.
Mr. Greenspan also had a series of spirited exchanges with Democrats on the committee about whether the economy and globalization are leaving too many people behind.
The Fed chairman said that the booming economy had helped reverse a decline in real incomes at the bottom of the economic ladder, and that incomes had been growing since the mid-1990's. He said it was important to recognize that globalization created economic dislocation, and to help those who had lost jobs or otherwise suffered economically because of the changes created by global markets, but that its benefits far outweighed its drawbacks, especially for the United States.
Challenged on whether the government should do more to help people adapt to the rapid economic changes, Mr. Greenspan said job training programs were often unsuccessful, and that the best solution was to create more jobs.
"There is no substitute for getting people employed," he said. "The most important thing that we as a government can do to enhance the economic capabilities of the lesser-skilled people in this country and the inner cities is to keep this economic growth going."
But Mr. Greenspan said there were always going to be some people out of work by choice or as they change jobs. And he suggested that he does not view the Federal Reserve or the government as capable of eradicating all economic problems, even amid the nation's longest business expansion ever.
Asked by Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, what he would say to people who cannot afford to buy a home because of the surge in real estate prices and mortgage rates, Mr. Greenspan said the problem was not easily resolved.
"I wish I could say to you I have a program which will either knock $100,000 off every home or raise incomes by some specific amount," Mr. Greenspan said. "The world is not the way we'd always like it to be."

HEADLINE: Consumers' Optimism Rises But Spending Plans Do Not

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Americans are more optimistic about the economy than they were a month ago, a new report said yesterday, but fewer plan to buy cars, homes or major appliances -- an indication they may have concerns about the economic future.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to 141.7 in July, up from 139.2 last month but well below the record of 144.7 in January and May. The increase was slightly more than Wall Street analysts were expecting. 
 "I think consumers are feeling good about things now, but there are concerns about the economy going forward," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "I think they're optimistic, but they're not as giddy as they used to be.
"We are seeing signs of the economy slowing down, but this report today will probably keep policy makers alert that the economy is still relatively healthy and that they need to be concerned about inflationary pressures."
The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times since last summer because of concerns that the economy was expanding too quickly and inflation could accelerate. The central bank's policy makers will meet on Aug. 22 to consider monetary policy.
In a separate report yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose 2.8 percent in June as Americans continued to lock in deals before mortgage rates climb higher.
The stronger-than-expected performance pushed sales of existing single-family homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.23 million units, the highest level in 10 months.
The business-financed Conference Board survey found that, over all, consumers are optimistic about the economy, said Lynn Franco, director of the group's Consumer Research Center, but the survey also revealed that consumers have some doubts.
The percentage of respondents expecting business conditions to improve in the next six months dropped to 16.5 from 18.3 last month, though the proportion expecting worse conditions held steady at 6.3 percent.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Guards Promised Against Steel Import Surges

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The Clinton administration plans to take aggressive new steps to protect domestic steel producers from import surges, speeding up its use of antidumping measures and providing faster relief for companies and workers, according to a report the administration will release today.
The 240-page report, a copy of which was made available by an administration official, seems timed to help Vice President Al Gore shore up political support from steel workers and unions. Some union leaders sharply criticized Mr. Gore's support for the China trade bill this year, and many have expressed disappointment that the administration has not done more to guard against sudden increases in low-price steel imports. 
 The report, prepared by the Commerce Department, says the administration will start imposing duties on imported steel faster than it has in the past -- and in some cases even before reaching a final judgment on whether a foreign country is selling steel in this market below cost -- so as to minimize the damage to domestic companies and workers when dumping does occur.
Administration officials said they had also requested funds to set up an interagency "rapid response team" that would distribute aid to hard-hit communities as soon as it became clear that a sudden rise in import volumes threatened profits and jobs.
Many of the nation's leading trading partners, including Japan, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, have complained bitterly about United States antidumping laws, especially as used to shield the politically sensitive steel industry. The administration's pledge to use those laws more actively seems sure to inflame already tense trade ties with those nations, especially with Japan.
Just last month, foreign steel producers released their own study that contended that the American restrictions on imported steel had cost consumers here as much as $150 billion over the last three decades. Trade barriers and government subsidies effectively raise the cost of everything with steel components, from aircraft to kitchen utensils, said that study, which was prepared by lawyers for foreign steel makers.
The Commerce Department's study makes essentially the opposite claim. It suggests that if anything, the United States has erred on the side of free trade and needs to speed up and stiffen its response when the industry faces unfair competition from abroad.
The United States imposed antidumping duties on hot rolled steel from Russia, Japan and Brazil in 1998. The administration decided at the time that the United States was flooded with below-cost steel after the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 led to devalued currencies and bankrupt companies abroad. Some steel industry and union officials have complained that it took the administration too long to respond to that crisis.
"This is designed to make sure that what happened to the industry two years ago doesn't happen again," a senior Commerce official said. "We want to move as fast and as aggressively as we can, because we know that it takes time for the remedies to work."
In the future, the report says, the administration will act faster to break out and distribute trade data on steel. That will help people spot evidence of potential import surges. When surges occur, the administration will act faster to head them off, the report says. Among other actions, the report recommends starting negotiations with trading partners as soon as it becomes clear that an import surge is in the works.
The report also says that the administration will work to address long-term "structural factors" that cause foreign countries to sell steel at prices the United States has determined are below the cost of production.
Russia, the report says, has allowed steel exporters to escape paying bills at home, allowing them to sell goods abroad below cost. Japan allows steel makers to coordinate with one another and keep prices artificially high at home to help promote low-price exports. South Korea has unsound banking practices that have effectively subsidized a glut of steel production capacity.
The administration will use its influence at the World Bank and other international lending agencies to end loans that expand steel production capacity, the study says. It will also propose that international economic bodies study how best to knock down informal barriers that protect and subsidize steel companies.

HEADLINE: Report on Black America Finds a College Gender Gap

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Among blacks, home ownership is at a record high and unemployment is reaching a record low, the National Urban League said in its annual overview on the state of black America.
"Our move towards the economic mainstream continues steady as it goes," Hugh B. Price, the league president, said in an interview. "The strong economy is proving a powerful magnet for growth. But we still have a way to go to achieve parity." 
 But while the study shows the black middle class swelling, it also points to a downside: blacks represent a disproportionately high number of adults and juveniles in prison and those dying of cancer, AIDS and other diseases.
The report also said that black men trail black women in educational success and that the gap is widening.
In many ways, the report, to be made public on Wednesday, offers a picture of two black Americas: one taking advantage of economic opportunities and another mired in deprivation.
"The strong demand for labor has lifted all boats in the American economy, and we are no exception," Mr. Price said.
The good economic times are transforming the urban landscape as neglected black districts such as Harlem in New York City and the U Street corridor in Washington are sprouting new stores.
"We are seeing Gaps and Home Depots and Sears moving to 125th Street in New York," Mr. Price said. "That would have been unthinkable just a few years back."
However, the other black America is still burdened by unemployment rates that are more than twice the rate among whites.
What Mr. Price described as one of the most troubling gaps does not divide black and white: the gulf between black men and black women in educational attainment.
The number of blacks in college has surged by 43 percent since the 1970's. But black women have far outpaced black men in both undergraduate and graduate school settings.
From 1977 to 1997, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to black men increased by 30 percent, while the number increased by 77 percent for black women. For master's degrees, the increases were 8 percent for black men and 39 percent for black women.
"The numerical status of African-American men in higher education is a cause for concern," the report says.
Separately, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education said this year that in 1997, 454,000 black women in the country had master's degrees, compared with 222,000 black men.
Michael Nettles, a University of Michigan education professor, said part of the explanation is that black men may have more options than black women after high school, noting that black men outnumber black women among college-age military recruits.
"There may be expectations that the family depends on them more than girls to earn the paycheck," Professor Nettles said.
In addition, he said black males are severely underrepresented in advanced placement settings and over-represented in special education classes for students with low test scores or behavior and discipline problems. Teachers, using "extremely subjective" criteria, may harbor lower expectations for black males, he said.
The implications are far-reaching. If few black men enter higher education, they will continue to be rare in corporate boardrooms and other spheres of power.
Mr. Price said the gap between black women and men could be troublesome for the future of the black family. "As the economic gap widens, questions of whether black women will find black men who can carry their share in the household will become more evident," he said.

HEADLINE: National Study Examines Reasons Why Pupils Excel

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool appear to increase student achievement, particularly in impoverished communities, more than the salaries, education or experience of teachers, a national study released yesterday says.
The state-by-state analysis of standardized test results suggests that policy initiatives to raise student achievement have been effective, with math scores climbing steadily across the country at an average rate of about one percentile point each year from 1990 to 1996. Texas and a handful of other states that were among the leaders in adopting new standards and accountability systems have shown particular gains, including significantly higher scores by poor students and those from minority groups. 
 "Public education is reformable," declared David Grissmer, the principal author of the book-length study published by the Rand Corporation, a policy and research group based in Santa Monica, Calif.
"Five years ago, we were unsure whether reform in the states was working and if spending more money would make any difference in educational outcomes," Mr. Grissmer said. "We see gains in some states from reform efforts, and we see that resources, if they're properly targeted, can be very effective at raising achievement."
The study presents a mixed picture for politicians arguing over how to spend education dollars, and, in calling for increased federal spending to reduce disparities among states, is sure to provide fodder for debate in the presidential campaign.
Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore immediately highlighted the report on their campaign Web sites, with Mr. Bush celebrating the declaration of his state as a national leader and Mr. Gore noting that class-size reduction and universal preschool -- programs praised in the report -- form the centerpiece of his education agenda.
"I am proud of the results we have achieved in education in Texas," Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, said in a statement. "As president, I will achieve the same results, ensuring that no child is left behind."
But William A. Galston, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore, the all-but-named Democratic nominee, pointed out that Mr. Bush did not even become governor until 1995, near the end of the period studied.
"I'm told, though I'm not a farm boy, that roosters crow when the sun comes up," said Mr. Galston, director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland. "I am told by some farmers that some roosters are under the impression that they have caused the sun to rise, but they did not."
Beneath the partisan potshots, though, educators and state policy makers found crucial lessons in the report, which links scores on a national standardized test to census data and variables like per-pupil spending and class size for the first time. The study looked at seven math and reading tests administered in 44 states through the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal program that tests samples of 4th, 8th and 12th graders.
Among the findings were these:
*There is wide disparity in performance across the states for students from socio-economically similar families. Texas topped the list, with students scoring an average of 11 percentile points higher than their counterparts in last-ranked California. The states succeeding in this measure tended to spend more money per student, have lower student-teacher ratios and less teacher turnover, provide more public prekindergarten classes and have teachers report satisfaction with their classroom resources.
*Looking at raw scores, states clustered near the top were mostly northern and rural, including Minnesota, Montana and Maine, while the 10 lowest performers were eight Southern states, California and New Mexico. The study's authors attribute this largely to demographics.
*While math scores increased across the country, there was considerable range in gains among the states. North Carolina students improved nearly 2.5 percentile points each year, and those in Texas and Michigan 2 percentile points, more than twice the national average.
*Teacher salaries, their years in the classroom and the percentage of the teaching force with master's degrees appear to have little impact on student performance, though Mr. Grissmer said more study of these factors is necessary. The report said education dollars would be better spent on classroom-based resources to improve teacher working conditions, like computers and voice mail and curriculum materials, or on reducing class size than on wages.
"It's great to see such a sophisticated study confirming a truth too many people want to ignore: poor children achieve at lower rates because we give them an inferior education," said Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington group focused on disadvantaged students. "With targeted investments and high expectations, we can close the achievement gap once and for all."
But while most people praised the report's rigor, some questioned the usefulness of analyzing test scores that predate many state reform initiatives, and other aspects of its methodology.
Tom Loveless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who is also studying NAEP data, pointed out that the math scores Mr. Grissmer used come from a new test that tracks curriculums introduced widely in the last decade, and that scores on an older form of the exam, which emphasizes basic skills such as arithmetic, have been flat in the 1990's.
Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, questioned whether the analysis of teacher pay and experience remains relevant now that the country is facing a teacher shortage.
And Susan K. Burr, California's interim secretary of education, noted that in the last two years, her state has cut class size in kindergarten to fourth grade from 28 students to 20; increased per pupil spending by nearly $1,000, and instituted an accountability system similar to the one in Texas.
The report, she said, is "ancient history."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
G.M. Unites Media Planning At New Shop

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The largest assignment in the history of Madison Avenue was made yesterday when General Motors consolidated responsibilities for media planning -- deciding where to run ads with an annual budget of $2.9 billion -- at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the giant agency company known as the B Com3 Group.
The consolidation of media planning under the unit, the Starcom MediaVest Group, came after a monthlong review of three contenders and will affect all G.M. brands sold in the United States except Saab and Saturn. 
 "As you can imagine, this is a huge undertaking for us," Michael A. Browner, executive director for media and marketing operations at the General Motors Corporation in Detroit, said in a conference call to reporters to announce the decision.
Media planning is taking on additional strategic importance as marketers seek to increase the long odds that a potential customer -- busy with life and bored by most ads -- will pay attention to a sales pitch, particularly when many products are aimed at narrow demographic groups rather than mass audiences.
One way media planning works is to use tools like consumer research to try tailoring media schedules to the tastes of would-be buyers so they are more likely to encounter the ads, whether watching television, listening to the radio, surfing the Internet, passing by billboards or reading a newspaper or magazine. Another way media planning tries to improve the chances that consumers will see ads is to have them appear in unexpected places, from store floors and plastic bags wrapped around dry cleaning to elevators and airport baggage carousels.
"If we do our job well, the effectiveness of our advertising will be improved by putting ads in better places at better times," Mr. Browner said, "making sure we can reach more of the target audience more effectively."
The decision to select Starcom MediaVest was made by a committee of seven high-ranking G.M. marketing and advertising executives. There were two other agencies under consideration in the review: the Interpublic Group of Companies and Carat North America, part of the Aegis Group.
The decision by G.M. to consolidate media planning at a stand-alone shop came seven years after the company, the nation's largest advertiser and largest automaker, consolidated media buying -- the negotiations to determine how much ads will cost -- at G.M. Mediaworks in Warren, Mich., formed by Interpublic at G.M.'s request.
The creative duties for G.M. brands remain at the various agencies now handling those tasks, including Starcom MediaVest siblings like Leo Burnett in Chicago and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in Troy, Mich., as well as Interpublic agencies like Campbell-Ewald in Warren and McCann-Erickson in Troy. The creative agencies had also been handling media planning for their particular brands; so, for instance, Burnett took care of creative and planning tasks for Oldsmobile and D'Arcy did the same for Cadillac and Pontiac.
The goal of consolidation is to wring additional economies from the elaborate planning and buying processes that lead to the delivery of ads to consumers.
"Efficiencies come from improved effectiveness in the marketplace," John G. Middlebrook, vice president and general manager for vehicle brand marketing at G.M., said during the conference call.
That will best be accomplished, he added, by "the formation of a dedicated media-planning operation, tentatively titled G.M. Planworks," to consolidate the national and regional brand-planning duties that had been divided among 17 agencies. The responsibilities had been about evenly divided between agencies owned by B Com3 and Interpublic.
Starcom MediaVest will form G.M. Planworks -- in Detroit or a nearby suburb -- to handle the media planning for brands that include Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac and G.M.C. Currently, more than 200 people handle those planning tasks, developing and producing media schedules for each brand based on the intended audience for each car, minivan or truck. G.M. Planworks, which is to be fully operating by the first quarter of 2001, is to have 150 to 200 employees.
"This is all about trying to raise the bar higher," said Jack Klues, chief executive at Starcom MediaVest, which was formed by B Com3 in May by merging Starcom Worldwide, affiliated with Burnett, with MediaVest Worldwide, affiliated with D'Arcy. Other Starcom MediaVest clients include Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble.
 "We've always admired and respected" the performance of G.M. Mediaworks, he added. "Now our goal and purpose is to deliver that same quality of work from a strategic planning perspective."
Carat North America, unlike Starcom MediaVest and Interpublic, has not handled media planning for G.M. But the chief executive there, David Verklin, is well known to the automaker for his work at the San Francisco agency now known as Publicis & Hal Riney, which handles creative and media planning assignments for Saturn.
"The two 'inside' competitors and the one 'outside' competitor all came in with an equal opportunity to win the assignment," Mr. Browner said, adding that the criteria by which Starcom MediaVest was chosen included "the successes the agency has had for G.M. as well as with other companies" and "its strategic media research."
"We have had no dissatisfaction with the quality of the media plans done for our brands by the individual agencies," Mr. Browner said. "But we should benefit from the integration across the brands, the shared learning when you've got best-in-class research."
Riney continues to handle media planning for Saturn and the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., owned by Interpublic, continues to handle media planning for Saab.

Hot Schools, Hot Pursuit And a Touch of Hot Air

BYLINE: By Kate Zernike 

 BODY:
LAST fall, convinced that it could attract more students if it could just show them what happens in the classroom, Mount Holyoke College tried out a new marketing strategy: it sent professors to three cities to teach hourlong lectures, much like those they would teach back on campus, to prospective applicants.
At a time when colleges wrangle over who ranks highest on the "most wired" list, it seemed like such a quaint idea, almost naive: lure 'em with good teaching. 
 But it hooked me. I walked away from the biology lecture wondering not only why, when I looked at colleges in the 1980's, I hadn't considered a women's college, but also why I had not thought more seriously -- that is to say, at all -- about studying science.
Why not? Because I did as so many other people did, and do: with the wisdom typical of age 16, I chose the "hot" school -- so hot that it was pictured on the cover of The New York Times Magazine with the headline "The Hot School," so hot that it didn't accept me, leaving me to scramble for an alternative that worked out, but far from ideally.
Just punishment, then, that I should be assigned to cover education, a job that means I find myself at least once a week asking why I didn't consider this college or that, depending on whatever program I've just visited, whatever professor or college president I've just interviewed.
The point is not so much that I should have studied medicine or gone to Mount Holyoke (though I did discover that one dowager left a chunk of her fortune to ensuring the nightly tradition of milk and cookies in the dorms, which I found pretty appealing). The point is that like so many prospective college students, I never thought outside the "hot" box.
Hot has only gotten hotter since I set my sights on Duke, in vain. There are more than 3,000 colleges in the United States. Yet the "Harvard or bust" mentality has grown so frenzied that excellent colleges complain that they have to give more financial aid based on merit and less based on need because the only way they can attract good students away from the big names is to buy them.
I can't help but wonder whether if everyone did for a living what I now do -- or at least the parents and students out touring colleges this summer -- people might be less obsessed with the hot school and more interested in what schools work best for them.
The first thing they'd realize is how many interesting things are happening at so many different colleges. How about a place where the college president still teaches class, engagingly so? A place where alumni barons of the new economy come back to lecture in small seminars about what they've learned? A place with strong mentoring? A place that demands that students learn to write and speak well, whether they major in engineering or English? A state college that affords you the opportunity to take courses as well at the most exclusive liberal arts college in the nation, while paying less than $10,000 a year? These are all things happening at good colleges whose names aren't among the five or so hot schools that every student in the country seems to want to attend.
They might also see that hot is a pretty empty concept, based mostly on rankings that in themselves are fairly arbitrary. The most popular guides devise rankings based on the number of alumni donations, the number of students per faculty member, the number of applications rejected. Some schools have explicitly said they shape their budgets to make themselves look better in rankings. Others assemble teams of staff members specifically to figure out how to list information in a way that will lift the ranking; they can dance on the head of a pin to find the most flattering definition of "faculty" or "alumni." Which is better, a school that's figured out how to ace the rankings, or one that serves students well?
If I were going to do it all over again, knowing what I have learned from colleges across the country, I would consider the larger state schools, and smaller strong liberal arts colleges in the Midwest. I would sit in on classes, and not just English classes, but physics classes, too. As that lecture last fall taught me, a professor's ability to intrigue the uninitiated is a good indication of how dedicated a college is to teaching.
I would remember that college is about exploring your options, and look for a place strongly encouraging that. I would remember, too, that college is what you make of it, no matter where you are.
It's become easy to say that professors at research universities don't do enough teaching. That, too, isn't always true; I've met plenty of professors and deans at Harvard who care about individual students. But these aren't the schools for everyone. The trick, as guidance counselors try to convince their students every year, isn't to get into the best college. It's to find the best college for you.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Flood Victims Get $11 Million More in Aid

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
New Jersey received an additional $11 million in federal aid yesterday for some of the poorest residents affected by flooding in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Floyd last September.
The money is to be spent on repairs, rental assistance or new home purchases for residents whose incomes do not exceed 50 percent of the median in each of the nine counties most affected by the flooding. 
 The funds come in addition to a larger and more generally focused $30 million in public works and economic development assistance.
Both measures were passed by Congress this month and signed into law by President Clinton on July 13.
The money will be administered by the State Division of Community Affairs, which had determined months ago that there were still many in the state living with relatives, unable to repair their homes or running low on rent money while they awaited more permanent assistance.
Maureen Hassett, a senior policy adviser to the state agency, said that because the income levels in the nine affected counties vary so widely, a family of four in wealthy Somerset County, with earnings as much as $40,000 annually, would be eligible for the same kind of assistance as a similarly sized family in Passaic County earning just $16,000 a year.
The nine counties are Bergen, Somerset, Essex, Passaic, Union, Morris, Middlesex, Hunterdon and Mercer.
The extra help was announced by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and a bipartisan group of New Jersey's Congressional representatives.
Governor Whitman praised the federal agency for the speed with which it delivered the money.

Prescription for Failure

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
In denouncing President Clinton's plan to extend Medicare coverage to prescription drugs, and in touting their own counterproposal, Republicans have rolled out the usual rhetoric. They excoriate the administration plan as a bureaucratic, "one size fits all" solution. They claim that their plan offers more choice.
And for once their claims are absolutely right. The Republican plan does offer more choice. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases in which more choice is actually bad for everyone. In fact, by trying to give people more choices the Republican plan would end up denying them any choice at all. 
 Where Democrats want to offer drug coverage directly to Medicare recipients, the Republicans propose to offer money to private insurance companies instead, to entice them into serving the senior market. But all indications are that this plan is a non-starter. Insurance companies themselves are very skeptical; there haven't been many cases in which an industry's own lobbyists tell Congress that they don't want a subsidy, but this is one of them. And an attempt by Nevada to put a similar plan into effect has been a complete dud -- not a single insurer licensed to operate in the state has shown any interest in offering coverage.
The reason is "adverse selection" -- a problem that afflicts many markets, but insurance markets in particular. Basically, adverse selection is the reason you shouldn't buy insurance from companies that say "no medical exam necessary": when insurance is sold to good and bad prospects at the same price, the bad risks drive out the good.
Why can't the elderly buy prescription drug insurance? Suppose an insurance company were to offer a prescription drug plan, with premiums high enough to cover the cost of insuring an average Medicare recipient. It turns out that annual spending on prescription drugs varies hugely among retirees -- depending on whether they have chronic conditions, and which ones. Healthy retirees, who know that their bills won't be that high, would be unwilling to buy insurance that costs enough to cover the bills of the average senior -- which means that the insurance plan would attract only those with above-average bills, meaning higher premiums, driving still more healthy people away, and so on until nobody is left. Insurance companies understand this logic very well -- and are therefore simply not interested in getting into the market in the first place.
The root of the problem is that private drug insurance could be offered at a reasonable price only if people had to commit to paying the necessary premiums before they knew whether they would need expensive drugs. Such policies cannot be offered if those who find out later that they don't require such drugs can choose to stop paying what turn out to be unnecessarily high premiums.
And while in principle one could write a contract that denies the insured the choice of opting out, just try to imagine the legal complications if a private company tried to force a healthy retiree to keep paying high premiums for decades on end, even though he turns out not to need the company's benefits. As a practical matter the only way to avoid this opt-out problem, to enforce the kind of till-death-do-us-part commitment needed to make drug insurance work, is to make the coverage part of a government program.
All of this is more or less textbook economics. So why are Republican leaders insisting on a plan that almost nobody familiar with the issue thinks will work?
Cynical politics no doubt plays an important role. So does money; the insurance industry is by and large against the Republican plan, but the pharmaceutical industry is very anxious to avoid anything that might push down drug prices, and fears that the administration plan will do just that. But sincere fanaticism also enters the picture. Republican leaders in the House, in particular, are true believers in the miraculous powers of the free market -- they are in effect members of a sect that believes that markets will work even when the businessmen actually involved say they won't, and that government involvement is evil even where conventional analysis says it is necessary.
The Republican plan is, in short, an assertion of a faith that transcends mundane economic logic. But what's in it for us heathens?

Middle East Summit Ends Without a Settlement
President Clinton said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Camp David had been unable to reach an agreement after two weeks of talks on such issues as the shape of a new Palestinian state and the future Palestinian refugees. The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat who had balked, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, which Israelis and Palestinians both claim as their sacred capital. A1
 
Mr. Barak flew home to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters and his country sharply divided over the startling new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control. A12
 
Analysts said Mr. Arafat's refusal to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem allowed him to return home with his credibility intact among other Arab and Muslim leaders. A11

HEADLINE: IMPASSE AT CAMP DAVID: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON ENDS DEADLOCKED PEACE TALKS

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
At the end of two weeks of marathon negotiations with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, a visibly fatigued President Clinton announced today that they were unable to reach an agreement "at this time."
The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who balked in the end, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, the Holy City both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their sacred capital. 
 Speaking at the White House, Mr. Clinton singled out the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, for his readiness to make hard compromises. "I would be making a mistake not to praise Barak, because I think he took a big risk," the president said. "The prime minister moved forward more from his initial position than Chairman Arafat, particularly surrounding the question of Jerusalem."
He also declared that the discussions at Camp David had been "really unprecedented" in raising issues "that had long been considered off limits." The issue of Jerusalem in particular had never been discussed before by Palestinians and Israelis in face-to-face encounters.
"Under the operating rules that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, they are of course not bound by any proposal discussed at the summit," Mr. Clinton said. "However, while we did not get an agreement, significant progress was made on the core issues."
Mr. Clinton convened the summit talks in an ambitious attempt to reach a sweeping settlement before Sept. 13 on questions -- such as the shape of a new Palestinian state, the future Palestinian refugees -- that have kept the two sides in a state of conflict for 52 years.
No side announced any immediate plans to resume talks, and Mr. Arafat's declared intention to unilaterally proclaim a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 imposed the next serious deadline on a process that has seesawed from hope to despair and back since the Oslo agreements were signed in 1993.
In a somber parting statement, Mr. Barak laid the full blame for the setback on Mr. Arafat, and declared that Israel was prepared for "every possibility." But he did not exclude another try: "The vision of peace suffered a major blow, but I believe that with good faith, good will on all sides it can recuperate."
Mr. Arafat made no comment before departing the United States. But his chief negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas -- more commonly known as Abu Mazen -- put an unexpectedly optimistic face on Camp David, saying that the negotiations had laid groundwork for an agreement by Sept. 13. "What happened at Camp David are seeds that will grow very fast," Mr. Erekat said.
The two-week sequestered talks at Camp David, which included round-the-clock negotiations -- much of the time with Mr. Clinton as mediator and go-between, as well as threatened walkouts and at least one narrowly averted breakdown, marked one of the most intensive mediating efforts by an American president in the Middle East since Jimmy Carter brokered a peace between Israel and Egypt in 1978.
In some respects, it was hardly surprising, Mr. Clinton said, that the summit meeting, with its qualities of an almost brutal showdown in close quarters, had not produced what he wanted. "This is like going to the dentist without have your gums deadened," he said.
At the end, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders left the rainy hills of Maryland for the Middle East confronting the potential for increased violence and political uncertainty -- particularly in Israel, where Mr. Barak faces criticism for considering concessions to the Palestinians.
In a briefing before he left for home, Mr. Barak put the onus of failure squarely on Mr. Arafat. "We were ready to end the conflict, we looked for an equilibrium point that will provide a peace for generations, but unfortunately Arafat somehow hesitated to take the historic decisions that were needed in order to put an end to it," the Israeli leader said.
Mr. Arafat flew out of Washington without speaking publicly. But his aide, Mr. Erekat, insisted that an agreement could be reached no later than Sept. 13. "The prospects for agreement on all permanent-status issues are stronger than at any time in almost nine years," he said.
Instead of the comprehensive agreement the White House had hoped for, the summit talks concluded with a five-point statement of "negotiating principles" agreed to by the Israelis, the Palestinians and the United States.
The document said that the two sides understood the "importance of avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations" and that differences would be resolved "only by good faith negotiations."
More particularly, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said it was Mr. Arafat who had a lot of thinking to do.
"Barak was far more willing to think out of the box, far more willing to consider, though he never accepted, solutions that could have broken the logjam," Mr. Berger said. "Arafat on the other hand, while he did make some compromises on Jerusalem, was not prepared at this point to crack open his traditional positions."
A best hope, Mr. Berger said was that the summit meeting would provoke a reassessment within the Palestinian delegation, a group of about a dozen of Mr. Arafat's top political and security aides.
Coinciding with the last days of the summit talks, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, met with other Arab leaders in the Middle East in a spurt of diplomacy, the goals of which were unclear.
But a senior administration official said Mr. Mubarak did not help Mr. Arafat reach the bold decisions that the White House wanted. "I didn't see any evidence that a positive influence was being brought to bear," the official said.
According to officials involved in the negotiations, the prospects for an accord finally fell apart just after midnight Monday night, the second all-night session that President Clinton had led after returning to Camp David from Japan on Sunday evening.
On Sunday and Monday nights, Mr. Clinton worked with negotiators from both sides and progress was reported on the borders of a Palestinian state, on the fate of the three million Palestinian refugees scattered through the Middle East and on security arrangements.
"Then it came down to whether we could cut the Gordian knot on Jerusalem," a senior administration official said.
For what turned out to be the last effort by the president to get the Palestinians to agree to a deal on Jerusalem, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Arafat sometime after midnight.
By then, Mr. Barak had made what the administration regarded as considerable concessions in relinquishing control to the Palestinians in the outer and inner suburbs of East Jerusalem.
The administration declined to go into precise details today, but in the last week of the summit talks, according to Israeli reports, proposals were put forward by the Americans on concepts of shared sovereignty in East Jerusalem. Mr. Barak was considering these ideas, which represented a radical departure from established Israeli policy that Jerusalem was the united, undivided capital of Israel.
"We believe that the ideas raised by the president were far-reaching and justified a kind of positive response from Arafat. They didn't," Mr. Barak said at his news conference.
But when Mr. Clinton spoke with Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader was unwilling to budge from his position that East Jerusalem must be the capital of the new Palestinian state.
The question of sovereignty over the holy sites in Jerusalem, home to major places of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims, was at the heart of the problem, the administration official said.
"Think of Jerusalem as four concentric circles," the official said. "Outer suburbs, inner suburbs, the Old City and the religious sites. As you move into the center, the issues become more intense, historical, religious." There was surprising convergence on how different parts of the city would be managed but severe disagreement on the notion of sovereignty.
In that last conversation between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Arafat while the talks were still alive, Mr. Clinton tried to explain, once again, the advantage for Mr. Arafat in making a compromise on Jerusalem.
"The president described one again what was at stake: gaining a state, international legitimacy, international economic support," the official said.
Conversely, if Mr. Arafat let an agreement pass by, he could declare a state but it would be on 40 percent of the West Bank, and the Israeli reaction would be strong -- possibly the forcible annexation of the Jewish settlements.
After Mr. Arafat rebuffed Mr. Clinton, the president's senior aides -- Mr. Berger, the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and the senior coordinator for the Middle East, Dennis Ross -- met with one of the Palestinian negotiators.
They discussed, for one last time, the possibility of Mr. Arafat accepting a partial agreement that would deal with the shape of a Palestinian state, refugees and other matters, but would put the question of Jerusalem aside for the time being.
This last effort did not appeal to Mr. Arafat either, who, according to the administration's account, felt that he would lose some of his leverage over Jerusalem if he settled on the other issues first.
At 3 a.m., Mr. Arafat, ensconced in his cabin, called Birch, sent one of his negotiators to Mr. Clinton with a letter. The letter politely thanked Mr. Clinton for his efforts but said that Mr. Arafat could not accept the proposal on Jerusalem.
This morning, Mr. Clinton met separately with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in sessions that focused on where the peace process would go now.
Then there was a brief meeting of Mr. Arafat, Mr. Barak, and Mr. Clinton, only the second formal session of the three leaders, although they had sat together at dinner several times.
Drained by the exhausting discussions, and in some respects pleased to be out of their confinement -- Mr. Barak referred jokingly to Camp David this morning as a prison -- the leaders went their separate ways.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak both focused on the dangers of violence as the Sept. 13 deadline for the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state approached.
"We are at the end of an important stage of the peace process and at the threshold of an era of uncertainty," the Israeli leader warned before leaving for home.
"Every day they go past it will put more pressure on the Palestinians to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally and more pressure on the Israelis to have some greater edge and conflict in their relations as a result of that," Mr. Clinton said.
The threat of violence came as expected from Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who issued a familiar warning to Israel from his headquarters in Gaza. "This failure is another indication that the only choice we have is resistance," he said. "Only by force are we able to retain our rights."
The Israel armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said that the Israeli Army was preparing for the possibility of increased violence. "We don't want a confrontation in any way, and a lot is dependent on the Palestinians," General Mofaz said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Unfinished Business of the Camp David Talks"
Under the ground rules for the Middle East summit meeting at Camp David, there would be no agreement unless all issues were resolved. And although negotiators were reported to have made strides on several fronts, after 15 days the talks collapsed over the core issue of sharing Jerusalem. While Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said that all is now null and void, this is where the talks stood when they ended, according to negotiators and other officials:

JERUSALEM -- Israel had long insisted on its sovereignty over all Jerusalem, whereas the Palestinians saw East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
 
BORDERS -- Israel discussed handing over about 95 percent of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip to Palestinian sovereignty in exchange for annexing the other 5 percent, including three major Jewish settlement blocs.
 They also considered swapping land in the Halutza area adjoining the Gaza Strip.

JEWISH SETTLEMENTS -- Israel would annex parts of the West Bank settlements where about 130,000 of the 170,000 Jewish settlers live. The remainder would be allowed to resettle in Israel or remain under Palestinian sovereignty, but with special security arrangements.
All Jewish settlements would be removed from the Gaza Strip.
 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES -- Israel is believed to have agreed to admit about 100,000 Palestinian refu-gees in a one-time "family reunification program."
 An international body would be set up to monitor the resettlement and compensation of refugees, with an international fund to which Israel would contribute.
 Compensation would be paid to countries that received refugees -- Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the future Palestinian state -- as well as to the refugees themselves.
 
During the talks, Mr. Barak agreed that the Palestinians could have sovereignty over certain parts of Arab East Jerusalem in exchange for Israel annexing several Jewish settlements adjacent to the Holy City.
The Palestinians were believed to have conceded the principle of Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem, as well as the Jewish Quarter of the walled Old City and the Western Wall, but continued to insist on full sovereignty over East Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: THE CONCORD CRASH: THE SCENE;
A Symbol of France Crashes in Flames

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ROISSY, France, July 25

 BODY:
Witnesses described the brief, fiery flight of AF 4590 as a vision of hell or a kind of bomb, in flames from the time it rolled down the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport until it smashed three minutes later into a tiny, wooden hotel.
"It was like some bomb taking off," said John Palmerston, an Australian who saw the plane leave the runway from the airport here. "The whole back end of the plane was on fire. I thought it was going to crash right here at the airport." 
 In the little town of Gonesse, barely four miles southwest of the airport, there were reactions of shock and distress. "It was truly a hell; there were flames everywhere," a witness told the French television channel LCI. "There were pieces of the fuselage over more than 200 meters, pieces of plastic, of cloth, bits of metal, pieces of the wing, rivets. As for the hotel, there is nothing left; it was blown to pieces."
According to authorities, 109 people died on the airplane, and 4 more on the ground, apparently in the hotel Hotelissimo . A huge cloud of gray and black smoke surged into the sky, visible for at least 10 miles.
For Fabien Tillon, an official trying to manage the crisis from the local government offices in Cergy-Pontoise, the first crash of a Concorde was also a terrible blow to French pride.
"It's a big national shock," he said, as he tried to handle two telephones and a cigarette. "Many people died, but the symbol of the Concorde, too. The Concorde is a huge national idea for France, a symbol of engineering pride, and the fact that the Concorde crashed, and so many people died, and on the soil of France, it's a terrible shock."
The elegant, needle-nosed Concorde, the world's first supersonic passenger plane, was developed by the French and the British in the 1960's as a kind of response to the American and Soviet technological competition, another version of the cold war.
It also served to heal some wounds left over a veto by France in December 1967 of British membership in the Common Market, now the European Union -- hence the name of the plane. In more than 20 years of commercial flying, however uneconomical and however noisy, the Concorde had never crashed.
Firemen placed traffic cones across a blackened field, apparently marking the places where charred bodies were found. "Once you got used to looking through the smoke, the horror hits you," an emergency worker who had been at the scene told Agence France-Presse. "By the dozens, bodies or pieces of bodies, horribly mutilated. Here and there, shoes, books, parts of suitcases that are wasted away."
At the hotel, another witness told French television that onlookers had smashed a window and tried to get into the building, but the victims inside were already dead. "There was nothing we could do," that witness said.
At least one guest jumped out the window to safety, witnesses said.
Extraordinarily, it seemed, another hotel nearby, Les Relais Bleus, was untouched. "I thought the plane was going to land on my desk," the owner told Europe 1 radio. "I saw it heading for me in flames. I just let go of the telephone and ran."
Mr. Tillon said his staff was unbelieving at first. "Frankly, when we heard the news, we thought it was some kind of joke or an emergency exercise," Mr. Tillon said. "And then we had confirmation, that the Concorde had crashed and presumably everyone was dead. It really came like a blow."
Valerie Tourbon, a Frenchwoman flying today from Charles de Gaulle, echoed the normal sense of pride felt when a Concorde is spotted in the air. "It always excites me to see one," she said. "It makes me proud. It's awful what's happened."
Mr. Tillon described the "red plan" for national emergencies that went smoothly into operation in his department, Val d'Oise, which governs Gonesse. More than 200 firefighters were soon on the scene, along with 110 policemen and 80 gendarmes, 13 ambulances, three helicopters, the prefect and the prime minister, Lionel Jospin.
But even as more emergency workers arrived, their vehicles blocking the roads, there wasn't much to save, Mr. Tillon said. The passengers all appeared to have died, and after the fire was put under control, there came the grisly task of bagging the dead and taking them to the waiting line of hearses.
"First, there was a large explosion, then barely a second later, another large explosion," an office worker said. "We went to the window, and the flames were higher than the trees. When we went outside, pieces were falling down on us." One piece of metal fell on the roof of a colleague's car.
Another witness told French television: "I heard the noise, because each time the Concorde flies over, I always have a look. I saw it coming with an engine on fire, it tried to turn on its left, then it fell and fell onto the hotel."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Upgrading Buildings on Edge of Midtown

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Institutional investors avoided the Midtown South sector of Manhattan for a long time, concentrating on the larger and more glamorous properties in Midtown and downtown. Now, with rents soaring in the area from 34th Street to Canal Street, pension funds and opportunity investors are beginning to plunge in.
Starwood Urban, an affiliate of the the big real estate investor Starwood Capital, has bought the building at 430 West 14th Street, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund pension fund invested $115 million last fall in the old Port Authority inland terminal at 111 Eighth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. 
 Recently, Koll Bren Schreiber, a pension fund adviser based in Boston, persuaded one such fund to buy two buildings from the late Harry Helmsley's dwindling portfolio, 245 and 261 Fifth Avenue, at 28th and 29th Streets, respectively. The company plans to upgrade the buildings to attract new-economy and service-industry tenants, who have flocked to the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street.
"We are a value-added investor," said Charles A. Valentino, a senior vice president of Koll Bren Schreiber. "We invest capital to improve the quality of a building we think is in an emerging market."
He said the elevators, heating, air-conditioning and lobbies of both late 1920's buildings would be renovated, with new windows going into 245 Fifth. Both buildings will be wired for the high-speed Internet access that virtually all tenants demand today, and bathrooms and common corridors will also be improved.
The two buildings are the first investments in Midtown South for the company, whose sole previous investment in the city was the building at 50 Broadway in the financial district. Mr. Valentino said the company, which controls 74 million square feet of real estate nationally, valued at $4.5 billion, was shopping for additional properties.
"We think New York City will outperform many other markets," he said.
Rental rates in the area have been shooting up in recent months, according to figures compiled by Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and real estate services company. After surpassing $30 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, the average annual rental jumped to $39.65 a foot by the end of June, and in some submarkets actually went over $40.
The effort to reposition the buildings from their current status on the fringe of the garment district to one more oriented toward the booming Flatiron area will be helped by the shortage of space in Midtown South, said Mitchell L. Konsker, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield.
With the vacancy rate in the district at 3.7 percent at the end of June, he said, companies are trying to protect their ability to grow by taking space in buildings where future expiration of leases held by other companies will give them room to expand. Midtown South is generally defined as the area between 34th and Canal Streets, river to river.
"With the tightness of the market, tenants are looking for buildings where there is space for expansion in a few years but where they do not currently have to pay rent," he said.
Matthew R. Astrachan, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, said the expiration dates for leases in effect meant that 250,000 to 300,000 square feet of space would be coming available over the next 24 months, much of it in easily marketable 20,000-to-30,000-square-foot blocks. He said those spaces would be marketed to publishing, advertising and other service industry tenants being squeezed out of streets closer to the Flatiron Building, streets on which rents are approaching $50 a square foot. He said there were now about 100 tenants in the two buildings, with some of them in small spaces.
The plan, Mr. Konsker said, is to reduce the total number of tenants, so that space can be assembled in the more attractive larger blocks.
There is retail space of about 14,000 square feet on the first floor of 245 Fifth Avenue that was formerly occupied by a branch of Chase Bank, which bought out its lease's remaining years. The site, Mr. Astrachan said, is going to be marketed to a "high end" restaurant, which will presumably be attracted by the well-paid professionals coming to the area.
Retail space is available at 261 Fifth Avenue as well, but a restaurant is not likely there because the Marble Collegiate Church is across the avenue and New York City law bans establishments selling alcohol from operating within 200 feet of a house of worship.
There are still garment industry tenants at 261 Fifth, who are so uninterested in the view of the Empire State and Flatiron Buildings available from upper floors that they block out windows in their showrooms so that buyers can see the goods as they will be displayed in stores. Those tenants will be consolidated on a few floors, rather than stay spread around the building, Mr. Konsker said, so that new tenants can enjoy the views and natural light.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD IN CONGRESS;
Though Liked by House Democrats, Cheney Was a Consistent Conservative

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
In his 10 years as a Republican congressman from Wyoming, Dick Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative voting records in Congress.
He regularly voted for the tightest restrictions on abortions, including proposals to ban Medicaid coverage of abortions for poor women whose lives could be endangered by continued pregnancy. And he voted against all gun-control legislation, including measures like one to regulate what are known as cop-killer bullets that were supported by all but a handful of lawmakers from both parties. 
 On issues in which business and labor were on opposite sides, he invariably supported the business position. When developers and environmentalists were at odds, he was on the side of the developers.
He opposed a constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights to women and voted against economic sanctions on South Africa.
During Mr. Cheney's time in Congress, from 1979 to 1989, Democrats controlled the House. As is normally the case with lawmakers in the minority party, he was not directly responsible for any major legislation.
While rigidly conservative on issues, he was not known for strident rhetoric and was well liked by Democrats. Mr. Cheney was not a visible leader in the fight to outlaw abortion, but the National Right to Life Committee said today that he voted against abortion rights on all the roll calls for which he was present.
For instance, he voted in 1984 to define "person" under discrimination laws to include fetuses. The sponsor of the measure -- which Al Gore, then a congressman, also supported -- said its purpose was to deny federal funds to all institutions performing abortions. Mr. Cheney also supported a constitutional amendment banning abortion, but the issue never came to a vote.
He was an unwavering advocate of the Reagan administration's economic policy of deep tax cuts, more spending for the military and less money for social programs. Annual vote analyses by Congressional Quarterly showed that in most of the years he was in the House, Mr. Cheney supported President Ronald Reagan more consistently than almost any other member of Congress.
In only his second term, he moved into the Republican leadership, and he was the Republican whip, the No. 2 position, by the time he left. Had he stayed in the House, he might well have become speaker when Republicans gained control.
Beyond his leadership responsibilities, Mr. Cheney was most deeply involved in foreign policy and intelligence matters. He strongly supported covert spending for guerrilla forces trying to oust communist governments in Nicaragua and Angola.
In 1987, Mr. Cheney served as the top Republican on the House committee investigating the Iran-contra affair. The committee determined that the administration had raised money selling arms secretly to Iran, then used the proceeds to finance the rebels, known as contras, in Nicaragua. Mr. Cheney voted against the final report, which accused Mr. Reagan of failing to meet his constitutional mandate to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed."
Some issues important when Mr. Cheney was in Congress are no longer in the news. For example, he repeatedly voted to produce the MX missile, a hugely expensive weapon designed to carry 10 nuclear warheads that was the symbol of what opponents considered the excesses of the Reagan nuclear weapons policy.
He also often voted against proposals to apply sanctions on South Africa to protest its apartheid policy, andvoted in 1986 against a nonbinding resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.
In his first year in Congress, Mr. Cheney voted for a constitutional amendment to ban busing for school desegregation. In 1980, he voted against strengthening the laws banning discrimination in housing.
The only time he turned against the Reagan administration on an important issue was in 1985, when he helped lead a revolt against a bill negotiated by the president and Democrats to overhaul the income tax system. He accused the administration of selling out. Even after the bill was modified by the Republican-controlled Senate and came back to the House in 1986, he voted against it.
President Reagan signed the tax bill and considered it one of his foremost legislative accomplishments.
Other issues from that era will be featured in this year's campaign.
On gun control, he was one of just 21 House members to vote against a bill regulating the manufacture, import and sale of armor-piercing ammunition known as cop-killer bullets. He was one of four who voted in 1988 against a proposal to ban firearms that did not contain enough metal to be picked up by a metal detector.
On education, Mr. Cheney often voted against Head Start, the federal preschool program. He voted in 1985 against federal aid to college students, and opposed the creation of the Department of Education.
On the environment, he voted in 1987 against extending the Clean Water Act and in favor of postponing sanctions against cities that did not comply with the Clean Air Act.
Appearing tonight on CNN's "Larry King Live" program, Mr. Cheney discussed his conservative record and said "I'm proud of it."
But he said some votes had been motivated by a concern for fiscal responsibility in an era when the nation did not have the projected surpluses it now had. "I would not vote against Head Start today," he said.
He also spoke in a tempered voice about abortion. "I don't think it should be a defining issue for our party," he said, adding that the party needed to be sensitive to different views about abortion rights.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RUNNING MATE;
The Armchair General: Richard Bruce Cheney

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The night allied warplanes began bombing Iraq in 1991, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney quietly flipped on CNN in his third-floor Pentagon office, ordered Chinese take-out and sat back to watch the Persian Gulf war unfold.
"Everyone was concerned about possible losses, but he was tremendously calm," a former top Cheney aide said. "I asked him why he wasn't more nervous, and he basically said that he was confident that everything was done that needed to be done. Once the airplanes were in the air, we just had to wait." 
 In choosing Mr. Cheney as his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush has turned to an unflappable Washington insider whose easygoing exterior masks a steely confidence, a man who, once he makes a tough decision, never looks back.
"He sort of chews on issues, and chews on them until he makes his mind up," said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, "then he goes on and he doesn't second-guess himself. He has very good judgment."
Mr. Cheney, 59, who served 10 years in the House of Representatives and four as President George Bush's defense secretary, brings stature, decisiveness and decades of government experience to a campaign sometimes short on all three.
But the real secret to his success may be an ability to wrap a staunchly conservative ideology in a mantle of moderation and civility to get people to trust him and get things done.
It is not just Republicans who feel at ease with Mr. Cheney, who while in the House opposed abortion and gun control and supported aid to anti-Marxist rebels in Nicaragua and President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" anti-missile shield. Mr. Cheney has a knack for working with political rivals, colleagues say.
Leon E. Panetta, a former Democratic congressman and White House chief of staff, recalled that Mr. Cheney was one Republican with whom he could confide during sensitive Capitol Hill budget negotiations.
"There was never any question he had conservative views, but he was always someone you could deal with and talk to, and never one to demagogue the issues," Mr. Panetta said. "I trusted that what I said would not be used against me in negotiations."
The Wyoming Republican has been a rising star in party circles since he was President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, at 34. But that political fire appeared to die out in 1995, when Mr. Cheney ended a brief flirtation with his own presidential campaign, dissuaded by an election shaping up over domestic issues, not security matters. Instead he became chief executive of the Halliburton Company, an oil services and construction company based in Dallas whose revenues have doubled, to $14.7 billion, under his tenure.
What remains in question is Mr. Cheney's ability to wage a punishing presidential campaign. He is not an electrifying speaker. He is a balding, overweight, middle-aged man who is not especially telegenic, though he comes across solidly on television. He never faced a tough race in conservative Wyoming. And he abhors the scorched-earth politics that came to characterize House Republicans under Speaker Newt Gingrich.
"Dick does not bring political sex appeal to the ticket," said Bill Frenzel, a longtime friend and a former Republican congressman from Minnesota. "What he brings is the competence and confidence that if anything happens to the president, the country will have a competent vice president to step in."
Mr. Cheney's selection is the latest in a series of turns that have shaped his personal life and political career.
He is an Ivy League dropout who became a doctoral student in political science. He was the No. 2 House Republican on the path to possibly becoming speaker when President Bush plucked him from Congress to run the Pentagon after the Senate rejected his first choice, Senator John Tower of Texas. He was a military neophyte, avoiding the Vietnam War with student and parent deferments, who steeped himself in military tactics and doctrine and became the most pivotal defense secretary since Robert S. McNamara.
As defense secretary, Mr. Cheney joined a national security team that included Secretary of State James A. Baker; the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Under Mr. Cheney, 24,000 American troops invaded Panama in 1989 to overthrow Gen. Manuel Noriega.
When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, it was Mr. Cheney who flew to Saudi Arabia to present King Fahd with President Bush's offer to send up to 200,000 American troops to the kingdom. He clashed with General Powell, who recommended keeping economic sanctions in place longer, and prodded the military to plan a larger, more ambitious counterattack against Iraqi forces.
From the start, his stint as secretary was auspicious. A week after taking over at the Pentagon in 1989, Mr. Cheney publicly reprimanded the Air Force chief of staff, Larry D. Welch, for privately discussing options for updating land-based nuclear missiles with influential members of Congress.
A year later, Mr. Cheney abruptly dismissed General Welch's successor, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, for publicly discussing contingency plans for waging war against Iraq.
Even General Powell, a close ally, was not above reproach. General Powell recalled in his memoirs that after one meeting with President Bush during the gulf crisis, Mr. Cheney pulled him aside. " 'Colin,' he said, 'You're chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You're not secretary of state. You're not the national security adviser anymore. And you're not secretary of defense. So stick to military matters.' He made it clear that I had taken liberty for license."
While Representative Cheney had supported most of President Reagan's military buildup, Secretary Cheney presided over a 25 percent cut in the armed services and oversaw a bipartisan process to close hundreds of military bases. He stunned military analysts by canceling plans to build a $57 billion Navy attack plane, the A-12.
He vigorously opposed allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces. But when a magazine revealed that his longtime spokesman, Pete Williams, is gay, Mr. Cheney defended him, saying, "As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in a responsible manner, their private lives are their business."
Indeed, discretion is a Cheney byword. When President Bush met with his foreign policy advisers during the gulf crisis, Mr. Baker and General Powell typically briefed their senior aides afterward. Not Mr. Cheney.
"Cheney was absolutely mum," said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the third-ranking official at the Pentagon, who was forced to beg colleagues from the State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff for a briefing.
Friends and colleagues say the perception of Mr. Cheney as boring belies his wry sense of humor. After Jimmy Carter was elected president and considered replacing the chief of staff's job with a decentralized "spoke-in-wheel" system, Mr. Cheney left a broken bicycle wheel in his office as a warning to the Carter team.
Mr. Cheney had three mild heart attacks before age 48 and underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation more than a decade ago. Since leaving the Pentagon, he has battled a weight problem, gaining as much as 40 pounds. But he still hunts, fishes and hikes in the Grand Tetons near his home in Jackson.
Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 30, 1941. But his father, an Agriculture Department soil conservation agent, moved the family to Casper, Wyo., where young Dick became a captain of his high school football team and president of his senior class.
Mr. Cheney received a scholarship to Yale University but dropped out in his second year because of poor grades. He traveled around the West, at one point laying power lines for an electric company, before settling down at the University of Wyoming, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in political science.
He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, a political scholar and former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The couple has two grown daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.
Mr. Cheney entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and, at 27, was selected for a one-year fellowship in the office of Representative William Steiger, Republican of Wisconsin.
Mr. Cheney thrived in the political cauldron of Capitol Hill. When President Richard M. Nixon picked Representative Donald H. Rumsfeld of Illinois to head the Office of Economic Opportunity, Mr. Cheney sent him a 12-page memorandum on how to run the agency. Impressed by Mr. Cheney's ideas and audacity, Mr. Rumsfeld hired him to run the agency's Congressional affairs office.
As happens so often with aspiring aides in Washington, Mr. Cheney hitched himself to his powerful mentor's rising star for much of the next decade. When President Ford tapped Mr. Rumsfeld to become White House chief of staff, Mr. Cheney went along as deputy.
When Mr. Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense, Mr. Cheney, only 34, replaced him at the White House, one of the youngest men ever to hold that job. Dispensing with the perks of office, Mr. Cheney commuted daily to Washington in his 10-year-old Volkswagen, rather than a chauffeured government sedan.
Mr. Cheney's popular touch extended beyond Washington's power corridors. William F. Connelly Jr., a politics professor at Washington and Lee University who was a Congressional fellow in Mr. Cheney's office in 1985, recalled a visit to Wyoming with him.
A group of ranchers had demanded a meeting, angry over the military's plan to use more grazing land to base MX nuclear missiles.
"These big burly ranchers in sheepskin coats, including one guy chewing a nail, were fit to be tied," Mr. Connelly said. "But Cheney just talked them down. He said, 'Look, this is too important to America's defense.' "

HEADLINE: THE CONCORD CRASH: REACTION AT HOME;
News of Crash a 'Bombshell' to Luxury Tour Operator in Germany

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 25

 BODY:
The shaken owner of a German luxury tour operator appeared on national television today to confirm that his company had chartered the Concorde that crashed near Paris, killing 109 people on board and 4 on the ground.
Many of those who died had paid thousands of dollars to be whisked to New York and a waiting cruise ship. 
 Peter Deilmann of Peter Deilmann Reederei G.m.b.H. also expressed the dismay of many Germans who are about to begin their own vacations in August.
"The news was relayed by telephone to me by Air France and it came as a bombshell," Mr. Deilmann said. "We are in a state of deep shock. I can tell you that 99 passengers booked their passage on the aircraft through my company." Almost all were Germans.
Mr. Deilmann, whose company is based in the Baltic port of Neustadt, about 50 miles outside Hamburg, said the passengers came from many regions of Germany. The Foreign Ministry said the single largest group -- 39 -- was from Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia.
There were 96 German victims, whom the ministry declined to identify until the families were notified. Most of the passengers traveled from Frankfurt to Paris before boarding the Concorde.
Air France said there were 100 passengers on board -- a figure that apparently included the 99 passengers mentioned by Mr. Deilmann and the lone American on board, who has also not been identified. Christopher Korenke, an Air France vice president, told reporters at Kennedy International Airport in New York that the American was a retired Air France employee.
Three of the passengers were children, the ministry said. The cruise was to have gone through the Caribbean to a final destination of Manta in Ecuador, with an option to sail on as far as Sydney, Australia, and the Summer Olympics.
The passengers on the Concorde had paid between $4,200 and $11,000 for a cruise that was to begin in New York on a luxury ocean liner, the Deutschland.
That ship, two two years old, was built in a Roaring 20's style, with chandeliers, a ballroom, a palm-filled winter garden and a salt-water swimming pool.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder expressed his condolences to the victims' families and canceled plans to see a performance of Goethe's "Faust" at the Expo 2000 world fair in Hanover. The German cabinet, headed by Mr. Schroder, said it would attend an ecumenical service for victims of the crash Wednesday at a chapel on the Expo grounds.
Germany immediately indicated that it intended to play a central role in the investigation of the crash, dispatching the transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to Paris and announcing that the federal agency that investigates air crashes would begin an inquiry.
The news punctured a generally upbeat mood in Germany as the chancellor prepared to go on vacation. A strong economy and the passage through Parliament of the largest tax cuts in Germany for many years have bolstered optimism and increased Mr. Schroder's popularity.
Mr. Deilmann said this was the fourth time that his company had offered a Concorde-cruise package -- and would be the last. But the cruise, which had 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.
"There's no sense letting the ship lie there," he said. "Life goes on."
In New York, some passengers felt differently.
Gitta Schoneberg, 47, and her 48-year-old husband, Willi, were among the hundreds of passengers who had boarded the Deutschland in Germany and sailed into New York on Monday night.
"It will be a sad voyage for us," Mrs. Schoneberg said. "Whenever we look over at an empty seat, we will think of this tragedy."
"It's better to end the cruise here," said her husband. He said this was the most luxurious of the 25 cruises that he and his wife -- both teachers -- had taken since 1990. "I would ask the captain not to go on. We're not in the mood for a party."

HEADLINE: IMPASSE AT CAMP DAVID: THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER;
A New Political Landscape Could Brighten for Barak

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 25

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel flew home from the Camp David summit tonight to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters, his country sharply divided over the new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control.
As news spread that the Camp David summit had ended without agreement, the airwaves were filled with the speculation of experts and politicians. Would there be a national unity government, bringing in Mr. Barak's right-wing Likud critics, new elections or violence from the Palestinians? 
 The entire country seemed to tune in to Mr. Barak's Washington press conference. Peppered with questions from Israeli journalists, the Prime Minister himself made light of the uncertainty.
"At least let me get on the plane and we'll think on the way," he joked. "We will even consult with our journalist friends on the plane."
Then, more seriously, he added "There is no doubt that all of the options are open. We will have to consider the issues seriously and assess the situation. We are at the end of a very important chapter.
"Neither the discussions at the summit nor the public debate in Israel were marginal issues. We will deliberate on arriving in Israel what is the right thing to do."
Mr. Barak, who has been in office only a year, lost his majority in the 120-seat Israeli Parliament on the eve of the Camp David meeting, when two Orthodox religious parties -- Shas, which represents Sephardic Jews, and the National Religious Party -- along with former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky's right-leaning party of recent Russian immigrants, quit to protest the peace talks.
The grim picture is further complicated by a vote scheduled on Aug. 2 -- the last day before the Parliament leaves for a three-month vacation -- to dissolve the legislature and hold new elections.
Yet Mr. Barak may actually be returning in a good position, said Sever Plotzker, a political commentator at the newspaper Yediot Ahronoth, which has been polling extensively in the last few days.
"Altogether, he is coming home in a very special situation," Mr. Plotzker said in a telephone interview. "He has no government, a weak coalition. But in my personal opinion he is stronger in the past few weeks and after Camp David. All our polls show this. He is coming back stronger. The economy is good, and people are seeing progress toward peace. He is sticking to his agenda."
The prime minister's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, told Israeli reporters that "as soon as he returns, Barak will be busying himself with the composition of the government."
Mr. Barak's One Israel parliamentary faction began maneuvering this afternoon to kill the bill, sponsored by two Likud members, that called for elections. The plan was to have the bill referred to the House Committee, headed by Slah Tarif of One Israel. The committee could vote to reverse a previous ruling that the departure of the three parties constituted a "significant change" in the political situation.
A similar bill was defeated a few weeks ago, and under Knesset rules another dissolution bill cannot be considered for six months unless there is a significant change. Thus, Mr. Barak's supporters could gain themselves three months while Parliament is on vacation.
Mr. Barak's problems are largely the result of e electoral changes made in 1996, by which Israelis vote separately for the prime minister and the members of Parliament. That has resulted in a profusion of smaller parties representing special interests, particularly the Orthodox. While Mr. Barak got a strong mandate in the popular vote, he had to turn to these smaller parties -- sometimes with contradictory interests -- to form a governing coalition.
"This system has created increasing fragmentation, which makes any coalition unwieldy and unmanageable," said Joseph Alpher, a political analyst. "This has been a constant in Barak's case."
Indeed, said Mr. Alpher, who had been a special adviser to Mr. Barak during the peace talks, had he reached an agreement of major proportions, he would not have been able to get it through the Parliament and would have faced new elections.
He now has several options, Mr. Alpher said. He could try to continue to pursue the peace process, possibly with a renewed summit in late August, to maintain momentum. He could move to a national unity movement with the Likud Party, which would signal at least a timeout in negotiations. Or he could try to reconstitute the basic elements of his coalition, probably without the National Religious Party and Mr. Sharansky's group.
"All of these options are extremely difficult," Mr. Alpher said.
On the right, Yisrael Harel, a Jewish settler from Ofra and onetime chairman of the settler's council, took a dim view of Mr. Barak.
"As I see it, he has a problem with both sides, both the left and the right," Mr. Harel said in a telephone interview. "The left thinks he should have conceded more, including in Jerusalem. For the right, after he has conceded the Jordan Valley, the settlements, neighborhoods of Jerusalem, it's no longer possible."
Mr. Sharansky, who had been the minister of interior, then set up a protest tent outside the prime minister's office two weeks ago, issued a statement calling for a national unity government.
"Under today's conditions, the agreement that would have been reached at Camp David would have torn Israeli society apart from the inside and would have been disastrous for Israel's national interests," the statement said in apparent relief at the summit's failure, adding:
"Today, more than ever, when Israel faces fateful decisions to its future, Mr. Barak must extend a hand to the heads of the opposition in Israel to set up a national unity government. Only a government representing a broad national consensus, with clearly defined red lines, can make critical decisions for the future of the state of Israel."

Reaching Out to Disabled Employees, With Mixed Results

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Ten years after the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, employers are still struggling to figure out who is covered by the law and what they are supposed to do to comply with it.
 Part of the problem, said Dr. Tom Hale, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is there are different definitions of disabled and the definitions are very political. 
 Cornell University's program on employment and disability found in a recent survey of human resource managers that companies have had more success providing access for people who use wheelchairs than in providing services for people who have hearing or sight impairments.
 Dr. Susanne M. Bruyere, director of the Cornell program, said that was going to have to change. Given that there are a number of people with hearing impairments in the work force and the work force is aging, this will become an increasing problem, Dr. Bruyere said.
 The most important continuing obstacles to complying with the law seem to be lack of information and training and lingering stereotypes about what people with disabilities can do.
 Attitude barriers remain very high, Dr. Bruyere said. Often, biases can be the result of a lack of education. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

Turnpike Stops Worth the Trip

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
THE scenery along the Ohio Turnpike -- an east-west melding of Interstates 80, 90 and 76 -- will never be confused with that along, say, the Pacific Coast Highway or the Blue Ridge Parkway. But weary travelers this summer are encountering something that may compensate: a new generation of service plazas, providing the amenities of home or at least those of a decent airport terminal.
In Ohio, the buckle on the Rust Belt, the turnpike commission has decreed a new family of pleasure domes. Little colonies of comfort just off the exit ramps, the buildings are set in pairs, one on either side of the roadway. They catch the eye immediately, suggesting the town hall of a midsize Swedish municipality or perhaps an American high school designed by Eliel Saarinen. 
 Long, with low domes, eaves of white limestone and supports of Roman brick, they replace drab and dingy facilities dating from 1954 and 1955, the first years the highway was open. Their arcades curve to embrace the parking lots; covered walks reach out, topped by an iconic minitower that is part sail, part steeple -- a faintly Art Deco element that could have been borrowed from the 1934 Chicago World's Fair.
At about $10 million each, the plazas may seem steeply priced. But the two pairs already open (the Erie Islands and Commodore Perry stops, at one exit, and the Towpath and Great Lakes centers, at another) have become a hit with their offerings of Sbarro, Starbucks, Jody Maroni's & Cinnabon, Burger King and Max & Erma's restaurants. All 16 stops are due to be finished by 2005 or 2006.
The designs were part of a larger plan to improve and widen the turnpike, a plan initiated in 1994, when the commission promised a fresh new vision: "Rather than rehash the old concept of service plaza, the commission has instead redefined the concept for the 21st century," a legend on the turnpike map boasts.
Under Umberto Fedeli, a former chairman of the commission, the project began in 1995 as part of the wider refurbishment. To pay for a whole package of improvements, including redoing toll plazas, rebuilding bridges and adding interchanges and an extra lane, tolls have been raised about 10 percent a year since 1995, leading to widespread grumbling.
"They said we were building Turnpike Taj Mahals," Enrico Zamporelli, the commission's executive director, said. "But now people love them."
The new service plazas have surely helped improve drivers' perceptions of Ohio. The impressions left by a major highway can shape the image of an entire state -- consider how often New Jersey is associated with the oil refineries along just a couple of miles of the New Jersey Turnpike.
"We wanted to enhance the image of the state of Ohio," Mr. Zamporelli said.
The architect of the new centers is Celso Gilberti, whose firm, Gilberti Spittler International of Cleveland, was chosen from three finalists in an architectural competition. Mr. Gilberti, who was born in Brazil, examined other "transportation nodes" -- bus and train stations and airports -- and chose as his model what he calls "the better shopping airports," like Pittsburgh's, with a variety of stores and types of food.
The look of the buildings is inspired by Prairie style, he said. "My buildings have a strong sense of eaves," he said. "You get a very nice horizontal line, anchored with the dome at one end." Those eves and the long Roman bricks in the supporting structures pick up the horizontal line of the road -- the line of the journey.
Too often, Mr. Gilberti said, travel becomes monotonous: "You lose the excitement you had when you set out, of going from one place to another. I wanted to recapture some of that excitement of the journey."
IN each lobby, an attendant stands watch at a horseshoe-shaped information desk. Inside are shops, a business center with a fax and e-mail kiosk, a truckers' lounge and various dining options.
A display shows a side of Ohio that is changing. To such attractions as the Benjamin Harrison historical site have been added the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the roller coasters at the Cedar Point amusement park, top-rated by connoisseurs.
A chart lists hotels and motels along the turnpike, with a green light for vacancy, or a red light if fully occupied. Truckers, who enter separately, have their own television lounge with smoking and no-smoking halves, several showers and a coin laundry room.
Beneath the dome four or five restaurants line one wall, and tables are scattered among upright lamps that feel like streetlights. The patio, with more tables, is popular as well. At the Towpath center, the restaurants include Panera Bread, known for sourdough bagels; the Coffee Beanery; Wendy's; and Pizza Hut. As is the policy at many airports these days, the facilities promise to restrain prices for "captive travelers" to roughly the level of those in surrounding areas.
Turnpike travelers across the country have come a long way from the dark 1970's, when they faced decaying facilities on toll roads. Long-term contracts during those inflationary years left the vendors with little incentive to improve.
The pattern for toll road services was set by the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the nation's first, which opened in 1940. In the 1950's, variety in food on the turnpike meant 28 flavors of ice cream to follow the wrinkled frankfurters in paperboard trays. Howard Johnson raised turnpike food service to an art, before grudging service, indifferent maintenance and minimal choice became the rule of the toll road in the 1970's.
Moreover, tastes have changed. Travelers want bagels and yogurt, Arizona iced tea and French roast coffee. (The Starbucks at the Commodore Perry service area, Mr. Zamporelli said, is one of the busiest in the country.) And they want their electronic services: modems, faxes and places to recharge their cell phones. Even truckers file their road logs by fax or e-mail.
Representatives of other turnpikes have visited Ohio, Mr. Zamporelli said. The New York State Thruway has added larger plazas with more services and varied food in recent years. Several states offer outdoor farmers' markets in the summer.
Mr. Gilberti stops by the plazas frequently to read comments in the guest books. On his way in, he always glances up at the towers at the entrance. "These I call the Portals of Ohio," he said.

With Debts Paid Online, Check Is in the E-Mail

BYLINE: By JESSICA SEIGEL 

 BODY:
THE check was not in the mail, not for the last 10 years. Serdar Danis, a Philadelphia salesman, had lent $15 to a walletless friend one night a decade ago but had never been paid back. As time passed, it just seemed too petty to mention.
When Mr. Danis, 29, recently began selling his old Star Trek memorabilia through Web auctions, he discovered online services that allow buyers and sellers to use e-mail to send and receive money from their bank and credit card accounts. That's how he got the idea of e-mailing his deadbeat buddy, directing him to PayPal.com, the largest of the new Web payment sites. "Within less than a minute, I got my money back," Mr. Danis said. 
 As sending money by e-mail spreads from the online auction world to everyday life, "the check is in the mail" already sounds quaint in some circles.
Instead, people are using person-to-person payment sites like PayPal.com, eMoneyMail.com, PayMe.com, ecount.com and PayPlace.com to settle small personal debts, pay sports league dues or pass the hat for a bachelor party.
"I haven't written a check in over a year," said David McIntyre, 32, a marketing manager from Tempe, Ariz., who no longer even keeps stamps at home. Web-oriented and envelope-shy, he helped raise $2,800 through eMoneyMail.com for Jimmy Welch, a 26-year-old friend with a rare cancer.
In the past, only businesses with merchant accounts could accept credit cards. But friends donated to the cancer fund through eMoneyMail, charging the donations to Visa cards or checking accounts, for a $1 transaction fee.
Mr. Welch was then able to use his A.T.M. card to withdraw the money from his bank account for travel expenses while undergoing chemotherapy in Los Angeles.
"My friends are more computer-savvy than I am," Mr. Welch said. "I was hesitant at first. But then, it was, like, wow."
Barely existing a year ago, the person-to-person online payment market has taken off in the last six months, catching the traditional banking world by surprise.
"People are signing on in greater numbers than the analysts expected," said Kenneth Kerr, senior analyst at Gartner Financial Services, a research firm in Stamford, Conn. "No one knew how great demand would be."
Although none of these services works precisely the same way, each allows users to send and receive payments by e-mail, transferring money between physical-world bank or credit card accounts and using the Web site account as a conduit.
Typically with these services, users must first deposit money into their online accounts before sending out payment by e-mail. To make payments, customers tell the Web service to send a "you've got cash" type e-mail message to the other person, who must sign in, then collect the money by credit card, bank account or paper check. When credit-card account users send money, the amount appears as a charge on their monthly bill under the Web site's name.
Now one of the most popular financial Web sites, Paypal.com attracted 2.7 million users through an aggressive marketing campaign that pays $5 to new users and $5 for each referral. PayMe, PayPlace and ecount.com don't release how many users they have, but eMoneyMail says it has 20,000 registered members.
"We didn't pay for those customers," said Steve Dieringer, general manager for the service, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, taking a swipe at PayPal's referral reward.
To send or collect money through these sites, customers register by giving their names, addresses and telephone numbers. The confirmation e-mail from the company contains a numeric security code that is required to finish signing up at the Web site.
At PayPal.com, some people have reported trouble with the first step, including difficulty confirming their bank accounts. The security procedure involves calling their bank, learning the exact amounts PayPal has put into their account in two tiny deposits, then keying those figures into a PayPal form.
Ross Honey, a New York management consultant who is a PayPal enthusiast, said that he appreciated the extra security but that the service was "too complicated."
So when it came to finding a service his mother could use, Mr. Honey directed her to PayMe, which not only has a simpler sign-up but is also the only service that automatically deposits accumulating funds into a customer's bank account without charging an extra fee. With most other Web services, the money remains with the online account until users click the Withdraw or Receive button to move the money into their credit card or bank accounts. Some people simply prefer to leave some money in their online accounts, transferring payments back and forth like so much Monopoly money.
Because most sites do not automatically transfer money from the online account into the user's bank or credit card account, many people inadvertently leave cash in their Web accounts, which don't pay interest. (Several sites plan to offer interest, while eMoneyMail automatically cancels the transaction if the money is not collected in 21 days.)
"My money is still sitting in PayPal," said Laurel Touby, chief executive of Mediabistro.com, a New York-based Web community and job site. "I never could figure out how to get it."
There are other caveats and occasional glitches to bear in mind while using person-to-person payment systems. For example, the sites ask prospective customers to check a box confirming that they have read a Terms of Use agreement. To no one's surprise, many users don't slog through the turgid, repetitive legalese.
Here's the crux of those agreements: PayMe, PayPlace and ecount claim broad immunity from liability. Their terms also explicitly require customers to forfeit the right to dispute a person-to-person credit card charge run through these sites, except in cases of error or unauthorized use.
In other words, users give up certain basic protections against sales fraud that usually come with paying by plastic. The PayPlace agreement, which weighs in at an eye-glazing 16 pages, is particularly confusing and intimidating.
The deal has improved at PayPal, which recently revamped its terms to allow customers to dispute credit card charges and added Travelers's SafeWeb Remote Banking Insurance to cover unauthorized use, but not sales fraud. In a mercifully short five pages, eMoneyMail does not make customers sign away credit card protections and clearly explains how to pursue complaints about errors.
And eMoneyMail is also one of the few payment services backed by a bricks-and-mortar bank. But that will probably change as more established financial institutions begin to jump into the market. Western Union is running a payment service called Moneyzap (www.moneyzap.com) and AOL will offer Web payments this fall through an alliance with Citigroup.
Should potential Web payment users wait for more established players to enter the market?
Paul Hagen, a senior analyst in e-commerce technologies at Forrester Research, a marketing research firm in Cambridge, Mass., thinks consumers should look at the business behind the service. "The question is: How do you make money?" he said. "What's the business model? I think a lot of people will use these payment-to-payment schemes. But I would be skeptical of no-name companies with no-name backing."
Even PayPal, which is backed by large investors like Nokia Ventures, has had to revamp its business strategy. The Web site, run by the online financial services company X.Com, had planned to make money from interest on the funds left temporarily in customer accounts. The revamped plan involves charging fees for premium services like 24-hour customer phone service and automatic deposits into offline accounts.
And what's the next big thing in person-to-person payments?
"Think about all those office pools," said Mr. Hagen, who recently lost $10 betting on college basketball in a friendly wager. "What a brilliant way to pay." He could ante up without ever walking over to the water cooler.

HEADLINE: Behind the Music: Organs Go Electronic

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG 

 BODY:
THE imposing facade of the main pipe organ at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan looks about the same as it did before its recent overhaul. And its thousands of pipes still produce celestial blasts of trumpets in the treble and rumbling thunder in the bass.
But beyond the facade and the ranks of pipes is a profound change that is causing rumbles not just beneath the floorboards of the sanctuary but also throughout the world where people listen to and treasure the mighty sounds of the pipe organ. 
 The reason? Some of the sounds in the refurbished main organ are digital, produced by a loudspeaker instead of an organ pipe. That means that when the organist pulls a stop on the console to signal, say, an English horn or a chime or a flute and then touches the keyboard, the people sitting in the pews hear a digitally sampled version of a horn, a chime or a flute pipe recorded elsewhere. Stops are the knobs used to activate a row of pipes that make a particular sound, like that of a flute.
While the sound of the main organ at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian has only a few digital contributors salted in among the regulars, the antiphonal division -- the main organ accompaniment sitting at the rear of the hall -- is now entirely digital. All of its sounds are produced by circuits and loudspeakers instead of pipes.
Fifth Avenue Presbyterian is just one place where the king of instruments is being usurped by the prince of electronics. In organ lofts throughout the country, relatively inexpensive circuits and loudspeakers playing digitally sampled sounds are taking the place of costly organ pipes. Sometimes digital sounds are used solely for the deep bass notes of the pedal pipes and sometimes for the reeds, trumpets or other stops that are expensive to build and fussy to maintain. Sometimes the entire instrument is digital.
Synthesized organ sounds are not new. What is different is the quality of the sounds and the speed with which they are being adopted. Proponents say that with the increasingly sophisticated sampling techniques of digital technology, there is virtually no difference in sound between a true organ pipe and its digital impersonator. Any differences, they contend, are outweighed by the savings in money and space.
Opponents argue that the sounds of the ersatz organ pipes is sharply inferior. They object to what they see as yet another musical sacrifice on the altar of frugality.
Dr. Richard D. Westenburg, director of music at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, defends the digital technology in his renovated organ loft. "The electronics are so flawless that they replicate the real pipes with absolute integrity," he said.
And the price was right. "The cost was probably under $40,000," Dr. Westenburg said. "Were we to buy those pipes, as well as installing a new division at the other end with its wind supply, there's no way it could be done for under $200,000 to $250,000. And we don't have to sacrifice the sound for the savings. We can enjoy the fruits of economy with the same results."
The economics of fake pipes are certainly powerful.
Cornel A. Zimmer, an organ builder in Denver, N.C., whose company produces pipe organs, all-digital organs and combination instruments that include both pipes and electronic voices, explained the big difference in cost for a single stop. "A low-end pipe stop costs anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000," he said. "A high-end customized digital stop will cost about $2,000 to $3,000."
And the sound of that digital stop? Can it really fool the ear? Kent Tritle, who is the music director and organist at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan as well as organist for the New York Philharmonic, said that there were distinct differences in the clarity of sound between the actual and the digital. "Setting a column of air in motion is what one pipe does," he said. "No matter what you do, digitally produced sounds are coming through a speaker that's putting the air in motion. It sounds quite different."
The issue of the true sound of a pipe organ and its replacement by electronic counterparts is at the center of a deeply passionate debate. It is one thing, many musicians argue, to improve the sound of a pipe, but another entirely to abolish it.
The trend toward digital enhancements is being firmly resisted by some groups, including the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of America, an invitation-only organization of more than 30 companies that account for the majority of pipe organs produced in the United States.
"We are trying to keep the organ from going down the slippery slope of electronic conditions that compromise it," said Charles Hendrickson, president of the organization and owner of the Hendrickson Organ Company in St. Peter, Minn.
In fact, the group feels so strongly about digital voices that after an extensive debate, it now expressly forbids the use of most digitally sampled sounds, except for deep bass notes and some percussive sounds, like chimes and bells. The issue is so divisive that some members of the organization left the group because they were unwilling to comply with the decision.
Mr. Henrickson said his group was fighting to keep the tradition of the pipe organ alive. "We want to retain the pipe organ as an authentic wind-blown instrument with as few electronic voices as we can," he said.
But the business of electronic voices, as the digitally sampled sounds are called, is booming, said John Carpenter, president of the Walker Technical Company in Zionsville, Pa., which makes many of the electronic stops, including the eight-foot flute harmonique at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian.
"We give smaller churches the ability to afford something that sounds more like a pipe organ," Mr. Carpenter said. "Put a few ranks of pipes on it and build the rest with electronics, and you'll have it much more like a total pipe organ."
One electronic enhancement for pipe organs has not been controversial: the use of microprocessors to make the job of pulling stops simpler during a pipe organ performance.
The more stops, the more complicated the job of changing the sound. A mere mortal with two hands and two feet, already busy with the keyboards and pedal board, can be hard-pressed in the middle of a tricky passage when the time comes to change the sound from flutes to trumpets.
Adrian Wadey, a design engineer at Solid State Logic Organ Systems in Brandon, England, and Livonia, Mich., designs some of the programmable stop systems that let organists create a single command -- similar to the computer shortcut called a macro -- that specifies a number of physical actions by the stops. That lets the organist press a single button, called a piston, to put the command into effect. The pistons are usually under the keyboard or above the pedal and are operated either by a thumb or a foot.
Mr. Wadey, a young but seasoned player in the contentious world of electronic aids for pipe organs, is careful to explain exactly what he and his company do. "We don't make electronic sounds," he said flatly. "We concentrate on real pipe organ sounds and tools that let the organist get as much as possible out of the organ."
At the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Mr. Tritle said that the programmable stop system on the church's mechanical-action pipe organ, designed and built by Mander Organs in London, was quite useful. He enters information in the microprocessor so that when he pushes a particular piston later, it moves the correct stops into position.
"We have an antique key action," he said, "but the modern convenience of electric programmable stops saves an enormous amount of time." If a piece requires rapid changes in sound, Mr. Tritle can program those changes in advance, setting memory levels for the stop selections before the performance.
At another Manhattan sanctuary, Calvary Episcopal Church, where the organ is being renovated, the director of music, Harry L. Huff, is looking forward to the convenience of programmable stop action, as well as other innovations brought about by computer technology.
The renovation at Calvary is being done by Bishop Pipe Organ Service, of Westfield, N.Y. Ron Bishop, the company's owner, is careful to point out that absolutely no digital voices are going into the instrument. "It will have programmable stops, but no programmable sounds," he said.
The organ at Calvary is electropneumatic. When the organist presses any key, an electrical switch closes and activates an electromagnet, which, with the help of a bellows to open a valve, sends puffs of air into the pipes. When the overhaul is complete, the organ's electromechanical switches and relays will be replaced by solid-state circuitry, Mr. Bishop said.
So far, one digital stop has gained wide acceptability and prompted little criticism. It is the one used to create the bass sound of the pedal pipe, and it is popular because the large bass stops are expensive to produce and take up a lot of space. At this frequency, 16 hertz, sounds are almost beyond hearing range and are more like rumbles than notes. But even for this bass sound, some builders refuse to use digital enhancements.
"It's a no-no," said John Pike Mander, president of Mander Organs in London. Mr. Mander does not put the digital bass stops on the instruments he builds.
"Often the sounds are sampled from existing stops with strong basic tones but little harmonic development," he said. But pipe organ stops get their particular character through a layer of foundation notes plus a series of harmonics above them, he said. "I don't think electronic notes, which characteristically have a lot of foundation and little harmonic development, make the right sort of sound," Mr. Mander said. A real bass pipe has harmonics that blend with higher-pitched pipes in a way that produces better sound, he explained.
Objections like that seem pointless for some organists, like Robert Melhuish, the chapel organist at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., and St. Joseph's Seminary in Berkeley, Calif.
"The organs of the future are going to have core sets of pipe ranks and digital enhancements for the large and difficult-to-maintain pipes," he said. "Because of the huge expense and the talent to maintain the pipes, digital enhancement is the direction the field needs to go in, and yet the field appears to be fighting it."
 
All the Stops
As churches begin to modify and replace pipe organs, they have several options:
 
TRADITIONAL -- All sounds are created by air forced through the pipes.
 
HYBRID -- Many church organs now have some natural sounds, produced by pipes, and some electronic sounds, produced by amplifiers and speakers.
 
ELECTRONIC -- The least expensive and most radical change eliminates the pipes entirely. All sounds are produced electronically.

HEADLINE: Kosovo Leaders Reach Reconciliation Pact at Meeting in U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, July 26

 BODY:
Leaders of Albanians and moderate Serbs in Kosovo have reached an agreement that calls for joint efforts to stop violence and help refugees return.
The text of a joint declaration worked out in talks in Airlie, Va., was published in Kosovo newspapers today. 
 "We agree beginning today to a Pact Against Violence to promote tolerance, condemn violence, prevent negative exploitation of ethnic issues, and enable physical integration and political participation by all," the document said.
The declaration said that the two sides would join in a campaign against violence ahead of municipal elections set for October.
Fewer than 1,000 Serbs have registered for the elections. About 80,000 to 100,000 Serbs are said to remain in the province.
Delegations from the two communities held the talks under the auspices of the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally supported organization in Washington.
In a separate statement, the Serbian delegation, led by Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo and Rada Trajkovic, who have shown some willingness to work with Albanians, said that despite continuing disagreements, the talks were "perhaps the first serious and constructive meeting of a relatively large number of the Serb and the Albanian people."
The Albanian delegation included Hashim Thaci, the former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla group who now heads the Democratic Party of Kosovo, and Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the more moderate Democratic League of Kosovo.
A radical Serbian group based in the divided northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica opposes reconciliation with the Albanians. The level of support for the Serbian leaders at the meeting in Virginia is unclear.
Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Mitrovica Serbs, dismissed the deal. "It is nothing special," he said. "Weak Serb representation and weak results."
Most Serbian leaders have said Serbs should boycott the vote while attacks on them by Albanians continue.
About 180,000 Kosovo Serbs have fled Kosovo since last year when NATO and the United Nations took over the province and Albanians began a wave of revenge attacks for past Serbian repression.
 The declaration said that before the election the signers would work "to convince the citizens that the time for reintegration has come" and to seek the release of hostages and eliminate ethnic hatred.

Aid for Clearing Danube War Debris
 BRUSSELS, July 26 (Reuters) -- The European Union's executive body completed the paperwork today to contribute as much as $20 million to help clear NATO bomb debris from the Danube.
The union has agreed to pay up to 85 percent of the cost of the project, which was agreed on by the international body with responsibility for Danube navigation.
Eleven weeks of NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia last year brought down several bridges, causing economic disruption to countries that rely on the Danube to ship goods.
Under the project the wreckage of three bridges bombed into the river at the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad will be cleared.
The fund does not provide for the reconstruction of any bridges.

HEADLINE: As Deregulation Begins, New Yorkers' Power Bills Soar

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz, the Queens Democrat, was not happy about last month's electricity bill for her apartment. The cost, she said, jumped to $78 in June -- even though she spent an entire week out of town with the air-conditioning off -- compared with $35 for the previous month.
"All this deregulation was supposed to save money," said Ms. Koslowitz, who heads the Council's Consumer Affairs Committee. "It is now costing more money. I just feel that the consumer is getting shortchanged." 
 In the month since the State Public Service Commission lifted price caps from part of what Consolidated Edison could charge to generate electricity, officials say, power bills have gone up significantly for most New York City residents. The average customer, according to Con Edison, will pay 30 percent more than last summer for electricity this June and July. Ms. Koslowitz said her office had received hundreds of complaints from electricity customers.
Electricity providers were forced before deregulation to set a fixed rate per kilowatt hour of service, meaning that customers' bills would fluctuate month to month only from the amount of electricity they used. But now, electricity providers can change the monthly rate based on demand, allowing them to raise the price per kilowatt hour.
Under New York State's version of deregulation, utilities that used to be monopolies are being forced to set aside a certain amount of electricity for outside companies to sell to customers. Con Ed was forced to sell most of its generation plants. The company has begun to focus on distribution of electricity through its grid, instead of generating power.
Con Ed was also forced to allow other energy companies to use its network to enter the transmission and distribution business. The companies are, in theory, able to shop around for the best power-generation prices to provide lower costs.
In return, the state lifted caps on how much could be charged for electricity, allowing the market to control prices and creating the spike in prices charged in June. It is likely to be higher throughout the year until there is real competition in the market, said Tom Bourgeois, the senior economist at the Energy Project at Pace University's law school.
"You have all these issues that sort of cloud the ideological competitive market," Mr. Bourgeois said. "So now, when you have high demand, not enough supply and you've deregulated the price, there will be higher costs for consumers."
The Consolidated Edison price increases come as the latest blow to customers who are already grappling with the rising costs of gasoline and home heating oil, Ms. Koslowitz said. Faced with complaints that are growing in pace and pitch almost daily, there is a move by some city politicians to offset the higher electricity rates with tax cuts.
The money for the tax cuts would come in the form of a rebate of more than $45 million in unexpected utility taxes that the city collected during the last fiscal year. "It is not a lot, but it is something," said Public Advocate Mark Green, a Democrat, who is a likely candidate for mayor in 2001.
Officials said that the extra tax money came primarily from unexpected new Consolidated Edison customers. Michael Clendinin, a spokesman for Con Ed, said that it added more than 22,000 customers in its service area last year, about 6,000 of them businesses and the rest residential. But higher electricity costs are also expected to raise tax revenue in the future.
City officials estimate that out of the $45 million, they collected roughly $13 million in extra taxes and the state collected the rest. Mr. Green said he would call on state legislators to return $32 million to New York City residents.
"Since it is a regressive tax and it especially hurts high-tech companies, the excess that the city has obtained should be rebated to customers," Mr. Green said.
But the extra tax is arriving just when city officials have expressed concern about anticipated budget deficits in future years, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has announced his intention to scale back some plans for personal income tax cuts.
Last week legislative leaders and several representatives of local utilities met at City Hall to discuss growing concerns about the increases. Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and Mayor Giuliani discussed rising energy costs, officials said, and Mr. Green's office requested data from Con Ed explaining the price increases and calculating how much extra money customers were paying.
In an interview, Mr. Vallone said that when it came to reducing any type of energy costs, anything, including a tax rebate or requests for a return to more regulation of the industry, would be considered.

HEADLINE: Alexander Dallin, 76, Dies; Precise Historian of Russia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Alexander Dallin, an American historian of the Soviet Union whose family took part in the Russian Revolution but who was widely respected for the scholarly detachment with which he viewed Communism, died of heart failure on July 22 in Stanford, Calif. He was 76.
He had a stroke the day before, Stanford University said in announcing his death. 
 Mr. Dallin was a director of the Russian Institute at Columbia University and of the Center for Russian and East European Studies at Stanford where he was the Raymond A. Spruance professor of international history from 1987 to 1994.
Mr. Dallin exercised wide influence on other students of Russian history, said Timothy Colton, director of the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard University.
Marshall D. Shulman, another former director of the Russian Institute, emphasized Mr. Dallin's objectivity, saying, "In a field riven by political controversy, he was universally respected as a voice of common sense and scholarly detachment rooted in a solid historical backing."
Born in Berlin on May 21, 1924, Mr. Dallin was the son of David Dallin, a Russian revolutionary leader who belonged to the moderate Menshevik faction, which had broken away from Lenin's Bolsheviks in 1903. After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, the Mensheviks sought to play the role of opposition party, but David Dallin was forced into exile in Germany in 1921, the year before Lenin formally banned the movement.
As a Jewish revolutionary, David Dallin was then forced into exile a second time, fleeing Hitler's Germany in 1940 for the United States where he wrote hostile books and articles about the Soviet Union and its Stalinist rulers.
His son completed graduate studies at Columbia University and went on to build a reputation for exacting Soviet scholarship and a deep understanding of the Communist Party. He became the Adlai Stevenson professor of international relations at Columbia in 1965 and was director of its Russian Institute from 1962 to 1967.
After the the Soviet Union's fall, Mr. Dallin worked on reviving the social sciences in Russia, where they had had been eclipsed by Marxism-Leninism as academic disciplines under Communism.
In 1994 he helped found the European University in St. Petersburg, which specializes in political science, sociology and economics, as well as the New Democracy Fellows Program at Stanford, which brings over students from the post-Communist world for graduate work in social sciences.
"Dallin had a profound and beneficial influence on the field of Soviet and East European studies," said David Holloway, who now holds the chair that Mr. Dallin held. "For him the study of the Soviet Union was not a question of confirming an already held point of view but rather a matter of seeking to understand a complex and changing reality."
Mr. Dallin was something of a maverick, tending to concentrate on aspects of Soviet history and policy making that were neglected or viewed as irrelevant by other academics.
In 1957 he published "German Rule in Russia, 1941-45," a study of Hitler's occupation of parts of Russia during World War II, which remains the definitive work on that subject and won the Wolfson Prize for history, which is awarded by the Wolfson Foundation in London.
Five years later he produced "The Soviet Union at the United Nations: an Inquiry into Soviet Motives and Objectives," an examination of Moscow's approach to the United Nations at a time when the Soviet Union appeared to have turned its back on international cooperation.
In 1964, long before the United States had embarked on the strategic arms limitation talks, he published "The Soviet Union and Disarmament," which suggested a negotiated halt to the arms race would be in America's national interest.
He published many more books, including "Women in Russia" (1977); "Black Box"(1985), a study of the Soviet shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 concluding that the United States may have engineered the plane's deviation into Soviet strategic airspace; and "The Gorbachev Era"(1986), written with Condoleezza Rice, Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser.
He is survived by his wife, Gail W. Lapidus, herself a political scientist; three children from a previous marriage, Linda, Natasha and Andrew; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Thea Porter, 72; Dressed the Elite of the 60's in Hippie Chic

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
Thea Porter, one of the earliest among British fashion designers who rode hippie chic to high visibility, if not always to enduring commercial success, died on Monday in London. She was 72.
Well before globalization became a fashion cliche, Ms. Porter was deploying the concept in her own canny rendition of it. Beginning in 1967, from a series of shops located in unlikely quarters of London and Paris, and later at I. Magnin in San Francisco and Giorgio of Beverly Hills, she made and sold clothes whose inspiration was drawn from her far-ranging travels and a childhood spent as the half-French, half-English daughter of a missionary posted to the Middle East. 
 Ms. Porter dressed Elizabeth Taylor for the souk, put the socialite Dalitha Getty in caftans and created Symbolist-inspired costumes for a perpetual party centered on the Rolling Stones and their newly made friends from the British aristocracy.
Her specialty was in finding exceptional fabrics -- Swiss chiffons, Indian handprints, 1930's French voiles uncovered in warehouses -- and deploying them voluminously for a clientele undaunted by the extravagance of both her silhouettes and her fees. A gypsy costume Ms. Porter made for Begum Aga Khan to wear to a fancy dress ball given by Baron Alexis de Rede was lavish enough that her fellow Briton, the designer Hardy Amies, described it as "pre-guillotine."
Born in Jerusalem on Dec. 24, 1927, Dorothea Noelle Naomi Porter was raised in Damascus, Syria, and briefly attended the Royal Holloway College in London, until she was expelled because, she once explained, "I wanted to study art." Although her art studies were equally short-lived, a job as a librarian in Beirut eventually resulted in her marriage, in 1953, to Robert Porter, an economist attached to the British Embassy in Lebanon. As a diplomat's wife in the early 60's, Ms. Porter traveled to Iran and Jordan, spent holidays in Italy and France and, as she once said, "went to nightclubs every night and had millions of clothes."
The marriage dissolved in 1964, and Ms. Porter began a fashion career with textiles collected during her travels. By good fortune, the prevailing style of the moment was High Ethnic. Clients at her Moroccan-inspired shop on Greek Street in London included not only rock stars but also members of a nascent jet set whose style reflected their newfound nomadism. She attired both Jayne Wrightsman, the wife of the oil industrialist Charles Wrightsman, and the actress Jane Fonda as if for a visit to a caravanserai in Kabul.
"Her real contribution was introducing ethnic clothes for that late 60's, rich hippie period," said the fashion designer Zandra Rhodes. It was a period, Ms. Rhodes said, "of shawls and prints and unusual textiles that you might have seen on the Beatles or the Mamas and Papas," or the titled people who indulged their escapist fantasies with what one critic referred to as Ms. Porter's "peacockerie."
In 1971 Michael Butler, the producer of "Hair" on Broadway, financed a shop for Ms. Porter in New York. When the enterprise failed, Ms. Porter returned to England and turned her hand to decoration. Her store, Thea Porter Decorations, eventually went into receivership; she later formed a brief partnership in a smaller store with Princess Dina of Jordan. "Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that," said Ms. Rhodes.
After a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Ms. Porter moved from her Mayfair apartment to a nursing home in Kensington, where she died.
She is survived by a daughter, Venetia.

HEADLINE: Long Beach, in Los Angeles's Shadow, Strives for a Spotlight

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., July 25

 BODY:
To hear municipal officials here tell it, there is no more enduring, supportive relationship in a region known more for affairs and heartbreaks than the bond between this industrious, muscular port and that livable but, let's be honest, tough if not troubled city just north, Los Angeles.
Scratch that happy surface, however, and Long Beach will concede somewhat more complex feelings. 
 Henry Taboada, its city manager, summarized the prevailing view when he recalled going to Washington with Los Angeles officials last year to seek financing for a major rail link to the cities' adjacent, sometimes bitterly competitive ports.
As they entered a Congressional hearing room, the huge Los Angeles delegation took literally every seat at the table, Mr. Taboada said, forcing him to almost physically remove one of the aides so there would be a seat for the only other person in the Long Beach delegation, the mayor, Beverly O'Neill.
"It was that or get no seat at the table," Mr. Taboada said.
By any measure, Long Beach is a substantial city. With roughly 450,000 residents, it is larger than St. Louis, Atlanta, Pittsburgh or Minneapolis. It has one of the largest container ports in the world, a huge Boeing manufacturing center and a university. It has more than five miles of beaches. And, perhaps most important, it has clawed its way back from a series of economic calamities, including more than 50,000 aerospace job cuts and military base closings that made the last recession all the more fierce here.
But Long Beach also has a complex, a product of its sense of always resting uncomfortably in the shadow of the flashier, more prosperous and, truth be told, infinitely more effervescent neighbor to the north.
It is a struggle Long Beach officials know they cannot win, and so they put the best face on things, no more evident than now. Los Angeles will be thrust into the spotlight as host to the Democratic National Convention from Aug. 14 to Aug. 17. And Long Beach? From Aug. 9 to Aug. 13, it will play host to the Reform Party convention, a role that some city officials admit reinforces their poor-stepchild image, at least in the eyes of the media, but does put their town on the map.
Indeed, some officials make a virtue of the city's second-tier status. Los Angeles is preparing nervously not just for tens of thousands of delegates, politicians and journalists but also for well-organized and aggressive demonstrators. The embattled Los Angeles police have already been criticized for a crowd-control plan yet to be put in effect.
By contrast, Dale L. Brown, deputy police chief in Long Beach, said his city was anticipating exactly zero demonstrators at what is expected to be a sedate Reform Party gathering.
"You're right, there are times we feel we don't get the recognition we deserve," Mr. Brown said. "But sometimes it's nice to be in the shadows."
Mr. Taboada added: "We won't get the attention Los Angeles will. On the other hand, there are only three presidential conventions, and we have one of them."
Ms. O'Neill, the mayor, said that in her view, the problem was a matter of perception and nothing more.
"What we want," she said, "is to help people realize that when you say Los Angeles County, you don't just mean Los Angeles. I don't grumble about it, maybe because I've gotten used to dealing with this my whole life. But we're not an appendage, and we just want people to see that."
Then she did an uncanny impression of Ross Perot, who led the Reform Party when it held its last convention here four years ago and who, she said, offered this compliment: "Your city is very nice."
Long Beach is no stranger to ups, downs and identity crises. It was founded in 1882 as Willmore City, named for an English developer who put up about a dozen houses and then failed. A few dozen more buildings were thrown up, and the settlement was reborn in 1888 as Long Beach. Today it covers about 50 square miles that comprise one of the most heavily industrialized areas in the region. On the drive south from Los Angeles on the freeway, the first sign that one has arrived is a huge oil refinery; indeed, the city still produces substantial amounts of oil.
During World War II, Long Beach became home to a Navy base, a naval shipyard and a big Navy hospital. These, along with big airplane factories, became the mainstay of the economy.
But Long Beach was hit with a triple whammy during the 1990's: the recession, base closings and military procurement cutbacks sent the unemployment rate soaring to 9.2 percent in 1993. An ugly racial incident, in which the police were filmed putting the head of a black suspect, himself a former police officer, through a plate glass window, almost led the city to dissolve its police force and bring in the county sheriff's department to keep the peace.
"We did not have just a death knell," Mr. Taboada said. "It was one death knell after another."
Ms. O'Neill became mayor in the bleak days of 1994 and has worked not just to revive the city but to transform it. In addition to technology, she has pushed tourism along the waterfront, where the most notable symbol is the Queen Mary, docked there and used as an entertainment center.
The success has been mixed, but unquestionably the city is back on its feet; today the unemployment rate is 5 percent, compared with 4 percent nationally. "We've been celebrating everything," Ms. O'Neill said. "We celebrated the first store opening. We celebrated the beginning of new construction. We celebrated anything that said hope."
The former Navy hospital has been transformed into a gigantic mall, although it does not have a major department store. (Indeed, there is none anywhere in Long Beach.) The city obtained government financing to build the Aquarium of the Pacific, a big tourist attraction on the refurbished waterfront, but it lost about $7.5 million from late 1998 through this March.
Yet the investment continues. Several acres of unsightly blacktop just behind city hall are to be torn up soon for apartment complexes, the first such residential construction in the area since 1992.
Ms. O'Neill and other officials say their concern now is not so much to ensure that the Reform delegates see the transformation as to get the media to take note of the successes as Long Beach's own, not Los Angeles's.
"Long Beach in the middle of the Mojave Desert would be a great media story," Mr. Taboada said. "But because we're on the underbelly of Los Angeles, when we get attention it's negative -- or it has been. We feel like we can't get our message out, but maybe this will help."

HEADLINE: IMPASSE AT CAMP DAVID: THE PALESTINIANS;
Hero's Welcome for Arafat, From Those Who Showed Up

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: GAZA, July 26

 BODY:
As Yasir Arafat returned to this hardscrabble territory, he was given a hero's welcome today for holding fast at Camp David to Palestinian demands that Israel surrender sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem.
Mr. Arafat was hoisted onto supporters' shoulders and hailed by thousands waving flags and banners and carrying his portrait. It was a rare moment of adulation for Mr. Arafat, whose popularity has been eroded by the hardships and corruption that have been hallmarks of life under the rule of his Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
 At Gaza airport and again outside his headquarters in Gaza City, the 70-year-old Palestinian leader responded, despite evident fatigue, by clambering atop the roof of his armored Mercedes limousine and raising his fingers in a victory salute.
One of many banners outside El Montada, the handsome stone building overlooking the Mediterranean in Gaza City where Mr. Arafat has his headquarters, put the matter squarely. "We welcome you home with honor," it said. "We hail your heroic stand in not surrendering a single centimeter of Palestinian land, and in not giving up Jerusalem. You are a great leader of the Palestinian people."
As frenzied as it was, the welcome appeared to involve only a tiny fraction of the one million Palestinians living in Gaza. It also appeared to have been carefully orchestrated by the Fatah movement, Mr. Arafat's faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
A similar story unfolded on the West Bank, where a rally in support of Mr. Arafat in the town of Ramallah attracted only 200 people. One reason for the small crowd was that Mr. Arafat's plane landed at the height of the working day. But many Palestinians appear deeply disillusioned with their leader for failing to deliver better living conditions in the six years since the Palestinian Authority assumed responsibility for most of Gaza from Israel.
But from the voices among the 5,000 people at the airport, and amid the tumult of a similarly-sized gathering at the Gaza headquarters, it seemed that Mr. Arafat had done the only thing he could in holding out for all of the Old City of Jerusalem, which contains ancient sites sacred to Arabs, Jews and Christians.
Teenage boys, Muslim clerics, middle-aged shopkeepers, policewomen, small children scampering cheerfully through police security lines of comic-opera efficiency, all were of a single accord.
"We should never give up any part of Jerusalem -- never," said Eyad Daoud, a 17-year-old high school student.
A 50-year-old official working in Mr. Arafat's religious affairs ministry, Abdul Fattah, stood back serenely from the hubbub in the city, a model of clerical propriety in a gold-trimmed robe and a loose white hood. "All Arabs, and all Muslims, need Jerusalem, and acknowledge it as the Palestinians' rightful capital," he said. "If the world wants peace, East Jerusalem must return to the Palestinians. There is no other way."
On its face, the welcome appeared to endorse Mr. Arafat's rejection of the compromise urged by President Clinton, involving limited Israeli concessions to Palestinian autonomy in the eastern parts of the city as part of an overall peace settlement. It would also have allowed the return to Israel of a few thousand of the more than three million Palestinian refugees dispersed around the region.
But things on this sun-scorched day were not necessarily quite as appearances suggested.
For one thing, Mr. Arafat emphasized during a brief stop at Alexandria for talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and again in remarks at Gaza airport, that he was still hopeful of resuming negotiations with Israel before the Sept. 13 deadline he has set for unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state.
The date, a possible trigger for renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians, is the anniversary of the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993 on the White House lawn.
Considering the unlikelihood of Mr. Barak or any other Israeli leader coming forward within the next seven weeks with sweeping concessions on Jerusalem, Mr. Arafat's eagerness for negotiations suggested that he, at least, has not ruled out a compromise.
One possibility would be the one raised at Camp David, under which the thorny issue of Jerusalem's status would be deferred while other issues, including the West Bank and Palestinian statehood, are settled.
For the moment, though, Mr. Arafat is sticking to the position he took at the peace talks: there can be no final peace, nor even an interim settlement, without Israel conceding sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
"Jerusalem is not only for the Palestinians, it is for the Arab nation, for Muslims everywhere, for Christians," he told reporters at the airport. He added, "Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state, like it or not. Whoever does not like it, let him go and drink from the sea."
Part of Israel's calculation in negotiating with Mr. Arafat has been that Palestinians might be willing to trade their historic links with Jerusalem for a quick transition to full statehood, international aid and more relaxed ties with Israel. American officials have said President Clinton dangled the prospect of generous Western aid in the closing hours of the Camp David meeting, only for the Palestinian leader to remain immovable on Jerusalem.
Despite the hubbub today, there may be a sizable proportion of Palestinians who are not willing to wait another generation or more for the benefits of peace, even if a compromise on Jerusalem is part of the price.
One long-term Gaza resident said that, at age 35, he could wait no longer for the benefits of a final settlement.
"All this posturing brings us nothing, or less than nothing," he said. "What do we have to show for six years of Palestinian autonomy here? No jobs, terrible shortages of electricity and water, bad schools, bad hospitals, bad everything -- worse even than when the Israelis were here. And now we say, 'Jerusalem or nothing.' It's a dream."
If there was one point of agreement among the Palestinians, it was that the events in Camp David should not be the signal for renewed violence, and especially not of a "second intifada," or uprising, like the one that caused widespread mayhem in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
Mr. Arafat implied as much by speaking of the hope of resuming negotiations, and one of his chief lieutenants, Nabeel Shath, who accompanied the Palestinian leader to Camp David, made it explicit. "There will be no violence from the Palestinians, not unless Israel makes violence, or the settlers turn to it," he told reporters.
Some young Palestinians have spoken menacingly of a resumption of attacks by Hamas, the radical Islamic group that engaged in a terror campaign in the mid-1990's. But Palestinian analysts say Mr. Arafat's Fatah group has largely emasculated Hamas by arresting or exiling many of its leading figures. In any case, Israeli military officials have said that they have alerted army and police units to be especially vigilant in the coming days.
In the circumstances, Mr. Arafat and his associates in the Palestinian leadership seem set on making the best of what, after years of working toward unchallenged Palestinian statehood, has unarguably been a setback. Mr. Shath, the senior Arafat aide who participated in the Camp David talks, said that despite the appearance of failure, the Palestinians had left Camp David convinced that they had achieved a major breakthrough simply by getting the Israelis and the Americans to concentrate on Jerusalem as the main obstacle to peace.
"We are not disappointed," he said. "The talks were very useful, very important, because all the issues that have been taboo all these years -- above all, Jerusalem -- are now on the table."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Files Brief Asking Supreme Court to Send Antitrust Case to Appeals Court

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
In a legal document filed yesterday, Microsoft argued that the government's antitrust case is "completely unsuitable for direct appeal" to the Supreme Court because it is complex and because the trial judge made "serious and substantive procedural errors."
Microsoft wants its appeal to go first to the federal appeals court in Washington, which ruled in favor of the company in a related case. 
 The company's argument, filed with the Supreme Court, rests heavily on a scathing attack on the work of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in Federal District Court.
The Microsoft document, citing interviews Judge Jackson granted to new organizations, including The New York Times, stated, "The district court's blunt comments to the press raise serious questions about its impartiality."
Microsoft also questioned the even-handedness of Judge Jackson's decisions in general. First, the company asserted, the judge improperly allowed the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company to broaden their case. Then, after allowing the additional evidence, Judge Jackson assured the company that his findings would be based on the more limited, original complaint, according to the Microsoft filing.
Those "assurances," the company stated, "the district court would later repudiate."
Judge Jackson ruled earlier this year that Microsoft was a monopolist that had repeatedly violated antitrust laws, and he ordered that the company be split in two -- an order he later shelved pending appeals.
If the case goes straight to the Supreme Court, it could be resolved in a year. If it goes first to the appeals court, the resolution might take up to two years.
The government is seeking to have the Supreme Court hear the appeal directly and sidestep a review by a federal appeals court. Direct appeals to the court are permitted in major antitrust cases brought by the government. Four of the nine justices must vote in favor for the case to go directly from the district court.
In its filing, Microsoft is trying to persuade the court that the appeal will involve a thicket of technical issues, procedural challenges and disputed facts. Sorting out these matters, Microsoft says, will involve poring over the voluminous written record of the lengthy trial - precisely the kind of winnowing usually left to an appeals court. The Justice Department had no comment yesterday, other than a brief statement saying that the government "will respond in its filing."
Still, there is little mystery about what the government's theme will probably be when it files its brief with the court on Aug. 15. First, according to legal experts, the government will say that the factual findings are clear and that the issues for appeal are a couple of big legal questions -- precisely the kind of major judgments of law that the court so often reserves for itself.
The big legal issues, they say, are whether Microsoft's bundling of its Internet browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system was an illegal tying of two products and whether Microsoft's dealings with other companies was indeed "monopolizing conduct," in legal parlance. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft's bundling move and its behavior did violate antitrust laws, and Microsoft is appealing his ruling.
The government is also expected to make a forceful policy argument for the expedited appeal, given the importance of computer industry to the economy.
"The government will say that Microsoft's monopoly is imposing a significant social cost while this case is on appeal and no remedies are in place," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. "It will say that not taking the case is a costly act, and that this is exactly the kind of case that was meant to go directly to the Supreme Court."
In its 30-page filing, Microsoft stated that the case "went badly awry from the outset," referring to Judge Jackson's decision to permit the government to add additional evidence after the suit was filed in May 1998.
That move, Microsoft said, allowed the Justice Department and states to "transform their case beyond recognition." In doing so, Microsoft declared that the judge "committed an array of serious and substantive procedural errors."
These errors, Microsoft said, included giving the company too little time for discovery and preparation of its defense to the expanding array of evidence.
Much of the evidence in the case, Microsoft contends, should have been tossed aside as not being suitable for admission in court. "The district court," Microsoft stated, "largely suspended application of the federal rules of evidence, admitting numerous newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay."
Judge Jackson, legal analysts say, did allow a wide range of written evidence in the case. But he gave that leeway to both sides, they said, noting that Microsoft submitted many newspaper articles, even press releases, as evidence.
And the government maintained that the additional evidence presented after the complaint was filed was part of the "pattern" of anticompetitive practices Microsoft used to stifle competition. Thus, the government said, the additional evidence involving companies like Intel and Apple was not an expansion of the original complaint, but merely further examples that fit the same pattern of behavior. Judge Jackson agreed with the government.
In its filing, Microsoft suggested that in its appeal, the company will seek to make sure that it no longer appears before Judge Jackson. It said his comments to the press should be considered grounds for a reversal or, at least, the basis for having the case sent to another district court judge if his remedy order is remanded for hearings, which is a possibility.
Judge Jackson has explained that he spoke to the press because, given the importance and prominence of the Microsoft case, he thought that there was a public interest to be served by speaking to the press about his reasoning. None of the press articles were published until after he had issued his final order in June. But he did give interviews beforehand with The New York Times, which Microsoft cited in the filing.
Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University law school who specializes in legal ethics, noted that the code of conduct for the federal judiciary states that "a judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action."
The judge's comments to the press, Mr. Gillers said, could well give Microsoft a basis for avoiding Judge Jackson's court in the future. He termed Microsoft's assault on Judge Jackson's work "uncommon but understandable."
"The bridges between Microsoft and Judge Jackson have been burned," Mr. Gillers said. "Microsoft has nothing to lose."

HEADLINE: THE CONCORDE CRASH: THE PLANE;
For Executives With Money, a Time-Saver

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies -- or any movies, for that matter -- but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven or nine hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative discomfort, passengers said yesterday.
In the aftermath of the crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris on Tuesday, which killed all 109 people on the airplane and 4 people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying on the jet again. 
 "When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified," said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris yesterday on his way to the island of Capri.
His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all of its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced that the planes are safe. But Mr. Demsey said he had been ready to take his flight even after he had heard about the crash.
"Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or better than any other plane," he said. "I would definitely fly it again."
British Airways, the other airline that flies the Concorde, resumed its New York to London service yesterday after having canceled some flights on Tuesday.
Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare round-trip ticket, described as a business tool. But that is how many of its habitues refer to it.
Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the rest are celebrities, the super-rich or vacationers like the members of the German tour group who died in the crash.
For business executives the advantage of the Concorde, which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 miles an hour, twice as fast, is not just time saved in the air. It is time saved on the ground.
British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so that passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Concorde passengers can show up a half-hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration. Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of arrival.
The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London, hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m. With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel back and forth to Europe regularly.
The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day. Indeed, the Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent in the afternoon. The alternative for many travelers is to take an overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane.
"I don't sleep well on planes," Mr. Demsey said. "To me it buys back two days."
Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare. Most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts as much as 30 percent, or the price of a business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050.
Passengers also use frequent-flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde.
"It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim," Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde. Most of his customers believe that the added cost is well worth it, since it means they can do more business.
"For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does pay for itself," he said.

HEADLINE: Lott Removes Hurdle for Vote on China Trade Bill

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, removed a major hurdle today to considering the China trade bill, setting the stage for a vote on the measure in September.
Under pressure from the White House and business groups, Mr. Lott, Republican of Mississippi, filed a motion to seek a vote on Thursday or Friday that would direct the Senate to proceed to the bill when it returns from its recess next month. 
 "I am pleased to see the process move forward," said the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefksy.
The legislation would extend permanent normal trade relations to China.
But obstacles could emerge. Before passing the bill, Mr. Lott said, he wants the Senate to vote on legislation that could lead to sanctions against China for reported weapon sales to Pakistan and other countries. The bill, introduced by Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, is opposed by business groups and the White House, even though Mr. Thompson agreed to changes. The latest draft would address proliferation threats from everywhere, not just China. But it would still require Washington to impose sanctions.
President Clinton has made passage of the trade bill a top priority. The House approved permanent normal trade relations in May. But Mr. Lott has refused to schedule a Senate vote on the bill, which would end the annual review of Beijing's trade status and guarantee Chinese goods the same low tariff access to American markets as products from nearly every other nation.
There is little doubt over the outcome of the so-called cloture vote this week, a move that requires 60 senators to pass. "The votes are there," a spokesman for Mr. Lott, John Czwartacki, said.
Unlike the case in House, where two out of three Democrats voted against the measure, the trade bill enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. Sixty-five lawmakers said in a recent poll they would vote for the bill, enough to override a filibuster.
Mr. Lott said he expected the Senate to vote on the trade bill in September and predicted that it would pass overwhelmingly.

HEADLINE: Multinationals Sign U.N. Pact on Rights and Environment

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 26

 BODY:
Executives of DaimlerChrysler, Nike and Royal Dutch Shell filled a chamber today where diplomats usually conduct business, as the United Nations recruited many well-known multinational companies to help protect workers and the environment in places where governments do not.
Secretary General Kofi Annan organized the session to encourage companies that operate across borders to spread Western-style human and environmental values or risk seeing the erosion of the consensus that favors open trade and investment. 
 Some 50 multinationals joined 12 labor associations and watchdog groups to sign a "global compact" that commits them to support human rights, eliminate child labor, allow free trade unions and refrain from polluting the environment wherever they do business.
Several signers are among the leading targets of protest groups that say the companies exploit workers and abuse the soil, water and forests in poor nations.
"Companies should not wait for governments to pass laws before they pay a decent wage or agree not to pollute the environment," Mr. Annan said after he had presided over the daylong meeting here. "If companies lead by example, the governments may wake up and make laws to formalize these practices."
Since the collapse of world trade talks and noisy street protests last year in Seattle, multinational companies have been scrambling to forge alliances with some of their critics, including unions and human rights and conservation groups. The compact sponsored by the United Nations is the most visible example of such alliances, and it is an attempt by Mr. Annan to make the world body a more effective force for social and labor standards.
The effort seems highly unlikely to alter the global economic landscape immediately. The pact, which took 18 months to negotiate, binds the signers to a declaration of principles rather than a legal code of conduct.
Several watchdog groups said the United Nations was participating in a "bluewash," allowing some of the largest and richest corporations to wrap themselves in the United Nations' blue flag without requiring them to do anything new.
But the session showed how world governments and corporate leaders increasingly rely on each other to demonstrate that they are helping the people left behind when companies move capital and manufacturing plants around the world. The United Nations and other international organizations have tried to address the side effects of growing international trade and investment but have found it difficult to act in isolation. Multinational companies, particularly those subject to barrages of criticism about how they conduct business in poor countries, are now eager to join the organizations.
"This global compact has the potential to become an historic partnership," the chairman and chief executive of Nike, Philip H. Knight, said. "We hope it provides the framework for real global progress versus each of us struggling with these issues alone."
Critics say Nike practices or tolerates sweatshop conditions in its foreign factories and those owned by its contractors. Nike says it adheres to the highest international standards.
Other companies that participated today have also run into criticism for their international operations, especially Shell projects in Nigeria. Numerous watchdogs have said the oil company violated environmental and human rights standards.
Bayer, Dupont, Ericsson, Healtheon/WebMD and Unilever were among the signers, as were Amnesty International and the World Wildlife Fund.
United Nations officials acknowledged that they had trouble attracting some American companies because the companies feared endorsing an instrument that might legally bind them to act in a certain way and subject them to fresh scrutiny. A United Nations official declined to identify companies that decided not to participate.
In the 1980's, the United Nations made a similar effort to forge international standards for foreign investment and workers' treatment. But that collapsed after rights groups, United Nations officials and executives clashed over the terms of the agreement.
This time, Mr. Annan, who became secretary general in 1997, selected nine loosely worded principles drawn from international accords like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, seeking to build agreement around long-established codes.
Mr. Annan stressed that companies should adhere to the standards even when the nations where they conduct business did not require them to do so. He said a company operating in a country that did not allow free unions should permit its workers to organize and bargain collectively, a position that could put companies at odds with the government of China, where almost all companies that signed the compact have investments.
The United Nations will not insist on strict compliance. Mr. Annan said the United Nations did not have the "capacity or the mandate" to police the companies. Several executives warned that the compact would fail if it became the basis for sanctions.
Some social and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, did not sign the accord. They wrote to Mr. Annan that some of the participants -- the letter cited Nike, Shell and Rio Tinto, the British-Australian mining company -- had poor records of operating abroad and did not deserve to be United Nations partners.
The letter urged Mr. Annan to "reassess your overall approach to U.N.-corporate partnerships."
"The mission and integrity of the United Nations are at stake," it added.
Still, some outside observers see the partnership as vital as the world grapples with the reality that nations cannot regulate, tax and set standards for commerce as effectively when companies spread their operations over many countries, rich and poor.
Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, compared the process to regulating labor, food, safety and the environment in the United States, programs that took decades to accomplish.
"There are just a huge number of issues that have to be addressed globally and there is no real infrastructure to do it," Mr. Garten said. "They can only be dealt with in partnership agreements between governments, business and nongovernment organizations."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Pulling All-Nighters for the Good of the City

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
RICHARD C. VISCONTI is talking about the highs and lows of a job -- his -- and tracing a jagged shape in the air. A mountain he'd love to ski? The Manhattan skyline his job makes him responsible for? No digressions, please. Mr. Visconti is methodical, focused, exacting, and not one to humor us by going off on tangents about metaphors.
So here are the highs: buildings that collapse, masonry that tumbles, scaffolding that twists in the wind. "Sometimes," he says, "this job's a pressure cooker." 
 And then there were the banner-bearing barges that floated by his office window.
Mr. Visconti is acting commissioner of the city's Department of Buildings. So he is one of the handful of officials who gather, grimly, at urban disasters. When a Brooklyn town house exploded two weeks ago, and when an architectural salvage shop in the East Village collapsed a few days later, he pulled all-nighters.
So what about that word "acting" in his title? He is not doing Shakespeare on the side.
"I can't really answer the question," he says, and neither could a City Hall spokeswoman who was asked why, after 14 months, Mr. Visconti has not been elevated or replaced. He suggests that his status has to do with word he sent to City Hall about the time he was promoted from deputy commissioner, in May of last year. His wife, Ronnie, had been in a serious automobile accident near their home in Jamaica Estates, Queens, and he was concerned about "this issue of timing": his job and her recovery.
She is fine now, and he carries on, a long-serving acting commissioner.
"I've never been concerned about the acting status," he says before listing changes he has had a hand in, from requirements that make new buildings more likely to withstand earthquakes to a new electrical code to a system for filing building permit applications by computer.
But after nine years at the department, first as the assistant commissioner for technical affairs, later as the deputy commissioner, he still sees himself as a "private sector person" and "an architect who had to interface with the department a lot." So he has a sense of the frustration that architects and builders feel about his agency.
"Every project in New York is a contentious project," he says. "You get these lawyers using the department to fight their battles."
Developers, of course, do the same. Once, several years ago, he met Donald J. Trump. "The Donald came in" and talked about the Empire State Building, Mr. Visconti said.
What kind of an impression did Mr. Visconti make? For once, the famously talkative Mr. Trump was silent. After relaying the question, an assistant to Mr. Trump said, "He really doesn't know the man, hasn't had anything to do with him, doesn't have any thoughts on him."
SOME officials suspect that his low profile is a result of his acting status. "We see him on TV, we read about him in the papers, we see him in hearings, but he's not someone we know well," said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields. "The real problem we have is lack of staff at the Buildings Department, and that's something an acting commissioner is stymied by."
Mr. Visconti denies that his 700 employees are too few. "We got more inspectors in our 2001 fiscal year budget," he says. "We needed more inspectors, we testified at the Council that we needed more inspectors, the administration gave us more and the Council gave us more, so we're staffing up now. I feel comfortable with where we are."
That was the acting commissioner talking.
"I can go two, three days without sleep," he says, the private practice architect talking again. "In practice, you spend the day meeting, selling. And you spend the evening trying to do the work."
Mr. Visconti, 53, was a partner at the Manhattan firm Beyer Blinder Belle Architects from 1981 to 1991 and was the director of technical services, overseeing construction documents and specifications. He worked on projects at the South Street Seaport, a 25,000-square-foot ski house in Aspen, Colo., and an addition to the old Barneys store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.
"Things were going swimmingly until the economy turned and we had taken on too much overhead." The partners cut their salaries by 50 percent. Then he had to lay off 60 employees. "No one wanted to hear, 'Go to Richard Visconti's office.' Then one day it was my turn."
The firm's senior partner, Richard Blinder, says Mr. Visconti volunteered to leave. "There was a lot of talk about do we have too many partners," Mr. Blinder says. "He just said, 'Look, I'll leave, and he left.' He took the initiative."
Using an administration buzzword, Mr. Visconti calls the brouhaha over the barge banner, a Dirtpile.com sign, "a quality-of-life issue."
He complains about sign pollution, and about enforcement. "We have to take each and every sign violation to criminal court," he says.
The barge had the gall to float by as Mr. Visconti was staring out the window of his office at 60 Hudson Street, an Art Deco colossus that once was home to Western Union.
Mr. Visconti says that when he saw the barge, he said something that could not go in a telegram, a sentence with a four-letter word. How unlikely. How unfocused. But that was after an all-nighter at the Brooklyn explosion.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Calls for Defeat of G.O.P. 'Old Guard'

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 26

 BODY:
Warning against apathy within the Democratic ranks, Vice President Al Gore today urged members of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's organization, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, to set aside doubts about him and work to defeat the Republican "old guard" embodied in the ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
Speaking before a mostly black audience of more than 100 people in a hotel ballroom here, Mr. Gore said the dismaying imperfections of politicians had turned off many people. 
 But he implored his listeners to avoid cynicism, cautioning that their indifference could help elect Mr. Bush and thus allow the Republicans to undermine civil rights, workers' rights, the economy, the environment and health care programs.
"There can be absolutely no doubt that voters will go to the polls choosing between two very different visions for our future," Mr. Gore said. "It is the choice between the old guard that gave us deficits, division and social injustices, and a new vision for prosperity and progress, investment, inclusion and growth to lift up all of our people."
He added: "Do not look at the imperfections and use that as an excuse for closing your heart and turning away. You have to overcome the cynicism, overcome the reluctance, overcome the doubt."
Mr. Gore did not explain what he meant by "imperfections."
His speech capped several days of campaigning in which he has sought to reach out to the party's core liberal wing, which includes environmentalists, unions and black and Hispanic voters. Many polls have shown relatively little enthusiasm among those constituencies for Mr. Gore. And as if to hammer home that point, his audience today applauded only occasionally.
His advisers say they are counting on Mr. Jackson -- who closed his remarks today with a chant of "More with Gore" -- to energize black voters by raising questions about Mr. Bush.
In introducing Mr. Gore today, Mr. Jackson -- once a bitter rival who has become his close ally -- asserted that the Clinton administration's policies had improved the lives of black families. But he also warned that "prosperity fatigue" might be creating apathy among black voters. And then he opened a slashing attack on Mr. Cheney, a former five-term congressman from Wyoming and secretary of defense under President George Bush, the governor's father.
"Dick Cheney voted against Head Start," Mr. Jackson said. "He voted against equal rights for women. He voted against sanctions against South Africa, not once but six times. He voted against freeing Nelson Mandela from jail."
Saying Mr. Cheney's record rivaled that of Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican conservative from North Carolina, Mr. Jackson added, "Beneath the veneer lies an individual of extreme views."
"We all know that image is a big part of high-tech politics," he said. "How somebody looks on TV can hide flaws. Dick Cheney has an image that is palatable. But Jesus warned us to beware wolves in sheep's clothing."
Implicit in Mr. Jackson's remarks was the concern, shared by many Democrats, that the Republicans are winning the public relations battle, successfully wooing centrist independent and swing voters.
Mr. Gore acknowledged that concern, saying, "I do give our opponents some credit" for their tactics.
"They have concocted a strategy of phrases and photo opportunities to convey the impression of inclusion and moderation," he said. "But you and I know this is not about show business. It is about the lives and livelihoods of hard-working families. You know from a hard history and long struggle that talk is cheap. Deeds are what counts."
Mr. Gore also raised questions about Mr. Bush's commitment to civil rights, recalling that the governor had supported South Carolina's right to fly the Confederate battle flag over its state house.
"He took a look up there at the flag pole," the vice president said of Mr. Bush. "He saw the American flag; he saw the dome. But he did not see a symbol of injustice and oppression. Something was wrong with his vision."
In his remarks today, Mr. Gore avoided the raspy, high-energy Southern-preacher speaking style he sometimes assumes when addressing black audiences. Instead, he spoke in a calm, almost easy-going voice as he delved into his confessional themes.
"I ask you to turn away from any who say that politics is not worth your hearts," he said. "Many hearts have been broken. Many have been disillusioned, disappointed; many have turned away. And some of the best and most effective men and women in America now keep politics at an arm's length."
"I will not let you down," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD;
Over the Years, Cheney Opposed U.S. Sanctions

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
During his early years as a White House official and member of the House, Dick Cheney, the expected Republican vice presidential candidate, consistently opposed unilateral American sanctions against nations including Iran, Cuba and South Africa.
More recently, as the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, an energy services company that is in the top 100 American concerns in revenues, Mr. Cheney became a lobbyist for lifting most sanctions. 
 Referring to "my favorite hobbyhorse, the question of unilateral sanctions," he argued in a 1998 speech that "they almost never work."
"It is very hard to find specific examples where they actually achieve a policy objective," he said.
As a new official in the Ford White House in 1974, Mr. Cheney saw the United States government, under pressure from Congress, impose sanctions against Turkey over the Cyprus issue. The action came not because it made sense from a policy standpoint, Mr. Cheney said, but "because the Greek-American lobby was significantly bigger and more effective" than its Turkish-American counterpart.
A decade later while serving in the House, Mr. Cheney twice voted to oppose sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa.
In the 1990's, as Congress moved twice to increase sanctions against Cuba, Mr. Cheney said, he would have preferred setting up a West Berlin-type enclave of democracy and free enterprise at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
But Mr. Cheney did back the multilateral sanctions against Iraq after the Persian Gulf war, aimed at curbing its production of weapons of mass destruction.
After he became chief executive of Halliburton, Mr. Cheney joined members of the United States Chamber of Commerce and pro-trade groups under the rubric of USA-Engage. The lobby led a failing effort to block the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, which bars American investment in those oil-rich countries. Halliburton is also a member of the board of the National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that recently won a victory in the Supreme Court, which struck down a Massachusetts state law imposing state-level sanctions on companies doing business in Myanmar, formerly Burma.
Mr. Cheney's company has already done business in countries still facing American sanctions, including Libya and Iraq, the enemy Mr. Cheney helped vanquish in the gulf war.
"Our government has become sanctions-happy," Mr. Cheney said in his 1998 speech.

Retirement Risks

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
In their brief joint appearance on Tuesday, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney both mentioned Social Security first when they referred to some of the big issues facing the country. Both said that strengthening the Social Security system was a priority.
And yet a rigorous analysis by the nonpartisan Century Foundation of Mr. Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts has determined that the plan would either worsen the system's long-term deficit or lead to substantial cuts in Social Security benefits, or both. 
 The analysis of Mr. Bush's plan was conducted by Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Alicia Munnell of Boston College; and Peter Orszag, president of Sebago Associates, an economics and public policy consulting firm.
It is understood that diverting revenue from the Social Security system to individual accounts, by itself, increases the system's projected deficit. The study said: "Compensating for this lost revenue and addressing Social Security's long-term deficit will require some combination of: higher payroll taxes; investing part of the Social Security trust funds in higher-yielding assets (such as stocks); general revenue transfers to Social Security; and/or reductions in Social Security benefits."
The authors went on: "Governor Bush has promised not to raise payroll taxes or invest the trust fund in stocks. He also has proposed tax cuts that would consume virtually the entire projected non-Social Security surplus, leaving no room for transfers to Social Security without causing a non-Social Security deficit. Governor Bush's plan would therefore have to rely on cutting Social Security benefits."
The study attempted to determine whether the proceeds from the individual retirement accounts would be enough to offset the benefit cuts. It came to conclusions that were frightening.
The authors based their analysis on a diversion of two percentage points of the current Social Security payroll tax into individual retirement accounts. And they assumed an inflation-adjusted rate of return on the accounts of 5.9 percent annually, which matched the assumption of Martin Feldstein, an advocate of retirement accounts and a top adviser to Governor Bush.
After extensive analysis, they concluded that substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits for workers 55 and under were inevitable.
"Social Security benefits for 30-year-olds would have to be reduced by 54 percent to extend the solvency of the Social Security system for the next 75 years," the study said. "Even if the stock market performs as well as it has historically, the combined income from the individual account and the scaled-back Social Security system would be 20 percent below current-law Social Security benefits for the average 30-year-old single earner."
That's what would happen if the stocks purchased by this hypothetical 30-year-old did well. But, of course, they might not.
"The conclusion," the authors wrote, "is that Governor Bush's proposal could cut Social Security benefits by more than 50 percent for young workers, and the proceeds from the individual accounts would (on average) make up only a portion of that cut while exposing individuals to significant risk."
Believe it or not, that's the rosier scenario.
The study said: "These estimates are based on assumptions we believe understate the likely reductions in Social Security benefits. Even with these favorable assumptions, the results are dramatic: Governor Bush's plan requires substantial reductions in Social Security benefits and increased exposure to market risks for future retirees. Indeed, the implied reductions in Social Security benefits for future retirees are so substantial, they raise questions about the viability of protecting benefits for current retirees, older workers, disabled workers, and survivors while diverting payroll taxes into individual accounts."
Governor Bush and Mr. Cheney will be rigorously cross-examined on this matter between now and November.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBUT;
Voting Record Dogs Cheney As G.O.P. Team Campaigns

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CASPER, Wyo., July 26

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush and his new running mate, Dick Cheney, made a whirlwind visit today to the vice-presidential contender's home state, defending Mr. Cheney's conservative voting record and vowing that the ticket would "renew America's purpose."
In their first campaign trip, Mr. Bush struck more partisan tones than usual, hammering away at the integrity and trustworthiness of the Clinton administration. He presented the all-Western Republican ticket as the antidote. 
 "Dick and I both have roots in the West," Mr. Bush of Texas told a chanting crowd packed into the gymnasium of the high school Mr. Cheney, 59, attended more than 40 years ago. "The West is a place full of straightforward people who usually say what they mean and mean what they say."
Then Mr. Bush reached back to one of President Clinton's well-known evasions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. "The West is full of people who understand the meaning of what the word 'is' is," he said.
A day after Mr. Bush announced that he had selected his father's former defense secretary as his running mate, the Texas governor was quickly hit with questions about Mr. Cheney's voting record in his six terms in the House. He and the Gore campaign engaged in a fierce cross-country competition to define what voters thought about Mr. Cheney.
"I obviously thought about the record," Mr. Bush said. "And this is a conservative man. So am I."
The governor and his aides said the selection of Mr. Cheney showed that Mr. Bush was putting political considerations aside to make a sober-minded decision on a running mate who could serve as commander in chief.
"He brings some strength to the administration," Mr. Bush said in a news conference.
"It speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as strong a man as he is," Mr. Bush said, "that I'm comfortable with having excellence by my side."
The Democrats also said the choice spoke volumes, about whether Mr. Bush really is a new kind of Republican or a throwback to the past. They pointed to Mr. Cheney's conservative voting record as well as his service in the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.
Mr. Cheney's record included votes against the Head Start education program, against banning so-called "cop-killer" bullets, against imposing economic sanctions on the government of South Africa and against a nonbinding House resolution calling for the release of the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
"I'm generally proud of my record in the House," Mr. Cheney told reporters. He said that he could "probably find some" votes "that I might tweak and do differently."
Mr. Cheney defended his votes, largely cast in the Reagan administration, as appropriate to the 1980's "when we had huge budget deficits, no money and when we really had to be concerned about controlling federal spending."
"Today we're in a different era," he said. "We've got a surplus. We've got the opportunity now I think to go do some things we could not have done 20 years ago."
Pressed by reporters to explain his stance on Mr. Mandela, Mr. Cheney said he had voted against sanctions on South Africa because he has generally opposed unilateral sanctions.
The Republicans also turned aside Democratic questions about their links to the oil industry. Mr. Cheney is stepping down as the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil services companies based in Dallas.
"I'm very proud of Halliburton," Mr. Cheney said. "I have nothing to apologize for." He described it as a company that had started small as the brainchild of one man and become "the quintessential American success story." Mr. Bush said his opponents were trying to "divert attention from the fact that the Democrats have no energy policy."
The Bush campaign presented the trip to Natrona High School as a sentimental journey to the hometown where Mr. Cheney met his wife, Lynne. He was the class president and a captain of the football team. She was the prom queen, and as Mr. Bush added today, a "nationally ranked champion baton twirler."
It was not a long and lingering homecoming. The appearance in the school, the lone rally of the day, lasted about 45 minutes. Aides said Mr. Cheney had to return to Dallas for a business meeting.
A cheering crowd in the hundreds packed the gym and another 1,000 people waited in a spillover room.
Gov. Jim Geringer warmed up the audience and dismissed the talk of Mr. Cheney's voting record. "I'd rather have Vice President Cheney with his heart, than President Gore with no backbone," he said.
Mr. Cheney gazed out at the crowd and said, "They never treated me this well when I was their congressman." And he joked that when he and his wife were in high school, many would have expected her to return one day along with the candidates for president and vice president. "But they never would have guessed it was going to be me," he said.
It was Mr. Bush, not his running mate, who seemed in a feisty mood. As he brought Mr. Cheney down the aisle of his campaign plane, reporters asked the governor what he thought of the Democrats' reaction to Mr. Cheney.
"What was it?" he asked. "Belittling? I'm not surprised that they would try to belittle the pick. Typical."

HEADLINE: FORD SAID TO PLAN IMPROVED MILEAGE IN SPORT UTILITIES

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 26

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company has decided to increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years, people involved in the company's plans said today. The increase, amounting to roughly five miles a gallon, would be the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of passenger vehicle in almost two decades.
Ford is convinced that Americans want to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and will steer their purchases to companies they perceive as environmentally responsible, the people said. The company's new stance is also a response to environmental concerns about the automobile's role in global warming. 
 At least at first, the company does not intend to pass the extra cost of producing more fuel-efficient vehicles directly to American customers, two people close to the plan said. The company is betting instead that improved fuel economy will increase sales more than enough to offset lower profits on each vehicle. Better gas mileage and lower operating costs for Ford sport utilities could eventually increase demand enough to allow the company to sell them with fewer rebates, and possibly even raise prices.
Ford executives hope that the more fuel-efficient sport utilities will give all of their brands an image of environmental responsibility, people close to the company's planning said. That could help sales of the company's cars, minivans and pickup trucks.
The move by Ford, which sells 800,000 sport utilities a year -- representing about a fifth of its total domestic sales -- is a sharp reversal. The company started and led the decade-long trend toward sport utility vehicles, the biggest of which consume more than twice as much gasoline a mile as the average car. The Ford Excursion is the world's largest sport utility, getting 10 miles to the gallon in the city, and 13 on the highway.
The decision to improve mileage comes even as recent efforts in Congress to mandate an increase in fuel economy have failed, partly because of lobbying by Ford and other automakers.
Much of the mileage improvement will be achieved through changes to Ford's larger sport utilities: the Ford Explorer, Expedition and Excursion, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and the Range Rover. Ford engineers say that there are many small steps that they can take to improve fuel economy, from making auto parts lighter to adjusting engines. But lighter auto parts are usually more expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of steel, while engine design alterations must be made with great care to avoid reducing vehicles' towing capacity. Ford executives declined to estimate the cost of these changes.
Part of the improvement in Ford's average fuel economy will come from the introduction in September of the Ford Escape, which is slightly smaller than the Ford Explorer and uses a lightweight car underbody instead of a heavy pickup-truck underbody. With a four-cylinder engine, the Escape gets up to 28 miles a gallon on the highway
Ford will not achieve its fuel-economy improvement by taking advantage of either of the loopholes that it and others have used in recent years: building vehicles like the Excursion to be so large that they are excluded from the federal averages, and building vehicles that qualify for alternative-fuel mileage credits. The Excursion will be counted as Ford pursues its 25 percent improvement.
Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are building huge numbers of minivans, pickup trucks and midsize cars that can burn either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol. These vehicles are counted in the averages as though they have triple their actual mileage, even though only 100 of the nation's 170,000 service stations sell ethanol.
Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, is scheduled to fly to Washington on Thursday to announce the company's decision at the National Press Club, people involved in the company's plans said.
DaimlerChrysler and G.M., Ford's main rivals in the sport utility market, declined to comment on Ford's move, saying only that some of their models were already fuel-efficient. Detroit automakers, including Ford, have said in the past that improved mileage for sport utilities would require sacrifices in engine power and vehicle size that American consumers would not tolerate.
Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler each have a quarter of the sport utility market. Foreign automakers divide up the remaining share.
G.M. has just finished improving the gas mileage of its full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by 5 percent over the last three years by completely redesigning them for the first time in a decade. But G.M. and other automakers have not improved their fuel-economy averages, increasing the power, size and gas consumption of some models even as others have become more efficient.
Ford voluntarily cleaned up its sport utility vehicles' tailpipe emissions two years ago to make them as clean as cars' emissions. While the cost has approached $100 a vehicle, and while many rivals have not yet followed suit, Ford officials say that decision has been a selling point.
William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman since the start of last year and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, is an outspoken environmentalist who has called for the auto industry to address global warming. At the company's annual meeting two months ago in Atlanta, he acknowledged the environmental and safety drawbacks of sport utilities.
There have been a few small signs in Washington that Federal fuel-economy standards, little changed since the mid-1980's, might be reconsidered next year. But there is no indication that the government might require nearly as big of an improvement as Ford is planning. Mr. Nasser intends to present the plan as an example of how the auto industry can improve fuel economy voluntarily, and will not call for tighter federal regulations.
Automakers are currently required to sell cars with an average fuel economy -- based on 55 percent city driving and 45 percent highway driving -- of 27.5 miles a gallon and so-called light trucks with an average fuel economy of 20.7 miles a gallon. Sport utilities, vans and pickup trucks are all counted as light trucks and now represent half of the American auto market, partly because manufacturers have switched production away from cars as low gasoline prices and a strong economy in the 1990's produced a soaring demand for large, but gas-guzzling, vehicles. Until now, Ford has barely met the averages, and its sport utilities have done especially badly.
President Clinton raised the fuel-economy standard for sport utilities, minivans and pickup trucks by two-tenths of a mile per gallon in 1993 and 1994, to 20.7 miles per gallon. When Republicans took control of the House and Senate in 1995, they began amending the federal budget each year to prevent the Transportation Department from spending any money to study the issue or tighten standards. Each annual budget since then has included the same prohibition, but support for the provision has dwindled as light trucks have increased as a share of the market.
High gasoline prices prompted an effort this spring by Western senators, whose constituents drive long distances, and by environmentalists, to overturn the ban. Under a recent Senate compromise, the freeze on fuel-economy standards will remain for another year while the National Academy of Sciences reviews federal fuel-economy policy.
Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Michigan Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, has blocked fuel-economy changes on the House side. His chief of staff, Paul Welday, said that Ford's latest move was a good one if it helped sell sport utility vehicles, but would strengthen those who want tighter standards.
"Inside the Beltway, it will only fuel the fires of those who believe that if Ford can do that, everybody else should be forced to do that," Mr. Welday said.
Daniel Becker, the energy policy director at the Sierra Club, said environmentalists would use Ford's decision in their lobbying. "This shows that the people who say you can't make cars cleaner and more fuel-efficient are wrong," he said. "This shows that a company that wants to improve fuel economy can do so."
Ford officials believe that they can improve mileage while maintaining the safety of their vehicles' occupants. Occupants of lightweight, subcompact cars tend to fare poorly in collisions. But a variety of recent studies have found that vehicles weighing 3,000 to 3,500 pounds -- the weight of a midsize or large car -- tend to be very safe; further weight provides only a little additional safety for the occupants, while tremendously increasing the risk to other motorists during collisions. Ford's current sport utilities weigh from 3,700 pounds for a two-wheel-drive Explorer to 7,200 pounds for an Excursion with four-wheel drive.
Mr. Nasser's plans have provoked some nervousness within Ford that the automaker may be limiting its ability to respond if gas prices fall or if consumers begin demanding even more powerful vehicles. "There is a lot of struggle within the company over whether this is the right number and the right time frame," a person involved in the plan said.

Chief of Spain's Big Phone Company Quits

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN JONES 

DATELINE: MADRID, July 26

 BODY:
Juan Villalonga, the chairman of Spain's vast telecommunications company, Telefonica, resigned today, leaving a once-stodgy Spanish monopoly that he had turned into a giant with fast-growing holdings in Latin America and the Internet.
Speculation had spread that Mr. Villalonga, 47, would resign after today's board meeting in the wake of an abandoned $58 billion merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN. The failure of the deal in May, because of Spanish government opposition, humiliated Mr. Villalonga, people close to the company said today. 
 In addition, Mr. Villalonga's clashes with government supporters on the Telefonica board suggest that as much as the revitalized Spanish economy had become more open and entrepreneurial in the last decade, there are limits to antagonizing the country's clubby elite.
Cesar Alierta, 55, chairman of the Spanish tobacco company Altadis, was named to succeed Mr. Villalonga. "The appropriate time has come for a change in the company's leadership," Telefonica said in a statement. What compensation Mr. Villalonga will receive was not disclosed.
Mr. Alierta, who has an M.B.A. from Columbia University, is no stranger to privatization and cross-border deals -- he led his company's $2.4 billion merger with Seita of France. Still, he will be following a remarkable act on the European business scene. Mr. Villalonga took the helm of Telefonica in 1996, when the company was still state-owned. Under the direction of a new center-right government, it was privatized a year later and Mr. Villalonga quickly moved to transform Telefonica into a stellar performer, outpacing other newly privatized European phone companies.
Telefonica made some $21 billion in acquisitions, gaining a huge share of the Brazilian market, as well as chunks in Argentina and Peru. Under Mr. Villalonga's leadership, the company became the largest supplier of telecommunications services in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. Telefonica says it reaches a potential market exceeding 550 million customers in 24 nations through affiliates in Europe, the United States, Latin America and Africa. Sales in 1999 approached $21 billion.
Mr. Villalonga also spun off cellular phone and multimedia businesses, as well as the Internet arm, Terra Networks. The spinoffs -- taking advantage of the market's voracious appetite for such businesses -- and Mr. Villalonga's aggressive, flashy style won over investors. Shares of Telefonica have risen sharply since Mr. Villalonga took over, though dropping amid the management uncertainty in recent months. Today, the company's American depository receipts rose $1.875, to $67.3125.
The change of leadership seemed largely a relief to investors and analysts, who said Telefonica was likely to maintain its course. "Over the medium term, there might be some volatility in Telefonica shares," said Glen Spencer Chapman, an analyst with Ibersecurities here. "But it's a good company and cheap compared to other telecoms in Europe. It would appear that Telefonica will go ahead with the deals it has on the horizon."
Another analyst, Nahum Sanchez de la Madrid, of Benito Monjardin, said Mr. Villalonga's resignation "eliminates the uncertainty which has sapped confidence in the company over the past several months."
Telefonica's $12 billion planned acquisition of Lycos, the American Internet portal, will not be affected by the change, executives said today. Robert J. Davis, Lycos's chief executive, said Mr. Villalonga's resignation removed a cloud over the merger. "It now becomes clear to our shareholders that the deal will get done," he said, noting that the merger agreement did not give Telefonica or Terra the right to back out. Lycos shares gained 10 percent today.
Mr. Villalonga's departure came after signs that the close political ties that had put him at Telefonica's helm were starting to unravel. He was a high school classmate of the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and after years with the consultants McKinsey & Company and with Credit Suisse First Boston and Bankers Trust, he was put in charge of privatizing Telefonica by Mr. Aznar's new government. With official support, he challenged ingrained Spanish business practices.
But his rough-and-tumble deal-making ways in time exacted political costs. In March's general election, the opposition Socialists made much of the millions of dollars of stock options Telefonica had awarded Mr. Villalonga and other top executives. They accused Mr. Aznar's government of rewarding cronies while ignoring the poor.
And last month, the newspaper El Mundo reported that Spain's stock market authority had reopened an investigation into accusations that Mr. Villalonga purchased company options as Telefonica was negotiating an alliance with WorldCom. The accusations first circulated two years ago, but regulators said then that they had found nothing illegal.
Mr. Villalonga has denied the insider-trading charges, saying he had bought the options on 264,244 shares two months before the alliance was announced.
He has also became fodder for Spanish gossip columns after he separated from his wife last year and began dating a former Mexican beauty queen who lives in Miami. His jet set lifestyle did not find favor among ordinary Spaniards.
More important, Spanish nationalism derailed Telefonica's biggest cross-border deal. In May, the government and two banks represented on Telefonica's board, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and La Caixa, helped scotch the KPN merger. While Mr. Villalonga had sought a deal so as to create a pan-European network of fixed-line, data and wireless services, Madrid officials opposed the linkup, arguing that the Dutch government would be the biggest shareholder in the new company. The government threatened to use its golden share in Telefonica to torpedo the deal.
Mr. Villalonga "was maybe too independent for BBVA and La Caixa," Mr. Chapman of Ibersecurities said. "Sometimes, Mr. Villalonga was perceived as too aggressive."

Samaranch Says I.O.C. 'Has a New Philosophy'

 BODY:
With only 50 days remaining before the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, was interviewed yesterday by Christopher Clarey of The New York Times. The interview took place in Samaranch's office overlooking Lake Geneva at the I.O.C.'s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, and it covered a wide range of topics, from preparations for the Summer Games to the continuing investigation into possible bribery and fraud in Salt Lake City's bid to be host of the 2002 Winter Olympics.
 
Q. How important do you think Sydney is for the future of the Olympics and how important is the success of Sydney after the problems of the last couple of years? 

A. I would not like to link what happened in Salt Lake City with Sydney. Because what happened in Salt Lake City, the I.O.C. really was affected. It affected some of our members, the organization, myself and so on. But I can assure you the Olympic Games was not affected and I can tell you for example that now we are waiting for the candidates for 2008. That decision will be made next year. We have 10 candidates, 10 very strong candidates, and that means that the prestige of the Games are not affected.
Speaking with regards to Sydney, we want to have a great Games. If it's possible, the best one. We don't know. The day before yesterday I was in Athens. I had a lovely tea with the president of the organizing committee of the Sydney Games, Michael Knight. And he's very happy, and if he is very happy, I am very happy.
 
Q. What are the positive aspects of Sydney from your point of view at this stage, and what are the aspects that concern you?
 
A. The positive aspects is that they work very well. They work on time. All the sports facilities were ready one year before. We could have pre-Olympic events to test these events at all the Olympic sites and Australia is a country which is crazy about sport. They expect great results from their team, around 60 medals. This is fantastic for a country of 19 million people and the bad thing for me regarding the Games is that they are in the spring in the Southern Hemisphere . Spring is not very warm. It could be cold. We could have rain, and that is, for me, the main problem.
 
Q. Has there been progress on the idea of having South Korea and North Korea marching together in the opening and closing ceremonies in Sydney?
 
A. I wrote to the two presidents to have the possibility of a joint team with the same uniform maybe and they discussed it during the visit of the president of South Korea to North Korea, and we got the official answer from South Korea:. they agree. But as of today we have not had an answer from North Korea.
 
Q. Do you expect you will have one soon?
 
A. We need it soon. In two weeks it will be too late. Not to parade together but to parade together in the same uniform, it will be too late in two weeks. Because the I.O.C. offered to present the same uniform for both teams. It was a present of the I.O.C.
 
Q. What will the I.O.C. do in Sydney to attempt to project a more open, accessible approach, to combat the image it has as a closed, pampered club?
 
A. The most important thing is that the I.O.C. has a new philosophy and that inside the I.O.C. we must have many members coming from international federations, many members coming from national Olympic committees. And also we have a fourth partner now, a very important partner, those are the athletes.
At this moment, we have 113 members and 30 of these members, they took part in the Olympic Games and 16 of these 30 members, they won medals in the Games. And that means that more than 25 percent are athletes or ex-athletes. In Sydney, during the Olympic Games, we will elect eight new members of the I.O.C. coming from active athletes. They will be elected by 10,000 athletes in the Olympic Village. And one of these eight will even sit on the executive board of the I.O.C., which means the government of the I.O.C.
 
Q. How will the I.O.C. project itself in Sydney? Will you still be in the finest hotels and driving around in chauffeured cars?
 
A. We will be in a hotel, a normal hotel. I will have my bedroom and a living room to meet with the people from the delegations who want to see me. That is what I need.
 
Q. And for transportation?
 
A. We will have a van to have some people with me, and we'll see. Listen, I need a car, don't I? But it will be a van.
 
Q. Do you have any research that shows the effect of your reforms on public opinion of the I.O.C.?
 
A. I think the situation is much more quiet. This very big scandal that you mentioned was a very big scandal in the United States and some other countries but I can assure you that this was not the case in all the countries.
 
Q. There are very likely to be Aboriginal protests of some form in Sydney. Are you concerned there will be any negative impact on the Games?
 
A. I don't think so. Because all the Aboriginal people are Australians. Maybe they will demonstrate on the occasion of the Games because they have a very important showcase, but also I think they are very much interested in the success of the Games. I will arrive in Sydney on the third or fourth of September. If I can meet with them again, I am ready.
 
Q. Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene are not going to be running in the 200 meters in Sydney, because of what happened in the American Olympic trials. Would the I.O.C. ever consider giving a wild-card berth to defending champions as the International Amateur Athletic Federation has done with track and field world championships, or do you believe the system is fine the way it is now?
 
A. The wild cards are not the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee. It must be a request coming from the I.A.A.F. If the I.A.A.F. makes this request, I think the International Olympic Committee is ready to study this request in a positive way.
 
Q. Does the I.O.C. want to ensure the best athletes are at the Games in their best events?
 
A. It is an American problem, 100 percent. If Greene and Johnson are not there, then two other Americans will be there, and as you know, in your country, you have a lot.
 
Q. Tom Welch and Dave Johnson have been at the center of the Salt Lake City scandal and now they have been indicted. Is that a sign of Salt Lake City's failings or the I.O.C.'s failings? And how do you view their indictments on a personal level?
 
A. I was not surprised, because all the people said that Welch and Johnson would be indicted, but personally I can say that with them I had a very good relationship. They were very friendly and very cooperative always with me and the I.O.C.
 
Q. But is it primarily a failure on the Salt Lake City end or I.O.C. end?
 
A. What I have a right to say is that it was a mistake by some members of the I.O.C. and also, it was a mistake on the other side.
 
Q. You have been to Athens recently. How is the situation evolving there since you expressed your concerns publicly about the organization there?
 
A. Much, much better. The day before yesterday I was with the prime minister, Costas Simitis, and I also had a short talk with the president of the country, and the appointment of the new president of the organizing committee is Madame Gianna Angelopoulos and I think it was the best decision. She was a great victor when she brought the Games to Athens for 2004. Now she is there and she is running the team she had during the bid and we are confident now that things are going in the right way.
 
Q. You have been quoted as saying you wish you had stepped down as president after the Barcelona Games. Is that true and if so, why?
 
A. Yes, it is true. Because after the great success of Barcelona in my city, I was at that moment 71 or 72. It was the right moment maybe to leave. But on this occasion, I allowed myself to ask for re-election for four more years, because in the four years to come there would be the centennial of the I.O.C. and a big congress in Paris and to be the president of the I.O.C. was a great honor on the occasion of the centennial. But after, there came the last election in 1997, and maybe yes, that was a mistake. Maybe.
 
Q. Six of the seven I.O.C. presidents have been Europeans and there has been one American, Avery Brundage. Do you think it is desirable to have a greater geographical representation in the future?
 
A. Maybe yes, but Europe is very important in the Olympic movement. Speaking of the Summer Games, maybe 60 percent of the medals and 60 to 65 percent of the participants are from Europe and for the Winter Games, maybe 85 percent of the medals and participants are coming from Europe.
 
Q. What sort of qualities do you think your successor will need to succeed in the role of president in the years ahead?
 
A. I think it serves no purpose to give advice or to recommend certain types of qualities for the next president. After you're gone, you're gone. But maybe one important thing is that the next president must be a full-time president, like me, and living in Lausanne, because if not, you are giving all the powers to the I.O.C. staff. And the staff of the I.O.C. and also in all the other organizations must be responding to the decisions of the elected people.
 
Q. Do you think that unlike you, he or she should draw a salary?
 
A. Why not? If he does not have the economical means to not be paid, he must be paid, like many international federation presidents and international organization presidents are paid.
 
Q. Some people believe that the 2008 Games will be the last in which the Internet does not play a major role in viewing and the last before the sports program evolves. Do you agree and how do you envision the I.O.C. negotiating this transition?
 
A. Maybe the next president can change many things in the program. Maybe. I couldn't, because to accept new sports is very easy, but to get rid of sports is quite impossible. But maybe the next president can succeed where I did not. As for the Internet, we don't know. That is something which is a mystery for us about the future of television and the Internet and for this reason in November we are organizing a big congress to have some light shed on what the future of the Internet and television will be. What we have to guard against is not to pit the Internet against television. I'm speaking for today. I don't know what can happen one or two years from now. At this moment, I believe we have to put the Internet and television together.
 
Q. There has been an increasing number of prominent athletes switching nationalities. Eunice Barber, the heptathlon world champion who was born in Sierra Leone, became a French citizen shortly before winning. Lyudmila Engquist became a Swedish citizen shortly before winning a gold medal in the hurdles in Atlanta. Does it concern you that as nationality becomes a commodity, it might dilute the impact of the Games?
 
A. In the I.O.C. we have a rule and the rule is that if you are to change nationality, there must be an agreement between the two Olympic committees and if there is no agreement, you must wait three years. If a boy is marrying a German girl and gets German nationality, normally he can compete for that new country. I think in your country, you have a good example with your professional leagues. They are full of foreign people. We have our rule that's all, and we are respecting this rule.
 
Q. You said last year that "I used to be happy to open the door of my office. Now, I am happy if I close it behind me." How do you feel now?
 
A. I said this because last year was not an easy year for me, to be the leader, to try to get through these reforms, because the members of the I.O.C., when they were elected, they had a lot of powers and prerogatives and to convince them it was time to change and to give up many prerogatives, like the visits to the bidding cities for the Olympic Games and so on, was not easy.
So that means at that moment, it was not easy. Now, it's a pleasure again, but I'm also thinking that this pleasure will not last very long.
 
Q. You're referring to the end of your term next year?
 
A. In 11 months, I will be an ex-president.

HEADLINE: Learning How to Run: A West Texas Stumble

SERIES: GOVERNOR BUSH'S JOURNEY: The First Campaign

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: LUBBOCK, Tex.

 BODY:
George W. Bush was seething with frustration. Here he was, feeling as Texan as the chaw he liked to tuck under his lower lip, and he had to smile gamely while the audience snickered at him as an alien in cowboy boots.
It was 1978, and the 31-year-old Mr. Bush was trying to get a start in politics by running for Congress here in West Texas. A candidate forum was under way, and his rival was needling Mr. Bush with an oft-repeated joke in which he was the punchline, a yarn that reinforced a perception of him as a spoiled rich kid from back East. 
 Kent Hance, the Democratic candidate and a smooth-talking good old boy, was telling a yarn about working in a field along a rural road. Then along came a fancy car.
"It was a Mercedes," drawled Mr. Hance, raising his eyebrows, and the audience tittered knowingly at the hint that Mr. Bush was the kind of man more comfortable in a Mercedes than a pick-up. "The guy rolled down the window and wanted to know how to get to a certain ranch."
Mr. Hance recounted how he'd given the man directions, telling him to turn right after a cattle guard, a metal grate ubiquitous in rural roads to keep livestock from straying. "Then," Mr. Hance continued, "he said, 'what color uniform will that cattle guard be wearing?' "
The audience roared with laughter, and just to be sure that the voters got the connection with the Connecticut-born Mr. Bush, Mr. Hance said he had noticed something else about the Mercedes: "It had Connecticut license plates."
Mr. Bush lost that race for Congress. Yet the story of his entry into politics, and particularly of that campaign, suggests that it left a deep imprint on him, one evident today as he campaigns for the White House.
Back then, Mr. Bush ran an energetic but deeply flawed campaign. He chose a race that may have been unwinnable, and then let himself be portrayed to many voters as an over-educated phony out of touch with ordinary voters -- ironically, a bit the way some Bush supporters now look at Vice President Al Gore.
When Mr. Bush first entered the Congressional race, he was still single and struggling to start an oil company. He was not obvious Congressional material: he lived in a bachelor's flat, his bedframe tied together with one of his neckties, and he dressed exclusively in ratty denim or in clothes that did not match.
"You've got to understand what a bad dresser George was," said Joe O'Neill, a friend from those days. "George didn't dress down, which intentionally looks bad. He just dressed bad. He dressed in the dark."
Mr. Bush campaigned feverishly from morning to night in his white Oldsmobile Cutlass, usually running late, his volunteers sitting beside him and struggling to domesticate him.
"He chewed tobacco," recalled Lisa Nowlin, one of those volunteers, "and we always had to carry a spit cup so he could spit out the tobacco before he saw the Methodist preachers."
Older people were sometimes put off by what they saw as Mr. Bush's cockiness, but the young volunteers were dazzled by his enthusiasm. "No matter how late the activities of the previous evening, he was always up early the next morning and working in a way I'd rarely seen in Lubbock," said J. Michael Weiss, whom Mr. Bush met while shaking hands at a shopping mall and turned into a volunteer county chairman.
"Of course," Mr. Weiss added reflectively, "Lubbock is maybe not the high-energy capital of the world."
 
A Life Steeped in Politics
George W. Bush is often seen today as a very late entrant into politics; he is running for president after holding elective office for just five years. Yet in another sense, he has been engaged in politics one way or another since his teens and has considered various runs for office since his 20's.
Mr. Bush was first exposed to politics at the age of 17, when his father ran for the Senate, and later he worked full-time on Senate campaigns in Florida for Edward J. Gurney and in Alabama for Winton M. Blount, nicknamed Red. The lure of these campaigns was not policy but the adventure of a statewide campaign; a friend recalls Mr. Bush saying that he spent his time in Alabama drinking and dating.
Diane Paul, a girlfriend of Mr. Bush when he was in his mid-twenties, said that Mr. Bush was fascinated even then by politics and searching for a way to run for office.
"He was very active trying to see how he could get his nose into politics," she said, "trying to figure out what was going to be his next move."
In 1971, when he was 25, Mr. Bush found a spot. A seat in the Texas State Senate was coming open in Houston the next year, and he chewed over with friends the idea of running for it.
"He explored it, he had conversations with the mayor, and he went to a couple of functions to test the waters and talk to people about it," said Donald B. Ensenat, his roommate in Houston at the time. "I assume he decided not to run because he thought he wouldn't win, because he thought he wasn't ready."
So Mr. Bush went off to Harvard Business School and then started business in 1975 as an oilman in Midland, the West Texas city where he had spent his childhood. Just two years later, a terrific opportunity seemed to tumble into his lap. George Mahon, the local Democratic congressman, announced his retirement after 43 years in the House.
George W. immediately leaped into the race to succeed him. Shortly afterward, he resumed an acquaintance with a one-time seventh-grade classmate, Laura Welch. After a whirlwind courtship, they married on the first weekend available.
It was a useful marriage. For a candidate like Mr. Bush who some saw as a rootless and immature carpet-bagger, it was helpful politically to settle down and start a family, particularly with a local girl who was an authentic West Texan. But the young couple seemed absolutely in love as they roared around the district on the campaign trail, and there was almost no muttering about the sheer political convenience of it all.
What drew Mr. Bush into politics?
In an interview, he rejected the suggestion that he had followed his father into politics, saying instead that he had been angry at Carter administration policy on natural gas pricing. But in a 1995 conversation with a historian, Herbert S. Parmet, Mr. Bush emphasized the degree to which his own family legacy pushed him into the political world.
"There is a passing on of tradition, passing on legacy, passing on responsibility," Mr. Bush said then, according to Professor Parmet's transcript of the conversation. "So I don't think it's a conscious effort. I don't think it's any of this thing where, you know, 'by God, young man, if you play your cards right you, too, may end up in politics.' It's more of an inherent trait."
 
A Famous Name's Consequences
Mr. Bush may not have had a decent suit when he announced his candidacy, but he had other assets -- among them a first-rate name. George Bush had been a prominent name in Texas ever since his father had begun his political career in 1964 with a campaign for the Senate and then, after losing, served two terms as a congressman from Houston.
The elder Bush ran for the Senate unsuccessfully again in 1970, but by then his star was rising in the Republican Party: he was mentioned three times as a possible vice president -- twice for President Richard M. Nixon, once for President Gerald R. Ford -- and became famous by holding a series of posts like ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee and director of central intelligence.
The younger Mr. Bush's key supporters in the 1978 campaign were his buddies in Midland, people like Donald L. Evans, who is now the chairman of his presidential campaign. In addition, friends of the father helped out the son or contributed money.
Financial reports showed that among those donors in 1978 were William Ford, vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company; Donald M. Kendall, the chairman of Pepsico; A. W. Clausen, chairman of Bank of America; Peter O'Malley, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; and even Mrs. Douglas MacArthur from her suite in the Waldorf Towers back in New York.
It would have been difficult to imagine an unknown 31-year-old who had barely held a job running for Congress -- had it not been for Mr. Bush's name and his family connections. But it soon became apparent that there was also a downside to this pedigree.
The other candidate in the Republican primary runoff, Jim Reese, the courtly and conservative mayor of Odessa, initiated attacks on Mr. Bush using themes that still reverberate today. Indeed, some of the epithets later attributed to Ann Richards when she competed -- and lost -- against Mr. Bush in the 1994 contest for governor, like Junior or Shrub, were first used by Mr. Reese in 1978.
Sensitive to the perception that he was simply playing on his name and background -- a sensitivity that continues to this day -- Mr. Bush asked his father not to campaign for him and played down the connection.
"We don't need Dad in this race," Mr. Bush told The Midland Reporter-Telegram. "We don't need anyone in this race but the people of this district."
Yet the Congressional primary runoff became a proxy battle between two national Republican giants, for Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush were dueling in preparation for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, and Mr. Reagan did not want a Bush family victory in Texas. Mr. Reagan contributed $3,000 from his own political action committee to Mr. Reese's campaign and taped a television commercial for him. This infuriated the Bush family.
"I'm not interested in getting into an argument with Reagan," the elder Mr. Bush told The Washington Post at that time. "But I am surprised about what he is doing here, in my state."
"They are making a real effort to defeat George," Mr. Bush added indignantly.
Young George also found himself pummeled by conspiracy-minded right-wingers.
His father was a member of the Trilateral Commission, a group of prominent internationalists working for cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. Word spread among farmers that the commission intended to create a world government and was responsible for depressed crop prices.
"We were going broke farming, and we were fighting anything that was keeping us down," recalled J. C. Lewis, an Oklahoma farmer and retired Air Force pilot who flew down to Texas to campaign against Mr. Bush in small towns like Wolfforth.
Gerald McCathern, a prominent farmer in the area, said: "We were always voicing the opinion, 'if you support the Trilateral Commission that your father is in, then farmers can't support you.' And he wouldn't back down. He would say 'he's my father and I support my father.' "
 
Missteps Along the Trail
The most common interpretation of the 1978 campaign is that Mr. Bush was a wonderful campaigner and natural-born politician. But this seems to be a gloss burnished by time and the selective memories of Mr. Bush and his friends.
Here in West Texas people say that Mr. Bush was personable and a quick study but still made a series of mistakes, largely through inexperience.
For example, there was the day, early in the campaign, at a candidate forum on a farm near the town of Dimmitt. "Today is the first time I've been on a real farm," Mr. Bush said, beaming at the crowd.
Mr. Reese, who was next to speak, began by saying: "I want to assure you, this is not the first time I've been on a real farm."
Then there was the TV commercial Mr. Bush dreamed up to demonstrate how energetic he was: it showed him jogging on a track. In those days, joggers were about as common in West Texas as Martians.
"The only time folks around here go running," Mr. Hance, the Democratic candidate, told audiences, "is when somebody's chasing 'em."
Ernie Angelo, a Midland businessman and prominent Republican leader in Texas, said that people either have a natural instinct for politics or they don't. Back then, Mr. Angelo said, he did not see it.
"In his campaign in '78, I didn't get the feeling that he had the knack for it," Mr. Angelo said of Mr. Bush. Since then, Mr. Angelo has revised his opinion and now believes Mr. Bush has tremendous political instincts.
In the end, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Reese handily in the Republican primary, taking 56 percent of the vote.
"George has been underestimated every time," Mr. Reese reflected the other day, as he sat on a couch in his home in Odessa. "I did it initially. Ann Richards did it in the governor's race. And Al Gore may be doing that now."
Everybody knew that the winner of the Democratic primary, Mr. Hance, would present tougher competition. A smooth-talking farmboy who had grown up in the area, Mr. Hance was a rising political star who represented a state senate district that largely overlapped with the 19th Congressional district they were fighting over.
"Kent Hance was a down-home boy, real homey, and George W. wasn't homey like Kent," recalled Johnnye Davis, a Republican leader in Odessa. "He didn't come across to the voters as well as Kent did, with the little jokes that Kent told."
While Mr. Bush now is sometimes mocked for an ignorance of policy details, back then people thought he had the opposite problem: a tendency to drop references in his speeches that baffled audiences, like a discussion of anti-inflationary economic policy.
"He was quick, a bit too quick, so that people didn't always get it," Mrs. Davis said. "He was so darn intelligent that a lot of what he said went over people's heads. He's learned to explain things a little better since then."
Another problem was that while Mr. Bush never really had a clear campaign strategy, Mr. Hance did: he focused his campaign on emphasizing local ties and on casting Mr. Bush as a carpet-bagger from the East. One of Mr. Hance's most effective radio spots was this one, read by an announcer:
"In 1961, when Kent Hance graduated from Dimmitt High School in the 19th congressional district, his opponent George W. Bush was attending Andover Academy in Massachusetts. In 1965, when Kent Hance graduated from Texas Tech, his opponent was at Yale University. And while Kent Hance graduated from University of Texas Law School, his opponent" -- the announcer's voice plunged -- "get this, folks, was attending Harvard. We don't need someone from the Northeast telling us what our problems are."
Otice A. Green, a long-time political consultant who has worked on campaigns since 1956 -- including Mr. Hance's in 1978 -- said that Mr. Bush made a "good entry" into politics and was an impressive candidate. But, he added: "Kent Hance was one of the best I ever saw."
It would have helped Mr. Bush if Republicans had united around him and vouched for him as a genuine West Texan. In retrospect, several Republicans think Mr. Bush should have tried much harder to get Mr. Reese's strong backing for the general election.
"Any time I was asked, I told people I was supporting George," Mr. Reese said. "But I don't remember him asking me to campaign for him."
Mr. Bush spent a third more than Mr. Hance in the general election campaign, but the extra spending played into the Democrats' hands. Mr. Hance denounced Mr. Bush for getting 64 percent of his campaign contributions from outside the district.
"Those contributions from the Northeast concern me," Mr. Hance declared at one public meeting. "The Northeast has been in direct conflict with us on oil and gas and agriculture."
Mr. Bush complained that Mr. Hance's numbers were wrong. Over all, he said, only 48 percent of the money came from contributors outside the district.
"We've been attacked for where I was born, for who my family is, and where my money has come from," The Midland Reporter-Telegram quoted Mr. Bush as saying. "I don't think that's fair."
 
Backgrounds Became the Issue
Mr. Bush and Mr. Hance did not have any particular ideological or policy disagreement. Indeed, The Reporter-Telegram wrote that at one appearance the two men were asked what difference there was between them.
"Well," Mr. Bush said finally, "I've got more hair."
"I wish I did," Mr. Hance, who was balding, responded wistfully.
"Hance would have made a good Republican," Mr. Bush told the audience.
"And Bush would have made a good conservative Democrat," Mr. Hance affirmed.
So in the absence of policy differences, their differing backgrounds and styles loomed over the race.
"Yale and Harvard don't prepare you as well for running for the 19th Congressional district as Texas Tech does," Mr. Hance told audiences.
Farmers continued to ask the candidates about the Trilateral Commission, and Mr. Hance shrewdly replied: "I don't know anything about it. But in 1973 when the Trilateral Commission was formed, what were you getting for corn and wheat? And what are you getting now?"
Mr. Bush's father was appalled that his membership in the Trilateral Commission was hurting his son's candidacy. So he wrote to Mr. McCathern, the farm organizer, and suggested a meeting to clear the air.
"He wrote me a four-page handwritten letter asking me to meet him in Houston any time that was agreeable," Mr. McCathern recalled. "He wanted to help his boy any way he could."
They had a "very, very affable meeting" in Houston, Mr. McCathern said, and Mr. Bush resigned from the Trilateral Commission a few days before the election. But if the elder Bush kept his cool over the issue, the son occasionally lost his.
Mel Turner, a local radio personality and a Republican, said he was leaning toward Mr. Bush but was troubled by the matter of the Trilateral Commission. At a candidate forum at the Branding Iron restaurant in Odessa, Mr. Turner stood up and asked Mr. Bush about the Trilateral Commission and whether his father was working for one-world government.
"He jumped like he'd been pricked," Mr. Turner said. Then, after the meeting, Mr. Turner stood at the door to say goodbye to the candidates.
"Junior Bush comes up, refused to shake my hand, looked me square in the eye and said, 'you . . . ' " using a crude epithet, Mr. Turner recalled. "Then Kent Hance came up and said, 'Mel, I'll see you up at the Tech game."'
"Here's a Republican candidate stepping on the wrong toes," Mr. Turner said. "He was an arrogant rich kid, a spoiled brat."
 
A Failure to Fight Back
Late in the campaign, disaster struck the Bush forces.
A university student was organizing a "Bush bash" to recruit young people from Texas Tech, and placed an advertisement in the student newspaper promising free beer. In fact, the event was tame and ended early, but the Democrats had their ammunition.
Five days before the election, a law partner of Mr. Hance wrote a public letter denouncing the Bush campaign for using alcohol to lure young people. The letter went to 4,000 members of the Church of Christ in Lubbock, and copies were put under windshield wipers of cars of people attending church services.
"Kent's opponent, young Mr. Bush, apparently is using tactics to secure votes which do not indicate the same high character," the letter declared. "Mr. Bush has used some of his vast sums of money in an attempt, evidently, to persuade young college students to vote for and support him by offering free alcohol to them."
The local newspapers wrote about the incident, quoting Mr. Hance as saying: "Maybe it's a cool thing to do at Harvard or Yale."
Mr. Bush called a news conference in which he fumed: "His campaign has been funny. First he attacked my family, then my background, and now my morals."
Supporters of Mr. Bush found out that Mr. Hance owned a building that was leased to Fat Dawgs, a bar in Lubbock. Some of Mr. Bush's friends urged him to accuse Mr. Hance of hypocrisy, but he refused; voters would reward a candidate who took the high road, he told supporters.
"His weakness was that he wouldn't go for the jugular," said Jane Anne Stinnett, a cotton broker and longtime Lubbock Republican. Ms Stinnett said that she argued for a tough response to the beer bash accusations, but "he just didn't want to do it."
A few days later, Mr. Bush was defeated, 53 percent to 47 percent.
"We were glad the race was over," Mr. Hance said. "He was really improving every day.
"He's a bright guy, and he picked up the issues and got better as time went on," Mr. Hance added. "If it'd been two weeks earlier, we would have beaten him worse. If it'd been two weeks later, it would have been really close."
Of course, if Mr. Bush had won, it might not have been the best thing for his career. He would have become part of the Washington establishment, and would not have cultivated the beyond-the-beltway aura that has been his strength since he re-entered politics by running for governor in 1994.
As for Mr. Hance, he ran for the United States Senate in 1984 but lost and ended up a lawyer in Austin -- and a supporter of the Bushes. Mr. Hance recalled that while in Congress, he met another young Southern Democrat, a Tennessean named Al Gore, and grew friendly with him. After seeing both men in action, he concluded that Mr. Bush is a far more effective campaigner.
"I'm convinced that Bush is going to be beat him and beat him soundly," Mr. Hance said. "I served with Gore and I know him, and I like him. But I'd hate to ride from Lubbock to Los Angeles with him. If you rode from Lubbock to Los Angeles with Bush, it'd be loads of fun. And Gore'd be saying things like, 'I see some mountains.' "
 
Lessons From the Campaign
So what did Mr. Bush learn from his first political contest? How did it change him?
He seems to have learned that a candidate needs to pick his races, for it may have been impossible for a Republican oilman from Midland to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic district dominated by agriculture and the rival city of Lubbock.
"It was an interesting lesson," Mr. Bush said in an interview. "Sometimes there are races you just can't win."
Another lesson, some of Mr. Bush's friends say, is the need to respond forcefully to accusations like those about the "Bush bash." The high road may be honorable, he discovered, but it does not necessarily lead to elective office.
More broadly, that first campaign taught Mr. Bush, as his old pal Mr. O'Neill puts it, "don't let your opponent define you."
"He defined George as a carpet-bagger, and it's nonsense," Mr. O'Neill mused. "So that's the lesson George learned: When someone comes out with something, he's on it like a chicken on a June bug, because he's not going to let someone else define him."
Mr. Hance believes he taught Mr. Bush two lessons. First, he said, he showed Mr. Bush the need to cultivate the religious right, those church-goers who he had largely ignored during the campaign and who in the end voted against him on the alcohol issue.
And second, he thinks, he helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.
As Mr. Hance put it: "He wasn't going to be out-Christianed or out-good-old-boyed again. He's going to be the good old boy next door."

HEADLINE: Kentucky Steps Up Fight on Illiteracy

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PINEVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
Statisticians call Marsha Hendrickson, a coal miner's daughter and the mother of four, functionally illiterate. With the national economy bubbling along, soaking up workers and spreading wealth, she and much of Appalachia live not only with poverty and unemployment but also with the humiliation of being taken for ignorant.
Ms. Hendrickson dropped out of school in the eighth grade, at 15. Now 28, she does read. On shelves by her television set, she has a set of dictionaries, two romance novels and a Bible. At the Pic Pac grocery store, she tallies her purchases as she pushes her cart through the aisles. But she stumbles on long words, subtraction and division, and says the lack of skills makes her feel inadequate. So far, they have also contributed to making her unemployable. 
 At a time that industry is scouring America for workers to keep it and the economy rolling, children in Kentucky's Appalachian hills as well as many in urban centers and impoverished stretches of the South are still dropping out of school at high rates, only to find themselves unequipped for any but the most menial jobs.
Sounding the alarm, politicians and advocates for the poor have begun putting entrenched illiteracy at the root of privation in places like Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, which economic growth has largely ignored.
In his presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has declared illiteracy a "national emergency," a view that his opponent, Vice President Al Gore has said he shares. To tackle it under a federal-state program called Even Start, Congress and the Clinton administration have increased aid to state literacy projects by nearly 50 percent, to $150 million, in three years.
Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat, who observes that his state has the nation's lowest percentage of high school graduates, is doubling expenditures on literacy programs, like Even Start, to $34 million over two years.
Across Eastern Kentucky's rural, time-worn cities and towns, government agencies, foundations and charities have opened storefront learning centers to coax people to study for the general education development test, the G.E.D, the equivalent of a high school diploma.
Kentucky is also tightening enforcement of the law requiring students to stay in school until age 16.
Typically, the functionally illiterate often struggle with all but the simplest arithmetic, reading a recipe, a map or the words on the keys of a McDonald's cash register. Often they cannot fill out a job application, type data into a computer, punctuate a paragraph, balance a checkbook or take a written test for a driver's license. (Kentucky lets people take the test orally.) In time, such difficulties can shred their self-esteem.
Ms. Hendrickson, a G.E.D. student at the Sister Marjorie Learning Center in Pineville, is one of the people the literacy programs are trying to reach. Cheerful, well-groomed and a fastidious housekeeper, she said she had long wanted a job, and she is now under pressure to find work before she loses her welfare benefits under the 1996 welfare law.
On her kitchen wall, Ms. Hendrickson has hung a certificate testifying to her completion of a job-readiness program that states have urged welfare recipients to take as they move off the rolls. But she remains stymied and stigmatized by the schooling she missed. "What hurts me," she said, "is I got no job history."
In applying for work at McDonald's, she was allowed seven wrong answers on the restaurant's food-handling test. "I got eight," she said.
She applied for a telemarketing job, soliciting sales on the telephone. "I stayed for one day of training" and gave up," she said. "I felt those people watching me. I felt people laughing."
So far, people trying to earn the high school equivalency diploma in Kentucky are few. Janet Hoover, a spokeswoman in the state's Workforce Development Cabinet in Frankfort, says that each year the literacy programs are reaching only 5 percent of the state's one million functionally illiterate people. Because the dropout rate remains high, the total has barely been affected.
That illiteracy is linked to poverty, unemployment and Appalachia's weak economy is hardly a secret. But for decades politicians attributed the region's poverty to its topography, isolation and the demise of coal mining. So they cut hundreds of miles of highways through the hollows and hills to bring in prosperity and well-paying jobs. But few jobs came, and the most employable workers used the highways to flee.
In a survey published seven years ago for the Department of Education, the Educational Testing Service said that more than 1 in 5 adults 16 and older, 40 million people in the United States, could read and calculate at no better than the lowest of five levels of literacy, called Level 1.
About a quarter of those 40 million people are non-English-speaking immigrants. The rest grew up speaking English. Many are blacks who live in large cities and rural Southern communities. Several million others live in Appalachia, which is almost entirely white. The national survey, and one three years ago by the State of Kentucky, found that about 30 percent of the adults in Appalachian counties were functionally illiterate.
With the new attention to literacy, groups that serve the poor are casting doubt on the social programs born in in the 1960's. The programs fed, clothed, nursed and sheltered a destitute population. But with the checks continuing until a family's children were grown, the advocates say, welfare institutionalized illiteracy and a low standard of living.
"The average job here pays a little over $6" an hour, said Richard L. Witherlite, executive director of Interfaith of Bell County Inc., a church-sponsored agency in Pineville that serves the poor. "There's been no boom because there are no jobs. There're no jobs because people are illiterate."
Mr. Witherlite said welfare supplanted coal mines that began closing and automating in the 1960's. Before that, he said: "A boy could quit school at a young age and make a good living. Then through the generations kids thought, 'Dad made it without an education, so I can make it.' That was O.K. as long as the coal mines were here."
At the Salvation Army in Middlesboro, Capt. Edward Binnix, the commander, said he no longer helped the poor until they first went next door to the learning center of the Bell County Council on Illiteracy for testing. The illiterate need to start thinking about working on a G.E.D., he said.
"We get people in here who can't fill out a job application," Captain Binnix said. "We get people who don't have a first-grade education."
Still, catching up after years out of school is no easy chore. "I finished the eighth grade," said Darrell Brock, 42, of Middlesboro. "Fifteen I was. I thought I knew everything about everything. I started working, mowing lawns."
Mr. Brock married and went to work for the highway department. He had two sons, now 11 and 14. But the 11-year-old is handicapped and uses a wheelchair, he said, and "my wife died of cancer." She was 33. "I quit my job," he said. "I couldn't find anyone to take care of my kids."
Mr. Brock's children will keep their welfare benefits, but with the changes in the system, he could soon lose his. He said he would like to get a janitorial job at his boys' school so he could be around when they needed him. For that, he most likely needs a G.E.D., and he has not yet been able to pass the test.
"I can read," Mr. Brock said. "I read the newspaper, the Bible, magazines, newspapers." But math and writing are tough. "My weakest area is writing essays. I have to add in all that punctuation, capitalization."
In Bell County, 52 percent of the 24,000 residents 16 and older have not finished high school or earned an equivalency diploma. Just 9 percent have a bachelor's or master's degree. Twenty-eight percent fall into the first level of literacy.
Bell County's unemployment rate seems low, at about 5 percent. But more than half the adults are neither working nor looking for work, compared with a third of the nation's adults. Some are disabled, some are in school, some are homemakers, and some are too illiterate to consider a job.
Ron Couch, director of the state data center at the University of Louisville, said about a third of Bell County's households live in poverty, about triple the national average.
"But they're not stupid," Wylene Payne said of the county's residents. Mr. Payne is assistant manager of Bell County's Middlesboro office of the Kentucky Department for Employment Services, where clients go to great lengths to deny their illiteracy or compensate for it. A sign at the clerk's window says job applications "must be filled out in this office." The forms are not allowed to be taken out because someone other than the applicant could fill them out.
"They'll say, 'I don't have my glasses today,' " Ms. Payne said. "I have people drawing their names."
They memorize the loops and lines of cursive script without learning the letters.
Sitting in the kitchen of her rented, two-bedroom ranch house in a Middlesboro hollow, Evelyn Muncy, 54, said: "My mother went to the fourth grade. My dad was in and out of school and went to the coal mines when he was 13. But nobody could cheat him with his money."
Now Ms. Muncy is doing as her mother did in her 40's and getting a G.E.D. She keeps a journal, written in pencil, in perfectly legible script. On the math pages of her G.E.D. workbook, she has progressed from subtracting 0 from 1 to subtracting 648 from 6,949.
Donald Zimmerman, 64, has built an arsenal of coping skills. He was born in Maine and became an orphan at 10.
"I stayed up in the mountains," sleeping in a cave, he said. "When I needed clothes, I'd come down and take them off clotheslines." He stole milk and eggs that had been delivered on back porches. He took to the road. He said he could not read a map, but he did not need one. He reads the sun.
Now in Middlesboro, he has earned a G.E.D. and is studying at the learning center so he can go to college. But the years of illiteracy took a toll. On a job application, he said, "I could read the words, but I couldn't comprehend what they meant."
"I used to love to paint," he said. But unable to read labels, he said: "I thought I was buying oil paint and bought a whole set of acrylics. You just can't use acrylics on top of oil."

In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge today ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down the service altogether. 
 In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of United States District Court in San Francisco ruled that the popular Napster service was used primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that she said Napster knew about and had started the service to make easier.
"A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music," the judge said.
The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday, and will continue pending trial.
The case has become the rallying point for competing interests in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers, consumers, policy makers and entrepreneurs watching closely. Legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
David Boies, Napster's lawyer, said the company would appeal immediately. He said Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
The injunction "does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate," Mr. Boies said.
Hank Barry, the company's interim chief executive, held an Internet Webcast tonight to address the ruling. "We'll fight this in a variety of ways, to keep the Napster community going and strong," he said. The company says 20 million people have downloaded its software.
The recording industry declared the decision a complete victory.
"This sends the message to others who are building businesses based on other people's copyrighted works without permission," said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.
Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster, said, "From the judge's language, this was not a close call." He also said the decision was a "huge win."
The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could suffer from being shut down pending the trial.
Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif., makes software that allows computer users to download free software that lets them in turn post to the service lists of music files they store on their own home or office computers. Other Napster users then can listen to or download music kept on one anothers' home computers. It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like Gnutella, have grown, too. Last week, the recording industry and the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users download music and video files.
The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc., the Sony Corporation, Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by the recording association, sued the service for copyright infringement.
From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement. The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own.
But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and therefore it is doing nothing wrong. Rather, it says, they are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all along -- the copying of music and other media for personal use.
Judge Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in "wholesale infringing," and that the users were not engaged in "typical personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted."
Moreover, she said the users reap economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for.
In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months. The lawyers said Napster users already download 14,000 songs a minute. "This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed," Russell Frackman, a record label lawyer, told the judge.
Mr. Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works from independent artists.
Mr. Boies cited the United States Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder, in part because the device was "capable of substantial noninfringing uses."
But Judge Patel did not accept the argument. "While Napster may be capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for," she said.
The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S. Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that "over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more."
Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association commissioned from the Field Research Corporation, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CD's any more or they bought fewer CD's.
Judge Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the effect of Napster will have to be done, noting that none of the studies presented were "without flaws."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Another Slice Of Roast Boor, En Croute

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
A LIFE-GIVING blast of anarchy sweeps the stage late in the soggy revival of "The Man Who Came to Dinner" that opened last night at the American Airlines Theater. The gale is named Lewis J. Stadlen, who improbably appears to be impersonating all of the Marx Brothers at once and, even more improbably, succeeding at it.
Mr. Stadlen plays a character named Banjo (read Harpo) in what is probably the most brazen comedie a clef in American theater. Written by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in the late 1930's as a poison-pen valentine to their famous friends, "The Man Who Came to Dinner" revels in the wonderful, horrible and glamorously impossible ways of the wild and celebrated, creatures so very different from us groundlings in the audience. 
 With his claxon voice, gravity-defying walk and enchantingly demented gaze, Mr. Stadlen's Banjo makes a persuasive case indeed for this play's barbed form of celebrity worship, while gleefully dragging an era long past into the present tense. The same can be said of Byron Jennings, who shimmers fleetingly as a self-adoring actor and playwright, clearly modeled on Noel Coward and a blindingly polished monument to narcissistic charm.
Unfortunately neither Mr. Jennings's character nor Mr. Stadlen's is the domineering man of the play's title, and their moments on the stage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning. The man who comes to dinner and stays and stays and stays is named Sheridan Whiteside, a writer, lecturer and radio host frankly modeled in the image of Alexander Woollcott.
Sheridan is played by Nathan Lane, one of God's rare major gifts to Broadway in the last several decades. Yet this highly evolved scene stealer, who normally turns wherever he is standing into center stage, here seems more like an uncomfortable bystander (or sitter, since he is mostly in a wheelchair). It is as if he were waiting for some deus ex machina that might galvanize him into a decided character.
Like the audience, he perks up with the arrival of Mr. Jennings (in the second act) and Mr. Stadlen (in the third). Unfortunately these actors are seen for perhaps 15 minutes altogether, which leaves well over two hours more to account for in the production, which has been staged in uncertain fits and starts by Jerry Zaks. What should be a buoyant balloon of an evening -- a festive opener for the Roundabout Theater Company's new home -- is more often an exercise in deflation.
The American Airlines Theater was built in 1918 and was until recently known as the Selwyn Theater. Despite the name change, its $25 million renovation has only enhanced its period charms. What better place for a company that specializes in well-upholstered revivals of classics? What better place, for that matter, to resuscitate the warmly remembered "Man Who Came to Dinner"?
When the curtain goes up on Tony Walton's richly colored, showroom-perfect representation of an upper-middle-class living room in small-town Ohio in 1939, the audience applauds in happy salutation. The setting breathes a promise of refuge from the abrasions of the 21st century, a chance to step back into a frothier era of comedy.
What we actually step into is an awkward place that exists in neither the then nor the now. Though "The Man Who Came to Dinner" is a textbook example of Kaufman and Hart's meticulous orchestration of comic chaos, a lot of what made it such a smash in 1939 has to do with more perishable assets. The play drops more names than a Louella Parsons column, and it is doubtful that most contemporary audiences will understand punch lines that hinge on references to ZaSu Pitts, Dorothy di Frasso and Chauncey Depew.
The plot is built on the reign of terror conducted by Whiteside over the home of the smug and prosperous Mr. and Mrs. Stanley (Terry Beaver and Linda Stephens). Having come there as a dinner guest during one of his lucrative lecture tours, Whiteside becomes an unhappy house guest after injuring his hip in a fall on the front steps.
Much of the delight that audiences of the late Depression derived from this situation came from their knowledge that Whiteside was modeled on Woollcott, who was first offered the role, which Monty Woolley created on Broadway.
Reviews of the play from that time devoted much ink to the similarities and differences between the character and his prototype. And it is worth noting that when Woollcott took the role in the West Coast productions, some observers felt that Woolley was actually more like Woollcott than Woollcott was.
You don't have to participate in this voyeuristic blurring of reality and caricature to enjoy "The Man Who Came to Dinner." But you do have to be presented with a world that exists confidently on its own terms, and this is exactly what Mr. Zaks's staging doesn't provide.
Heaven knows, little expense has been spared in resurrecting the play's antic mayhem as the Stanleys' home is invaded by everything from a group of homicidal convicts to a caroling boys' choir, from flamboyant stage stars to a wacky entomologist (Stephen DeRosa) bearing a cockroach farm.
Yet the production feels busy without being lively. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes and epigrams without being anchored to character. This, alas, includes Mr. Lane's performance.
In a recent interview in The New York Observer, Mr. Lane spoke of his research on his role and his awareness, after watching Woolley in the 1941 movie version, of the dangers of making the arrogant, curmudegonly Whiteside too unpleasant. Yet if Whiteside isn't a convincing monster, the central joke of the play falls apart.
Looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his professorial beard, Mr. Lane never really raises the hackles, even when shooting off the annihilating invective in which his character specializes. ("Listen, Repulsive" is a typical beginning of a Whiteside sentence.) His delivery fluctuates between Anglo-accented barks, bringing to mind Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins, and campy moments of self-satirizing melodrama.
He has some terrific isolated bits of business: his petulant, childish silence over being neglected by his longtime, long-suffering secretary, Maggie Cutler (Harriet Harris); his appreciative Gatling gun laughter for rare souls who give as good as they get from Whiteside. But the elements never cohere into a complete performance; it is as if he is still experimenting with his options.
Many of the supporting performances suffer from a similar feeling of distance between actors and their parts, a sense that lines are being played strictly for the comic moment with little regard for context. Jean Smart, best known for the sitcom "Designing Women" but capable of shrewd and subtle dramatic performances, here disappointingly overplays the role of an ambitious man-trap of an actress. Her exaggerated affectations suggest less a diva of the theater than a civilian's half-formed idea of such an exotic being.
Ms. Harris comes closer to a proper period tone, though she, too, can lapse into florid comic hysteria when crispness would be more welcome. Mary Catherine Wright has several winningly spontaneous displays of exasperation as Whiteside's put-upon nurse. And Julie Boyd, as the household maid, sweetly conveys the glazed infatuation that Whiteside is meant to inspire even as he infuriates.
That ultimately is the basis of whatever enduring appeal this play has: the illusion of being privy to an urbane celebrity Olympus, where obnoxiousness wears the exonerating halo of high madcap style. That's what Mr. Stadlen celebrates in his performance, careering through the set like a jet-propelled satyr, and what Mr. Jennings offers in his suggestion of a star who seems to be looking fondly into an invisible mirror at all times.
Mr. Jennings also gets to perform a song Cole Porter gave to the play, a perfect imitation of wry Coward esque wistfulness. When Mr. Jennings sings it, in a voice that melds the generosity and vanity of the consummately suave showman, he opens a door onto a shining, frivolous landscape in which one could happily spend a whole evening. That door shuts abruptly when the song is over.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Polishing Nashville's Twang

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
I wouldn't know a Gibson from a Stratocaster. My favorite guitarists are Django Reinhardt, Eddie Lang and Andres Segovia, and none of them, as far as I know, ever played a single note at the Grand Ole Opry.
That could cast a rather long shadow, I suppose, over my qualifications as a guide to Music City, U.S.A., except that there is a lot more than picking and fiddling, a lot more than ballads of love and loss, in Nashville's past, present and future -- especially its future. Which is no bad thing for the city, since country music, which rang up sales of tapes and records of almost $2 billion two years ago, is suffering through a bit of a slump at the moment. 
 The Convention and Visitors Bureau here has set aside $4 million to play down the city's hillbilly image and emphasize its developing cosmopolitanism. It should not prove too hard a sell; like Charlotte, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and a number of other second-tier Southern cities, this one is rapidly acquiring big-time accouterments, including a National Football League team called the Titans. With a brand-new $292 million stadium, a bruiser of a running back named Eddie George and a fearsome, long-limbed defensive end named Jevon (the Freak) Kearse, the Titans went to the Super Bowl last year and made the city swagger a little.
Already in business or on the way are a zoo, a new Country Music Hall of Fame, an enormous shopping complex on the scale of the Mall of America near Minneapolis, a new library designed by Robert A. M. Stern, an arena to house the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League and the ambitious new Frist Center for the Visual Arts, about which a few more words later.
What interests me most about Nashville, however, is its past, notably its often neglected role as an agent of political and intellectual change.
It was from Nashville -- or rather from the Hermitage, his home just east of town -- that rugged old Andrew Jackson set off for Washington in 1829, having ousted the aristocratic John Quincy Adams in the pivotal election of 1828. A frontiersman, a general, the first president from west of the Alleghenies, the first self-made man to take up residence in the White House, Jackson shaped modern American democracy in the image of his own egalitarianism. He fostered government by the unwashed masses instead of the propertied classes.
The muddy boots of Jackson's followers spoiled the carpets at the post-inaugural party and his opponents derided him as "some kind of border savage," in the words of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. But he proved them wrong, taking a new, more aggressive style of leadership to Washington and blazing a path for a fresh tramontane dynasty that included James K. Polk and Abraham Lincoln, a Kentuckian before he moved to Illinois.
A century later, in the early 1920's, a group of writers at Vanderbilt University, just west of downtown Nashville, coalesced around a journal they called The Fugitive. They railed against both the industrialization of the South and what they called the "moonlight and magnolia" distortion of traditional agrarian values.
Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom, two of the most important modern American critics, were members of the group, but its star was Robert Penn Warren. His biographer, Joseph Blotner, called him this country's greatest 20th-century man of letters, which seems reasonable enough given his achievements as a poet, critic, novelist, playwright, essayist and biographer. Warren wrote what for me is the greatest of political novels, "All the King's Men," whose protagonist, Willie Stark, was a ringer for Huey P. Long, and he was the only person to win Pulitzer Prizes for both poetry and fiction.
After a few years, the Fugitives became the Agrarians, and most members drifted away from Vanderbilt, but not before they had helped to ignite the Southern Literary Renaissance. Eventually, those fevered nights in Nashville helped to mold publications like The Kenyon Review and The Sewanee Review and writers like Randall Jarrell, James Dickey and Cleanth Brooks.
 
Academic Achievements
Vanderbilt may well be entering a bright new era. Founded in 1872 and endowed by Cornelius Vanderbilt, it has evolved from Methodist and regional origins into an institution of national repute with 10,000 students. Already among the 20 wealthiest colleges and universities in the nation, it has found a new champion in Martha R. Ingram, whose family controls Nashville-based Ingram Industries, one of the nation's dozen largest privately held companies. Among many other things, Ingram is the largest book wholesaler in the country.
In 1998 Mrs. Ingram gave Vanderbilt $300 million in Ingram stock -- the second-largest donation ever made to any American university -- and this year she played a leading role in persuading E. Gordon Gee to come here as chancellor. A former president of Ohio State University, Mr. Gee staggered the educational world by leaving Brown University, where he had only recently been installed as president.
Many in the region say Mrs. Ingram, who was also the prime mover in establishing the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, has ambitions to make Vanderbilt into a southern Stanford or Harvard, or at least to put it on an academic par with Duke and the University of Virginia. Not so, she said.
"Culturally, we were a little deprived, but we've begun to remedy that," Mrs. Ingram told me. "Education has always been taken seriously here. Now it's time to try to take Vanderbilt up a notch or two, but we don't want it to be a Southern equivalent of something else. Not at all. We want to be the best we can be on our own terms."
The city's early settlers hiked through the Cumberland Gap, a natural opening in the Appalachian barrier near the point where Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky meet. They settled along the Cumberland River, which cuts through lovely limestone hills in this region, and quickly established Nashborough, as it was first called, as a staging point to the west. From here, the Natchez Trace, a crude forest track, linked the interior South to the Mississippi.
For many generations, Nashville's banks and insurance companies formed the basis of its prosperity. They gave Union Street a modest reputation as "the Wall Street of the South," but in recent years they have been sold to out-of-town interests, along with The Tennessean, long the city's dominant newspaper, and a number of the more important radio and television stations.
Great hunks of Music Row now belong to big foreign conglomerates like Bertelsmann of Germany and Sony of Japan.
"Nashville used to be a home-owned, home-operated kind of city," said John Egerton, a social historian who has lived here for 35 years. "But for a long time, it has had an aspiration to celebrity, and by this point it is quite clearly a city on the make. It's a money culture. But that's the New South, I guess. The new world."
As the state capital, Nashville remains a cockpit of political drama. Closely divided between the two parties, Tennessee has produced prominent Democrats like Cordell Hull, Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state; Estes Kefauver, the 1956 vice presidential nominee; and Albert Gore Sr. It has produced powerful Republicans like Howard H. Baker Jr. and Lamar Alexander. They play the game for keeps here, and they don't forget; in casual conversation six years after he lost his seat, former Senator Jim Sasser bitterly condemned the Republican politicians who had denied him a fourth term as "reactionary know-nothings."
At the moment, politics sometimes looks like Nashville's growth industry. Mr. Gore, soon to be the Democratic nominee for President, is a native son, sort of; born in Washington, he spent summers in Carthage, Tenn., one of many nearby towns with names drawn from antiquity, then graduated from Harvard and studied for a year at Vanderbilt's divinity school. He moved his headquarters here when his primary campaign was floundering, and Yankee staff members have learned more than they wanted to know about biscuits with cream gravy.
Senator Fred Thompson, a Republican, was promoted for a time this year as a candidate for vice president, and there were even a few mentions of Tennessee's other senator, William H. Frist.
 
Importance of Health Care
In fact, though, Middle Tennessee, the region anchored by this city, has found more reliable ways to make a living. The most important is health care. Nashville has a string of important hospitals, and it is the headquarters of HCA, the largest hospital management company in the country. HCA was founded by Senator Frist's father, and after many corporate tribulations, Thomas F. Frist Jr., the senator's brother, returned as chief executive to turn it around.
The city's economy benefits as well from a Nissan auto plant at Smyrna and the Saturn factory at Spring Hill, both south of here. Bridgestone/Firestone produces tires here, too. And Dell has just begun shipping computers from a vast new Nashville factory.
Since the early 1980's, this has been one of the boom towns of the South, growing more rapidly than any other metropolitan area between Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Employment is so full that stores and airlines have trouble filling jobs. Metropolitan Nashville's population now exceeds a million, and it has recently overtaken Memphis as the largest urban area in Tennessee.
The swells of Nashville live in Belle Meade, a suburb of enormous houses beneath lofty shade trees on even more enormous lawns. They don't mix much with the denim-clad country crowd, and this is more and more their city.
But the two groups have a few things in common. The whole town assuages its sweet tooth with a locally produced candy called Goo-Goo Clusters, a highly caloric confection of peanuts, chocolate, caramel and marshmallow. Ronald Reagan took jelly beans to the White House; if Al Gore wins the presidency this year, look for him to stock the Oval Office with Goo-Goo Clusters.
 
Rhinestone Cowboys
As for country music, my wife, Betsey, and I are learning.
We were prepared for the army of musicians and would-be musicians looking for a break, waiting on tables and strumming their guitars everywhere -- in rundown bars, on street corners, in legendary dives like Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and Robert's Western World. We were ready for the rhinestones, too.
Robert Altman saw to that in "Nashville," his brilliant, Chaucerian film about the princes and princesses of country music, with egos the size of cathedrals, as well as the no-hopers. Now the French photographer Michel Arnaud has brought the picture up to date in a handsome new book, "Nashville: Pilgrims of Guitar Town," soon to be published by Stewart, Tabori & Chang.
But this is one of those places that you have to see to believe.
You could do a lot worse than start at the Country Music Hall of Fame, which reminded even a country-music philistine like me how much good stuff has flowed from Nashville into the American pop-culture mainstream. A fan of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw et al., I was intrigued to learn more about Bob Wills, who made "San Antonio Rose" popular and more or less invented the wonderfully rhythmic music called Western Swing. Apparently he never performed without a five-cent cigar in his mouth. I had not known that Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played that captivating banjo tune (it's called "Foggy Mountain Breakdown") on the soundtrack of "Bonnie and Clyde."
And I ask you, for sheer gaudy glory, what could match the hall's prize possession, Elvis Presley's "solid gold" Cadillac, a perfect totem of American excess?
Longtime Nashville residents remember the days when Music Row consisted of ratty houses used as music publishers' headquarters. The Opry played in the pre-renovation Ryman Auditorium, whose roof sometimes leaked.
"There wasn't any air-conditioning," recalled Tricia Frist, Thomas Frist's wife, "so you stuck to the back of the seats."
Now Music Row is lined with multistory office buildings, and the Opry has moved to a riverside site on the edge of town. Today's Grand Ole Opry House has air-conditioning, a light board and sound system that would do credit to Las Vegas and more seats than the Metropolitan Opera House: 4,400, versus 3,800. Nearby stand the kitschy Opryland Hotel and a sprawling mall called Opry Mills. An expanded Country Music Hall of Fame is to open closer to downtown in May.
 
Musical Moments
Its fans treat the Opry with tremendous seriousness, according it a place in their hearts alongside stock-car racing and evangelical Christianity. (One car in the immense parking lot bore the license plate "SAVED 67.") An Opry performance feels a little like a secular church service. The audience is, in fact, seated in pews, not individual seats. Everyone listened raptly and respectfully the Saturday night we were there, munching their popcorn and slurping Big Drinks, with none of the hubbub of a rock concert.
Viewed from another perspective, this is vaudeville for hayseeds, with a carefully calibrated blend of corny jokes, spangly costumes, bottle blondes and a surprising range of music -- not just country and bluegrass, but also honky-tonk, western, rockabilly, gospel and quasi-Cajun. A lot of the lyrics may be banal and the emotional range may be severely limited, but there are big voices up there onstage, and the songs are sung with unmistakable skill.
"You'd need a heart of steel not to like this stuff," said Betsey, charmed by Porter Wagoner, the gold-booted M.C. who joined the company 43 years ago and helped to advance the career of a buxom thrush named Dolly Parton.
But we realized what aliens we were in this culture when the crowd lustily cheered an explicitly sexist, rabidly homophobic, stunningly anti-government ditty called "We Want America Back." The Supreme Court, one of the song's milder verses suggested, hands out free condoms while frowning on the distribution of Gideon Bibles. Rush Limbaugh would have been enthralled.
There are other art forms in Nashville, but sometimes you have to look around a bit to find them.
You might despair about the city's contemporary architecture if all you saw was its skyline, dominated by the Bell South building. From one angle, I thought, it looked like some misbegotten postmodern Mont St.-Michel; from another, a mooring mast for dirigibles. As usual, the word on the street was more apt; Nashville folk call it the Batcave or the Batman Building.
My friend Joseph B. Ledbetter, a Nashville businessman of broad interests, set me right. The concrete span bridge on the Natchez Trace Parkway south of town, he said, "is perhaps the most beautiful sight in all of Nashville." So it is: a broad, lean, handsome arch across a verdant valley, an architectural engineering gem as graceful as the soaring Sunshine Skyway in Florida.
 
'Good to the Last Drop'
The same goes for pictures. Nashville's showplace is Cheekwood, the limestone mansion built in the 1930's by Leslie Cheek, who made a pile from Maxwell House Coffee (named after the Nashville hotel where Theodore Roosevelt supposedly proclaimed it "Good to the Last Drop"). While we greatly admired the English silver, some of it by Hester Bateman and Matthew Boulton, we found the paintings disappointing and the gardens, with the exception of the extensive boxwood hedges, beaten down by Nashville's unforgiving midsummer heat.
But at Fisk University, in a far less leafy part of town, we found an utterly unheralded trove of early American modernism. Founded by missionaries and freedmen in 1866, only a year after Appomattox, Fisk may be the oldest historically black institution of higher education in the country. A statue of W. E. B. DuBois, the school's most famous alumnus, stands on the campus. After the death of the pioneering photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1946, his widow, Georgia O'Keeffe, divided his art collection five ways, giving most of the paintings to big urban museums but sending 101 others to Fisk, where they hang today in a modest little red-brick building.
A few are by European masters, including Severini and Renoir and Signac. There is an arrestingly caustic portrait of a dandy in pince-nez and his companion, swathed in pearls and furs, done by the German George Grosz while he was living in New York during World War II. Three or four less well-known artists are included here, among them Abraham Walkowitz, whose vaguely Cezanne-like work was represented in the famous Armory Show in Manhattan in 1913.
The treasures of the Fisk collection, to my mind, are the large groups of works by Marsden Hartley, Arthur G. Dove, Charles Demuth (especially a precise, curiously touching little watercolor of an eggplant and some bell peppers) and John Marin. There are more than a dozen Marins, watercolors and dry-point etchings, ranging from Venice to Manhattan to the Maine coast.
These same artists are shown to no better advantage in Washington's Phillips Collection, which owes part of its renown to them. It is a pity that no corporation or government body has stepped forward to underwrite improvements to the galleries at Fisk or to help publish a catalog. Chronically short of cash for decades, the university desperately needs every cent of help.
 
Exhibiting Art
Perhaps one day the Stieglitz collection will be shown at the $45 million Frist Center, now being carved out of the old Nashville Post Office, a good-looking New Deal building guarded by stone eagles outside and decorated with elegant Art Deco aluminum screens inside. When it opens next year, it will give Nashville 24,000 square feet of gallery space to house major traveling exhibitions as well as temporary exhibitions of locally owned art.
For now at least, the center will have no collection of its own.
"We're rather late to the party," said Chase W. Rynd, the center's executive director, who came here from Tacoma, Wash. "Good art is very expensive these days, so we are concentrating our resources on the building, on education and on holding the prices down. Kids 18 and under will pay nothing."
The center is scheduled to open on April 8, with a show from the Art Gallery of Ontario. Nashville will hit another cultural milestone this fall when the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, for the first time in its history, plays in Carnegie Hall on Sept. 25. More than 1,000 local residents have booked trips to New York to cheer their musicians in a program featuring the violin virtuoso Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.
It will be a triumphal moment for Kenneth Schermerhorn, the orchestra's music director since 1983. Earlier in a long career, he conducted both the Milwaukee Symphony and the orchestra of the American Ballet Theater in New York.
 
With Classical Music
Classical music seems somehow appropriate for a city that has so much classical architecture, notably timeless houses like Belle Meade Plantation. This is the kind of Southern mansion, in the words of the critic Roger G. Kennedy, that seems to be "sleeping away the centuries, its white columns composing a kind of cage to keep what lies within from being touched by time."
The Hermitage is another such house, set next to a garden ablaze with hollyhocks and crape myrtle in high summer. Its most impressive exterior feature is its portico, with six two-story columns painted, then sprayed with sand to simulate stone. They are topped with what were apparently meant to be acanthus leaves, but no botanist would recognize them as such. Inside, the furniture, though largely original, is outshone by the textiles and wallpapers, especially the exceptional scenes of Telemachus and Calypso, made in Paris in 1837, which hang in the foyer.
Then there is the work of William Strickland, who came to Nashville from Philadelphia after designing the magnificent Second Bank of the United States. Here, he produced the Downtown Presbyterian Church (1851), perhaps the finest Egyptian Revival building in the nation, a real Thebes on the Cumberland, and the State Capitol (1859), finished by his son. He is buried there.
And finally, the Parthenon -- Nashville's Parthenon, the only full-size replica in the world, first built of wood and plaster in 1897, and then, 25 years later, when it had started to melt like ice cream in the sun, replaced with a copy in brownish concrete. Like the original, it is sometimes partially covered with scaffolding, but the little museum inside is open, occupied by a Winslow Homer exhibition.
What are we to think about this apparition, which John Seigenthaler, the publisher emeritus of The Tennessean, calls "a phenomenal monstrosity?" Betsey said this: "The Elgin marbles seem to be in place, so what's the fuss about?"
 
Beyond Red-Eye Gravy, Gizzards and That Country Sound
Nashville is 750 to 800 miles miles southwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions as well as travel information follows.
 
Where to Stay
HERMITAGE SUITE HOTEL, 231 Sixth Avenue North, (615) 244-3121. Minnesota Fats, the legendary pool hustler, passed his last days here, and Dinah Shore began her career here with Francis Craig's orchestra. But the magnificent, richly marbled lobby reeked of disinfectant when we checked in, and the dated though spacious guest rooms had dirty windows. Keener management and a less lackadaisical staff could work wonders at this Beaux-Arts landmark. Double room rates: $99 to $209.
LOEWS VANDERBILT, 2100 West End Avenue, (615) 320-1700. Without doubt the best address in a city with a chronic dearth of first-class hotels. A sparkling travertine lobby, a plugged-in young staff (including car parkers working their way through the university just across the street) and a convenient location more than compensate for the somewhat anonymous, run-of-the-mill rooms. A Ruth's Chris Steak House on the site caters to itinerant carnivores. Double room rates: midweek, $149 to $269; weekend, $109 to $269.
OPRYLAND HOTEL, 2800 Opryland Drive, (615) 889-1000. This is the capitol of the Kingdom of Schlock, a maze of 2,883 guest rooms, 15 restaurants, 27 shops, 600,000 square feet of meeting and exhibition space, three pools and nine acres of interior gardens, hard by the Grand Ole Opry and its adjacent outlet mall. "Shoppertainment," they call it. Take your hiking boots; Yogi Berra said he crossed three time zones between the front desk and his room. Double room rates: room with balcony and terrace that overlooks the extensive gardens, $245; traditional room with view of the hotel exterior, $195.
RENAISSANCE NASHVILLE, 611 Commerce Street, (615) 255-8400. Linked to the city's convention center and arena by covered passageways, this is Nashville's leading convention hotel. With 673 rooms in a shiny modern tower, it meets contemporary standards of service and amenity, but don't look for the personal touch in a place this big. For country-music enthusiasts, the honky-tonks of Lower Broadway and the Ryman Auditorium are within easy walking distance. Double room rates: weekends, $99 to $109; midweek, $149 to $169.
 
Where to Eat
LOVELESS CAFE, 8400 Highway 100, (615) 646-0067. Local foodies complain that tourists have taken over and insist that the salty country ham is not quite as authentic as it once was. Maybe so. But the fried chicken, scratch biscuits, sweet shoepeg corn and red-eye gravy still have that down-home flavor, and the fabulous peach and blackberry preserves are still made in big kettles right on the spot. You eat at tables with red-checkered cloths, served by waitresses with personalities as sweet as sorghum.
ROTIER'S, 2413 Elliston Place, (615) 327-9892. This beloved hole in the wall near Vanderbilt University has been serving things like buttermilk and chicken-gizzard dinners since 1945. Evelyn Rotier, who founded it with her late husband, still comes to work three days a week. What keeps the place full are a list of 50 beers and the truly exceptional grilled hamburgers, served on toast.
SASSO, 1400 Woodland Street, (615) 226-7942. Corey Griffith, who cooks in this agreeable little East Nashville hot spot, says he's shooting for quality "without glitter or glare." He does well by salmon: salmon cakes remoulade at lunch, a fillet in a Szechuan peanut crust at dinner. There's wit at work, too; the menu offers "roasted airline chicken breast" as well as "swine-whine" barbecue. Fish and chips come wrapped in The Tennessean.
SUNSET GRILL, 2001 Belcourt Avenue, (615) 386-3663. A lot of music-industry executives eat at this glossy, relaxed restaurant, with a good, mostly modestly priced wine list. Pastas, salads, stir-fries and grills dominate the menu. You'll probably encounter the odd bit of weirdness, like swordfish stuffed with Brie, together with a lot of imagination, like shrimp with a brisk roasted-cumin salsa and a boffo butterscotch-habanero bread pudding.
WILD BOAR, 2014 Broadway, (615) 329-1313. The atmosphere is rather sepulchral, but there is nothing gloomy about the food. Tiny bouchot mussels in a light curry sauce, perfectly roasted quail and a fruit extravaganza (peach ice cream served in a tuile, alongside delectably ripe peaches on a peach bavarois) all showed solid craftsmanship. Seafood, from scallops to grouper, is bought from day boats. The wine list astonished us: 15,000 bottles, from $35 to $5,000, many of them old vintages of a sort rare in this country (to say nothing of France).
ZOLA, 3001 West End Avenue, (615) 320-7778. Debra Paquette scores some successes, like a stacked salad of yellow and red tomatoes, with herbed goat cheese, avocado and a topknot of mango chutney, which seemed a definition of good midsummer eating. I also liked the ice cream flavored with Moroccan spices. But many of the dishes of Greek, Turkish and Italian inspiration tasted as if every ingredient in the souk had gone into them.

HEADLINE: Ford Says Research Inspired New Push for Fuel Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
For years, automakers insisted that the technology did not exist to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and that Americans were not especially interested in gas mileage.
But today, the Ford Motor Company reversed course and announced plans to improve the gas mileage of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over five years, or roughly five miles a gallon, saying that the technology already exists to do so and that customers actually want better fuel economy. 
 Until recently, Detroit carmakers cited research showing that fuel economy was near the bottom of 25 criteria considered by buyers of sport utility vehicles. But Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said today that fuel economy was among the top 10 criteria for buyers of the vehicles. Ford's market research, rather than the gut instinct of executives, prompted the company's decision to make changes, he said.
Kelly Brown, Ford's director of vehicle environmental engineering, told reporters here that the technology already existed for improving fuel economy affordably through engine and transmission changes and lighter auto parts.
"Everything we're doing is something already tested and proven, and some of it is already in production elsewhere" within Ford, he said.
Martin B. Zimmerman, Ford's vice president for government affairs, said after Mr. Nasser's speech that while customers seldom volunteered an interest in fuel economy, in-depth research disclosed that buyers wanted better gas mileage.
"You ask them, 'Do you like our vehicles?' and they say, 'We love them,' " he said. "But you ask them, 'What would you like to change?' and they say, 'We'd like greater range, better fuel economy.' "
Standing near Mr. Zimmerman, Janet Mullins Grissom, Ford's vice president for Washington affairs, interjected that market research into Americans' views on fuel economy "is just like polling -- it depends on how you ask the question."
Mr. Nasser and Mr. Brown refused to discuss the technologies or the cost of Ford's decision, saying that this would be valuable information for rivals. People involved in the plan said the cost was considerable but declined to provide figures.
Analysts said it was impossible to distinguish Ford's fuel-economy spending from other vehicle design costs. And competition from foreign automakers is already forcing Ford to invest more in the design of sport utility vehicles, they added.
Sport utility vehicles used to be strictly the province of Detroit manufacturers, which were under little pressure to respond to consumer demand. Federal fuel economy rules are much more lenient for sport utility vehicles than for cars. And until a series of court decisions in the early 1990's, the sport utility market, unlike the car market, was protected by stiff import taxes that discouraged foreign automakers.
Now, foreign automakers are shipping more sport utility vehicles to the United States, while Honda and Toyota are preparing to build full-size sport utility vehicles in the Midwest. The foreign brands tend to be much more fuel efficient than the American brands because most of them are based on lightweight car bodies instead of the heavy pickup-truck underbodies that Detroit still uses. The market has been growing swiftly for small car-based sport utilities, which tend to be less polluting and more fuel efficient than bigger models and less dangerous to other motorists during crashes.
During a question-and-answer session after Mr. Nasser's speech, which was delivered at the National Press Club here, he challenged Ford's rivals to match its decision to raise average fuel economy for sport utilities by 25 percent. "If General Motors and Chrysler and others want to make that commitment -- that's a commitment; it's not words; it's a commitment -- then we'd welcome their inclusion in this," he said.
He later added that G.M. and Chrysler also had the technical capability for such an improvement.
William Noack, a G.M. spokesman, said that General Motors models had better fuel economy than Ford models in many market segments, including full-size pickups, and that G.M. intended to keep that lead. But he added, "I don't think we're going to be making any commitments, but we're going to make progress."
DaimlerChrysler declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Tensions Build for Inauguration in Peru

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 27

 BODY:
In this capital today women were washing Peruvian flags they say have been sullied by President Alberto K. Fujimori, vendors were selling crude gas masks and riot police were taking up positions.
Mr. Fujimori is to begin his third five-year term on Friday, having resisted pressures for democratic reforms. It promises to be a raucous inauguration. 
 Through a mix of economic populism, political repression and deal making in Congress, he has tightened his grip on power since his re-election eight weeks ago, which was roundly criticized for vote tampering and campaign dirty tricks.
After the voting, Mr. Fujimori promised to work with the Organization of American States to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, to revamp electoral agencies and to expand freedom of the press. He has, however, reduced the influence of officials in his government who have most advocated reform.
The opposition, led by Alejandro Toledo, the business professor who dropped out of the presidential race a week before the May 28 runoff, has organized more than 100,000 people across the country to march in an attempt to discredit the inauguration. But efforts to block the ceremony have been dropped.
Mr. Fujimori has appeared oblivious to criticism from the United States and many Latin American and European governments. "The opinions of other countries are not important to us," he said recently.
In the lame-duck Congress, Mr. Fujimori pushed through legislation that gives the agency regulating telecommunications more power to monitor private phone conversations and to obtain access to computer and telephone records without court order. He also has broken with his usual free-market policies, through a new law that removes tax benefits for foreign mining companies that reinvest profits in the country. He has blocked several privatizations in order to maintain control over gas and water prices as well as to shore up a government pension fund.
The moves have upset businessmen and Wall Street analysts, who express concerns that Mr. Fujimori will use populist economic policies to buttress his political position.
In addition, Congress acted not only to clear high-level Fujimori campaign officials of charges that they led an effort to forge a million signatures to put the president on the ballot, but also voted to make four whistle-blowers who exposed the forgery criminally liable. The charges of forged signatures, substantiated by the newspaper El Comercio, were a large factor in Mr. Fujimori's failure to win a first-round victory.
The Organization of American States is continuing to press for a democratic opening, but Mr. Fujimori has refused to follow a demand that he fire his intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, for campaign abuses.
So far, Mr. Fujimori has not faced international sanctions aside from a few mostly symbolic actions by the United States Congress, which delayed delivery of $42 million in foreign aid and excluded Peru from a recent $1.3 billion antinarcotics package that primarily helps Colombia, but also Ecuador and Bolivia.
The Clinton administration has signaled that it will continue to work with Mr. Fujimori, particularly on antinarcotics programs. Still, it expressed strong comments about Mr. Fujimori when Ambassador John Hamilton told a July 4 gathering here that "cosmetic or superficial changes will not resolve the crisis of credibility."
Mr. Hamilton will lead a spare United States delegation to the inauguration. The only foreign presidents to attend will be Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador. Nine Latin American presidents attended Mr. Fujimori's last inauguration in 1995.
Mr. Fujimori has tried to head off a chilling of relations with Washington by ordering the air force to deploy 18 Sukhoi-25 tactical fighter jets, formerly used as a deterrent against Ecuador, to fight the drug trade.
The opposition had placed its hopes on international influence, believing that the United States and the Organization of American States might even prevail on Peru to hold new elections. But now Mr. Toledo and other opposition leaders are expressing bitter disappointment, going so far as to accuse the regional group of complicity in Mr. Fujimori's election victory.
A dozen or so opposition legislators have changed sides in the last two months, so Mr. Toledo's ability to pressure Mr. Fujimori has decreased. In one case, a former Toledo ally in the new Congress changed his allegiances after judges friendly to Mr. Fujimori reversed an embezzlement conviction against him.
In one gesture today, the Fujimori government pardoned and freed eight people who, according to a government-appointed commission, had been falsely prosecuted on terrorism charges. But 46 other pardon requests presented to Mr. Fujimori last December remained unanswered.

HEADLINE: Alvin Alm, 63, a Leader in Environmental Policy

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Alvin L. Alm, a businessman and senior government official who helped create environmental and energy policy in Republican and Democratic administrations for four decades, died on Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 63.
Mr. Alm was stricken at his home in nearby Falls Church, Va., apparently with heart failure, said Allen Moore, a colleague at Chambers Associates, a public policy consulting firm where Mr. Alm was president. 
 As an expert in budgeting, economics, regulation and the other fine details of environmental policy, Mr. Alm operated just under the bureaucratic rank where public service translates into renown. Although virtually every policy maker in his field knew of his work, the influence of the jobs he held, like assistant secretary of energy for environmental management and deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, far exceeded his public name recognition.
Mr. Alm spoke lightly of his many moves into and out of government, once saying, "I have to confess I am a recidivist." One reason he came and went was that the most powerful figures in the federal government called upon him at critical moments.
For example, when the Environmental Protection Agency was in crisis during the Reagan administration, with Administrator Anne Gorsuch's resignation under pressure for her handling of the Superfund and other programs, Mr. Alm returned for a second stint at the agency under William D. Ruckelshaus, whom President Ronald Reagan had called back to salvage the E.P.A.'s bruised reputation.
Alvin Leroy Alm was born in Denver, graduated from the University of Denver in 1960 and earned a master's degree in public administration from the Maxwell Graduate School at Syracuse University.
He worked on environmental matters in the Washington bureaucracy for several years and by 1970, when the modern environmental movement reached full flower, held a crucial post as staff director of the newly created White House Council on Environmental Quality.
He helped develop the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972 and moved to the Environmental Protection Agency, then in its infancy, as assistant manager for planning and management. There, from 1973 to 1977, he helped devise the system of water pollution permits that put the law into force.
During the energy crisis of the late 1970's, he worked on energy policy for the Carter administration and moved to the Energy Department for the first time.
Throughout his long career, Mr. Alm took on some of the most intractable of problems. His most recent tour in government was from 1996 to 1998, as President Clinton's assistant secretary of energy in charge of cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons complex, overseeing a program of about $6 billion a year.
Outside government, he was chairman and chief executive of the Thermal Analytical Corporation, an environmental testing concern, from 1985 to 1987; chief executive of another technical consulting company, the Alliance Technologies Corporation, from 1987 to 1989; and senior vice president of yet another, the Science Applications International Corporation, from 1989 to 1996.
In the early 1980's he was at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard as a lecturer and head of a research program.
His marriage to the former Ronnie Elwell ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Jessica Alm of Boston; a sister, Carol Birza of Denver; and his companion, Mary Clark of Washington.

HEADLINE: Luba Journal;
A Corner of Africa Where Dreams Gush Like Oil

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LUBA, Equatorial Guinea

 BODY:
Not counting the yapping cocker spaniel that was terrifying some men who were practicing witchcraft in the jungle the night before and now feared being found out by the sharp-eyed dog, this town was pretty much dead on a recent Saturday morning.
A drizzle from the clouds on this side of the volcanic island of Bioko -- slightly more than half the size of the state of Rhode Island -- had kept most people indoors. A handful of children splashed in the murky canal that snakes through this town. A large monkey lay dead on a front porch, waiting only for the kitchen. 
 A knock on the governor's temporary house (the longtime president of this tiny Central African nation, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has grown so fond of the governor's house that he has appropriated it for his visits here) found the man in question, Deogracias Miguel Olomo, looking relaxed in sweats.
"Just a couple of years ago, there was absolutely nothing here," Governor Olomo told an unexpected visitor. "Now Luba can be, well, not the capital. But it can be the economic capital."
If Luba, population 3,000, is thinking big these days, it is merely a reflection of the national mood. Equatorial Guinea, once the penniless neighbor in a region awash with oil, has finally hit the jackpot. With perhaps 120,000 barrels a day of crude, and much more to come, forgotten towns are now daring to dream of El Dorado.
After the Spanish colonialists left in 1968, Luba, despite being the second town on this island after the national capital, Malabo, sank into darkness. With nothing going on here, people stepped back into the jungle to hunt and grow crops. The roads linking Luba to Malabo to the north and Riaba to the east became virtually impassable.
Today, while much of the road to Riaba remains hidden under overgrown trees and bush, workers are digging up and paving over the way to Malabo. A new port for the oil companies is being built here.
As for Equatorial Guinea's government, it says it wants to develop every town in the country. And to that effect, it has adopted a novel strategy: in June it moved the entire government, or most of it, off this island and onto the mainland in the city of Bata.
Gabriel Nguema Lima, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Mines and Energy and a son of President Obiang, explained that the move would perhaps last six months. After that, the government will keep moving to other towns, returning to Malabo after an indefinite journey, Mr. Nguema added.
In Malabo, the move caught most people unawares. That was hardly a surprise in a country with no daily newspapers and a history of authoritarian, corrupt governments.
At El Sabroson, a restaurant on Avenida de la Independencia, a couple of days before he was scheduled to join his colleagues in Bata, the information minister, Lucas Nguema Esono Mbang, was having lunch with a ponytailed Spanish businessman.
"By moving the government away from here," the information minister said, picking at his plate of antipasto, "we can redevelop the entire country."
The Spanish businessman, who was awarded a government contract earlier that day, nodded.
"In fact," the information minister went on, "Spain should follow our example by moving the government to Barcelona or the Basque country."
"Exactamente," the Spanish businessman said, looking down at his plate.
"You know, he is a great admirer of Franco," the minister said of the businessman.
"It's true," the businessman said. "Authority is good! That's why this country is good. You can leave 100,000 francs on this table," or about $150, he went on, "and no one will take it. Liberty! What is liberty if you cannot leave 100,000 francs on this table without worrying?"
A few blocks away, at the headquarters of the Union Popular, an opposition party, people ascribed different motives to the government's move to Bata.
Fabian Nsue Nguema, the party's secretary general, brought up the point that in the final months of the administration of Francisco Macias Nguema, the country's first president, the government was also moved to the mainland. President Macias, a brutal dictator, eventually placed the government in his hometown, Mongomo, at the country's easternmost point. Shortly after that, he was toppled and then executed by his nephew, the current president, in 1979.
"It's a dictatorship," Mr. Nsue said of the government. "What distinguishes dictatorships is that they are afraid. So they are afraid and want to move from place to place."
Agapito Ona Nguema, another party officer, added: "Why do they have to move from place to place to develop the country? Your government in Washington, does it have to move to New York or Los Angeles to develop them? And yet they are developed, right?"
The president's family, a subclan of the Fang ethnic group, has controlled the country since independence. Though they come from the mainland, they have governed from Malabo, the capital established by the Spaniards. An ethnic group known as the Bubi makes up the indigenous people of Malabo and the rest of the island of Bioko.
A couple of years ago, enough resentment toward the mainland rulers had built up that some Bubi rebels killed two soldiers here in Luba and marched north toward Malabo. They were stopped near the capital by soldiers, who are believed to have carried out reprisal attacks in and around Luba.
These days, things seemed to have settled down. Filiberto Estrada, 27, a mason, is one of the many people who have gravitated here after hearing of job opportunities. He has not found one yet, complaining, as do many other jobless young men, that the jobs go to those with connections to the governing party.
He did not understand why the government was packing up and going to Bata.
"It's the first time I've heard of it," Mr. Estrada said. He added, with a smile: "Each country has its own way of doing things. And here in Equatorial Guinea, we have our own way of doing things."

HEADLINE: Data Leave Rate Picture Unclear

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Employment costs rose moderately in the second quarter but orders for durable goods skyrocketed in June, the government said today in two closely watched reports that left the outlook for short-term interest rates wide open.
The Labor Department said the pay and benefits of workers rose 1 percent in the April-June period, less than expected, possibly giving the Federal Reserve some comfort as it debates whether to raise interest rates again to slow the economy. 
 But in another report, the Commerce Department said soaring demand for commercial aircraft had increased orders for costly manufactured goods in June by the sharpest rate in nine years, indicating that the industrial sector might be speeding up instead of slowing.
Analysts said the data did little to clear up the fundamental issue facing the Fed: Has the economy slowed enough to eradicate the threat of higher inflation?
Fed policy makers will next meet on Aug. 22. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has told lawmakers he will need to see more firm evidence of the much-awaited slowdown to determine whether the Fed's six rate rises since last June have done the trick or whether more are needed to keep the lid on inflation.
The report of a 1 percent gain in the second-quarter Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages, salaries and benefits, was below both the 1.4 percent increase in the first quarter and the 1.1 percent increase forecast by economists for the second quarter.

Trade Accord With Vietnam: Exports in Place of Enmity

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 26

 BODY:
Just a few weeks ago, foreign executives here looked at Vietnam and saw a Communist backwater dabbling halfheartedly in free enterprise and foreign investment.
Today, they see a budding market in a country that has signed an agreement granting the United States, a former enemy, access to many sections of its economy. 
 The change is largely due to that trade agreement, signed by Washington and Hanoi officials on July 13. Lawyers, economists and executives are only starting to make sense of the new accord, a densely worded volume of diplomatic and legal language. The consensus is that the agreement is the most significant business development here since the country reopened to foreign investment almost 15 years ago.
"It has changed the landscape completely," said Nigel Russell, a lawyer who has worked for seven years in Vietnam advising American and other foreign clients for Phillips Fox, an Australian law firm.
The agreement, which is subject to approval in both countries, would give Vietnam the same normal trade relations, subject to annual review by Congress, that China had until it secured permanent status this spring. In return for gradually opening its economy to United States investment and exports, Vietnam immediately gains improved access for its products in American markets, with the average tariff on Vietnamese goods falling to 3 percent from almost 40 percent.
"This is a very comprehensive agreement that will open a lot of doors to U.S. business in Vietnam," said Frederick Burke, a lawyer with Baker & Mackenzie at a briefing to the American Chamber of Commerce here. The agreement, he said, also represents "dramatic progress for Vietnam in its integration into the global economic community."
That said, few people here are under the illusion that change will come easily or that a recent exodus by disenchanted foreign investors will quickly be reversed. Much will still depend on the willingness of Vietnam's elderly Communist rulers to enforce the agreement.
"Implementation is going to be a serious question," said Anthony Salzman, who sells Caterpillar products in Vietnam. "As an American businessman, I'll be looking at that."
Vietnam has been experimenting with market reforms of some sort since 1987. Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in 1994, American companies have been trying with mixed success to participate in that experiment, but it took almost five years for the two nations to reach an agreement formalizing the terms of a trade and investment pact.
Its immediate effect on Vietnam's economy may be relatively small. The World Bank estimates that Vietnamese exports to the United States would rise to $768 million a year, compared with $504 million last year. Even in an economy as small as Vietnam's, that would increase average incomes by less than 1 percent, the agency estimates.
"The real economic impact is not as great as people expect," said Dinh Tuan Viet, an economist at the World Bank's office here.
The quickest beneficiaries are likely to be foreign textile and apparel manufacturers with plants in this country, such as Nike and the lingerie maker Triumph. United States tariffs on brassieres and panties, for example, would drop to zero from about 60 percent, contributing to the World Bank estimate of a potential 1,500 percent increase in clothing exports from Vietnam to the United States.
Although Vietnamese workers would earn the wages from such a boom, the country does not supply the raw material and so the broad economy would reap relatively little benefit, Mr. Viet of the World Bank said. A greater benefit to the economy, he said, would come from cuts in tariffs on processed food, especially fish and shrimp products.
More profound are the changes the agreement makes to Vietnam's rules on foreign investment. Economists say these will force the country to adopt international norms on accounting and corporate governance, and accelerate economic changes already under way, especially the transfer of state-owned industry to private ownership. Last week, for instance, Vietnam opened a long-awaited stock exchange in the hope of mobilizing private capital.
"It opens up the economy to a whole series of competitive forces," Wong Yit Fan, regional economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore, said of the agreement.
For American companies interested in Vietnam's market of nearly 80 million people, the agreement offers important concessions. It phases out quotas on a range of exports from meat to motorcycles and gradually cuts tariffs on everything from Maybelline mascara to Motorola cellular phones. It establishes the right of United States accounting and law firms to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in Vietnam and over time opens the country to American banks and insurers.
The agreement also protects intellectual property rights, including software and semiconductor designs, and prohibits Vietnam from applying different product standards to American companies or from charging foreign business higher fees for phone calls, utilities or airfare. Perhaps most tellingly, it seeks to eliminate the regulatory caprice that is the subject of many investor complaints. The agreement would oblige Vietnam to end the arbitrary application of rules to foreign companies and to set forth rules well in advance.
Mr. Burke of Baker & Mackenzie said the agreement's significance was amplified by nondiscrimination clauses in Vietnam's trade agreements with other nations. Companies from China, Japan and Europe would also benefit from the new terms.
Even so, it stops short in many areas. Hanoi retains restrictions on trade in economically critical products like oil, rice and gold, as well as in publications and films.
The agreement apparently does not do much to improve Vietnam's Internet infrastructure. It mimics China's limits on foreign involvement in telecommunications and does little to promote the flow of venture capital to finance the high-technology start-ups that other developing nations have deemed crucial to taking part in a new economy.

HEADLINE: Ford's Clean Air Breakthrough

 BODY:
The various industries responsible for much of the country's air pollution -- the oil companies, the automakers, the big utilities -- have usually resisted federal clean air regulations, routinely overestimating the costs of the regulations while underestimating the ability of their engineers to satisfy them. In the 30 years since the passage of the Clean Air Act, industry has rarely been out in front of government. Yesterday, however, the Ford Motor Company reversed this paradigm with the announcement that it would increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years. It did so even though Congress recently rejected yet another effort by environmentalists to tighten up fuel economy standards.
The company's move deserves applause from anyone who worries about carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas that is thought to be a major contributor to global warming. Cars and trucks are responsible for about one-third of the carbon dioxide produced in the United States, and S.U.V.'s are responsible for a big chunk of that. S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and vans now account for half the vehicles sold in America. This has been a boon for Detroit but not for cleaner air, mainly because S.U.V.'s, which are officially classed as light trucks, have been allowed to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard cars. They also consume about one-third to one-half more fuel than ordinary cars. 
 Last year the Environmental Protection Agency began a crackdown on S.U.V.'s, using the so-called tailpipe standards authorized by the Clean Air Act. It issued new rules that will require S.U.V.'s to meet the same emission standards that apply to ordinary cars and govern pollutants like nitrogen oxide, a precursor to urban smog. At the same time, the E.P.A. required the oil companies to produce a cleaner-burning gasoline to increase the efficiency of a car's catalytic converter, the device that strips most pollutants from auto exhaust.
But the catalytic converter does nothing to decrease emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. The only way to reduce carbon dioxide, short of installing an engine that does not use fossil fuels, is to increase fuel efficiency. That is what Ford's new strategy for its S.U.V.'s would do.
While committing itself to more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s, the company remains opposed, along with other automakers, to legislative efforts to increase fuel economy standards generally. These standards have not significantly changed in nearly 20 years. Ford's answer to what some see as an inconsistency is that it opposes top-down regulation but will respond to consumer-driven market forces. Ford says it is convinced that consumers are ready to sacrifice a modest amount of engine power and size in exchange for a cleaner S.U.V. It also argues that it has the technology to increase the fuel economy of S.U.V.'s without increasing prices -- the implication being that it will be able to do the same for other cars if allowed to proceed at its own pace.
Environmentalists on the whole were delighted. They noted that if Ford can build S.U.V.'s that yield much better mileage per gallon, other companies are sure to follow. If they do, William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, will further solidify his reputation as the most adventurous executive in an industry not previously known for environmental stewardship.

HEADLINE: PARATROOPER POLITICS: A special report.;
A Combative Leader Shapes Venezuela to a Leftist Vision

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, July 27

 BODY:
He promised a revolution, and he has kept his word. Since being swept to power here 18 months ago, Hugo Chavez has uprooted every institution, assaulted every elite and derided every orthodoxy with the unrelenting combativeness of the army paratrooper he used to be.
The Congress and Supreme Court he called "corrupt" and "worm eaten" are gone, and the two political parties that governed for 40 years have collapsed. The military's role has been vastly expanded, the powerful government oil company he criticized as "a state within the state" has been purged, and the authority of governors and mayors has been curtailed. 
 In speech after speech, he has attacked the business, opposition and media leaders who have expressed doubts about his methods and objectives, calling them "degenerates" and "squealing pigs." When Roman Catholic bishops dared suggest that he should be less confrontational, he dismissed them as "devils in vestments."
The centerpiece of Mr. Chavez's plan to transform Venezuela, which has been the United States' leading source of imported oil in recent years, is a new Constitution he hails as "the most democratic in the world." Hand-tailored for him in a Constituent Assembly dominated by his leftist Patriotic Pole movement, it enlarges the powers of the state while weakening the legislature and judiciary.
Now the former army colonel, who will be 46 on Friday, seems assured of at least six more years in office, thanks to provisions in the new charter that extend the presidential term by one year and eliminate a ban on immediate re-election. An election scheduled for Sunday to "relegitimize" his rule and choose governors and a new Congress is expected to hand him a sweeping victory.
"Oligarchs tremble, because now is when the revolution is going forward," he warned recently. "This is going to be delicious: we're going to deliver a knockout punch to the counterrevolution."
For the Latin American left, hungry for a home-grown hero, Mr. Chavez is a godsend: a charismatic military man who condemns "savage capitalism," embraces Fidel Castro and promises social justice. An orator who is by turns spellbinding and funny, Mr. Chavez has gathered the poor into a powerful force that is demanding change.
But for many others, unwilling to forget the unsuccessful coup he led eight years ago, Mr. Chavez reawakens memories of the authoritarian caudillo -- the classic military strongman with little patience for the give-and-take of democracy. To them, his language reeks of class hatred and demagoguery, his vituperative attacks foreshadowing even greater conflicts to come.
"His movement is contradictory, and Hugo Chavez is a divided soul," said Teodoro Petkoff, a former guerrilla and government official who is now editor of an irreverent new daily newspaper here, Tal Cual. "At the same time he is Menshevik and Bolshevik, Girardist and Jacobin, Danton and Robespierre."
In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez seems to be everywhere, his image plastered on posters, his voice booming over the airwaves. But the man himself -- as well as a clear picture of how he intends to exercise the enormous power he has been accumulating -- remains elusive.
He was elected in a landslide in December 1998 by promising a "peaceful social revolution" that would usher in a "golden age." So far he has failed to deliver either prosperity or equality: the Venezuelan economy shrank by 7 percent last year, and more than half the work force remains unemployed or is working in the underground economy. The well-off, fearful of his declarations, have spirited more than $8 billion out of the country, mostly to the United States, since he came to power, according to Venezuelan central bank data.
He has ordered government security forces not to move against squatters who invade buildings or farms, and has just backed a measure that would expropriate landholdings that the government deems to be "idle."
His followers, drawn from the 80 percent of Venezuelans who live below the poverty line, have been kept in a permanent state of agitation. His speeches refer to his "plan of battle," the need to "take every piece of space by assault" and efforts to "force the adversaries of the people into their caves and foxholes," but offer few policy specifics.
 
Former Officers at His Side
"Now brothers, let us unsheath the sword of truth," Mr. Chavez intoned in a recent speech. "All of you are warriors, so let us once again seek the oracle of war and put on our combat boots. I am certain that from today on the popular offensive will be as implacable as ever and that the attack will come from all sides because the Venezuelan people have clasped their banner and are going on to battle and victory again."
Given his two decades in the army, it is hardly surprising that Mr. Chavez's public declarations have a martial tone or that he has brought large numbers of former military officers into his government.
"Von Clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics by other means, but it also works the other way around," he said in an interview. "Whether it be war or some other kind of challenge, you are always talking about struggle, battles, advances and retreats."
But he also draws heavily on religious imagery, comparing himself to Jesus and his opponents to the demons of the apocalypse. When Roman Catholic bishops sent him a letter last spring cautioning him that it was false to suggest that "God has blessed one political project" above others, he responded with a 20-page letter that read like a papal encyclical, complete with biblical citations.
Mr. Chavez leavens his aggressive remarks with jokes, proverbs, bits of popular songs, asides to his wife, Marisabel, and anecdotes about friends, his boyhood and his days as a baseball player. His opponents say they find his performances coarse and clownish, but his folksy approach has helped cement his ties to ordinary Venezuelans. "He is one of us," said Beatriz Tovar Mendieta, a washerwoman here. "We've never had another president like that before."
Mr. Chavez is also more closely identified with the masses in terms of the ethnic or racial divide that characterizes Venezuela. The predecessors he attacks as members of a "rotten oligarchic elite" are typical "mantuanos," as people with European features and pretensions are called here.
In contrast, Mr. Chavez is a typical "pardo," or brown-skinned person, with traces of Indian blood, "curly hair, Chinese-looking eyes, a thick mouth and an aquiline nose," in the words of one of his biographers, Angela Zago. In speeches, the president has been known to underline his resemblance to his followers by referring to himself as "the Indian from Barinas."
William Lara, who met the president when both were studying political science in a postgraduate course a decade ago and is now one of his closest political advisers, said: "Like Hugo Chavez I am from the plains, which is a place that has very few trees. So when a plainsman sees a tree, his first impulse is to look behind it to see if someone is waiting there to ambush him. Hugo Chavez has that characteristic."
Combined with that self-reliance is a distrust of and disdain for technocrats that leads him to rely on his own instincts more than advice from experts. "You need to take an aspirin, but they prescribe Viagra," Mr. Chavez complained in a recent speech.
Mr. Chavez's relationship with the United States is no less complicated. Aside from a passion for baseball that works its way into almost every speech, he is a fan of American movies and television, referring to them almost as frequently as he adorns his speeches with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and Walt Whitman.
 
U.S. Help Is Rejected
But when floods and mudslides inundated the Caribbean coast last December, killing thousands, Mr. Chavez refused help from an American military team. Their presence, he said, would offend Venezuela's sovereignty, even though he allowed in doctors from Cuba, relief workers from Spain and Mexico, and aid from China and Pakistan.
He personally takes responsibility for the dramatic rise in oil prices and record gasoline prices in the United States. On the campaign trail here, he reminds voters it was his government's decision to lower production and adhere to OPEC quotas that has resulted in a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of Venezuelan crude since he took office 18 months ago.
Not only has Venezuela often been the leading source of oil for the United States, but the country's minister of energy, Ali Rodriguez, is now OPEC president. In recent speeches, Mr. Chavez has bragged to Venezuelans about telephone calls from President Clinton asking for relief on oil prices, but he has also made it clear that he does not intend to give any ground.
Once the election is over, Mr. Chavez plans a Mideast tour to discuss with "our Arab brothers," as he calls them, an OPEC heads of state meeting scheduled here in late September. Although he plans stops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Mr. Chavez seems bent on tweaking Washington by visiting Iraq, Iran and Libya, and inviting their leaders to the conference.
"Imagine what the pharisees will say when they see me with Saddam Hussein," Mr. Chavez said with a big grin in a recent speech.
Indeed, his foreign policy has shown a fascination with rogue elements around the world. One peculiar example is his correspondence with Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the Venezuelan-born former guerrilla known as Carlos the Jackal, who was convicted of murder and kidnappings across Europe and once organized an attack on OPEC ministers.
In addition, Mr. Chavez has cited the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya as a model for participatory democracy. He has also repeatedly praised Mr. Castro's rule in Cuba, much to the distress of Venezuelans still resentful of Cuban support for past guerrilla movements here, saying both nations are "swimming together toward the same sea of happiness."
Mr. Chavez withdrew Venezuela from annual American-sponsored joint naval maneuvers and this week accused the United States of trying to install a missile base in neighboring Guyana. But perhaps most immediately troubling to Washington is his decision to ban American drug surveillance flights from using Venezuelan airspace.
For now, the American response has been restrained, arguing, no doubt with an eye on oil supplies, that forbearance and dialogue are the best way to avoid further radicalization of the situation here.
But Republican members of Congress are clamoring for sanctions against Venezuela, and the United States ambassador who has been carrying out the wait-and-see policy here is to be succeeded next month by Donna Jean Hrinak, who as ambassador to the Dominican Republic took a hard line against that country's wily authoritarian president, Joaquin Balaguer.
 
'A Tough Little Kid'
Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born in Sabaneta de Barinas, a small town in the vast, sparsely populated savannah that is Venezuela's equivalent of the Great Plains. As teachers in the local elementary school, his parents, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez and Helena Frias, had social but not material status.
"We grew up there selling bananas and sowing corn" and when students finished the sixth grade "we had to go somewhere else, to the state capital, if we were going to continue our studies," Mr. Chavez recalled in an autobiography.
The new student in the capital was first ridiculed as a bumpkin but soon stood out for his ability to recite poems and speeches at festivals and for athletic prowess. Baseball is the national pastime, and Mr. Chavez excelled as both a left-handed pitcher and a power-hitting first baseman.
"He was a tough little kid, mischievous, a real talker and dreamer, but as tenacious as hell," Jose (Tintan) Lopez, Mr. Chavez's baseball coach, said in an interview. "Even when he was 7 or 8, he could put the ball where he wanted and wasn't afraid to come in on a batter with his fastball."
Indirectly, it was baseball that led to Mr. Chavez's military career. His plan was to qualify for the army's team and capture the attention of major league scouts.
But he soon developed arm trouble, and his ambitions shifted. "When I met some officers and read a bit of history, I felt something stirring inside me," he has said. He drew inspiration from Latin American military leaders like Juan Velasco of Peru, Juan Peron of Argentina and Omar Torrijos of Panama -- men who used their power to shake up the status quo, not reinforce it.
After graduation he was assigned to a succession of posts: an armored unit, antiguerrilla duty along the Colombian border, a military ethics instructor, paratrooper training and eventually staff duty at the Ministry of Defense. But there was also a conspiratorial side he was careful to keep hidden from his superiors.
"We were a group of four or five captains who used to jog together in the afternoons, and one day in 1983 Chavez suggested we swear an oath to fight against corruption and for the welfare of our country," recalled Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, a former classmate and friend who recently broke with the president. "From that moment on, we began to study the problems of Venezuela in a systematic way, and as time passed we got more and more young officers to join us."
After world oil prices collapsed in the early 1980's, neither of the country's two political parties proved able to govern effectively or honestly in a situation that called for belt-tightening. In 1989, a popular uprising against an International Monetary Fund austerity program resulted in the deaths of several hundred people and convinced Mr. Chavez and his co-conspirators that the system could no longer function.
 
A Turning Point in Life
On Feb. 4, 1992, Mr. Chavez, Francisco Arias Cardenas, then his closest comrade in arms but now his challenger in Sunday's vote, and other officers attacked the presidential palace. It was a bloody failure, resulting in the deaths of more than a score of soldiers. But most Venezuelans caught their first glance of their future leader then, and Mr. Chavez has described the episode as the turning point in his life.
After surrendering, he was paraded in front of television cameras, wearing the bright red military beret that he and his followers today wear as the symbol of their movement, to call on the last holdout units to lay down their arms.
"For now, comrades, the objectives that we established have unfortunately not been achieved in the capital," the young army colonel said, with a touch of bravado that resonated deeply among ordinary people. Then he was bundled off to jail.
By Mr. Chavez's own account, the two-plus years he spent there were devoted largely to reading and debating. In an interview last year, Mr. Chavez described himself as "a promiscuous reader," with a reading list that included Camus, Cicero, Martin Luther King, Mao, Montesquieu, Neruda, Nietzche, Ortega y Gasset, Rousseau, Alvin Toffler and Walt Whitman.
Visitors of all political persuasions were allowed to see him, including some of the most influential members of what is now his government. Among them were two veterans of the left who would become his mentors: Luis Miquilena, now head of the Congress, and Jose Vicente Rangel, his foreign minister.
After Mr. Chavez was freed in 1994, Mr. Miquilena and other admirers decided he needed to travel abroad because he knew little of the world.
Because of his role in the attempted overthrow of a democratically elected government, the United States refused to grant him a visa, a policy that remained in effect until he was elected president. But he traveled throughout Latin America, and on one trip he met an obscure Argentine sociologist named Norberto Ceresole.
Mr. Ceresole's language can be murky, but in essence he envisions political leadership as an almost mystical bond between the masses and a charismatic figure. Such a "post-democratic" relationship eliminates the need for political parties, he argues, because the military can more reliably serve as a sort of conveyor belt between the leader and the led.
To critics, such notions are little more than warmed-over fascism. Mr. Ceresole also denies the Holocaust and calls for third world coalitions to counter the power of the United States.
Just after Mr. Chavez was elected, Mr. Ceresole visited Venezuela and proudly described the president-elect as "my disciple." Mr. Chavez was clearly irritated by the remarks and, according to Mr. Urdaneta, then his secret police chief, ordered the Argentine to leave.
Nevertheless, many Venezuelans remain convinced that Mr. Ceresole's ideas influence Mr. Chavez's government.
As he was discovering Mr. Ceresole, Mr. Chavez made his first trip to Havana, where he was welcomed by Mr. Castro. At a 1994 news conference there, Mr. Chavez, clearly dazzled by having been treated almost as a head of state, was full of admiration for Mr. Castro and the Cuban revolution. He has continued to visit Havana as president, even playing baseball with Mr. Castro last year, and has offered Cuba economic aid.
To Mr. Chavez's critics, the president's fascination with two figures as ideologically divergent as Mr. Castro and Mr. Ceresole indicates he has no core beliefs of his own, only a set of postures that he tailors for his audiences.
"On Wall Street, he talks about the wonders of capitalism, in China he quotes from Chairman Mao, and in England, he praises Tony Blair and the Third Way," Mr. Urdaneta said. "He wants to be on good terms with everybody, so he says what people want to hear. We will only see the true Hugo Chavez emerge after this election."
 
A Time to Deliver
That chapter will open after the vote on Sunday when pressure to deliver results can only mount.
But "there doesn't seem to be a coherent plan," said Robert Bottome, editor of Veneconomia, the leading business newsletter here. "The formal economy is being more and more destroyed, and I don't think it is deliberate. It's just that he doesn't understand, he doesn't know what he's doing."
And even as the hour of his greatest triumph draws closer, Mr. Chavez has passed up an opportunity to be magnanimous or conciliatory. Instead, he has stepped up attacks on all who question his vision or recoil at the conflict he says he relishes.
"There is no third way here," he said recently. "No, here there is only revolution and counterrevolution, and we are going to annihilate the counterrevolution."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTORATE;
Potential Voters Skeptical, Lacking Passion for Candidates

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill., July 21

 BODY:
It is a puzzling political season for George Gauthier.
Although the major presidential candidates were identified months ago, Mr. Gauthier, a builder, has no idea whom he will vote for. 
 He knows where he stands on the issues and has thoughtful, nuanced ideas about what a president should be. But so far, no candidate has given him enough to go on.
"Bush doesn't have the strengths in foreign and national politics that his father did," said Mr. Gauthier, 59, who also runs an organization to help lower-income people obtain homes, "and there's been good and bad state governors as presidents, so he comes into it having to answer why he should be executive of the United States."
"With Gore, my fear is that his programs would be too big, too expensive," said Mr. Gauthier, who voted for Republicans in the last four presidential elections, Democrats in the previous three and knows only that he will not vote for a third-party candidate this year.
"I think both of them show leadership potential, an ability to project their vision of the future," he said. "Neither is going to effect major radical change. It's a question of how they would lean, which bias they have. It's hard to find the best candidate."
With the Republican and Democratic conventions coming up, Mr. Gauthier is hardly in the minority, interviews with voters suggest. In dozens of discussions in Evanston, a diverse, middle-class suburb just north of Chicago in a critical swing-vote state, people were studiously skeptical, awaiting answers and wary of the campaign games politicians play.
In the absence of a single urgent issue like war or economic crisis, voters were sizing up candidates as managers, stewards and respect-worthy leaders rather than as rallying, agenda-driven politicians. Voters were more interested in what kind of cabinet officials and Supreme Court justices the candidates would appoint and in how they would work with Congress than in where they stood on every issue.
And while most said they wanted a president with consistency and integrity, someone unlikely to be swayed by interest-group pressure, they doubted whether any candidate had those qualities.
"I'd like to see a leader who's not a captive of special interests, but it may be impossible," said Edith Eisner, a 75-year-old retired English teacher who said she would vote for Al Gore. "I think both the candidates now can be pushed around."
Al Butkus, the president of an engineering firm who said he would vote for George W. Bush, said: "My big concern about presidential politics is once you get to be able to run for president you've had to make so many promises and compromises that you've compromised yourself coming through the system."
In Evanston, home of Northwestern University and one of the few racially diverse communities in the Illinois suburbs, more people vote for Democrats. But the interviews focused on people across the political spectrum. All except one of those interviewed said they had ruled out voting for the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party. Most considered them extreme or narrowly focused, although some said they found Mr. Nader appealing but unelectable.
Strikingly, among people who said they would support Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush, there was frequently little passion about the candidate.
Cindy Wilson, a 40-year-old civil rights lawyer, said she had always voted Democratic and would again this year.
Still, she said: "I think Gore is questionable. I don't think he tells the truth all the time."
Ms. Wilson, with two children and a husband who is also a lawyer, said she was fairly certain that Mr. Gore agreed with her on education, the environment, affirmative action and other issues, but she had reservations about "him as a person." She said she believed, for example, that he was "pandering" when he said that Elian Gonzalez and his father should be given permanent residency status, and she called his ethics on campaign financing "a little loose."
"He seems to always say what people want to hear. I can't get excited about him and trust him."
Mr. Butkus, 48, who typically backs Republicans for president, said of Governor Bush: "He doesn't have a lot of political experience. There's just not a big book on him to let you now how he'd act in situations." He said he was "not happy" with Mr. Bush's vague response about whether he had used cocaine, but added, "There's abuses on the other side."
"The one thing I'm impressed with Bush about is that he has been picking good people and they're sticking by him," Mr. Butkus said.
People seem well aware of what presidential power can and cannot do. Their priorities included Supreme Court appointments and keeping Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Some would like a foreign policy leader to help resolve the Middle East conflict, deal firmly with Russia and either scrap or build a missile defense system.
Some mentioned health care that would be affordable for all citizens and progress in race relations. Most said they believed the economy would continue strongly under either candidate. And no one linked his or her vote to a single issue, like school vouchers or the death penalty -- indeed, a few said such issues should be left to the states.
Mr. Butkus's wife, Ellen, 47, said she strongly opposed abortion, but would not make that a litmus test. "The check mark in the little box just doesn't give you a sense of all the different ways that this candidate could affect things," said Mrs. Butkus, a nurse.
Rather, Mrs. Butkus, who is undecided and would not rule out Mr. Nader, is more concerned about how candidates would deal with racial issues and what impact they would have on issues like the death penalty and school choice.
Several people seemed to favor both the probusiness, smaller-government approach historically associated with Republicans and the sense of social justice and inclusiveness typically linked to Democrats.
"I want someone who's going to have a balance in being generally businesslike in the management of government," said Don Colleton, a 58-year-old lawyer leaning toward Mr. Bush. "But I'm not one to play around with some of these social issues. I want folks to behave in a way that is just resolute in acknowledging the intrinsic equal dignity of members of the human race, whatever color or size they come in."
Mr. Gauthier exemplifies the sense of wanting to borrow from both Republicans and Democrats. He says that the federal government should deal with social problems by financing private nonprofit agencies like his housing coalition, which he contends are more cost-effective than government agencies. He says he thinks a prescription drug plan should include means-testing so that those people most in need will benefit, and that eventually, there will have to be means tests for Social Security and Medicare. He also contends that school vouchers are unworkable, and that the government should take some of the money now being spent on the military and battling illegal drugs and put it into drug treatment.
Indeed, Mr. Gauthier is so concerned with balance that he said he might vote for the candidate whose party appeared as though it would not have a majority in Congress.
Several people expressed concern that Mr. Bush might be influenced by radical right-wing voices in the Republican Party, but none seemed concerned that Mr. Gore would be similarly pulled from the center.
"I think Bush's heart is one place and his head is another," said the Rev. Larry Bullock, an African Methodist Episcopal minister who also owns construction businesses. "I think he is a compassionate conservative, but I think he's too beholden to certain wings of his party."
Mr. Bullock said he would probably vote for Mr. Gore, but wanted the Democratic candidate to "show a freshness and a newness."
"He's really got to rattle those bones," Mr. Bullock said. "Clinton gave us the bridge to the 21st century. Gore needs to tell us what's on the other side of the bridge."
Most of those interviewed said their view of President Clinton would not affect their vote. Supporters and critics said Mr. Gore was appropriately loyal in defending the president in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And most said that he deserved neither credit nor criticism for Clinton administration policies.
One exception was Lorraine Morton, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, who said she did not have "great enthusiasm" for Mr. Gore, but "Clinton did a fantastic job," and if elected, "Gore can pick up the telephone and say, 'Bill. what do you think about so and so.' "
Although most people said Mr. Bush made a good choice in Dick Cheney as his running mate, those interviewed said it would not affect their views.
As the campaign heats up, the candidates might do well to listen to the likes of Barry Slotnick.
Mr. Slotnick, 28, who works in his family's travel business and owns a fitness equipment company, considers himself "fiscally conservative and socially liberal," pro-entrepreneur and pro-abortion rights. He voted Republican in 1992 and 1996, but started this campaign admiring Bill Bradley, especially his progressive views on race relations. "As Bradley's situation started to fade," he said, "I really took an interest in John McCain."
Now, Mr. Slotnick is "very much on the fence," he said.
"I like the Republican platform when it comes to small government," he said, but added that he was worried about "some very frightening people in the far reaches of the Republican Party, the far right."
With Mr. Bush, he said, he is unsure "how much has been attained because he's daddy's boy."
"I don't think there's any question that Gore brings more experience, having been vice president for eight years," he said.
Still, Mr. Slotnick said he believed that Mr. Bush "could probably get a good cabinet together." And while "Bush seems to me like a grown-up frat boy," Mr. Slotnick said, he also "seems like a more approachable, more normal guy."
"He seems less political," Mr. Slotnick said. "Gore, everything he does seems a little rehearsed."
Mr. Slotnick said he thinks "both Gore and Bush can keep the momentum in the economy going," adding: "So this year I'm really looking more at the person. At the end of the day you look for someone who really you can look up to and trust. Are they a good representation of the country?"

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Absolutely, Positively Unrealistic

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
ABSOLUT New York, as defined on a new billboard at Lafayette and Bond Streets, is a studio apartment in the shape of a vodka bottle. The three-dimensional apartment is fully equipped with real furniture, rugs, kitchen appliances and a bathtub that are all affixed to the billboard.
It's described as a life-size apartment, which is indeed the scale of the 49-foot-wide billboard, but anyone who has been hunting for real-life apartments in NoHo could quibble with the dimensions. This studio apartment has a total of 900 square feet of space, which is absolutely not New York in today's real-estate ads. That's more like the size of a two-bedroom. 
 But while the apartment may not conform to reality, it does conform to the popular image of a Manhattan apartment. Over-size homes are the norm on film and television. When New Yorkers see their alleged apartments on the screen, their reaction is often Robert Redford's in "Legal Eagles" upon entering the SoHo loft of Darryl Hannah, a performance artist who has just told him she inherited no money from her father.
"Lot of room," he says, looking in surprise around a space big enough to be a basketball court.
In "Desk Set," Katherine Hepburn lives in an Upper East Side apartment that seems grandiose for a magazine researcher, although it's nothing compared with the digs of a newspaper reporter, Lois Lane. In the movie "Superman," Christopher Reeve finds Margot Kidder waiting on a rooftop terrace fit for a wedding reception. It looks like the Peninsula Hotel's rooftop bar, but with a better garden.
Even before John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow get to know their strange new neighbors in "Rosemary's Baby," it's clear that supernatural forces are at work. How else could an unsuccessful young actor get an apartment in the Dakota?
How does Sigourney Weaver, playing a classical musician in "Ghostbusters," afford a co-op on Central Park West with a huge kitchen and a park view? How does Deborah Kerr, playing a school teacher in "An Affair to Remember" who says she's "on a budget," manage a one-bedroom apartment with a large sunken living room, marble fireplace and balcony?
There's been some realism on TV, as on "The Honeymooners" and "Seinfeld." The huge apartment of a waitress and an unemployed chef on "Friends' is explained away as a rent-regulated legacy. But the huge rooms on "Mad About You" remain a mystery to most New Yorkers, including Chuck Katz, the author of "Manhattan on Film: Walking Tours of Hollywood's Fabled Front Lot."
"The bathroom in 'Mad About You' looks bigger than most Manhattan apartments," Mr. Katz said. "It's not realistic for that young couple to be living in a place like that, but you can see the practical reasons for it. In one episode they get locked in the bathroom. If two people got locked in my bathroom, there'd be no room for a film crew."
LOCATION scouts for films are accustomed to suspending disbelief. "I've told directors dozens of times that an apartment is a little upscale for the character," said Dana Robin, who has 15 years of experience scouting locations. "But the directors need high ceilings and big rooms for light and cameras." They also have to consider the audience in the rest of the country.
"People in the rest of the country would be shocked to see how New Yorkers really live," Mr. Robin said. "Your hero, unless he's a down-and-outer, should live in what looks to the audience at least like a respectable place, if not better. The entertainment business likes to perpetuate a bigger and grander picture of life."
So does the advertising industry, which is why the studio on the billboard is so big. "We didn't set out to create an apartment for the New York Everyman," said Richard Lewis, worldwide account director for Absolut at the TBWA/Chiat/Day agency. "It's a place where the Absolut New Yorker would live."
These fantasy apartments can be disillusioning for the natives, because they must make our places look even more cramped by comparison. But in some ways we also benefit from the false images.
"These big apartments are a P.R. campaign for New Yorkers," Mr. Katz said. "We don't want the rest of the country to know how we live. We'd rather show a young actor in the Dakota instead of in a fifth-floor walk-up in Brooklyn. We don't want our friends back in Tucson or Chicago to know the real bargain with the devil here: you can get a great job, but you have to live in a shoe box."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD;
Cheney Slips in Explaining A Vote on Freeing Mandela

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
As he made the rounds of the television talk shows this morning, Dick Cheney confidently defended his votes in the 1980's against gun control, abortion rights and education spending, but he slipped when he tried to justify his opposition to an obscure resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.
Democrats immediately pounced on the issue and vowed to use it against the Republican ticket in the fall campaign. 
 On NBC's "Today," Mr. Cheney, the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, said his vote was based on a disagreement over whether economic sanctions were the best way to end apartheid.
"The debate that we had at the time had to do with how we could best pursue our policies in South Africa," Mr. Cheney said. "Nobody supported apartheid. We were all against it. But there was a big debate over the best leverage we could use to get Nelson Mandela free.
"One school of thought said that there should be sanctions imposed on South Africa, that American companies should be prohibited from operating in South Africa, that there shouldn't be any trade with South Africa. The other school of thought said, 'Wait a minute,' that, in fact, the only good jobs that were available to black South Africans were with American firms. If you wanted a company that was going to provide opportunities and not discriminate, you had to go to American firms, and the people that would be hurt if we forced American firms out of South Africa were those very people we were trying to help."
Mr. Cheney then said, "This notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical Al Gore distortion of a record, a point he's trying to make because he doesn't want to talk about real issues."
The disagreement over sanctions was a big issue in Congress in 1986, and Mr. Cheney's description of the two sides was accurate. Before the year was out, Congress overrode President Ronald Reagan's veto of a bill that imposed sanctions, the first time Mr. Reagan had been rebuffed like this on a foreign policy matter. Mr. Cheney supported the president.
But the question of sanctions never came up in the debate on the Mandela resolution. The opposition to it was based on the belief of the right wing of the Republican Party in the House that the African National Congress, Mr. Mandela's party and the leading political voice against apartheid, was dominated by Communists.
Representative Dan Burton of Indiana said: "Let us look at the A.N.C. and see what it consists of exactly. Nineteen of the 30 members of the A.N.C. are known members of the South African Communist Party, and we believe as many as 26."
Democratic strategists said today they expected to use the Mandela vote against the Republicans this fall, particularly in commercials on radio stations popular with blacks.
"George W. Bush has now said to the African-American community, 'I give you my person, my candidate for vice president, and my person said no to Nelson Mandela when he was in prison,' " said Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
The 1986 resolution was nonbinding. The House debated it for less than an hour, and it was defeated, 245 to 177, shy of the 282 votes needed for a two-thirds majority.
On the vote, 215 Democrats and 30 Republicans were in favor; 32 Democrats and 145 Republicans, including Mr. Cheney, were opposed.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PLATFORM;
DRAFT PLATFORM FOR G.O.P. SOFTENS HARD-LINE STANCES

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 27

 BODY:
The proposed Republican platform would drop several of the more hard-edged conservative positions adopted four years ago -- like calling for the abolition of the Department of Education -- and transform much of the document's tone to reflect the "compassionate conservatism" of Gov. George W. Bush.
But it also reflects the continuing power of the party's conservative base, most notably in its word-by-word reaffirmation of the abortion plank, calling for a ban on abortion with no exceptions and the appointment of judges who "respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life." 
 The draft of the platform was written under the guidance of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the platform committee chairman, and was distributed to members of the platform committee gathering here tonight. It will be reviewed -- possibly rewritten -- and voted upon by the 107-member platform committee over the next two days. The full convention will consider the resulting product on Monday.
Governor Thompson said tonight that he hoped the draft reflected "a more uplifting view of the Republican Party, one that's more inclusive, that attempts to build a winning team, that people can rally around." He said it was also intended to reflect the Bush philosophy, adding that he took the chairman's job "because my friend the governor asked me to do it."
Asked how much he expected the committee to change this draft, Mr. Thompson said, "I hope not much, but I know some."
Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said tonight that Republicans were simply putting "compassionate conservative wrapping paper" around the same old conservative dogma. She argued that the platform's changes were "around the margins" and asserted, "If the American people wanted one sign that the Republican Party had moved out of the 19th century, it would have been some understanding that American women want the right to choose protected."
As written, the document is in large part a road map of the Bush campaign's political strategy in the general election. The section on immigration, for example, no longer demands a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the children born of illegal immigrants, as it did four years ago. Rather than calling for "the official recognition of English as the nation's common language," it declares, "Another sign of our unity is the role of English as our common language." The tone, in general, is far more welcoming, reflecting Republicans' efforts to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrant groups.
Similarly, the document includes a careful appeal to women, pledging the party's commitment to women's health issues, and to the elderly, considered a critical swing vote this year. It promises to give Medicare "a new lease on life," by giving each of its 39 million beneficiaries a choice of health plans, an allusion to efforts to get more private insurance plans involved in Medicare. And it accuses the Clinton administration of treating "Social Security as a slogan rather than a priority," while heralding Mr. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their payroll taxes.
Still, for all these appeals to voters in the center, this is hardly a rebuttal of conservative orthodoxy. The platform reiterates that "we defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms" and argues that "self-defense is a basic human right." The answer to gun violence, it argues, is stronger enforcement of existing laws.
The platform attacks the Supreme Court's recent decision overturning state laws that barred what opponents call "partial-birth" abortion, asserting that the decision "shocks the conscience of the nation." And while Mr. Bush says he would allow abortions in the case of rape, incest and to save the life of the woman, the platform remains unswervingly opposed. Mr. Bush and other Republican leaders had promised the anti-abortion movement early on that the abortion plank would not change.
Republican aides said the document was intended to sound a far less combative tone than the 1996 platform, which is in keeping with the Bush campaign's effort to present its candidate as "a uniter, not a divider." At times, the references are opaque: In a section titled, "Government for the People," the draft is apparently referring to the impeachment of Mr. Clinton when it declares: "At a time when the nation felt betrayed by misconduct in high office, the Republican Congress responded with gravity and high purpose. We applaud those members who did their duty to conscience and the Constitution."
The platform goes to great lengths, though, to try to build a case against giving the Democrats any credit for the current economic boom. It argues that the economy was a "shambles" under President Jimmy Carter, was saved by the Reagan and Bush administrations, and was jeopardized anew by the election of the Clinton administration in 1992, although that election occurred in a recession. Only the "honesty and guts" of a Republican Congress managed to erase the budget deficit and steady the economy for this boom, the platform draft declares.
Four years ago, when that Republican-controlled Congress was still in full-cry, the platform called for the elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education and Energy. This draft generally calls for "downsizing" of the "mess" in Washington, where there are "too many departments and agencies with competing programs that waste resources and fail to deliver the goods."
Mr. Thompson said the draft was written by the staff of the Republican National Committee, the Bush campaign and his own operation, under the guidance of him and his two co-chairs, Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee.
Some of the most scathing criticism in the draft comes in the section on foreign policy, where the administration is accused of mishandling crises from the Balkans to Mexico.
"Reacting belatedly to inevitable crises, the administration constantly enlarges the reach of its rhetoric -- most recently in Vice President Al Gore's 'new security agenda' that adds disease, climate and all the world's ethnic or religious conflicts to an undiminished set of existing American responsibilities. If there is some limit to candidate Gore's new agenda for America as global social worker, he has yet to define it," the draft declares.
"It is time for America to regain its focus," it adds.
Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, responded, "Sounds like the Republicans are turning back the clock to the days of isolationism and a head-in-the-sand view of the world. It's only common sense to address these problems before they develop into conflicts."
The platform draft also takes aim at Mr. Gore's environmental initiatives, arguing that a Republican president will reduce harmful emissions without "forcing Americans to walk to work."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RUNNING MATE;
Once Again, Cheney Confronts the Questions

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., July 27

 BODY:
Dick Cheney tried today to beat back questions about his conservative voting record, appearing on the morning news programs of all three major networks as the Bush campaign fought to keep from being defined by the second man on the ticket.
Gov. George W. Bush jumped into the debate, accusing the Democrats of using a "constant line -- vote for me, I'm going to tear down the other person" -- in attacking the record of his running mate, whose service as defense secretary to Mr. Bush's father followed 10 years in the House. 
"Secretary Cheney brought people together and helped win a war," Mr. Bush said, "which stands in stark contrast to Vice President Al Gore, who tends to divide people to create war."
Mr. Bush spoke as Mr. Cheney, for a second straight day, was called on to explain positions he took as a congressman from Wyoming, including votes against the equal rights amendment, gun control and sanctions on South Africa's apartheid government.
Democrats have highlighted those stands to undercut Mr. Bush's efforts to define himself as a "different kind of Republican."
At times today, Mr. Cheney shot back by pointing to inconsistencies in Mr. Gore's own Congressional voting record. At other times, he defended his conservative views. And occasionally, he turned to talk of legislative process.
Asked, for instance, why he had voted against the equal rights amendment, he said Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., as the speaker of a Democratic-controlled House, had brought it up for a vote under a procedure "that prohibited amendments of any kind -- we had to accept or reject it." He said he had feared that the way it was written would have required the drafting of women into the military.
"Now, I didn't think that was a very good idea," Mr. Cheney said on "The Early Show" on CBS.
Several hours later Mr. Bush made a brief appearance before reporters, taking time out from practicing his acceptance speech for his nomination next week, and maintained that he had not been blindsided by Mr. Cheney's record.
"Of course I knew his votes," Mr. Bush said. "But I also know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who all they do is spend time tearing people down."
The Democrats kept up their efforts to use Mr. Cheney's record as a way of tying Mr. Bush to a Republican establishment of the past.
"What Cheney's selection has done is given us a rather vivid picture of old guard Republicanism," said Mark Fabiani, a deputy Gore campaign manager. And, Mr. Fabiani said, "some of his past votes are hard to explain away in any era."
The difficulty for Mr. Bush is that some of the stands of his running mate cut right to the heart of the way he has been seeking to define himself as a "compassionate conservative." Mr. Bush has put a heavy premium on education, for example, and Mr. Cheney voted against the Head Start program.
Mr. Bush regularly surrounds himself with members of minorities and recently spoke at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Cheney voted against imposing economic sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa and against a House resolution calling for Nelson Mandela to be freed after 23 years in prison.
This morning Mr. Cheney said on the NBC News television program "Today" that "this notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical distortion by Al Gore."
He said the issue had been tied up in a debate over sanctions against South Africa. He said he believed that forcing United States companies out of South Africa would have left many blacks there worse off, because "any good jobs available to black South Africans were with American firms."
Of domestic matters, Mr. Cheney argued that the 1980's, when he served in the House, were a different era, when budget deficits required votes to control spending. And he said his rise in Congress up the leadership ladder of his party showed that he had not been viewed as an extreme conservative.
"So whatever the Democrats want to say about me now," he said, "the fact of the matter was many Democrats, as well as all of the Republicans, thought I was a reasonably respectable fellow in the 1980's."
On some issues, Mr. Cheney stood firm. When asked why he had been one of only 21 House members to vote against a ban on so-called cop-killer bullets, he said: "I consistently voted against gun control. I'm one of those people who believes that the solution to our gun problem is to enforce existing laws, not impose new restrictions on law-abiding citizens."
Pressed as to why in 1988 he voted against a ban on plastic guns that can make it through airport security, a measure that was not opposed by even the National Rifle Association, he said, "Well, obviously I wasn't in the pocket of the N.R.A."
And on ABC's "Good Morning America," he tried to turn the scrutiny to Mr. Gore, whose position on gun issues has changed since his first years in Congress. "At the same time that I was doing that, casting those votes, Al Gore was receiving an A rating from the National Rifle Association," Mr. Cheney said. "He was pro-gun and anti-gun-control."
As for his votes against creating the Department of Education and against spending on Head Start, Mr. Cheney cautioned against the assumption "that anything that's got the word 'education' on it is good."
"You've got to look at the substance of it," he said. "You've got to analyze the legislation. The fact of the matter is that education is primarily a state and local responsibility."
Mr. Cheney also answered questions about a Republican fund-raising brochure from 1992 that had a picture of him as defense secretary and promised large contributors the right to attend unspecified government briefings.
"We didn't do any fund-raisers in the Pentagon," he said, "never did. I did brief people from time to time, but as a general rule we stayed out of partisan politics in the Pentagon."

HEADLINE: Playing for (Political) Time on China Trade

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
When Commerce Secretary William M. Daley laid down the Clinton administration's strategy this past spring for forcing the China trade bill through a reluctant Congress, he insisted repeatedly that, win or lose, Congress had to vote before the summer political conventions.
"You just don't want to be debating China during the heat of the fall campaign," Mr. Daley said then. "You do that and all bets are off." 
 Now, Mr. Daley has left the administration to head Al Gore's presidential campaign, and the China trade bill, having cleared the House in May with seemingly unstoppable momentum, has become tied up in the Senate's arcane maneuvering on the budget, efforts to punish China for weapons proliferation, and general procedural gridlock.
The Senate will adjourn on Friday for the summer having barely begun to debate, much less vote, on the measure that Mr. Clinton repeatedly called a national security priority and his top remaining legislative goal.
Both the Clinton administration and the Senate leadership expect the bill to pass. The Senate voted 86 to 12 this afternoon to open a debate on China trade, overcoming a procedural hurdle to schedule full consideration of the measure in early September. Nearly 70 senators are thought to support the bill itself.
Yet the fears Mr. Daley expressed last spring over the fate of the China bill have come true: It became a political hostage while the White House and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, clashed over annual appropriations bills and while Democrats focused on unrelated legislative goals. Meanwhile, the political needs of the Gore campaign sidelined Mr. Daley from the White House lobbying campaign to pass the trade bill, leaving Steven Richetti, a less prominent political hand, in charge of the effort.
"The patients' bill of rights is simply not an important matter compared to the possibility of nuclear stand-off in Asia," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who has argued that the United States could face a military confrontation with China if Congress fails to approve permanent trade ties.
"We -- and I mean the Democrats, the White House and the Republicans -- simply do not recognize the weight of this matter," he said.
Administration officials said that China remained one of Mr. Clinton's foremost priorities. But since the bill passed the House, the president and many of his top aides have been focused on other issues that will shape his legacy, including brokering a Middle East peace accord, rejecting Republican tax-cut initiatives and, perhaps most of all, helping Mr. Gore become president.
The president allowed Mr. Daley, who headed the aggressive lobbying effort on behalf of the China bill from January to June, to resign to take over Mr. Gore's lagging campaign. Mr. Richetti, the deputy White House chief of staff who was Mr. Daley's partner in shepherding the China bill through the House, was left to see it through the Senate.
Mr. Richetti said the prospects for passage were good in September, despite earlier concerns that Democrats might have a hard time voting for a trade measure staunchly opposed by labor so soon before a tight election. He urged Mr. Lott to stop using the China bill as a legislative negotiating lever.
"There is wide bipartisan support for this," Mr. Richetti said. "It's far too important a national security and economic issue to be used as a bargaining chip for other matters."
Few fault Mr. Richetti's political skills or his attention to the China trade issue. But several senators and business lobbyists who support the China trade bill said that Mr. Daley has been missed.
Widely considered Mr. Clinton's best political strategist, Mr. Daley has a no-nonsense style and, among Clinton administration officials, a rare track record of working successfully with the Republican-led Congress. He also demanded -- and was granted -- broad influence over Mr. Clinton's schedule, arranging many public and private events to show that the president had no higher priority than China.
"We had a sense of urgency in the House and then we lost it -- Daley leaving, the president had some other things, you had the appropriations bills," said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "We need to get that urgency back."
He said that while there is plenty of support for the measure in the Senate, it will now be subject to intense political pressures and a crowded legislative calendar in the fall.
One senior administration official described the view that Mr. Daley's departure signaled a downshift on the China bill as "totally false." The official argued that the stall in the Senate began even before Mr. Daley left and that the strategy put in place by Mr. Daley and Mr. Richetti for dealing with those delays remained.
They and several Senate Democrats put the blame squarely on the Republican caucus and Mr. Lott, who exercises almost complete control of the Senate's daily agenda. Despite overwhelming support from their core constituency -- business -- Mr. Lott repeatedly refused to schedule a firm date for a vote in June or July.
Republicans see the China vote as a tough one for Democrats because it requires that they offend core labor and environmental constituencies, making a September vote politically appealing. "I think it's clear that the Republicans want to make it as difficult as possible on the Democrats," said Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Newspaper Can Be Sold, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
A federal judge in San Francisco ruled yesterday that the Hearst Corporation's $660 million purchase of The San Francisco Chronicle did not violate antitrust laws and that the company would have had legal justification for closing The San Francisco Examiner had it chosen to.
The Chronicle has been a fierce journalistic rival of The Examiner, the newspaper that gave William Randolph Hearst his start in publishing, for more than a century. The two newspapers have also been business partners for the past 35 years. 
 In his ruling, the judge, Vaughn R. Walker of Federal District Court, noted that The Examiner's financial condition was so weak that it "imposes a substantial drain on the profitability" of the newspaper agency whose profits were shared by both papers. The Chronicle's circulation of 464,943 is more than four times The Examiner's.
Since the closing of The Examiner would have been economically justified, its subsidized sale to the politically influential Fang family in San Francisco was laced with what Judge Walker called "malodorous aspects," in reference to the complicated political and legal dance behind the sale.
The sale to the Fangs came in March, after weeks of pressure from the Justice Department, which was threatening to use its regulatory authority to block the sale of The Chronicle. For months, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., a Fang ally, had also promised to fight any effort to close The Examiner.
In last fall's mayoral election campaign, The Examiner's publisher, Timothy White, offered to "horse trade" with the mayor. According to evidence presented in the trial, Mr. White suggested that The Examiner would give editorial support to Mayor Brown in return for his political support for the paper's business plans.
Last March, Hearst agreed to sell the newspaper to the Fangs' business and give it a subsidy of up to $66 million for three years to help keep a truncated version of the newspaper alive. While the judge was critical of the Justice Department stance that provoked the sale, he said that Clinton Riley, who had challenged the transfer of The Examiner, did not have legal standing to make that claim. .
Judge Walker's decision paves the way for Hearst to act on its plans to merge the Chronicle and Examiner newsrooms and to compete with Bay Area rivals. The San Jose Mercury News, owned by Knight Ridder, this week began delivering a special San Francisco edition, firing the first shot in the latest battle for readers in one of the country's wealthiest areas.

HEADLINE: A City With Too Much Housing;
Syracuse Hopes to Clear Deserted Eyesores From Streets

SERIES: THE OTHER ECONOMY: Struggling Against Blight

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
If only it were near New York City, 403 Rowland Street might be a handy home-buyer's dream. Sure, the side porch is collapsing, the chimney is crumbling, and the big front windows have been replaced by small squinty ones. But the vintage charms of this turn-of-the-century house, including sturdy construction and gingerbread trim, would probably look alluring to the housing-hungry hordes in southern New York State.
The view is quite different here, near the center of the state, near the center of Syracuse, near the center of a working-class neighborhood known as Skunk City. So it is hard to argue with Millie Compeau, sitting on the porch of the tidy house where she has lived for 89 of her 92 years, when she peers across Rowland Street at No. 403 and decrees, "That house should come down." 
 A lot of people are starting to agree. That is because Syracuse has more houses -- a lot more houses -- than its 152,000 citizens need or want. Like the place on Rowland Street, as many as 2,200 of them are empty or abandoned, more than 10 percent of the houses within the city limits.
Boarded-up houses mar some of Syracuse's nicest neighborhoods and fill blocks in some of the worst. Skunk City, where residents say the namesake critters still roam at night, is somewhere in between: a well-kept house is followed by a rundown place, then another nice one, then an abandoned wreck -- or two or three.
The problem is so bad that last fall, government and civic leaders began the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative to try to bring back blighted areas of the city. Representative James T. Walsh, a Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, whose father grew up in Skunk City, has already gotten $15 million in federal financing for the initiative.
As part of the project, many in Syracuse are embracing an idea that has long been anathema to almost everyone trying to save urban areas: demolishing houses -- and not rebuilding them.
"The truth is, getting money to do tear-downs is very hard," said Allison Lee, a senior official in the Albany office of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. But after touring areas where problem properties have been knocked down, she said, "I have to tell you, the neighborhoods are better."
Syracuse is not the only place upstate suffering from abandoned housing, which afflicts almost every old city east of Detroit. But perhaps because Syracuse is so small and is not a corporate or government center, the problem seems more overwhelming than in other cities.
"Ours is the most serious problem because we have the least resources," said Eric Mower, an advertising executive who is chairman of the initiative.
How Syracuse came to such a pass is a tangled tale of failures in public policies and changes in private tastes, but most of all, of economics. The 1991 recession that hit all of New York State came to Syracuse and would not leave. Long after the economy began to rebound to the south, central New York stagnated.
That is no longer true, at least on paper. New jobs have been sprouting here at a faster pace than almost anywhere else north of New York City, and unemployment is only 3.7 percent, well under the national average of 4.2 percent.
The housing market is improving, too, after dropping sharply in the mid-1990's and treading water for years. Last year, the number of houses sold in and around Syracuse rose more than 10 percent, according to the Greater Syracuse Association of Realtors, and the median price edged up to $82,500 (which is still less than the median in 1994).
Within the city, however, house prices still seem to be dropping, according to a study by the federal Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative. That is, when houses sell at all. In Skunk City, there were just four regular sales last year, according to the report. Tax auctions and foreclosure sales have become the norm.
City inspectors report that more than 1,000 houses in the city remain vacant, and the number has been rising. Minchin G. Lewis, the city auditor, says that the correct figure is more like 2,200, based on the number of water meters that have been unused for a year.
The vacant houses that people see all over the city remind them of the terrible economic times they have endured -- and help explain why the good news announced by economists does not seem to have sunk into the psyche of Syracuse's citizens. "They're shellshocked from the decline that has taken place," Mr. Lewis said.
That was clear at a city council hearing, held on July 19 to discuss plans to build a big mall in the city. Dozens of residents spoke, and many described Syracuse in apocalyptic terms.
"This city is in a real crisis," said Melanie Duer, 43, who after a disabling accident used her insurance settlement to buy and fix up a small apartment building in Skunk City, near where she grew up. In 1994, she told city officials, there were 6 vacant houses on the main road between her building and downtown; today, she said, there are 36.
In a later interview, Ms. Duer expressed frustration with politicians who, she said, find it easy to overlook her neighborhood. When President and Hillary Clinton visited Syracuse last year, the president played golf less than a mile away from her building, "but it might as well have been in Zimbabwe," she said. "They could really make a difference if they walked on this street. I'm just one voice with a weed whacker."
On the surface, Skunk City does not look like a slum. Each one- or two-family house has a little strip of grass in the front and a plot in the back, with just enough room for a shed or a garage. Many of the houses are trim and tidy. Marigolds and petunias edge walks. Children of all colors ride their bicycles up and down the streets.
Hang around for a while, however, and problems appear. Drug dealers, for instance.
On Rowland Street, a young man announces, "I'm gonna cop," and with money in his hand crosses to the corner where a couple loiter. A block away, there is a lot of furtive activity around a pay phone on the corner. Down the street, a high-stakes craps game continues in one driveway. Residents complain that illegal car-repair joints sprout on the bigger streets.
And on almost every block, like a bruise, is an unkempt house with a sagging porch, a trash-filled yard, a pile of old dumped tires, or broken windows partly boarded up.
There have been some shootings and stabbings, said Richard Puchalski, who as executive director of Syracuse United Neighbors seems to know every block of Skunk City. "A lot of folks who have lived here 40 or 50 or 60 years are finding it difficult to maintain their houses," he said. "They are being pressured by their siblings, who say, 'You'd better get the hell out of there.' "
Even in its heyday, Skunk City was not the fanciest part of town. It was too close to the swamp; developers crammed as many houses as possible in narrow lots along the new sewer line. In more recent decades, the threat of a highway project discouraged people from moving in.
But to the people who lived there, it was a "garden spot of Eden," according to the yellowing newspaper clippings preserved at the Onondaga Historical Association. For the children, there was fishing and skating and swimming; for the adults, there were plenty of saloons and a movie house.
The men in the neighborhood had steady jobs at the post office, the railroad or the auto plants. Some were more colorful: Florence Joslin's father sang on the radio, while the Schwald boys' dad had been a roller skater in a vaudeville act, the Whirling Hamilton Trio, before he settled down to raise a family.
"When we were kids, 15, 16 years old, our father could leave the car in the driveway with the keys in it," said Dennis J. Schwald Sr., 58. "Nobody touched nothing."
Back then, said his brother William, 61, "everyone owned their own home." He added, "We've seen it gone down and down." Both men, who retired from the Carrier air-conditioner plant, still live on Hartson Street, as did their parents and in-laws; now, Dennis's son owns two houses on the street.
But such roots have gone out of fashion, even in Syracuse. Today, many young families -- and older ones, too -- prefer to live out in the suburbs, where the houses are newer, the lots bigger and the schools better. The amount of developed land around the city has almost doubled in the last decade, said Vito Sciscioli, the city's commissioner for community and economic development.
Meanwhile, the region's population has been shrinking, with most of the drain coming from within the city limits. From 1990 to mid-1999, the population of Onondaga County shrank by 13,000, with 12,000 of the drop occurring in Syracuse, according to federal census estimates.
That left Syracuse with "a brutal oversupply of housing," said Eric Hangen, who wrote the report for the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative. People who wanted to sell could not. People who wanted to fix up their homes would not because they feared rightly that they could not recoup their investments, he said.
Desperate homeowners took to renting out their unwanted houses, or selling them to slum lords, or abandoning them altogether because they could not pay the mortgages. Or the taxes, especially after the city started seizing delinquent properties a couple of years ago.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development alone now lists about 50 houses for sale in the city. Some of them are priced at less than $15,000, which is roughly what it would cost to knock them down.
In the 1980's, the Syracuse Model Neighborhood Corporation, a housing group, built houses on vacant lots and sold them for $78,000, but no more.
"In the last two years I've built one house," said Thomas Francis, who runs the group. "There's no demand, and I can't afford to hold on to them."
Fundamentally, Mr. Francis said, "there just are not enough people."
Ergo, demolition -- or de-densifying, as some people call it. The idea is to tear down not only those abandoned houses that threaten to collapse on their own, but also those that are simply unneeded and uneconomical. The land could be split between the remaining nearby houses, to give them bigger yards, or driveways, or garages (popular in snowy Syracuse). Big tracts could be turned into parks.
The plan, in other words, is to make the city more like the suburbs.
"The suburbs are the best part of America," said Greg G. Smith, a landlord with 60 units on the west side of the city. "Everybody loves having a decent-size yard and off-street parking. They want breathing room enough that when somebody's alarm clock goes off, it doesn't wake you up."
If the houses that get knocked down are simply replaced, he added, "you're preserving the streetscape that everybody hates." As part of the neighborhood initiative, he is hoping to get financing for a master plan and small grants to try out this idea on the west side of town.
Exactly how much housing will be demolished in Syracuse remains unclear. Each of the city's neighborhoods gets to make recommendations about what improvements it would like. In some of the more prosperous areas, residents are calling for improvements like period streetlights or a new botanical garden.
Representative Walsh said that no more than a third of the federal money, $5 million so far, could be used for demolition; at $12,000 a pop, the city's estimate, that would be about 417 houses.
No one is suggesting that demolition will solve all the problems in Syracuse's neighborhoods. "It's good to have that strategy," said Mr. Sciscioli, the city commissioner, "but if you don't address basic services, you can kiss it all goodbye."
Back in Skunk City, however, longtime residents like Patricia D. Masters are looking forward to some demolition. "I'd like to see them do it a little quicker," she said. "How long do you have to have a dead house on your street?"
 
The Other Economy
Upstate New York, a vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by. This is the fourth in a series of articles examining the region's quest for prosperity.

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES;
New Translation For 'Rififi'

BYLINE: By Dave Kehr 

 BODY:
Usually, asking a director when he first encountered Stanislavsky is not a question about a literal meeting, but Jules Dassin has a literal answer.
"The man himself? Shall I tell you? It was in 1923, when the producer Morris Guest brought the Moscow Art Theater to New York. I was a boy, and I saw this with my own eyes. John Barrymore was playing 'Hamlet' at that time, and he had heard of Stanislavsky and his great actors. And it seems he cut big chunks out of his 'Hamlet' that night to run and see some of the Moscow Art Theater. He made his entrance still dressed in his inky black Hamlet costume, and rushed up to the stage and kissed the feet of the director and the actors. I saw that!" 
 Mr. Dassin, a vigorous 89, was in New York recently to introduce the rerelease of "Rififi," the classic caper film he made in France in 1955, after the blacklist forced him to leave Hollywood. "The title comes from the North African tribe, the Rifs, who were in constant conflict," he said. "So it's all about melees and conflicts and fighting, out of which the novelist Auguste Le Breton made the word 'rififi.'
"He went on to write 'Rififi in Tokyo,' 'Rififi in San Domingo,' 'Rififi in Flatbush' and so on."
Translating 1950's underworld slang into subtitles for 2000 posed a problem for Mr. Dassin, who worked with Bruce Goldstein (whose company, Rialto Pictures, has released the film in the United States) and the journalist Lenny Borger to create a new English text.
"Breton's characters spoke a very special language, and one unknown to many parts of France outside of the Paris circle," Mr. Dassin said. "When I was given the book to read, I understood nothing of it. It was a very special argot, and I should not be surprised if he invented some of it. To know what the book was about, I had a guy read it to me who was a specialist."
Mr. Dassin, born in Middletown, Conn., and raised in the Bronx, landed in Europe after the director Edward Dmytryk named him in the hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities into Communist influence in Hollywood. Having specialized in film noir in Hollywood ("The Naked City," "Brute Force") Mr. Dassin returned to the genre for his first film in France, and it became a worldwide hit.
In 1964 he went back to the form for "Topkapi," with its famous high-wire burglary scene -- a sequence that Mr. Dassin was surprised to find re-enacted without acknowledgment in Brian De Palma's 1996 "Mission: Impossible." "That shocked me," he said. "I think it was just too literal, the same thing. I said, 'Is this allowed?' Apparently it was."
After shooting "Rififi" in Paris, Mr. Dassin discovered Greece, where he met and married the actress Melina Mercouri, who starred in his 1960 film "Never on Sunday" as well as "Topkapi." Athens remained his home after her death in 1994. "I stopped working right after my wife died, to continue on with some of the unfinished projects she undertook when she was the Greek Minister of Culture. We've created a foundation in her name. And I'm trying to get a museum built. There are wonderful educational projects in schools, with fascinating results. That's all my time now."
 
The New Zemeckis
One of the handful of Hollywood filmmakers still able to put a personal stamp on his work, Robert Zemeckis made his name with big, broad comedies like "Back to the Future" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." But since "Forrest Gump" in 1994, a more melancholic strain has appeared in his films. His last two features, "Contact" (1997) and the current "What Lies Beneath," are both about emotionally isolated women whose attempts to break through to others lead them to relationships, possibly hallucinated, with otherworldly beings.
"Someday, some scholar is going to be able to line up my movies and watch the arc of my life," Mr. Zemeckis, 48, said by telephone. "There's some thread in there about understanding the importance of being able to develop an emotional intimacy with other people, and the wall you come up against from time to time. It's usually within yourself, of course."
"What Lies Beneath" is a suspense thriller, "written in the language of Hitchcock," said Mr. Zemeckis, about an unhappy housewife (Michelle Pfeiffer) who finds that an unwelcome entity has joined her marriage with Harrison Ford.
"You begin to understand more complex characters as you build up some years," Mr. Zemeckis said. "I couldn't have made this movie 15 years ago, and I couldn't have made 'Contact.' That's why I think it's important to take these little sabbaticals in between movies. If you're not careful, just making movie after movie can isolate you too. It's a very isolating job; even though you go all over the world and you do all these things, it's a very, very unrealistic way of living."
There has been no sabbatical for Mr. Zemeckis lately. "What Lies Beneath" was made while the director was waiting for Tom Hanks to lose weight and grow a beard for his role as a plane crash survivor living on a desert island in "Cast Away," which is to be released at Christmas.
"We did the first two-thirds of 'Cast Away,' and then we stopped," the director said. "I rolled the crew onto this movie, and then rolled them back on to the end of 'Cast Away,' which is the only way I could have done it, because no one except David Lean could stop the camera for 30 days. No one can afford to do that, so I had to figure out an economical way, and one way was to make a whole other movie."
For Mr. Zemeckis, "Cutting for comedy and cutting for jolts is the same. It's all timing, which ultimately comes down to individual frames. It's exactly like leading the audience to the punch line. You can literally be off by half a second and it won't be as effective."
 
An Iranian's Themes
Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed Iranian film "The Wind Will Carry Us" opens in New York today (review, Page 7) accompanied by "Kiarostami 101," an instructive 20-minute short assembled by the film scholar Jamsheed Akrami. With brevity and wit, the short sketches out the characteristic themes and images of Mr. Kiarostami's work, which many critics place among the most beautiful being produced today.
Mr. Akrami, who is an associate professor of film at William Paterson University, first wrote about Mr. Kiarostami's work in the early 70's, when the director was making films for Kanun, the Iranian government's Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents. Then came the revolution, and Mr. Akrami found a six-month visit to the United States turning into a 22-year stay.
There's more where these 20 minutes came from. "When I interviewed Abbas," Mr. Akrami said, "I shot six hours of video, and we only talked about his first two films. There's a lot more to cover."

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the "At the Movies" column in Weekend on Friday about "Kiarostami 101," a short by the film scholar Jamsheed Akrami about the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, misstated plans for it. Mr. Akrami is expanding the short; it is not being shown with Mr. Kia rostami's new film, "The Wind Will Carry Us," at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Resisting Gentrification

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 22 news article about gentrification in Park Slope, Brooklyn, humanized a complex issue that is affecting many low-income communities of color across the country. Effective solutions exist to enable residents in danger of displacement to stay in their neighborhoods and take part in the economic benefits of revitalization.
An emerging approach called equitable development emphasizes the positive effect of mixed-income communities, and helps residents to have a voice in decision-making and to acquire the skills and resources needed to stay anchored in their neighborhoods. 
 Longtime residents are afforded the opportunity to buy homes, gain jobs at a living wage, and build community-based businesses. This approach is essential to maintaining the diversity and vitality of American communities.

HEADLINE: Chief Is Selected For the Rebuilding Of Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Lincoln Center has named Rebecca Robertson, a city planner who led the government effort to redevelop West 42nd Street, to be the field marshal in its $1.5 billion rebuilding project.
The appointment, confirmed yesterday, is part of a new management plan to oversee and finance the redevelopment project, by far the largest in the center's four-decade history. 
 The actions were detailed by Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in a telephone interview after word of Ms. Robertson's appointment began circulating informally.
She said construction could start in two years and would take until 2010 to complete, upsetting many performing schedules as it proceeds.
"We are moving ahead quite steadily," Ms. Sills said.
As outlined in December in a consultant's study, the projected work -- new structures, rooftop additions, skyboxes and widespread repairs -- is likely to cost more in adjusted dollars than the original Lincoln Center, the world's biggest and busiest performing arts presenter. The city has committed $96 million to the project, but the bulk of the money remains to be raised. Difficult questions also remain about how to reschedule performances around the construction work.
Ms. Robertson, now vice president for real estate and special projects at the Shubert Organization, said in an interview yesterday that she would begin work part time at Lincoln Center on Aug. 7 and full time in mid-September, "supervising the master-planning of the complex, its vision and implementation." She is to report to a new renovation committee under a vice chairman of Lincoln Center, Marshall Rose, a leading real estate developer.
That panel, in turn, is answerable to a new Project Leadership Committee composed of the chairmen and artistic directors of the center's 12 resident arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet and Opera.
The chairwoman of the leadership committee, which first met on Jan. 31, is Ms. Sills, who is also supervising the search for a new president of Lincoln Center to replace Nathan Leventhal, who is leaving on Dec. 31 after 17 years. The panel met most recently on Thursday, when Ms. Robertson was introduced.
Ms. Robertson will be the executive director of the reconstruction committee, and a second committee will supervise fund-raising for the project. Its co-chairmen will probably be four major money-raisers, but they have not been appointed.
Ms. Robertson, 50, described the Lincoln Center project as "the great urban renewal project of New York City."
She said she envisaged the job's taking easily as long as the decade she spent on the overhaul of 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. For the last seven years of her tenure, which ended in 1997, she was president of the 42nd Street Development Project Inc. The state-chartered entity attracted Disney, Livent, Forest City Ratner and other entertainment and redevelopment companies as replacements for evicted sex storefronts and X-rated movie houses.
Before that Ms. Robertson, who was born in Canada, worked in planning and development in Toronto and Caracas and in the New York City Planning Department. She joined the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner, in 1997 and, among other projects, helped develop the new 499-seat Shubert theater being built on Theater Row on West 42nd Street.
Ms. Sills said that the leadership committee was intended to reassure Lincoln Center's constituent groups that they would have a central say in the rebuilding.
The scope of the project covering the 18 acres Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues and 62nd and 66th Streets has not been determined. In its three-inch-thick report to the board last December, the Manhattan architectural firm Beyer, Blinder & Belle laid out a range of needs, from repairs to the cracked plaza paving blocks and deteriorating travertine cladding on the buildings to additional rehearsal, performing and reception space.
In particular, the study says, the options included rooftop additions and skyboxes for Avery Fisher Hall, where the Philharmonic performs, another rooftop addition for the Juilliard School, a loft for Alice Tully Hall, new space for the New York State Theater, an expanded lobby and museum for the Metropolitan Opera, a new central visitors' center and ticket office and a new administrative building in Damrosch Park.
Last December some Lincoln Center executives described some items as part of a wish list that was to be fulfilled.
Ms. Sills said yesterday that the cost might grow beyond $1.5 billion. "At first we thought a lot of it was just wish list," she said. "I do not think it's a wish list any more."

HEADLINE: A Spike in Electricity Prices Sets Off Debate in California

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 28

 BODY:
With electricity prices soaring in San Diego, and consumer anger rising even faster, California politicians are backing away from the state's ambitious plan to deregulate its power industry fully by 2002.
The fight in California, which four years ago led what has become a national movement to deregulate the electric industry, is likely to presage a debate across the country over whether deregulation is working, politicians here say. 
 "It's a nationwide problem," said State Senator Steve Peace, a San Diego Democrat who helped write the deregulation legislation but is now calling for some government controls on prices.
High demand and tight supplies have given too much market power to a few generators and power marketers, causing prices to spike unreasonably, Mr. Peace said.
"The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and stable enough to address its problem," he said, "or, inevitably, whether it's the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political system will cut them off at the pass."
That view gained momentum on Thursday, when Gov. Gray Davis asked the federal government to impose controls on the wholesale price of electricity across the West. Residential consumers and businesses need relief from price spikes that caused the average monthly electric bill in San Diego to more than double in June, the governor said.
"When California deregulated the electricity market in 1996," Mr. Davis said, "consumers were promised that competition in the marketplace would be mature enough to ensure stable, if not reduced, prices. That is clearly not the case in California."
Big swings in the wholesale price of electricity are not unusual in the summer, when high demand taxes generators' ability to supply power. In New England, the wholesale cost of power reached more than 100 times its usual level for a few hours during an unexpected heat wave this May. But because of regulation, consumers and businesses have always been insulated from the swings, paying one price for electricity year-round, regardless of its true cost.
Now, as California makes the complex transition from a regulated to a competitive market, San Diego has become the first market in the nation where consumers must pay retail prices that move with the true wholesale price as it changes from month to month. And they are not happy.
"San Diego in many ways is the poster child for how not to do deregulation," said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 42,000-member group based in San Diego, where the average monthly residential bill rose in June to more than $100, from about $50.
But power companies and many economists argue that price controls are a misguided and shortsighted measure that will only increase the risk of blackouts in both the short run and the long. Price caps failed on both natural gas and gasoline, and they will fail on electricity, said William Hogan, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who has studied deregulation and worked as a consultant for utilities.
"We used to have lots of shortages of natural gas; now we have lots of natural gas," Professor Hogan said. "The reason we had shortages is we had price controls. That's what electricity is facing now."
Nationally, independent power generators are moving quickly to add new plants to bring supply and demand back into line, said Jeffrey K. Skilling, president of the Enron Corporation, a Houston company that is the world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas.
"Let the market do its thing," Mr. Skilling said. "The system is tight around the country, but there's been an enormous supply response."

U.S. Seeks W.T.O. Talks On Mexican Phone Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Just weeks before Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, is scheduled to make his first visit to Washington to discuss commercial relations with the United States, the Clinton Administration took the first steps yesterday toward filing a formal complaint against Mexico for failing to ensure open competition in its $12 billion telecommunications market.
As she had warned several times since April, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, is asking the World Trade Organization to hold formal consultations between the United States and Mexico on the way Mexico supervises its recently deregulated telecommunications industry. 
 Several American corporations, including AT&T and WorldCom, have invested millions in Mexico since deregulation began in the mid-1990's. They have complained for the last year that they have been stymied by the actions of Telefonos de Mexico, the dominant carrier, and by weak-kneed Mexican regulators who have failed to stand up to the company, known as Telmex.
AT&T, along with Mexican partners, owns Alestra, a long-distance company. WorldCom owns a controlling share of Avantel, another long-distance company, also with Mexican associates.
The trade representative accuses Telmex of several anticompetitive actions. The United States contends that Telmex overcharges to connect local calls to the long-distance networks, applies unfair fees for incoming international long-distance phone calls, and denies competitors the high-traffic lines they need for Internet service.
Telecommunications regulators are accused of failing to properly enforce deregulation commitments that Mexico agreed to in 1998.
The issue has become a sore point in commercial relations between the United States and Mexico, its second-largest trading partner, giving rise to harsh statements in a field usually noted for diplomatic restraint.
"Clearly, the regulatory system in Mexico is entirely broken," Ms. Barshefsky said in a conference call with reporters yesterday morning. She said she had little faith that Mexican officials in the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo would keep promises to resolve the regulatory issues before Mr. Fox is inaugurated on Dec. 1.
"We've heard that song before," she said.
In Mexico, Jorge Nicolin, president of the Federal Telecommunications Commission, said that the trade representative's complaint was "unfounded and not substantiated." He said he was confident Mexico would successfully defend its position.
"We've met with U.S.T.R. three times already this year and as we explain at every step, it is because we have competition in Mexico that we have these problems," he said.
By Mr. Nicolin's count, 12 competing long-distance carriers operate in Mexico, along with 7 local carriers. He acknowledged that competitive problems exist, but said that formulation of new regulations to promote competition had been delayed by legal challenges from Telmex and other telephone companies. They should be ready by the end of October, he added.
A Telmex spokesman, Arturo Elias Ayub, refuted the trade representative's claim that Telmex had actually increased its share of the long-distance market to 81 percent from 74 percent three years ago. "We wish it were that high," he said, contending that Telmex handled no more than 60 percent.
If no settlement is reached within 60 days after the World Trade Organization consultations begin, Ms. Barshefsky said the United States would file a formal complaint before the W.T.O.

Stocks Take a Daily Hit, and the Nasdaq Gets a Downright Beating for the Week

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday as a report of unexpectedly strong economic growth increased the threat of another Federal Reserve interest rate increase.
The Nasdaq composite index plunged 4.7 percent, finishing the week off 10.5 percent, its third worst week ever. Its technology stocks have been under pressure for more than a week because of concerns about weaker corporate earnings in the second half of the year. And that concern has begun to spread, adding to the selling pressure yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent. 
 But interest rates rose only slightly, probably because inflation remained in check despite the strong second-quarter growth.
A strong economy is usually positive for stocks because growth is good for corporate earnings. But at a time when the nation's central bank has pledged to slow the economy's growth to a noninflationary pace, the 5.2 percent second-quarter surge in the gross domestic product that the Commerce Department reported yesterday was read as a negative.
The jolt from the report was intensified by two factors. One was the surprise. Most economists had been expecting the economy to slow to a pace of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent, from over 5 percent in the first quarter. "Signs of a slowing economy are hard to find in this latest batch of numbers," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
In addition, many investors had begun to think that the Fed might be finished with its interest rate increases, after pushing up its benchmark federal funds rate six times, to 6.5 percent, since June 1999. The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, may have inadvertently re-enforced this view when he outlined the reasons he believed growth was slowing when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee July 20.
But another rate increase is still not a certainty, some analysts argued. This is because the data yesterday also reflected several positive trends: a slowdown in consumer spending, contained inflationary pressures and strong business investment that could lead to even higher worker productivity.
It has been the surprising increase in worker productivity the last several years that has allowed the economy, which is now in its longest expansion on record, to grow briskly without a surge in inflation. And Mr. Greenspan indicated in his recent testimony that if these positive trends continued, a rate increase might be avoided.
So the path between now and the Fed's policy-making meeting Aug. 22 could be bumpy. The data for July, which will be released between now and then, including that on jobs, retail sales and consumer inflation, will probably determine what the Fed does, a point that Mr. Greenspan made in his appearance before Congress on Tuesday.
"If the consumer looks like he is ramping up again, then that is a threat," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
Mr. Glassman thinks the pace of consumer spending is slowing, in part because higher oil and gasoline prices are cutting into income and in part because some big companies are worried about sales slowing in the second half of the year. But yesterday's data, along with the June jumps in existing-home sales and orders for durable goods and the July increase in consumer confidence, do give him pause. Even so, he is still not predicting a rate increase in August.
William Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, thinks consumer spending has not slowed significantly. Instead, he argued that the 3 percent growth in spending in the second quarter, down from 7.7 percent in the first quarter, was just a pause. The key for Fed policy makers and investors, he said, "is why did the consumer pull back in the second quarter and will it continue."
He expects another interest rate increase in August. "This idea that the Fed is done with tightening is premature because the economy has more momentum than people think," Mr. Dudley said.
Only a small rally in the last minutes of trading prevented all three major stock indexes from ending at their lows for the day. The Nasdaq composite index fell 179.23 points, to 3,663.00, led lower by Cisco Systems, JDS Uniphase and Intel. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes many of the same big technology stocks that pulled down the Nasdaq, dropped 29.73 points, or 2.05 percent, to 1,419.89. The Dow, which has a lighter load of technology stocks, dropped 74.96 points, to 10,511.17. The Dow was led lower by declines at American Express and J. P. Morgan & Company.
For the week, the Dow was down 2.1 percent, while the S.& P. was off 4.1 percent. For the year, all three indexes are down, with the Nasdaq off 10 percent, the Dow down 8.6 percent and the S.& P. slipping 3.4 percent.
Despite yesterday's selling, the stock of Corvis, a maker of equipment for fiber optic cables, more than doubled on its first day of trading. The stock jumped 48 23/32, to 84 23/32, although the company has yet to show any revenue.
In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed as one measure of inflation in the gross domestic price data showed price increases falling to a rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter from 3.3 percent in the first. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.03 percent, from 6.00 percent on Thursday. The note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 8/32, to 1031 2/32.
The confusion among investors about what the Fed might do is understandable because the central bank's job is not just to slow the pace of economic growth. Instead, policy makers want to slow growth to a noninflationary pace. But as they are trying to do this, the acceptable noninflationary speed limit for growth is rising because of stronger worker productivity. The Fed's speed limit has already jumped from around 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the early 1990's to 3.5 percent to 4 percent now. And who knows whether it will move higher.
"If people are disoriented, it certainly makes sense," Mr. Glassman said. "We are not used to this type of growth."

Breaking The Silence

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
Imagine a country, a democracy, with a domestic program that is increasingly costly and socially disruptive. The problem it is supposed to solve has actually grown worse over the years -- but neither major political party will talk about changing the policy.
That is a picture of the United States and its drug policy. By any rational test the war on drugs, with its use of the criminal law and harsh sentences to solve the problem, is a costly failure. The number of Americans in prison for drug offenses has multiplied by 10 since 1980, from 41,000 to 458,000. But drugs are more available than ever, and more young people are using them. 
 In the face of this political and social disaster the Republican and Democratic parties offer: silence. Their leaders are evidently afraid that even discussing different approaches might get them labeled as soft on drugs.
But the silence is about to be broken. In tandem with the Republican National Convention starting Monday in Philadelphia, and later with the Democrats, there will be shadow conventions that discuss the failed war on drugs and two other issues that the major parties have not solved: campaign finance and the gap between rich and poor.
Senator John McCain and other politicians brave enough to break with their parties' wishes will participate. Senator McCain will be the keynote speaker tomorrow, talking about the idea that makes him anathema to so many other Republicans: ending the scandal of campaign money and influence.
The shadow conventions are the brainchild of Arianna Huffington, the columnist and gadfly. She has moved from the political right toward the left -- or perhaps to a position of dislike for all evasive politicians. The shadow conventions will have participants from all camps.
Representative Tom Campbell of California, the Republican candidate for Senate against the incumbent Dianne Feinstein, will talk about the failed drug war. So will another Republican brave enough to challenge the policy, Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Walter Cronkite, the greatly respected former broadcast newsman, has made a 10-minute video special for the shadow convention on the cost of the drug war.
The staggering figure mentioned above -- that 10 times as many Americans are in prison for drug offenses today as in 1980 -- comes from the Justice Policy Institute in Washington. It has just issued a report that shows, in fresh ways, some consequences of the war on drugs.
The 458,000 men and women now in U.S. prisons on drug charges are 100,000 more than all prisoners in the European Union, whose population is 100 million more than ours. The annual cost of incarcerating them is $9 billion.
Nearly 80 percent of drug arrests in 1997, the most recent year for which figures are available, were for possession. Of those, 44 percent were for possession of marijuana.
Blacks are overwhelmingly more likely than whites to be imprisoned for drug offenses, a study by Human Rights Watch showed. Just 13 percent of regular drug users in this country are black, but 62.7 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison are black. Evidently juries and judges treat offenders less seriously if they are white.
The Justice Policy Institute report found that in 1986, 31 out of every 100,000 young people in America were put in state prisons for drug offenses. By 1996 the figure had nearly quadrupled, to 122 per 100,000.
The institute studied states with higher rates of imprisonment for drug offenses to see whether that had a deterrent effect. It found, to the contrary, that states with higher incarceration rates also had higher rates of drug use.
There are already signs around the country of unease with the human cost and practical failure of our drug policy. Perhaps the shadow conventions will move more political leaders to face the reality recently stated by The Economist of London: "That misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars, cost billions, encouraged crime and spread corruption while failing completely to reduce drug abuse."
Ralph Nader has chided me for saying that he has paid little or no attention as a candidate to the civil liberties record of the major parties. In fact he has called the Clinton administration's record "abysmal."

HEADLINE: Economy Grew at a Robust 5.2% Rate in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Despite a pullback in consumer spending, the American economy grew at a surprisingly robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
A widely expected slowdown failed to materialize. In fact, the economy actually grew faster in the second quarter than in the first. But for all its strength, the second quarter offered just enough signs of weakness to raise doubts about the future of the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. 
 Business investment, particularly in computers and software, sustained the growth, and so did corporate willingness to churn out consumer merchandise, although consumer sales weakened. Goods piling up unsold in warehouses and stores accounted for nearly a percentage point of the 5.2 percent growth.
A surge in federal government spending, mainly for the military and for the now largely completed 2000 Census, added nearly another percentage point to the growth of the gross domestic product, which is the value of all new goods and services.
But the economy's future path is in the hands of consumers, whose spending accounts for most of the now $9 trillion economy.
"The real question is what happens next to consumer demand; will it rebound," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "My guess is that it will." Wall Street seemed to agree that economic growth in the second half of the year would remain well above the 4 percent level. That is the maximum growth rate that the economy can sustain, in the Federal Reserve's view, before shortages of goods and services appear and prices rise. Stock prices fell in expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates again to slow the economy, if not at its next policy-making meeting on Aug. 22, then later on. Higher rates encourage investors to shift their money from stocks into interest-bearing securities.
The Commerce Department also issued a revision yesterday of economic growth rates going back to the fourth quarter of 1996. The average quarterly growth rate since then was nudged up to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent. The revisions helped President Clinton to declare that economic growth since he took office in 1993 has averaged 4 percent a year, "the best growth America has had since the Kennedy-Johnson years."
There were big revisions for last year's fourth quarter and this year's first quarter, mostly because of inventory swings. Stockpiles swelled in the fourth, particularly stockpiles of farm produce, and as a result the growth rate was revised to 8.3 percent from 7.3 percent. In the first quarter, however, inventories were drawn down, and growth was reduced to a 4.8 percent annual rate, instead of the originally reported 5.5 percent.
An upward revision in business investment also played a role in swelling economic growth in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, however, investment in new equipment and software turned out to be weaker than originally reported, partly because of a strike at the Boeing Company, which reduced aircraft production.
Business held up its end handsomely in the second quarter. There was robust spending for equipment, software, office buildings, warehouses and other commercial buildings. And the federal government raised its spending by nearly 18 percent in the second quarter, after a fall of 14 percent in the first quarter.
Some of that swing reflected quirks in government accounting, but the Commerce Department reported a significant increase in military spending, not for new weaponry but for various support functions, including research, weapons repair and personnel services.
Rising investment holds out the hope of rising productivity. The new equipment, in effect, helps workers increase their output and their employers' revenue. The additional revenue is then available to feed profits or raise wages, or both, without an increase in prices. Labor costs, in fact, rose at a fairly mild 4.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- edging up from last year's rate of increase, but unchanged from the first quarter, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.
Inflation has also risen slowly. The gross domestic product report includes a price measure that is far broader than the Consumer Price Index, covering almost every price change in the economy. This price measure showed inflation rising at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter. While that rate was higher than last year's levels, partly because of gasoline prices, it declined from a rate of 3.3 percent during the first quarter.
The consumers, however, will determine the pace of economic growth in the future, and the second-quarter gross domestic product report suggests they are pulling back. Consumer spending in the second quarter increased at a rate of only 3 percent, or less than half the 7.6 percent growth rate registered for the first quarter.
"Consumer spending slowed for basically everything, but the really big slowdown was in motor vehicle sales," said Brent Moulton, associate director of national economic accounts in the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Department.
As a result, inventories of unsold goods built up at almost double the pace in the first quarter, with most of the increase in motor vehicles parked in dealers' back lots. The auto buildup almost certainly will result in a production slowdown until the inventories are worked down, said Wynn Van Bussman, corporate economist at the DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
"What you will probably see is a delay or a cutback in the production of new models," he said.

HEADLINE: Albright Meets North Korean but Learns Little About Missile Plans

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 28

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright held talks today with North Korea's foreign minister, and said that although the meeting was friendly, she learned little about the country's reported intentions to curb its missile program.
"My meeting with Foreign Minister Paek constitutes a substantively modest but symbolically historic step away from the sterility and hostility of the past," Dr. Albright said. 
 The meeting ran nearly an hour over the allotted 20 minutes.
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun gave Dr. Albright no details of an offer made recently by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, to transform the North's missile program into peaceful efforts to launch satellites into space.
"I was direct in stating American concerns about the missile threat, nuclear weapons-related activity," Dr. Albright said.
Despite Mr. Kim's reaffirmation last month of a moratorium on long-range missile launchings, his missile program has leaders on both sides of the Pacific jittery.
A missile test over Japan in 1998 awakened the world to North Korea's growing prowess in long-range missiles and spurred the United States' drive to develop a national missile defense. The United States still has 37,000 troops in South Korea.
American officials have suggested that North Korea should be allowed to launch satellites only from neutral nations and should be prevented from obtaining technology that could improve its missiles.
Still, both nations said today's meeting -- the highest-level talks between the United States and North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War -- contributed to the thaw on the Korean peninsula, which began with last month's summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas.
"I remain realistic in expectations and fully committed to coordination with our allies," Dr. Albright said. "I'm also somewhat more hopeful than before for the long-term stability on the Korean peninsula and throughout the region."
North Korea issued a statement saying the two sides had conducted "serious deliberations on the ways to normalize and expand" relations and agreed that recent developments led to a "positive atmosphere."
Before the talks, Mr. Paek was asked about news reports that North Korea would send a high-level delegation to Washington to discuss improving ties.
The Americans have been seeking such an encounter, Mr. Paek said, "but the atmosphere is not ripe yet."
North Korea first wants the United States to end economic sanctions and remove it from the list of nations accused of sponsoring terrorism.
New Zealand, meanwhile, agreed today to normalize relations with North Korea, becoming the second nation, after Canada, to announce diplomatic relations with the Communist state this week.
New Zealand's foreign minister, Philip Goff, said Mr. Paek had reiterated North Korea's denial that it has nuclear weapons but had told him that it was "no secret" that missile systems had been developed.
"His response was also that this must be expected from North Korea, given the fact that other countries also have missiles trained on his country," Mr. Goff said.

HEADLINE: Germans Say Nine Wounded By Bomb Were Immigrants

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 28

 BODY:
The nine people wounded by a bomb on Thursday in Dusseldorf are immigrants, with six of them Jews, the police and prosecutors said today.
Johannes Mocken, a spokesman for state prosecutors in the western city, said the victims had just left their daily German class at a language school when the bomb exploded on a metal footbridge leading to a commuter station. "We cannot exclude that somebody purposefully intended to kill members of this group," Mr. Mocken said. 
 Interior Minister Otto Schily said it was reasonable to assume that the attack had a racist motive.
The leader of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Paul Spiegel, said: "I don't want to create any hysteria. But the fact is most of the victims were Jewish, and it appears that they passed on the same route from school every day."
The number of Jews in Germany has been growing rapidly over the last decade, bolstered by waves of immigrants from the former Soviet Union drawn here by the relative ease of obtaining residence papers and generous financial aid. The country has 85,000 registered Jews compared with 29,000 at the beginning of the 1990's.
A bombing against those immigrants would be a blow to Germany's international image and a worrying indication that the extreme right is becoming bolder and more organized.
But no organization, rightist or other, has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The police said all possible motives, including reports of a feud among the immigrants, remained under examination.
One of the wounded, identified by the police only as Tatyana, 26, was 6 months pregnant. The unborn child was killed when shrapnel pierced her stomach. Her condition, and that of her husband, Michael, 28, were listed as critical. Two other people were listed in serious condition.
The immigrants came from Azerbaijan, Russia and Ukraine, the police said. Their German lessons were part of the government's aid for immigrants, and the group was about to board a train to nearby Solingen, where five Turkish women and girls were killed in 1993 in a racist firebombing.
Anti-immigrant violence has steadily risen in Germany in the 1990's, spurred by high unemployment, frustration among idle youths and well-organized, if marginal, neo-Nazi movements.
Last month, a 39-year-old black immigrant from Mozambique was beaten to death by neo-Nazi skinheads in the eastern town of Dessau, and the police dismantled what they described as a highly organized and heavily armed rightist youth group near Dresden, finding grenades, ignition devices and parts of rockets.
The openness to Jewish immigration is rooted in a deep-seated political conviction that the Holocaust makes any other policy unthinkable, as well as a calculation that such receptiveness is generally good for Germany as it asserts its growing economic power, particularly in the United States.
But protracted recent negotiations over compensation for Nazi-era slave and forced laborers showed a growing, if still rarely expressed, impatience with what is sometimes described as "Jewish blackmail." In October, more than 100 headstones in Europe's largest Jewish cemetery, in Berlin, were smashed or overturned.
Dusseldorf has been a major center of Jewish immigration. Michael Szentei-Heife, leader of the branch of the Jewish council there, said 6,300 Jews lived in the area, with 5,100 being recent Russian emigres. Their move stems from a decision to accept Jews from the former Soviet Union by Helmut Kohl, who was then the chancellor, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell.
But that decision was never the subject of a parliamentary vote or national debate, and the public view of the de facto rebuilding of a German Jewish community all but extinguished by Hitler remains unclear.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said this week that anti-immigrant violence by rightist groups had reached unacceptable levels.

HEADLINE: Nortel Agrees to Buy Alteon For $7.8 Billion in Stock

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
The Nortel Networks Corporation of Canada continued its push to become a major developer of Internet systems yesterday as it announced that it had agreed to acquire Alteon WebSystems Inc. for $7.8 billion in stock.
Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., makes equipment that allows Internet servers -- the computers that hold information on the Web -- to perform more efficiently. Alteon's gear splits up requests for Internet information among a company's individual servers, allowing the servers to perform at their best, and can spare those servers the electronic burden of performing routine tasks like encryption. 
 As big communications carriers try to offer a full package of Internet services, equipment like Alteon's can allow them to maximize the value of the Web servers they already have and to offer more finely tailored services to their corporate customers.
The value of such a product is reflected in the move by Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet equipment, to acquire Alteon's main competitor, ArrowPoint Communications, based in Acton, Mass., for $5.7 billion in May. At the time, that deal was seen by some communications analysts as a negative for Alteon. With Cisco's acquisition of ArrowPoint, the argument went, it would be tougher for Alteon to sell itself.
Clearly, it was not that tough. North America's Big Three makers of communications equipment, Cisco, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel, are engaged in a furious battle to dominate the market for the next generation of communications technology, and the sort of gear Alteon makes fits that bill perfectly.
For the next few years, there will probably be three major "sweet spots" in the communications equipment business. One is in the sale to communications carriers of wireless systems that can transport Internet data. Another is in the sale to communications carriers of optical systems that can transmit billions of bits of information in ways that are both flexible and robust. (Earlier this week Nortel ended discussions to combine its optical components unit with that of Corning Inc.) And the third is in the sale to carriers of advanced data networking equipment.
Alteon fits into the third category, one that Cisco, Lucent and Nortel are approaching from different directions.
Cisco's roots are in the sale of data communications equipment to corporate customers for office networks. Now that the corporate market is largely mature, Cisco is furiously trying to reinvent itself as a vendor to big international communications carriers, whose technical requirements are far more complex and stringent than those of everyday corporations. In Cisco's favor, however, is its legacy of experience with data communications systems.
Lucent and Nortel have the opposite problem. For decades, those two companies have been meeting the requirements of the world's biggest carriers, but mostly by providing systems for voice telephone calls. Only over the last few years have Lucent and Nortel made significant strides in data networking.
A company like Alteon can jump-start that effort, not least because it already has significant customers and partners, including Akamai Technologies Inc., which helps transmit electronic "content" on the Web. Unlike many of the start-up optical communications companies that are being snapped up these days for billions of dollars, Alteon has revenue, $110 million in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June.
"In the new economy, the value and richness of content across the Internet is increasing on a massive scale," Clarence Chandran, Nortel's chief operating officer and heir apparent to John A. Roth, Nortel's chief executive, said in a statement. "Our acquisition of Alteon WebSystems will accelerate the delivery of an Internet data center capable of moving content seamlessly and rapidly."
Dominic Orr, Alteon's chief executive, said in a statement, "Alteon WebSystems and Nortel Networks share a common vision of high-performance content delivery services that exploit the high-performance Internet and create new profit opportunities for service providers."
The Alteon deal is Nortel's biggest acquisition since it agreed to acquire Bay Networks Inc. for $9.1 billion in 1998. Under yesterday's agreement, Alteon stockholders are to receive 1.83148 shares of Nortel for each of their Alteon shares. Based on Nortel's closing price Thursday of $78.625, the deal is worth $144 for each Alteon share, $1 more than Alteon's closing price Thursday.
Yesterday, shares of Nortel fell $5.125, to $73, amid a broad stock market sell-off. Shares of Alteon closed at $129, down $14.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Russians Want Beauty With Scent of Home

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 28

 BODY:
When Russia began picking apart its economy in 1992, Oleg Nasobin spotted an opportunity. After 70 years of Soviet deficits, his country was brimming with pent-up demand for lipstick, face creams and body lotion. It was a business opportunity he could take up only by leaving.
That year, Mr. Nasobin packed his family off to Prague. He was looking to build a business on safe ground, away from the constantly shifting turf of Russia's early days of capitalism. He also was leaving his home -- the place that would later make him a wealthy man. 
 "We left carrying two suitcases," said Mr. Nasobin, a 33-year-old former peddler of ginseng. "It was a very grim situation in Russia in those days -- no personal prospects in sight."
Now his company, Green Mama, is one of Russia's top five cosmetics producers. Since starting the company in the Czech Republic in 1996, Mr. Nasobin and his wife, Irina, have expanded sales to 36 countries including the United States and Canada, and employ about 500 people. They later moved the factory to France and two years ago began some production in Russia. The pair hit upon a winning recipe: homegrown extracts with a made-in-France label that increased allure in a market still curious about foreign goods.
Imports flooded Russia's cosmetics market after the fall of Communism in 1991. Kiosks were crammed with deodorant, face cream and shampoo with brightly colored English labels. Local residents, starved for foreign brands, snapped up everything from detergent to candy bars.
But locally produced cosmetics have made a comeback since the country's 1998 currency devaluation. The weaker ruble drove up the price of imports, which became too expensive for locals to afford. Domestic car sales boomed while some foreign food and beverage makers were pushed out of the market altogether. Advertising on city billboards, television and radio changed from flashy foreign images to familiar designs and scenes.
Russian-made cosmetics are especially popular outside of Moscow in Russia's vast regions, where average salaries are much lower. Last year, Russian-made shampoo in the regions held 39 percent of the market, up from 17 percent in 1998, according to ACNielsen, an international market research firm. Local face-care products -- one of Green Mama's biggest sellers -- rose to 83 percent of the market outside Moscow last year, from 68 percent the previous year, according to the researcher. Locals' market share was lower in Moscow where imports still dominate.
Mr. Nasobin's treasure is face cream, body lotion and shampoo. The plastic tubes and bottles are dotted with sketches of flowers, plants and berries and are named Taiga Formula after the vast forests of central and northern Siberia. Extract of sea buckthorn, a bright yellow Siberian berry, colors a new face cream. Ribwort, a Russian roadside weed, makes face masks green. A new line of larch sap lipstick has just been released.
The familiar ingredients are appreciated by Russian buyers, who over the last decade have had their fill of foreign-made products they say are packaged alluringly but just do not measure up to Russian items. Even before the ruble's collapse drove up prices on imports, buyers had already begun to turn away from many foreign products, seeking familiar brands of ice cream, soap and hand lotion. Green Mama, though made mostly in foreign factories, plays on that nostalgia.
"I like the way it smells," said Valentina Surkova, a 43-year-old accountant who grew up in eastern Siberia and now lives in Moscow. "Sea buckthorn berries -- this is my childhood."
Competition is intense, as local producers scramble to find a niche in the market space that has been created by the currency devaluation's impact on imports. Green Mama ranks third and fourth among local sellers of face-care and body-care products, its biggest selling items, according to Nielsen. However, sales are far below its biggest domestic competitor, Kalina, a company based in the Ural Mountains. Large foreign companies, like Beiersdorf of Germany, maker of Nivea cream; Proctor & Gamble; and L'Oreal occupy about half the market, according to the Russian Perfume and Cosmetics Association. The association, a group of about 60 local producers, was formed five years ago to monitor trends in Russia's cosmetics industry.
Russian women like to preen. Beauty care product sales this year will exceed $3.5 billion, according to the Perfume and Cosmetics Association. That is up from $3.2 billion last year, and includes sales of major foreign producers.
After decades of fitting the image of a factory worker dressed in a shapeless smock and head scarf, women these days meticulously accentuate their femininity. A traveler to Moscow today would be hard pressed to spot unlaquered fingernails or bare lips in a crowd.
Mr. Nasobin said he did not believe in marketing. He avoids expensive national advertisements and gets the word out mainly through local newspapers, radio and television. But the lack of aggressive advertising also has helped limit Green Mama's share of the market. Its annual sales total about $20 million, compared with the $90 million in sales by Kalina, which also sells household cleaning supplies produced at its factory in the Siberian city of Omsk.
The son of a schoolteacher, Mr. Nasobin grew up in Yekaterinburg, the town in the Ural Mountains where former President Boris N. Yeltsin rose to fame. In the late 1980's he made his first forays into capitalism in the eastern port city of Vladivostok, where he bought Chinese ginseng from local traders. His wife and two small children live in France, but his parents and extended family have stayed in Russia.
The Russian-foreign duality that has helped shape Mr. Nasobin's personal story is also reflected in his attitude about the future of his business.
Though foreign countries helped Mr. Nasobin prosper, they also have crimped his company's development, he said in an interview in his central Moscow office, wedged between a cigarette factory and a Soviet-era clock maker.
Green Mama, named for a drawing Mr. Nasobin's son made of his wife dressed to go out in green jewelry, has received unfair treatment simply because it is Russian, Mr. Nasobin said. Last year, foreign banks closed his company's accounts without explanation after United States authorities began investigating charges of Russian money laundering through the Bank of New York, though the company was not linked to the inquiry. As the investigation gathered momentum, banks tightened security for Russian companies and citizens.
"We brought our business to its feet abroad -- if we had been based inside Russia this whole time, we would never have been able to do the same thing," he said. Still, he said, "there's a bad image of Russians abroad," adding, "I often have to explain that I also eat with a fork and knife."
Nor has he been able to persuade a foreign bank to give him a loan. He diverts a small amount from profit each year to help the business grow. That makes expansion slow, though he said he would prefer a bank loan to a partner.
Next year, Mr. Nasobin said, he plans to expand Russian operations, which now pump out only the simplest of products, shampoo. The French factory is set to buy new equipment with some of last year's savings, and the Russian factory will inherit its used machinery.
More Russian production will also help cut costs. Russian workers are paid about $300 a month, while company employees in France make an average of $3,500.
Still, business in Russia has its problems. Heavy taxes weigh on profits and property rights are not always protected. Mr. Nasobin is embroiled in a struggle with local authorities in a small town near Ryazan in central Russia over a ceramics factory he has leased. He has organized Green Mama's Russian operations as a series of small companies, registered separately, in order to help insulate the business from threats of seizure in any possible property disputes.
Nor is finding supplies easy. Green Mama has an in-house furniture maker, clothing producer and a packaging plant to ensure supplies.
For now, Green Mama will remain Russian with a French address, just like Mr. Nasobin's children. But that will change, he said.
"I migrated; I didn't emigrate," he said. "We need to decide where Russia should go from here."

HEADLINE: Con Ed Runs Tests in Bid to Restart Indian Point Plant

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: BUCHANAN, N.Y., July 28

 BODY:
Despite mounting criticism of its inspection procedures, Consolidated Edison renewed its claims today that the Indian Point 2 power plant could be safely restarted with its existing steam generators and even ran heat and pressure tests in preparation for the restart.
Con Edison engineers elaborately defended their inspection procedures with charts and numbers during a five-hour public meeting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the plant site, 35 miles north of New York City. Last week, the commission sent a letter to plant managers requiring further, extensive analysis of the steam generators before it could be reopened. 
 The commission delivered another blow yesterday in a second letter that cited Con Edison's lax inspection of the steam generators in 1997 as a contributing factor in the Feb. 15 radioactive leak that shut down the plant. In that leak, a tiny amount of radioactive steam escaped after a tube carrying superheated radioactive water cracked from corrosion. No injuries were reported, but the accident was the worst in the 26-year history of the plant.
James S. Baumstark, vice president of nuclear engineering for Con Edison, said he disagreed with the nuclear commission's findings in the 1997 inspection. He also emphasized that the company had improved its methods since then to include an electronic probe that is better able to spot minute cracks in the tubes.
"We've made significant improvements in both equipment and processes," he said.
But Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials said today that they would need more time to review the company's responses and study the processes involved before making a final decision. Still, Jack R. Strosnider, director of the division of engineering at the commission, said that the Indian Point 2 plant could reopen in a matter of weeks.
"It's possible," he said. "If they provide the right engineering answers. We haven't reached a final decision at this point."
Although Con Edison officials have pledged to replace the plant's aging steam generators by the end of the year, they want to restart the existing generators to increase the company's power reserves during the hot summer months, when energy use rises. Today, workers raised the temperature of the nuclear reactor in a routine test to check for leaks or other problems. A few weeks ago, they performed a similar test after receiving permission from the nuclear commission, said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison.
In recent months, local government officials, advocacy groups and others have petitioned the nuclear commission to demand that Indian Point 2 remain closed until the new generators are installed.
State Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat from the nearby town of Ossining, was one opponent at today's public meeting. "I think it was a waste of time, money and talent to debate whether these steam generators should be allowed to run for a few months," she said. "I just don't understand why they let the engineers argue about this when they're going to change it anyway. Just get it done."
But Mr. Baumstark said it could take nine months to a year before the new generators are fully operational because of the detailed preparations involved. During that period of transition, he said, the existing generators could supply power that is currently being bought from other power companies. Since the shutdown, the company has passed on the cost of that arrangement -- about $600,000 a day -- to its utility customers.
"We're very concerned about the ability to get some reserve power on the grid," he said. "The grid's done well to this point, but we haven't had a lot of very demanding days, and we could have a backup for our customers."
But still others today raised the possibility that the most economical decision for Con Edison may be to keep the Indian Point 2 plant closed permanently.
Edward A. Smeloff, executive director of the Pace University Energy Project, said that replacing the plant's four existing steam generators would cost between $150 million and $250 million. He said that Con Edison should undertake a comparative cost analysis to determine whether it would be cheaper in the long run to keep buying energy from other companies.
Mr. Smeloff said that two power plants, one in Oregon and one in Maine, were closed by their owners in the mid-1990's because it was cheaper than replacing the costly steam generators. "So the question becomes: Can that investment be recovered in future operations of the plant through the market?" he said. "If it can't, then the plant wouldn't be economical and should be shut down."
But Con Edison officials today dismissed the idea of shutting down the plant to save money. The company is in the process of selling the power plant, which has been licensed by the nuclear commission to operate until 2013. "We believe it's less costly to have the plant running than to have to go purchase power from other sources," Mr. Clendenin said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Bush and His Rivals Touring the Same Highly Contested States

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SPRINGDALE, Ark., July 28

 BODY:
Brimming with confidence, Gov. George W. Bush flew into President Clinton's home territory today, proclaiming that he intended to contest areas that the Democrats won solidly in the last two presidential elections.
With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the northwest corner of Arkansas, Mr. Bush began a five-day march to the Republican National Convention that will take him through the highly contested states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
 In the district where a young Bill Clinton lost a race for Congress at the age of 28, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were greeted by a roaring crowd packed into a high school auditorium and chanting a football fight cheer. Dozens of children were arrayed on the stage behind them and a banner proclaimed, "Renewing America's Purpose."
Mr. Bush pointed to two local boys-made-good -- Senator Tim Hutchinson and his brother, Asa, the congressman who gained renown as one of the impeachment managers who prosecuted Mr. Clinton.
"They whispered something in my ear that made Dick Cheney and I feel really great," Mr. Bush said. "They told us we're going to carry Arkansas next fall. They told us not to worry about the last two election cycles. Something else is taking place in this state."
"It buoys my heart," he told the cheering crowd. "It buoys my spirit to know as we're working our way to Philadelphia for the national convention, and we're working our way across battleground states that the Republican ticket has not been able to carry for the last two elections."
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney took turns taking shots at the integrity and trustworthiness of the president, who was impeached, but later acquitted for his efforts to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. Neither man mentioned impeachment directly or even Mr. Clinton's name, but again and again they harked back to the Lewinsky scandal.
Mr. Cheney said he and his running mate were "on a great crusade to restore dignity and integrity to Washington." And as the crowd cheered he called Mr. Bush "the man who is going to give our kids and our grandkids a government we once again can be proud of."
Mr. Bush praised Mr. Cheney in turn, and in the process took a shot at Mr. Clinton for his effort to sidestep questions about Ms. Lewinsky. "This man is a good man," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Cheney. "He's a solid man. He's a man who understands what the definition of is is."
At one point out in the audience, someone thundered, "No more Slick Willie."
As he began his swing into the Republican convention, Mr. Bush had some good news -- two new polls showing him in the lead. Even in Arkansas, a Mason-Dixon poll just last week showed Mr. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore, 46 to 40 percent. It had a four-point margin of error.
The Democrats kept up their assault on Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as the "big oil dream ticket," and circulated a Reuters report from 1999 saying that Mr. Cheney, the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil services firm, had praised an OPEC decision to cut oil production.
Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, said that Mr. Cheney had been speaking at a conference of industry analysts and telling them of projections by economists that OPEC would cut production and that the "price situation" for the industry would improve.
"Unlike the Clinton-Gore administration, he was not caught napping about OPEC's actions," Ms. Hughes said.
From the moment he came aboard his campaign plane this morning, with his wife, Laura, Mr. Bush seemed relaxed and in good spirits. He ambled down the aisle joking with reporters and anticipating his nomination speech next Thursday.
"I'm really looking forward to this speech," Mr. Bush said. "This is going to be an unbelievably interesting moment in my life -- to walk out on that stage and to speak from my heart for however long it takes to get through the speech."
The Bush campaign has worked hard to plan a feel-good Republican convention with none of the sharp conservative edges of the past. The evening proceedings will have star turns for nonpoliticians -- a single mother, a teacher, a union member, a grandmother and granddaughter.
On Monday and Tuesday nights Mr. Bush will be beamed by satellite into the convention from places around the country. He is to arrive in Philadelphia on Wednesday morning at a Latin American music festival, symbolic of Republican efforts to reach out to Hispanics.
And on Thursday night one of the speakers welcoming him will be a Democrat, Jan Bullock, the wife of the late Lt. Gov. Ray Bullock of Texas, a Democrat who worked closely with Mr. Bush.
Even today on what was supposed to be a partisan tour, Mr. Bush tried to soften the tone. Before his rally he toured the Jones Center for Families, a community center founded by a family that ran one of the nation's largest trucking businesses.
"We're here to hear and see and feel first hand the acts of this particular platoon in the armies of compassion," Mr. Bush said.
As he took a quick tour of the center's computer operation, one of the first people to greet him was Charles A. Huffer, who tightly gripped the governor's hand and began speaking. Mr. Bush looked bewildered and brushed him off quickly.
"I told him that I thought he had a good chance to be president," Mr. Huffer, 61, said later, "and I asked him if he would be willing to finally tell the American people the truth about unidentified flying objects."

HEADLINE: A Robust Economy Raises Interest Fears

 BODY:
The American economy grew at a surprisingly robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. The news of the unexpectedly strong growth sent stocks plummeting as investors feared the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates again. The Nasdaq composite index plunged 4.7 percent, finishing the week off 10.5 percent, its third worst week. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 74.96 points, to 10,511.17, and was down 2.1 percent for the week. 
 Consumers, whose spending accounts for most of the $9 trillion economy, reduced spending in the quarter, but the federal government and businesses increased spending.

Stocks Trade in Vietnam, But Confusion Takes Over
With just two stocks, two hours and $5,000 in trades, Communist-governed Vietnam opened its first stock exchange for business and took the first faltering steps into the uncertain world of free markets.
Hopeful investors packed into the three brokerage offices taking orders for the shares to watch the market's birth on electronic boards. But curiosity and excitement quickly turned into confusion and disappointment, when minutes before the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center opened, the government imposed a ceiling on bids that invalidated many people's orders -- some of which were more than 50 percent above the government's artificially imposed prices.

HEADLINE: Bank of America to Cut Up to 6.7% of Work Force, or 10,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation announced yesterday that it would eliminate 9,000 to 10,000 jobs over the next year, or 6.7 percent of its work force, and use the savings to improve its Internet offerings, promote its brand name and improve services, especially for wealthy individuals and corporate clients.
Middle-level and senior managers are expected to be the principal targets of the job cutback, along with workers whose jobs will be erased by new technology. With these new steps, roughly 34,000 jobs will have been eliminated at the bank since September 1998, when it was created by the combination of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco. 
 Those two cities remain the primary addresses for senior executives, but a spokesman at corporate headquarters in Charlotte, Robert L. Stickler, declined yesterday to say where the cuts would be made. "They will really come across the franchise," Mr. Stickler said. The banking company now employs 150,000 people.
Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Hugh L. McColl Jr., in a statement announcing the plan, said: "Our days of growth by merger and acquisition are behind us. For the most part, our merger transition work also is behind us."
The challenge now, Mr. McColl said, is to make the bank's management structure, the product of multiple mergers over the years, more efficient.
The main interpreter of the new strategy to Wall Street yesterday was Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's president and chief operating officer. Reducing management costs without alienating customers will be something of a final exam for Mr. Lewis, 53 -- widely seen as heir apparent to Mr. McColl, 65, who is expected to retire next year.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lewis emphasized that the job cuts did not conflict with the bank's announced determination to increase customer satisfaction. In fact, he said, some of the savings would be used to identify specific customer complaints and fix them.
"For example, the bank gets a huge number of requests from customers who want a copy of their canceled checks," Mr. Lewis said. For each request, employees have to look the check up on microfilm, copy it and mail it to the customer -- a process that requires 800 people over all and still provides customers with a poor-quality copy that arrives days after the request.
By investing in new imaging technology, Mr. Lewis continued, the bank can both eliminate 800 jobs and enable customers to look up canceled checks online or even at an automated teller machine.
Mr. Lewis acknowledged that making the strategy work "is something I'm in charge of," but he said that Mr. McColl "was very supportive of what we wanted to do." He declined, however, to comment on Mr. McColl's retirement plans.
The rolling cutbacks at Bank of America will inevitably be felt in the economy of Charlotte, a city it has come to dominate, said C. W. Sealey, chairman of the finance and business law department at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. But "so long as they don't slip too far," he said, "the impact should not be too severe."
The bank spokesman, Mr. Stickler, said the company had a "competitive" severance plan to cushion job losses for management employees, who first began to hear rumors of the job cuts about two weeks ago. The bank expects to take a charge against its third-quarter earnings as high as $350 million, reflecting severance costs and other expenses in the plan.
Wall Street analysts and institutional investors seemed to take the news in stride yesterday. On a sharply lower day in the market, bank stocks were particularly weak, reflecting investor concerns that bank profits would be hurt if a strong economy prompted the Federal Reserve to again increase interest rates. Despite that, Bank of America shares were stronger than most, closing at $46.50, down 25 cents. But that is substantially below the stock's intraday high of $76.375, which it reached in July 1999.
The bank's top executives have reassured analysts that they still expect to meet their revenue and profit forecasts, said Ron Mandle, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The bank expects revenue to grow 7 to 9 percent a year, with earnings per share increasing 12 to 15 percent annually.
According to Mr. Mandle, that would allow Bank of America to meet Wall Street's profit expectations for the current year -- $5.21 a share -- and perhaps exceed them next year, when earnings are now forecast at $5.76 a share.
"They're really just changing the mix, not making absolute cuts," he added.
At the top of the bank's new to-do list is to steer an additional $70 million into "e-commerce initiatives" in the next six months and speed the introduction of Internet technology at its offices and call centers. The bank, which serves 30 million households and two million businesses, currently has 14,500 branches in 21 states and the District of Columbia.
The bank expects to reduce the number of branches by about 200 by the end of the year, Mr. Stickler said, but that entails closing 350 offices and opening 150 new branches in more promising locations.
Another element of the new strategy involves investing more in investment banking operations at home, and in Europe and Asia, to serve business customers in 190 countries. Through a previous merger, Bank of America inherited the Midwestern corporate business of Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, Mr. Mandle noted, and it continues to serve the corporate customers of the old BankAmerica and Nationsbank.
Mr. McColl and Mr. Lewis also plan to promote the bank's brand more aggressively, through increased advertising, and to cater more energetically to high-income individuals by improving asset management services and opening 10 private banking offices in wealthy areas, especially on the West Coast.

HEADLINE: Fujimori Takes Oath as Protests Blanket Area in Smoke

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 28

 BODY:
President Alberto K. Fujimori was inaugurated to a third term today as the police and demonstrators engaged in running battles that engulfed the downtown area in tear gas and smoke.
Mr. Fujimori, on his 62nd birthday, enjoyed the pomp of military marches and a special Mass. But waves of demonstrators, angered by their belief that he was elected in a fraudulent vote, tried to interrupt the proceedings, only to be turned back by police officers firing water cannon, tear gas and bullets. 
 The demonstrations were far smaller in size and more violent than organizers expected. The protesters threw rocks and sticks at the police, set bonfires at the gates of the presidential palace and vandalized several government offices. They threw homemade gasoline bombs and set fire to the building that houses the Supreme Court.
Three people were wounded by gunfire and at least six others were reported to have died in fires set today. About 100 others were injured and scores of protesters were dragged away in handcuffs.
As President Fujimori took the oath of office, opposition congressmen -- some wearing gas masks in a rebuke to the president -- jeered and walked out of the congressional chamber. But Mr. Fujimori made scant reference in his 40-minute address to the turbulence that has followed two rounds of balloting during which, international observer teams and opposition leaders have charged, there were irregularities and dirty campaign tricks perpetrated by his intelligence agency. "Many of our people are not in agreement with our program," Mr. Fujimori said. "That's democracy."
But he stopped short of asking for a reconciliation in a nation that has become increasingly polarized in the two years since Congress dismissed three judges who ruled that Mr. Fujimori was disobeying the Constitution by seeking a third five-year term.
In a speech short on rhetorical flare and delivered in a business-like fashion, he reminded Peruvians of his past successes at halting years of hyperinflation and in making peace with Ecuador. He also pledged to "fortify democracy and generate employment and well-being, with discipline, prudence and realism."
Mr. Fujimori outlined promises that he would work to improve the judicial system and reorganize the security services now that two terrorist groups have been virtually defeated. But he did not address complaints by the Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and several Latin American and European governments that he has governed in an increasingly authoritarian manner.
"Let's remember that in no country in the world does the minority govern, and certainly not in Peru," he said defiantly.
Even as civilian democracy has progressed in Latin American countries like Mexico, Argentina and Chile, Mr. Fujimori has become the symbol of a counter-trend that disturbs many officials in Washington and around the region. One elected president was overthrown in a coup this year in Ecuador, and President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has appeared to take lessons from Mr. Fujimori as he led a populist crusade.
But Washington has been reluctant to take tough action against Mr. Fujimori because of his commitment to root out drug trafficking and for fear that the leadership of the opposition is too erratic to govern.
Alejandro Toledo, the opposition presidential candidate who dropped out of the race a week before the May 28 runoff, originally said the demonstrators would block the inauguration altogether. But with his support flagging, Mr. Toledo lowered expectations and called for a longer-term strategy to force democratic change.
"This march will not end until the dictatorship falls," Mr. Toledo told a rally of 40,000 protesters in downtown Lima on Thursday night. "Mr. Fujimori must understand that the people will not stop demonstrating until there are new elections."
Tonight, Mr. Toledo blamed the government for the violence at the marches, saying intelligence agents infiltrated the demonstrations to discredit them. The government had no immediate response.
The demonstrators, mostly students and young workers, traveled to Lima from around the country by bus, train and even boat down Amazonian tributaries.
In his speech, Mr. Fujimori tried to bolster his base of rural Indians and shantytown residents with repeated promises that he would make new jobs his first priority. To promote development in the Andean highlands, he pledged to foster projects to improve irrigation and wool production from alpacas and llamas.
He vowed to build 3,000 schools, pave roads in urban shantytowns and expand supplies of clean water and electricity. He also pledged to expand a public school breakfast program to include lunch.
"The highlands must be transformed into something where more than despair grows," he said.
But Mr. Fujimori also tried to reassure investors, who in recent weeks have grown alarmed by his increasingly populist rhetoric. He promised to curb an expanding government deficit and to keep the annual inflation rate under 4 percent.

New Primary System Is Quashed by Bush Camp
Gov. George W. Bush ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding the Republican convention next week by killing an effort to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted. The Republican National Committee's plan was intended to lengthen the primary system by making the big states vote last. Members of the committee attributed the Bush camp's opposition to the plan to a desire to have a convention free of conflict. A1
 
Republicans fought passionately over abortion at a meeting on the party platform, with the anti-abortion forces easily prevailing, as the platform committee made its way through a document intended to balance the party's core conservatism with Governor Bush's attempt at a more centrist appeal. A9
 
Governor Bush flew into Arkansas, proclaiming that he intended to contest areas in President Clinton's home territory that the Democrats won solidly in the last two presidential elections. With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the northwest corner of Arkansas, Mr. Bush began a five-day march to the Republican National Convention that will take him through the battleground states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Where We Lived as We Turned Into Americans

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Louis Winnick's overview of the origins and transformation of Co-op Village from union-sponsored, moderate-income cooperatives to market-rate housing (Op-Ed, July 22) is both nostalgic and timely. Because of the loss of thousands of affordable apartments to the booming market, today's union members and moderate- and middle-income workers cannot find a decent place to live at prices they can afford.
Mr. Winnick deplores the inadequate public and private responses to this crisis. Our political leaders must understand that housing is the building block for a safe, healthy environment and economic stability. 
 The early union pioneers built a model community on the Lower East Side. We need that type of commitment today from unions, companies and government.

 HARRY GOLD
 By Millicent Dillon.
 280 pp. New York:
 The Overlook Press. $26.95. 
 To be a spy is a bit like having a secret love affair. Despite the occasional sense of romance and adventure, spying involves leading a double life concealed behind a filigree of deceptions and betrayals. If you're caught at either, you're likely to be punished for daring to subvert society's moral framework. Espionage involves drama, risk and danger. Or does it? Millicent Dillon's new novel about Harry Gold, the American chemist who acted as a spy for the Soviet Union in the 1930's and 40's, suggests otherwise.
In a scene depicting Gold's trial in 1950, Dillon quotes Gold's lawyer, John D. M. Hamilton, as saying: "I come here to explain a crime and not to excuse one. I come here to state a case and not to plead one." Dillon follows this lead by tracing Gold's story in precise and subdued prose, and combining her factual knowledge of his life with imagined detail and poetic texture. Like her character, the author has a double identity here, alternating between a biographer's and a novelist's voice and point of view. (It is a double identity that may come naturally to Dillon: the author of three previous works of fiction, she has also published biographies of Paul and Jane Bowles, among others.)
Unusually, Dillon the biographer inserts herself into the novel as a first-person narrator, and in this role she is honest enough to define her main weakness -- and the book's most rewarding challenge -- which is, as she puts it at one point, "watching from the outside, thinking I was watching from the inside."
From the outside, Dillon shows us a small, barely noticeable man who leads a simple, poor, dutiful life with his Russian Jewish parents and younger brother in Philadelphia. It is 1932, there is rampant unemployment and he is the family's sole support. When he too loses his job and is miraculously offered a new one by the friend of a friend, Harry doesn't realize that this friendship is motivated by a plan to recruit him as a courier for the Russians. Dillon shows an interesting dichotomy between Gold's refusal to join the Communist Party, whose teachings he finds unimpressive, and his readiness to become a spy, simply out of a sense of commitment to a friend and his belief that the Russian people need his help.
He begins by sneaking scientific information out of his own lab and sharing it with the Soviet Union via a clandestine contact; although his tasks grow in importance, he will always remain a minor courier -- dependable and practically invisible. His greatest claim to fame will be his connection with the German emigre physicist Klaus Fuchs, one of the masterminds behind the first atom bomb. He is also a witness for the prosecution at the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
But who is this man, and does his story give us any clues about his inner life? If a biographer is a well-informed voyeur, what, then, is a novelist? Where is the boundary between fact and fiction when writing about the life of a real person? Dillon's Gold is perfectly convincing as a fictional character, but for all we know he may not correspond to the real person: somewhat confusingly, biography bleeds here into fiction.
This secret agent is well removed from our romantic image of spies. He never seeks to be paid for his services; he has no ideology; he is unusually kind, reliable and selfless. He is a painfully ordinary man and -- it must be said -- a boring one; yet his blandness is a cover for a terrible neediness and loneliness. Harry becomes infatuated with almost every single one of his contacts (especially Fuchs, with whom he feels "caught up in the forces of history, at a critical juncture of life and matter"), sees them as friends and is crushed when they leave him. It seems that he is not so much spying for the Soviet Union as looking for soul mates. And no wonder: his double life results in his being doubly lonely -- he is not allowed to marry. One of the novel's most moving touches is Gold's attachment to an imaginary wife and children.
By the time we are shown Gold's trial, where he is jeered by a hostile, anti-Semitic crowd and sentenced to 30 years in prison, he has become an almost tragic figure -- yet still an enigma.
"Harry Gold" is a fascinating and original book. It answers few questions, and asks many good ones. Yet it would have been a better and more interesting novel if the biographer had been less inclined to interfere with the novelist's freedom to tell a good -- even if not necessarily true -- story.

HEADLINE: George Herbert Walker Bush;
The Accidental Vice President

BYLINE: By Richard V. Allen; Richard V. Allen served as President Reagan's first national security adviser.

 BODY:
What I remember most about entering Ronald Reagan's suite early on the third evening of the 1980 Republican convention, the night of his nomination, was the silence. It's not that there weren't plenty of people around. William J. Casey, Reagan's campaign manager, Richard Wirthlin, his pollster, and his advisers Peter Hannaford, Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese were all there in the candidate's elegantly appointed rooms on the 69th floor of the Detroit Plaza Hotel. So, too, was Reagan, dressed in a casual shirt and tan slacks. The entire group was seated on a large U-shaped couch, hushed, as if they were watching some spellbinding movie on TV.
The silence in the room was in marked contrast to the steadily rising noise at the Joe Louis Arena. There, word was spreading that Reagan was going to choose Gerald Ford, the former president and his bitter adversary in the 1976 primaries, to be his running mate. 
 As Reagan's foreign policy adviser, I didn't have much business getting involved in the selection of a vice president. But as someone who signed on with Reagan because I admired his principled criticism of the foreign policy of the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations, I couldn't help venturing to the suite to see what was going on. And so, at 5:30 in the evening, before I was to head over to the convention, I walked up the single flight of stairs that separated Reagan's floor from mine. It didn't take long for my suspicions to be confirmed. As I stepped into the hallway, there, coming out of Reagan's rooms and flanked by his Secret Service detail, was a tanned and fit Gerald Ford.
Once the former president and I had exchanged pleasantries, I made my way past security to Reagan's suite. Alone among those gathered on the couch, the nominee looked up and greeted me. I asked if he needed anything before I left for the arena. "Oh, no," he replied, "but thanks."
As I turned to leave, he asked, "What do you think of the Ford deal?"
"What deal?" I responded, genuinely surprised that the two parties were already working out details. In addition to the vice-presidential slot, Reagan said, "Ford wants Kissinger as secretary of state and Greenspan at treasury." My instant response was, "That is the craziest deal I have ever heard of." And it was.
This summer, as we approach the Republican and Democratic conventions, both major presidential candidates have conducted highly structured searches for their running mates. Richard Cheney, the former secretary of defense, has spent months vetting candidates for George W. Bush. Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been doing the same for Al Gore.
Though it was only 20 years ago, the process in 1980 could not have been more different from the one today. It is hard to imagine an unexpected vice-presidential pick at the last minute, like John Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960, Richard Nixon's choice of Spiro Agnew in 1968 or even George Bush Sr.'s elevation of Dan Quayle in 1988 -- all of which caught the candidates' advisers by surprise.
But it was Ronald Reagan's nomination of Governor Bush's father that bears special telling. Reagan's selection of Bush in Detroit represented a turnabout within six hours; it came only when the negotiations with Ford, having taken on a life of their own, appeared to have reached an impasse. Had the talks succeeded and had Ford been selected, the Reagan campaign, crippled by infighting, might well have lost to the Carter-Mondale ticket in the fall. Had Reagan and Ford managed to win the election, it's very likely that their administration would have been hobbled by an unworkable power-sharing arrangement. It's also possible that the Republicans might have a different candidate today.
There are many plausible versions of how and why Reagan chose George Bush as his running mate, but most are wide of the mark. One conventional view is that Reagan, about to be nominated, recognized that he "needed a moderate" like Bush to balance the ticket; another version has it that Reagan, supposedly unschooled in foreign affairs, saw the wisdom of naming someone with extensive experience in the field to offset his own shortcomings. Yet another explanation holds that Reagan, a Californian, needed "geographic balance" and got that in Bush, with his Connecticut and Texas lineage.
These explanations are wrong. George Bush was picked at the very last moment and largely by a combination of chance and some behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Many Reagan advisers have claimed a deal was never close. The post-convention media commentary has largely reflected this view. In fact, Meese and Deaver have gone so far as to declare that Bush was their first choice all along. I take exception to their account. I saw a very different story unfold, and saw it from a privileged vantage point. From the moment I walked into that suite until the moment Bush was finally selected, I was the only person to remain in Reagan's presence throughout the adventure. With detailed notes to back up my memory, this is what I saw at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution on that long night in Detroit.
Ronald Reagan's search for a vice president started as soon as he clinched the nomination with a string of primary victories in the spring of 1980. Before long, a short list of prospective running mates had been put together, including Howard Baker, William Simon, Jack Kemp, Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt and George Bush.
None of these prospective running mates were actually "vetted" in the way the process works today. Reagan knew all these men in varying degrees, but as was his style, he expected his advisers to do what was necessary to prune the list. The job fell largely to Ed Meese, who knew Reagan's mind better than anyone except Nancy Reagan.
It wasn't until several weeks before the convention that Gerald Ford's name entered into the mix. While it has never been established how it happened, most attribute it to Bryce Harlow, a respected adviser to Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. Harlow probably initiated the idea in a discussion with his friend, William Casey, who then took it to Reagan and Meese.
As the convention approached, the Ford rumors became stronger. Although Reagan was running even with or behind President Carter in most polls, the idea struck several of us on the senior staff as a highly impractical, if not silly, idea. After all, Reagan and Ford had fought intensely for the nomination in 1976. In 1980, the G.O.P. platform carried Reagan's conservative message down the line. Its foreign policy planks in particular were, under cover of assailing Carter, a de facto indictment of the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger policy of detente with the Soviet Union. Unlike many of his predecessors, Reagan actually believed in the platform and was determined to see it put in place. The platform alone, we thought, would make a Reagan-Ford ticket unthinkable.
In Reagan's suite, however, the unthinkable had become the possible. In less than 24 hours, Reagan was going to have to go before the convention to announce his vice-presidential nominee. And yet for reasons that to this day remain baffling, not only had Reagan given his political advisers free rein to negotiate with Ford, he had also refrained from initiating conversations with other potential running mates. With no alternate plan in sight, it seemed that Reagan was prepared to embrace the wing of the Republican Party that had ridiculed him, probably disliked him and would surely do its best to undermine his agenda.
At 5:50 p.m., Casey and Meese, who had left the suite shortly after my arrival, returned. They seemed pensive. Lyn Nofziger, a longtime aide, joined us a few minutes later, asking, "What did Ford want?"
Reagan again described the deal being negotiated, complete with Ford's demands for Kissinger and Alan Greenspan, adding "I thought that was more than a little sacrifice." Then Reagan went to his bedroom to take a short nap. He knew it would be a long night.
Shortly after 6:30, Kissinger entered the suite to talk to Meese, evidence that a serious negotiation was indeed in progress. Half an hour later, he emerged; we chatted briefly, but the former secretary of state revealed nothing of the talks. Meese, who was similarly guarded, said that Kissinger wanted to proceed with discussions.
This was serious. And so I did something rash: I decided to try to contact George Bush. Until that moment, the campaign inner circle had treated important issues in a collegial manner; there had been no secrets among us. But on this issue, Casey, Meese, Wirthlin and Deaver were keeping the lid on. If my colleagues could play it close to the vest on such a crucial issue, it was a game that could be played by others as well.
Although nominally still on a list of frequently mentioned running mates, George Bush was not really on Reagan's radar screen. Since the primaries, the two men had barely spoken, and they certainly hadn't discussed the vice presidency. Apart from serious policy differences, Bush had refused to admit defeat in the primary battles despite being vanquished by Reagan in 29 of 33 primaries and did not withdraw from the race until just before the California primary in June. Reagan considered the belated departure willful and unnecessary and was offended by it. Still, I thought Bush a viable alternative to Ford; he had the best credentials of the possible running mates mentioned. If not for the unsettled relations between the two, Bush could bring more to the ticket to help Reagan than anyone on the list of choices.
There was no question that a Bush candidacy would be a hard sell. Among Reagan's advisers, Nofziger and Casey viewed Bush as a liberal, and others were almost unanimously against him, some even contemptuous. I considered Bush a capable man whose positions were actually much closer to Reagan's than were Ford's, especially on foreign policy and defense matters. In 1978, Bush had requested my assistance on his campaign, but my commitment to Reagan was firm. Of the Reagan inner circle, I had the clearest channel to Bush and knew him the best.
Shortly before 7:30, I reached Stefan Halper, a Bush aide. Talking to him from the nearly empty suite, I asked him, in as circumspect a manner as possible, to seek Bush's assurance that he could support the platform "with no exceptions." Halper knew what I meant: Was Bush interested in the job? Would he implicitly abandon his support for abortion and his opposition to supply-side economics by embracing the platform? I then called an old friend, Richard Fairbanks, to ask him to approach Bush with the same question. I wanted two sources of independent confirmation and knew Fairbanks was close to Bush.
At this point, Reagan emerged from his bedroom refreshed by the catnap and sat down in front of three muted television sets in the suite. Within moments, Gerald Ford appeared on CBS with Walter Cronkite, and Reagan asked that the volume be turned up. Cronkite wasted no time asking Ford if he and Reagan were discussing a "co-presidency," which Ford affirmed by not disagreeing. Reagan looked appalled.
After the broadcast, the room cleared out. Reagan and I were alone. Reluctant to question him, but knowing that another track could never be started unless he agreed to it, I asked Reagan why he would not simply issue a statement denying that he had agreed to a co-presidency. There was a sense of resignation in his voice when he said, "I can't." After a few seconds, he said aloud, almost rhetorically, "Who else is there?"
"There's Bush," I suggested, half expecting him to close off the discussion. Instead, he paused and then said, "I can't take him; that 'voodoo economic policy' charge and his stand on abortion are wrong."
Sensing an opportunity, I reached for a copy of the platform lying on the coffee table, passed it to him and said, "Governor, this is your platform, every word of it." I added that Martin Anderson, Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser, Peter Hannaford and I had scrutinized it carefully. "If you could be assured that George Bush would support this platform in every detail," I asked, "would you reconsider Bush?"
Reagan mulled this for a moment and then said, deliberately, "Well, if you put it that way, I would agree to reconsider." The opening emerged.
At 7:50 Fairbanks called to say that Bush could indeed embrace the platform; soon thereafter, Halper phoned with the same message. Meanwhile, negotiations with Ford continued upstairs on the 70th floor, with Casey, Meese, Deaver and Wirthlin representing Reagan, and Greenspan, Kissinger and the Ford advisers John O. Marsh, Robert Barrett representing the former president.
Reagan continued to sit before the televisions, snacking on his favorite jelly beans. Senator Bob Dole appeared with the television commentator Max Robinson and declared that "Ford and Reagan can work it out." Reagan commented, softly: "No, Bob. I cannot give him what he wants."
Seeing another opening, I then informed Reagan that Bush had given unequivocal assurances that he could embrace and defend the entire platform, emphasizing "with no exceptions." He listened carefully, but did not respond. I simply could not read his reaction, and the thought crossed my mind that he was angry that I had opened a channel to Bush.
At 8:05, Reagan announced to no one in particular, doesn't Ford "realize there is no way in the world I can accept? What kind of presidential candidate would I be in the eyes of the world if I were to give in to such demands?" It seemed odd that despite his instincts, Reagan did not call a halt to the talks. It seemed odd, too, that so many of those who felt uncomfortable about the deal remained quiet.
Just before 8:30, Meese reported progress: Ford had modified his demands and now wanted to be "chairman" of the National Security Council. The notion should have been rejected outright, as the President is the head of the N.S.C. A few minutes later, Anderson and Deaver rejoined the group in the suite, and Deaver told Reagan that Ford would like to speak to him on the phone. At 8:55, Reagan went into his bedroom to call Ford. He returned five minutes later, reporting that Ford had told him that Kissinger "now takes himself out" of the running for secretary of state. It was clear that Ford and Greenspan had not taken themselves out of anything.
By 9:30, Sam Donaldson was reporting that Reagan would go to the arena with Ford in a matter of hours, reinforcing speculation about the "dream ticket," and at 9:45, Cronkite announced that Ford and Kissinger were meeting with Reagan operatives. At 9:50, Meese came into the room: "We're wanted upstairs" in Ford's suite.
At 10:05, former Treasury Secretary William Simon entered, and Reagan and I sat with him in a corner. Simon, who had been mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate, was determined to stop the deal in its tracks, which was surprising since he had served in Ford's cabinet. "Ron, take me out of this," he told Reagan. "But under no circumstances take Ford. If you did that, you'd be totally compromised, and you know it." Simon, never a man to mince words, left; he had made a deep impression on Reagan.
By 10:45, Casey and Meese returned to the suite to present the latest version of the deal. "It's kind of hard to describe how it would work in practice," Meese began. "The president will nominate the secretaries of state and treasury, with the veto of the vice president. The vice president will name the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the national security adviser with the veto of the president. It boils down to a mutual veto power." In this version, Kissinger, "taken out" as secretary of state, would run foreign policy from the vice president's office.
At that late hour, despite its obvious and fundamental flaws and without any sort of backup plan, our side seemed determined to try to make this constantly changing arrangement work. It was almost surreal: how could a president limit his constitutional powers and prerogatives by allowing a vice president to veto his choices?
Just before 11, Nancy Reagan and the Reagan children came in to watch the convention roll call. At 11:13, Montana put Reagan over the top, and there was jubilation. At the moment of triumph, though, the negotiators were not present; they remained upstairs, locked in discussions. Meanwhile, the convention was drawing to a close -- if the Ford talks went on much longer, and failed, there would be no way to heal the disappointment. Over the course of the preceding hour, I had told Hannaford, Anderson and Nofziger that a channel had been opened to Bush and that Bush was on board with the platform. Hannaford then began to argue that the logjam had to be broken. He collected Deaver and Nofziger at the entrance to the suite and mounted the stairs to tell the negotiators that a decision was needed.
At 11:25, the negotiators returned; Casey reported that "the answer is probably no." Five minutes later, Ford, accompanied by Barrett, entered the suite to talk with Reagan, and we left the room. The two men spent a few minutes alone, and at 11:35, Ford departed. We rushed back into the room, and Reagan said: "I have to say the answer is no. All this time, my gut instinct has been that this is not the right thing. I have affection and respect for Ford. He said he would go all out to help." There was complete silence.
Reagan glanced around and asked those assembled -- a group that included Casey, Meese, Wirthlin, Hannaford, Deaver and me -- Well, what do we do now?" There was no immediate response. No one offered an alternate plan. No one tossed out a name. Expecting instant opposition, I ventured, "We call Bush." Once more, silence. Reagan again looked at each of us; hearing no objection, he said, "Well, let's get Bush on the phone."
At precisely 11:38, the phone was in Reagan's hand; though they barely knew each other, Reagan dove right in. "George," he said warmly, "I would like to go over there and tell them that I am recommending you for vice president. Could I ask you one thing -- do I have your permission to make an announcement that you support the platform across the board?" We could hear Bush agreeing at the other end. Reagan then left for the convention center where, shortly after midnight, he took the podium to praise Ford and then to announce his running mate, George Bush.
And so it came to pass that Ronald Reagan averted what would have been a disaster for his candidacy and the Republican Party. The following morning, Ed Meese called us together and declared the official line should be that the process of selecting a running mate had been orderly and measured and that there "never was a deal with Ford" for the vice presidency. Technically, he's right, since no deal was ever consummated.
Months later, while on the campaign plane, I asked Deaver what was in his mind as he sat in those discussions. He thought for a moment and said, "Look, I'm a guy from Sacramento, Calif., and there I was sitting at a negotiating table with Henry Kissinger, and Kissinger had negotiated with Mao." Astonished, I waited for something more, then asked, "And so, that's it?" He looked at me as if I didn't understand and said, sharply: "Of course that's it. I was sitting right there!"
For his part, Kissinger, no stranger to balky negotiations, later told The Washington Post that "if it had been possible for both the principals to go to bed, sleep on it, meet again in the morning, we could have wrapped up this thing in two hours in the morning," adding, "that's how close it was." And I believe him.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Off the Hippies: 'Joe' and the Chaotic Summer of '70

BYLINE: By J. HOBERMAN; J. Hoberman, film critic for The Village Voice, is completing a book on the media culture of the 1960's.

 BODY:
THE regime of the summer blockbuster dictates that entertainment build the largest possible consensus. The notion that a movie might succeed by polarizing audiences seems absurd. Thirty summers ago, however, the landscape was quite different. The most talked-about and likely the most profitable movie to open that season was a cheaply made political button-pusher that riled audiences by mixing social satire with confrontational carnage: "Joe."
The summer of 1970 was bracketed by the release of the X-rated "Myra Breckinridge," perhaps the most reviled studio production ever, and "Soldier Blue," a phenomenally violent and tendentious cavalry western that showed American soldiers committing civilian massacres a century before My Lai. "Joe," which climaxed with the vigilante massacre of a hippie commune, was even more a movie of its moment -- opening at two Manhattan theaters in mid-July, barely two months after the shootings at Kent State and Jackson State. 
 For many of the nation's college students, the spring term ended in chaos. Some 30 R.O.T.C. buildings were burned or bombed. Over 500 colleges closed early. On Wall Street -- where news of Kent State triggered the Dow's worst one-day loss since the assassination of John F. Kennedy -- an anti-war rally was attacked by 200 laborers from a nearby construction site. The construction workers -- whose hard hats subsequently became a patriotic symbol -- assaulted demonstrators and bystanders, tore down the Episcopal banner at Trinity Church, invaded City Hall to demand the American flag be raised to full staff and smashed windows at nearby Pace College.
For probably the first time, American civilians fought in the streets over the war in Indochina. Although no movie captured this conflict better than "Joe," the scenario was conceived the previous summer. Norman Wexler, a 42-year-old Harvard-educated advertising executive and unproduced playwright, was inspired by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew's "silent majority" rhetoric, and a New York magazine article on the murder of an upper-middle class girl who had taken up with an East Village drug dealer, to write a movie treatment in which a pair of World War II veterans, one a disgruntled worker and the other the well-to-do father of a wanton hippie, wreak bloody vengeance on the younger generation.
Wexler, who died last summer, had no luck pitching his idea to the major studios. John G. Avildsen, a younger colleague with recent experience directing sex exploitation films, brought the idea to his employers at Cannon, then looking to produce more legitimate fare. Wexler wrote the script in eight days and Mr. Avildsen, not yet a union director and so technically only the cinematographer, was given a month to shoot the movie.
Made in early 1970, entirely on location, with the actors providing their own costumes, Cannon's first non-porn feature opens with the hippies Frank (Patrick McDermott) and Melissa (Susan Sarandon) sharing a bath in the kitchen area of their squalid East Village apartment.
Instead of lovemaking, explicit close-ups show Frank cooking and shooting his heroin. Melissa ingests too much speed and winds up in the hospital, after first freaking out and trashing a 14th Street sundries store -- a scene that Ms. Sarandon, who made her professional acting debut in "Joe," recalls being shot without retakes. Melissa's father, the haute WASP account executive Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick), ventures downtown to collect her effects from the pad of depravity. At that moment, Frank returns to taunt him with details of Melissa's unresolved family drama. In a splendidly cheesy effect, complete with crude psychedelic superimpositions, the enraged adman bludgeons the hippie scuzzball to death.
Redneck duck hunters had shot the hippie antiheroes of the previous summer's "Easy Rider," but this was something new! Anything seems possible as Compton picks up Frank's dope-filled shopping bag and flees. Cut to the dank neighborhood tavern where the steamfitter Joe Curren (Peter Boyle) holds forth, mind crammed with phantom antagonists. His blunt use of profanity and racial epithets instantly captured the viewers' attention. Ignored by a weary bartender, Joe continues his obscene anti-welfare harangue.
What could now match the initial frisson provided by this heavy-set working stiff installed on barstool in the middle of the afternoon shooting off his mouth as though he were a proletarian Lenny Bruce? When a haggard Compton -- desperate himself for an alcohol fix -- enters the establishment, Joe turns to the impeccably dressed newcomer and demands that he find a liberal who doesn't pander to blacks, offering a sexual favor to him if he can.
Joe expressed sentiments that no American politician -- not even George Wallace -- had the nerve to articulate, at least in public. These sentiments, however, were not those of Mr. Boyle. A member of Chicago's satirical Second City, he had been radicalized by the street disturbances around the 1968 Democratic Convention. For the actor, Joe was a character he might have invented on the Second City stage. Although Mr. Avildsen was impressed with Mr. Boyle's spontaneous embellishments when he read for the part, the film's producers felt the 34-year-old actor would seem too young to have served in World War II, and in fact their first choice for the role was the B-movie gangster Lawrence Tierney.
In giving on-screen presence to those blue-collar workers whose income was eaten away by wartime inflation even as the counterculture eroded their moral code, "Joe" developed in tandem with the social spectacle. The movie was not only retitled (from "The Gap"), but reconfigured in the wake of May's Wall Street rumble. Originally a supporting character, Joe became the protagonist. The requisite soundtrack album even included his opening diatribe -- which escalates to a call for vigilante vengeance. When the ad man confesses his crime, Joe is ecstatic: "I just talk about it, but you did it!"
There was a sense that only extralegal force could contain the disorder. A week after "Joe" opened, the presidential aide Tom Charles Huston presented a plan to coordinate all domestic intelligence gathering, including wiretaps and break-ins, under White House direction. In 1972, Norman Wexler, who had been diagnosed as manic depressive, would himself be arrested and jailed for making threats against President Richard M. Nixon during the course of a commercial cross-country flight.
Opening on July 15, the same day as "The Revolutionary," Paul Williams's sober view of campus radicalism, "Joe" waded into theaters in a season of rampant youth exploitation. "Love Story," the 32-year-old Yale professor Erich Segal's best-selling campus romance, was in production for its Christmas release. Mr. Segal's screenplay about a campus riot, "R.P.M.," would appear in the fall. It was "Getting Straight" -- with Elliott Gould as a hip Viet-vet grad student and Candice Bergen as his co-ed girlfriend -- that had the luck to open 10 days after Kent State. Two weeks later, "The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart" recounted the picaresque adventures of a longhaired college junior (Don Johnson) without mentioning either the draft or Vietnam. The movie was shot on the Columbia campus, unlike "The Strawberry Statement" which, opening in June, transposed James Simon Kunin's account of the 1968 disturbances there to San Francisco after the university refused to serve as a location.
SMALL wonder Joe was furious. These draft-dodging rich kids -- who, he imagined, spent their vacations at fancy resorts and had orgies -- were being presented as the crown of creation even as their opposition to the war threatened to obliterate the event that defined their fathers. Joe and Compton bond across the class divide; the movie reaches its comic high point when they tour the East Village in search of the runaway Melissa. After dinner at a macrobiotic restaurant, the pair is picked up by a gaggle of hippies and winds up partying with Frank's stash. Neither bothering to phone home, each gets himself a chick, only to discover, by the dawn's early light, that the girls' male confederates have made off with their wallets.
The two guys are now living in the moment. After violently extracting an address from the girl, they drive upstate to the hippies' rural farmhouse. There, in a scene that struck some as a domestic My Lai, Joe turns avenging angel. Kids are cowering in the corner begging for mercy as Joe persuades Compton to pick up the gun. A final freeze frame has Compton shoot a just-arrived hippie chick -- it is, of course, Melissa.
Hailing "Joe" as "a film of Freudian anguish, biblical savagery and immense social and cinematic importance," Time magazine ranked the final sequence with the climax of "Bonnie and Clyde." Getting away with murder might not be impossible. "A lot of Joes sit in jury boxes these days," the reviewer warned. And in movie theaters: Mr. Boyle recently recalled that at the Embassy on Broadway, where "Joe" was screening around the clock, he and a friend snuck in at 2 a.m. to find "people screaming at the screen." Mr. Boyle became an instant celebrity -- hailed as a long-lost buddy by New York hard-hats.
"I had no idea that anybody would see the movie," Mr. Boyle said by telephone. "It was a very strange experience -- people coming up and saying, 'That's what they ought to do with all these hippies.' I was in an identity crisis." Rather than revel in his new fame, Mr. Boyle spent the summer afraid for his life. "Kids are standing up at the end of the movie and yelling, 'I'm going to shoot back, Joe,' " he told an interviewer at the time. "The other night I was walking down 46th Street and I had a flash of myself being shot down in the street, just because someone thought I really was Joe."
The 1970 election was dominated by events of the previous May -- as The New York Times suggested with an article on the semiotics of construction-work apparel, "A New Hat in Political Ring." Meanwhile, college students were the enemy. In mid-September, Agnew took to the hustings to campaign against that "disruptive, radical and militant minority."
A Yale student, Bill Clinton, got his political education in that election -- working for an antiwar Democratic candidate, the Reverend Joseph Duffey. Attacked by Agnew as a "revisionist Marxist," Mr. Duffey was dogged throughout his Senate campaign by hard-hat demonstrators. Still, the most notorious figure at Yale that fall was Professor Charles Reich, who attributed a new consciousness to his students. First published in The New Yorker, Mr. Reich's "Greening of America" maintained that the nation was in the midst of an unstoppable, pot-smoking, love-making, bellbottom-wearing, non-violent revolution against the Corporate State. Mr. Reich's analysis had little interest in racism or Vietnam but much to say about the stunted consciousness of the Joe generation. The professor advised readers to "look again at a 'fascist' -- tight-lipped, tense, crew cut, correctly dressed, church-going, an American flag on his car window, a hostile eye for communists, youth, and blacks."
The president was, of course, devoted to the blue-ing of America. Plunging into the campaign, trailed by the student demonstrators who unwittingly served him as foils, Nixon attacked the "fawning approval" of antiwar violence that in certain "fashionable circles has become the mark of being 'with it.' " The rhetoric was black and white but the election proved inconclusive. The Republicans lost nine House seats while gaining two in the Senate, where eight "peace" candidates won and six were defeated.
Still, "Joe" was scarcely played out. In New York, the movie concluded a 21-week first run and then moved to selected neighborhood theaters over Thanksgiving -- a few days before J. Edgar Hoover placed the Weatherman leader Bernadine Dohrn on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list. A stone cast in the pool of American consciousness, "Joe" had a continuing ripple effect. On Jan. 20, 1971, the movie again went wide. The next night, a new situation comedy had its premiere -- it featured a domesticated Joe (Archie Bunker) and was called "All in the Family."
"Joe's" screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, and Mr. Avildsen estimates that the movie (whose budget, reported to be around $300,000, was likely exaggerated) eventually grossed $20 million. But, however sensational in its day, "Joe" is a movie without a reputation -- rating not a mention in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls," Peter Biskind's 1998 account of the old "new Hollywood."
Perhaps "Joe" belongs more to the history of American political image-making. As suggested by the minimalist title tune ("Hey Joe, don't it make you want to go to war . . . once more?"), its protagonist was the literal-minded infantryman of that Emerging Republican Majority that the political analyst Kevin Phillips detailed during the 1968 campaign. Rather than introduce a new auteur, "Joe" projected a new character -- and was thus precursor to such subsequent guerrilla productions as "Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song" and "Billy Jack." Indeed, Mr. Avildsen enjoyed his greatest success six years later when he directed the movie that introduced another, more positive, working-class hero: Rocky.
For a time, Cannon periodically took out ads for unmade sequels to its greatest hit. In 1980, the company promised "Joe II" and, in 1985, announced the coming of "Citizen Joe": "The man has changed but the times have not. . . . He's back." But, of course, the times had changed. The cult of direct action that seemed so shocking in 1970 was all too characteristic of the films of the 80's -- not only were characters played by Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger accustomed to taking the law into their own hands, their exploits served to burnish the image of our movie star president, Ronald Reagan. Or so it might have seemed to Joe.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Far Out in the Land Of Shakespeare

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: CEDAR CITY, Utah

 BODY:
FLAGS on Main Street here proclaim "Tony 2000." At the town's Utah Shakespearean Festival, not far from the majestic Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks, the organizers, actors and volunteers are still a bit dazed about having won the regional theater Tony Award last month.
"We began in 1962 with just about nothing, a budget of $1,000 and lots of volunteers," said Fred C. Adams, 69, the buoyant founder and executive producer of the festival. "This Tony Award was a validation of what we've been striving for over the last four decades." 
 It was also a validation of a resilient regional theater that was virtually unknown in New York until the Tonys but well known among a Shakespeare underground in the heartland. As many as 155,000 theatergoers, mostly young families and older people from the Midwest and Far West, surge into this sedate mountain town in the southwestern corner of Utah each summer for afternoons and evenings of professional theatrical productions.
The fact that there is a substantial and, yes, adoring audience "out there" for Shakespeare as well as other dramatists -- not in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles but in Utah -- might surprise the Broadway and Off Broadway crowd.
"This is destination theater," said Anthony DeFonte, who is performing three roles this summer, including Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice," and has appeared in a number of television series. "It's a place where people decide to take a vacation -- to see six plays in a few days and visit the national parks nearby. And they're a wonderfully attentive and responsive audience. They love the ritual of theater and we frequently get standing ovations. They are really moved by Shakespeare's work."
Another actor at the festival echoed Mr. DeFonte. "Audiences gasp openly, they laugh openly, they applaud, there's deep silence," said Kathleen McCall, who is playing Portia to Mr. DeFonte's Shylock. "And they are willing to be challenged," she added, seated on the theater's lawn in the pulsing heat before rehearsals.
"It's daunting for me," Ms. McCall said, "as for all of us, because they know their Shakespeare so well. Some will come with the plays, actually reading them as you perform. They'll look at you strangely if you say a wrong word. They really know the text. I'm sure at some point I'm going to have people from the audience saying 'the quality of mercy' speech with me."
Like some of the other 18 Equity actors who have the top roles this season, Ms. McCall has worked on Broadway, Off Broadway and in regional theaters. Auditions are held in January and February in major cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Some roles are cast with undergraduates; actor-interns are hired for nonspeaking parts and musical choruses.
The mood at the festival, with its two theaters -- outdoor and indoor -- its behind-the-scenes tours, lectures and festivities on the lawns of Southern Utah University (part of the festival grounds are on the campus), seems ebullient -- almost innocent. The afternoon that Mr. Adams and other executives of the theater returned from New York after the Tony ceremony, the 350 members of the festival's company and 400 volunteers lined up around the theaters and passed the award from one person to another.
"Those were the hands that made it possible," Mr. Adams said. "It was a very moving hour."
As he spoke, nearly 200 people were sitting on the lawn at dusk, waiting to enter the 888-seat outdoor Adams Memorial Shakespearean Theater. It is modeled after the Globe Theater in which Shakespeare's plays were produced in London, and it is named after a major benefactor of the festival, Grace Adams Tanner (a distant cousin of Mr. Adams's), and her parents. The audience, which would see "The Merry Wives of Windsor," was being entertained by "The Greenshow," half a dozen dancers and singers in Renaissance costume.
Watching them, Nancy Lindon, who grew up on Long Island, and her husband, Arthur, who retired in 1992 as director of public works for the Village of Old Westbury, N.Y., said they had been visiting the festival for three or four years and loved the plays -- at least most of them. The retired couple live in Pinehurst, N.C., but spend their summers in Park City, Utah, in the northern part of the state, the home of the Sundance Film Festival.
"The caliber of acting is first-rate," Mr. Lindon said. "We saw 'Peter Pan' today, and it was fantastic."
His wife nodded. "We come here for two days and see four shows, and I love it. I'm from New York. I've seen a lot of theater. That's top-drawer theater. Well, so is this."
The Lindons voiced one qualification. "The musicals -- sometimes," Mrs. Lindon said. "Last year we saw 'Damn Yankees' and it was not good. Doing a musical is not easy. We did see 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' here. That was excellent."
Nearby, Heather Hill, an electronics teacher in Bountiful, Utah, and her husband, Warren, a dean at Weaver State University in Ogden, Utah, north of Salt Lake City, said they had been making the five-hour drive from Ogden to the festival for 10 years.
"All kinds of people come here; you meet a lot of teachers and people interested in the theater and Shakespeare," said Mr. Hill, who with his wife used to live on the East Coast and in Detroit.
THESE plays are utterly timeless," Mrs. Hill said. "I remember going to Stratford, Ontario, to see 'Henry V.' It was during the Vietnam War. He made the speech to the soldiers going into battle and they were asking, 'What are we fighting for?' And I thought, 'My goodness, nothing has changed.' Last year we saw 'King Lear' here. The dynamics of the family is absolutely the same today as it was back then."
Because of the repertory schedule, a typical visitor can see all six productions in three days by choosing matinee and evening performances in both theaters. The roster this 39th season -- from June 26 to Sept. 2 -- is, in many ways, typical of the selections each year. In addition to "The Merchant of Venice" and "The Merry Wives of Windsor," the third Shakespearean production is "The War of the Roses" (an adaptation of "Henry VI: Parts 1, 2 and 3" by Howard Jensen, a festival director).
Shakespeare may dominate the calendar but other authors, of usually mainstream dramas, comedies and musicals, are equally popular. This year the festival is presenting Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," Michael Frayn's farce "Noises Off" and an adaptation of "Peter Pan" by Mr. Adams, who is also directing. A separate fall season, held indoors in the Randall L. Jones Theater, runs from Sept. 14 to Oct. 14. The productions there this season will be the musical revue "Always . . . Patsy Cline" and "Driving Miss Daisy."
Because the festival takes place in a conservative state founded by Mormons, the selection of non-Shakespeare plays has stirred some delicate issues for the organizers, many of them Mormon themselves. Dramas, comedies or musicals with sex, blunt language or edgy themes can be unwelcome. In "Noises Off" this season, the festival received permission from Mr. Frayn to alter the line "Oh, my God." Now it reads, "Oh, my Lord." Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie" was a big hit several years ago, as was Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." But while "A Streetcar Named Desire" has been done, Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" (in which a main character is a gay Mormon) would very likely be avoided.
A festival press representative put it this way: "We don't restrict ourselves because of the content of plays but rather because of whether the audience would go. So we wouldn't do 'Angels in America' because we probably wouldn't get an audience to watch it."
Yet it would be inaccurate to label the festival tradition-bound and cloaked in the culture of conservatism. Ina Marlowe, the director of "The Merchant of Venice" this year and the managing director of the Organic Theater in Chicago, said: "I didn't know any of these people when I came here and it's been an amazing experience. They have been totally open and welcoming to me as a woman director. I don't often get that in larger cities. I was not expecting it."
Kathleen F. Conlin, who staged "The Cherry Orchard" this summer and is the festival's casting director, put it another way: "When you look at the history of Utah, right from the beginning the church was pro art, music and drama. Brigham Young said drama was the best way to teach moral values -- especially for those people who couldn't read. One of the first major buildings constructed in Salt Lake when the pioneers arrived was a theater."
Similarly, Mr. Adams, the festival's founder, said that Shakespeare's dramas struck a chord for audiences in general: "We haven't changed since Shakespeare's time. The same longings, the same cravings, the same desires." Mormons, he said, were especially stirred by Shakespeare: " 'The Merchant of Venice' is one of the popular plays for Mormon audiences. They see the victim in Shylock. Having been victimized themselves in their own history, Mormons take great comfort in seeing this portrayal of humanity victimized by people who profess to be Christians."
By every account, the festival owes its birth and growth to Mr. Adams, a friendly and exuberant former actor with an obsession for theater. A Mormon, he grew up in central Utah, yearning to be an actor. After a stint in the Army he went to New York, where he worked in several Off Broadway shows and was a "swing" dancer, an understudy, in the 1953 Cole Porter musical "Can-Can." By the late 1950's, though, he had moved back to Utah.
"New York didn't need me and it was important to find a place that did," he said. He took a job in Cedar City at the small junior college that grew into the university. His task was to set up a drama department.
"The community was going through a real letdown," he recalled. "The iron mines had closed. The economy was shattered. At that point I said to the mayor and the city council that I wanted to start a Shakespeare festival. They thought I was crazy. The idea of Shakespeare didn't seem to impress any of them."
With the help of a local Lions Club, Mr. Adams began the festival in 1962 with "Hamlet," "The Merchant of Venice" and "The Taming of the Shrew." Students and local townspeople played the roles on a makeshift stage. Most of them made their own costumes. They also put on productions of "On Borrowed Time" by Paul Osborn and the Jule Styne musical "Bells Are Ringing." The festival made a profit of $2,000 -- and Mr. Adams was home free.
Today, the budget has climbed to more than $5 million, nearly 80 percent of it from the sale of tickets, which cost from $18 to $40. The rest of the money comes from foundation support and private donors, mostly in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix. In 1989, the company opened its second space, the stylish Randall L. Jones Theater (named after the father of tourism in the region), at a cost of $5.5 million. And now there is a Web site: www.bard.org.
The festival's appeal has started to lure travelers from the East Coast. "I was dubious at first about Shakespeare in Utah -- and very reluctantly I went," said Kenneth Adelman, a director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the Reagan administration, who has taught Shakespeare courses at Georgetown and George Washington universities. "And it blew me out of the water. This place is in the middle of nowhere. And what you get is extraordinary."
Mr. Adelman and his family began attending the festival a dozen years ago. This year, he and about 35 friends from New York, Chicago, Washington, Buffalo and other cities are attending.
Certainly the Tony Award has given the festival a visibility it never had, and Mr. Adams said he expected audiences as well as fund-raising to surge.
In the meantime, he still seemed almost overwhelmed by the award. At the festival's opening night this summer, Mr. Adams described walking along the red carpet to enter Radio City Music Hall to accept the Tony.
For the man who didn't make it on Broadway nearly 50 years ago, it was an especially sweet triumph. "At long last," he said. "We've been recognized!"

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Treasures Of a Past Glowing With Hope

BYLINE: By SHERMAN YELLEN; Sherman Yellen is the author of "Say Yes! The World's Fair Musical" and a collector of memorabilia from the 1939 World's Fair.

 BODY:
THE tip of this Trylon was perfect. Not a chip or a bend. The Perisphere was pristine, unscratched, unspotted, its surface gleaming after 60 years. Whoever owned these brass-plated pot-metal bookends had treated them with the reverence they deserved.
I entered my high bid in this Internet auction, under my nom de guerre, WF39, but as I surveyed the user ID's of the other bidders, I foresaw trouble. Here were my nemeses; the well-named "Fairfiend," "GroverW" and especially "exNY1940"; men and women possessed of pockets so deep and passions so large that seconds before the end of an auction, trigger finger on their mouse, they would make off with my Trylon and Peri sphere trophy, slamming my bid with a higher one, leaving me stunned and defeated. 
 It was kitsch I craved, tchotchkes if you prefer, collectibles if you must, that had reduced me to this Dostoyevskian desperation, as time and again I prepared to go beyond my limits to possess that which I had to have, something wonderful from the fair.
On my desk was a small Bakelite pencil sharpener, depicting the fair's symbols, the Trylon and Perisphere, in a smoky orange plastic, and though I honored it, I knew it was but a puny example of the T. and P. wonders that survived the fair. I hungered -- no, I lusted for -- more, knowing that more would never be enough. My sons had even jokingly threatened to hold a World's Fair intervention if I didn't stop my obsessive buying. I didn't need that to recognize that my life had been spinning out of control, dominated by a sphere and a spire that had been constructed on a former Corona, Queens, garbage dump.
These ashtrays, lamps, thermometers, andirons and salt and pepper shakers shaped as sphere and spire are, for me, that fair in miniature. If I step on the gas, I'd have to say they will always mean to me and the other fair fiends a better tomorrow. Who wouldn't want to own a piece of that? Forget the fairs of Chicago, St. Louis, Paris and San Francisco. We know that there was only one world's fair that ever mattered, and it took place in New York in 1939-40.
For the last three years I have been working as book writer and lyricist with the composer Wally Harper on a new musical comedy, "Say Yes!," set in that World's Fair of 1940. It was developed with the director Jay Binder by the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center and will have its premiere at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass., on Aug. 15. But its true origins can be found 60 years ago, when as a small boy my family took me to the fair. It was a life-changing experience.
At the time, my family, like many middle-class families in New York, lived in an apartment where brown ruled. Forget your Fred and Ginger dancing against gleaming silvery white settings. For most of us, America in the late 30's was drab; shabby before that word was tied to chic; it was linoleum floors and oilcloth tablecloths, and it smelled of furniture polish and Murphy's Oil Soap. And then came the dazzling moderne whiteness of the New York World's Fair to open up a new vision of how to live.
The theme of that fair, "Building the World of Tomorrow," was not a come-on, it was a pay-off for the hard years of the Depression, which were coming to an end. New York was still suffering under a major economic slump. A committee headed by Grover Whalen, the city's official greeter, determined that the fair would celebrate the wonders of the consumer society. "Consumer" in 1939 was not a pejorative term; to be consumers was the wish of every family who looked in wonder at the inaccessible General Electric dishwasher and the streamlined Ford cars.
A central-theme exhibit was needed to dramatize the fair's message. Enter Wallace K. Harrison, the architect behind Rockefeller Center and later the United Nations, a brilliant, pragmatic American modernist. Awarded the contract to design the theme center, Harrison began his design work for the monumental Trylon and Perisphere with a hairpin and a ball of putty. He claimed that the sphere he created was the ideal shape for the fair because a ball can enclose the largest possible amount of space with the smallest amount of material, while the natural contrasting form to a sphere is a tower. Further inspiration for the theme can be found in the drawings of the Russian Constructivists. Later it would be discovered that the closest ancestor of the fair's icons was the very antithesis of modernism, an 1875 engraving, "Within the Gates" by A. I. Rice, a scene of swooning spirits facing a fully formed Trylon and Perisphere, the artist's paradisiacal dream of heaven. There is no denying that there was something in these shapes, their great size and their relationship to each other that was magical. And to bottom it off, the fountain below the Perisphere created the illusion of a huge ball floating on air.
The path to the fair was also paved by the movies. The Emerald City of Oz would have fit in comfortably at the fair, Munchkins and all. That hidden city of peace and brotherly love, Shangri-La, in the film "Lost Horizon" (1937), was a modern white pavilion, another candidate for fairdom. The hunger for peace in a war-torn world, expressed in that film, met its match in reality at the fair, as the 1939 theme, "The World of Tomorrow," gave way to "For Peace and Freedom" in 1940.
The pull of the future must have been remarkable, because my parents, wary of crowds with their threat of polio epidemics, conquered their fears and took my sister, Simone, and me to view "The World of Tomorrow." Despite its architectural distinction, the fair was primarily family fun, and there was more than a bit of carney in its heart.
It is claimed that Walt Disney got his notion for Disneyland from the '39 fair. But to say that it was the precursor of Disneyland is to diminish it, for the early Disneyland offered a cozy make-believe past, while the fair gave us a spacious, gleaming make-believe future, far preferable to most Americans, who saw their recent past as something to surmount, not celebrate.
The fair set its sights on 1960 as its future. Many of its predictions would come true: machines would wash dishes and clothes, cars would be streamlined, suburbs would abound, television would entertain us and interstate highways would connect, and separate, us.
But the futurists of the time did not foresee the possibility of abandoned inner cities or the devastating consequences of economic and racial inequality. With World War II just around the corner, the fair's architects and industrial designers seemed to suggest that many of the world's ills could be cured by the judicious use of pale geometric shapes, with fountains and lagoons, leading to a new, modernist aesthetic that would assure a just society.
There was a breathtaking innocence to that fair. There was also that inexorable American optimism symbolized in the Trylon and Perisphere, undefeated by the Depression, strong despite the victories of fascism in Europe and the closing of the pavilions of the conquered nations.
With all this in mind -- well, actually with none of this in mind -- Wally Harper and I set out to memorialize the world of the fair in our musical, abetted by the souvenir Heinz pickle pins and Planter's Peanut men, hoping to capture the comic postcard charm that was also its hallmark. So, if I cannot repossess the symbols of my youth on eBay, I am privileged to relive it onstage with "Say Yes!" And if the show is successful, watch out Fairfiend, WF39 will be unstoppable.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The 400 Block of East 91st Street;
A West Side Food Name Shapes an East Side Block

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
FREE ASSOCIATE "Zabar's," and after "smoked salmon" you'll probably get "West Side." But there's another Zabar in the business, and for the last decade Eli Zabar has been remolding the low-rise block of East 91st Street from First to York Avenue from a street of miscellaneous light industry into a sprawling upscale food village centered on his Vinegar Factory at 429 East 91st.
In the mid-19th century, the East 90's near the East River had little of the development that was dotting the rest of the Upper East Side, perhaps because the large flatland north of 90th Street was a marshy swamp. Fill dumped from building operations gradually produced drier ground, and by the 1880's industries began locating in the area because of its nearby water access. 
 The most prominent of the newcomers was the large stoneyard that the contractor Thomas Osborne built. It covered several lots, including the site where the Vinegar Factory now stands. Osborne, who built the big brownstone-faced apartment house at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue that bears his name, died in his stoneyard in 1892, seven years after he lost the Osborne apartment house in foreclosure.
The oldest buildings now on the 400 block of East 91st Street date from that period, like the two factories at 403 and 407 built in the mid-1880's by another stone contractor, John J. Schillinger. He specialized in the new "artificial stone," which was rapidly replacing traditional bluestone sidewalks, and put his monogram, J S, on 403 East 91st.
Building records are contradictory for the gemlike brick and terra cotta building at 419 East 91st, but it appears that it was built in 1886 by the ironworkers James and Thomas Hunter as a combination residence and workshop, designed by the architect George Spitzer. The block also had a cigar factory, laundry and similar businesses.
In 1909 Charles Roos built the copper works at 429 East 91st Street, designed by Kastner & Dell. Across the street, the contractor and alderman James E. Gaffney built 434 and 440 East 91st in the early 1910's, at the time he owned the Boston Braves, now the Atlanta Braves.
The most striking architecture on the block came in 1930, when Horace Ginsbern designed the Art Deco garage at 406 East 91st, with zigzag decoration in multicolored brick.
Except for some big apartment buildings on York Avenue, the block had changed little when Eli Zabar arrived in the early 1990's. Mr. Zabar's father, Louis, founded the famous Zabar's at 80th and Broadway in the 1930's. After attending the Fieldston School and Hobart College, Eli Zabar tried business school and teaching. He decided, however, to follow in the family footsteps, but at some distance from his older brothers, Stanley and Saul, who run the West Side store with an unrelated partner.
ELI ZABAR founded E.A.T., a combination of takeout delicatessen and prepared foods and eat-in cafe, at 1064 Madison Avenue, between 80th and 81st Streets, in 1973, and in 1991 he rented the lower floors of 403 East 91st Street to make bread for E.A.T. and other customers. In 1993, the year the popular Aquacenter athletic facility opened at 91st and York, Mr. Zabar bought the old copper works at 429 East 91st, which by then was a Baker's Brand mustard and vinegar factory.
He and his architect, Richard Lewis, adapted the building to sell and serve food, keeping or reusing much of the original character -- like the giant hooks and lifts left over from the copper works -- and cutting old vinegar barrels in half for tables.
"We try to find the story in things," he says, "and here the story was very clear: a factory building, sort of rough, and we wanted to keep it rough."
Since then Mr. Zabar's food operations have come to dominate the block, from the aroma of bread to the sound of shovelfuls of ice sprinkled over produce to the occasional barricades of pallets of supplies. Now they include, moving from York Avenue west to First, a cafe and magazine store on the York Avenue corner; an old tinware factory at 430 East 91st, which he bought last year and is converting to a bakery; the original Vinegar Factory with its rooftop greenhouse at 429 East 91st Street; the adjacent garage building at 421 East 91st; the David Garage at 422 East 91st; a repair shop for his trucks at 420 East 91st; and his existing bakery operation at 403 East 91st. Mr. Zabar owns all the buildings except for the original bakery. He also operates a large store and restaurant at 80th Street and Third Avenue.
Every day the restless Mr. Zabar zooms through his side-street empire, constantly tinkering, rearranging, improving. And it is a handyman's fantasy: the bakery, for instance, has a Piranesi-style complex of rolling belts carrying bread through, around and over the ovens; the Vinegar Factory has unusual touches such as giant wooden window hatches suspended from the ceiling with complicated pulley mechanisms. There's nothing cutesy, nothing that looks restored. Architecturally it's more salvage than preservation, which fits into Mr. Zabar's innate sense of economy: "Working with leftovers excites me," he says, referring to both food and nonfood items.
IN 1998 Mr. Zabar added a tomato greenhouse on the roof of the Vinegar Factory and the adjacent building. It's a light, airy plastic shed. The tinkerer in him loves the fact that he uses the hot air from the pastry ovens below to moderate the temperature of the tomatoes on the roof.
Across the street at 430 East 91st, Mr. Zabar's newest project is rooftop steel for another greenhouse, this one for lettuce. Mr. Zabar can't give a bottom line account of whether the original $100,000 greenhouse has been a good investment: "I don't really calculate costs," he says. "If you do things right, it will work out."
Mr. Zabar has more than 200 employees chopping, kneading, broiling, icing, wrapping, checking, driving and everything else necessary to feed the stream of shoppers who make the block a destination. "I don't think there were 26 people who walked down the block 10 years ago, and now we have 9,000 a week just go through the cash registers," in addition to the restaurant traffic, Mr. Zabar says.
Mr. Zabar's operation spreads over about 38,000 square feet of mostly contiguous real estate.
Has the idea of building instead of baking come up?
"Periodically we look at it, but then we get confused and move on to something else" says Mr. Lewis, the architect. "Someday, maybe," says Mr. Zabar, drifting off and looking a little vacant. But then he snaps back to attention when he sees a problem on the sidewalk -- a parking stanchion out of alignment -- that needs fixing.

HEADLINE: More People Calling Cincinnati's Downtown Home

BYLINE: By JOHN ECKBERG 

 BODY:
WHEN the Hofmeyer family bought the decrepit Biltmore apartment building on West Fourth Street in downtown Cincinnati in 1990 and two years later the Lombardi, a historic but condemned apartment building on an adjacent lot, banks balked at loans to update the units. Housing in the city's central business district was in a downward spiral. Parking was scarce. There was no grocery, and few young professionals were ready to live in a Midwestern downtown.
Nevertheless, Max and Angela Hofmeyer and their five sons, who own a plumbing company, concluded that their out-of-pocket investment in upgrading the two distressed buildings would pay off. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Hofmeyer -- both are now 68 -- sold their house on two acres in a suburban neighborhood on the west side of town, and at an age when many Americans would be looking to retire to a beach community became part of a Cincinnati back-to-the-city movement, living in one of the buildings that they were refurbishing.
They knew there would be challenges. After all, the Biltmore was half-occupied and four of the 28 apartments had never been completed after a previous attempt at renovation. The family was confident, however, that the building could be returned to its former glory. There were tall ceilings, white marble hallways, exposed brick walls and distinctive windows in a building that at one time had been a coveted address.
"There was risk, but we knew felt comfortable knowing that after a lot of work we would have quality apartments, and quality apartments will have renters," said their son Paul, who helped update kitchens and bathrooms in both buildings.
Because of investors like the Hofmeyers -- and heavy public subsidies for other projects -- the population of the square-mile Cincinnati Central Business District has reached levels not seen for decades.
The population increase is similar to the trend back to downtown that has been noted in other cities across the nation. Eugenie Birch, who heads the department of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has compared housing trends in 40 American cities from 1990 to 1999 and found that one in four have returned to 1970 population levels.
In her 1999 study, "Downtown Living: A Deeper Look," she reported that Cincinnati had one of the more robust markets for downtown housing in the nation.
She estimated that 4,810 people lived downtown in 1999, up from 3,838 in 1990. Kathy Schwab, residential development adviser to Downtown Cincinnati Inc., a nonprofit group, said that there were about 2,100 housing units downtown, with 10 or so buildings restored or converted, five more under construction and two projects in development.
"What people were reflecting anecdotally -- that more people were moving back downtown - was really happening in some cities like Cincinnati," Professor Birch said. "This is a fragile trend that has happened for a lot of reasons. People want to walk to work. They like an urban life with all its attachments: good restaurants, theater and art museums."
"They are living in lofts, converted factories," she added. "It's a lifestyle choice."
Professor Birch initiated her study when she reviewed a 1998 report by the Brookings Institution and Fannie Mae, the federally chartered mortgage financing corporation, that showed many American cities expected to see a healthy increase in downtown housing. In that report, however, Cincinnati was not in the top tier. Planners had projected that only 3,500 people would be living in the central business district by 2010, about the same number they thought were living downtown in Columbus and Pittsburgh today. But that study of 26 cities did not have fixed central business district boundaries, and planners had estimated downtown boundaries and populations.
While Professor Birch thought that the methodology of the report could be sharpened, she agreed with the finding that there was a broad trend of people moving back to downtown. IN preparing her study, she focused on the growth in the number of downtown households, and restricted the geographical scope of the report to core blocks. Instead of relying on rough estimates by local planners, she bought data from Claritas, a company that specializes in demographic and economic data. Cities with downtowns that posted significant gains, according to her study, included Dallas, Denver, Colorado Springs, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., and Portland, Ore.
The Hofmeyers never regretted their move from suburbia to downtown, though they have now returned to a suburb to be closer to grandchildren. "We had a rooftop deck with views of downtown and the river," Mrs. Hofmeyer said. "But at the beginning friends told us we were nuts."
The Hofmeyers' two buildings had a waiting list until earlier this year, when some tenants fled because of inconveniences from the construction of a new football stadium for the Cincinnati Bengals about three blocks south. Seven vacancies resulted, all of which have since been filled, although the waiting list is a thing of the past, at least for now. Other buildings where young and single tenants live include a former cigar warehouse called East Eighth Lofts, where all 45 units were rented in 60 days last fall. Other apartments have gone into the former Shillito Department Store.
Nicholas Bonner, a professor of art at Northern Kentucky University, moved into East Eighth Lofts last fall after spurning "cookie-cutter" complexes in nearby suburbs. The central location means he spends less for gasoline and has a manageable commute to the university six miles south. Also, he said, he is not contributing to urban sprawl, though the lack of a grocery downtown remains an inconvenience. He pays $670 a month in rent, which does not include utilities, and $120 a month for two parking spots.
"I bet half the people in the building are lawyers, doctors or professionals," Mr. Bonner said. "I love it downtown: to walk out the door and see an opening at the Contemporary Arts Center or go grab something to eat."
Among the challenges for developers has been competition from other neighborhoods and the city's historically low housing costs, said Ralph D. Bolton, the former head of Cincinnati downtown development and now a principal at the architecture firm of Brashear Bolton.
"There were and are very good neighborhoods close to downtown that were accessible and had relatively inexpensive housing stock and apartments," he said. "What has to happen for downtown housing to be attractive is it must attract people from those neighborhoods: offer some kind of vitality and value."
Rising rents and property values in recent years in nearby neighborhoods like Clifton and Hyde Park that have long attracted young professionals has also added to the attraction of downtown housing. In the 1970's and 1980's, most housing downtown was aimed at low-income residents. Today the mix includes more upper- and middle-income residents, and as a result restaurants and clubs are opening in long-vacant buildings.
Apartments in the Biltmore and Lombardi bring $350 to $725 in rent, but that does not include $75 a month for a parking slot.
A few units go for more: the rent for a two-bedroom townhouse with deck is $800 a month and approaches $900 when parking is included. Although that may seem a bargain when compared with rents in major cities like New York and Chicago, it is pricey by Cincinnati standards.
The Hofmeyers are in the market to buy another apartment building downtown, but times have changed. A nearby shell carries a $325,000 price tag -- far from the $10 that the Hofmeyers paid the city for the Lombardi nearly a decade ago.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
In Bayonne, Selling Shares to a Home-Grown Bank

BYLINE: By ANITA DENNIS

DATELINE: BAYONNE

 BODY:
Bailey Building and Loan. Bayonne Community Bank. Different places, same idea.
In a city where children often attend the same grammar schools their parents did, and where parents and their grown children often live together in two-family houses, merchants had become annoyed at the impersonal service they were receiving at banks owned by the larger out-of-town institutions. 
 The solution? They decided about a year ago to open their own place to put their money, and the result is the Bayonne Community Bank, a grass-roots venture that is being financed by longtime residents of this working-class waterfront town.
"I've been in business here 27 years," said H. Mickley McCabe, who is chairman of the new bank. "I'm president of the economic development corporation, I was vice president of the chamber of commerce. But now I go into a bank and they ask me for ID. If you go into a community bank, you know them and they know you."
As a result, the bank's founders worked hard to cultivate community support, beginning with an open house last November on the bank's planned site at 40th Street and Broadway, in the heart of the town's commercial district. After two subsequent informational meetings at local restaurants, a large percentage of the 250 to 300 people who attended ultimately bought shares in the bank at $10 each, said Donald Mindiak, the bank's chief executive.
The bank, which is awaiting charter approval from state and federal regulators, has the $5 million initial capitalization required by the state and is hoping to have $6 million before it opens in September, Mr. Mindiak said.
Long a vibrant industrial stronghold, Bayonne has in the last decade been abandoned by large employers ranging from Texaco to the Army. Moreover, 50 years ago this city of about 60,000, which sits on a three-square-mile peninsula, was cut off from its nearest neighbor, Jersey City, by the turnpike's Newark Bay extension.
But about three months ago it became much more accessible with the opening of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line, which can deliver Manhattan-bound commuters from Bayonne to the Exchange Place PATH station in as little as 15 minutes.
"Bayonne is the unclaimed jewel," Mr. McCabe said in a recent interview.
Although the city missed out on previous real estate booms in Hudson County, Mr. McCabe and his fellow investors hope Bayonne can finally attract the kinds of young professionals who flocked to Hoboken in the early 1980's in search of affordable housing, as well as families who are tired of long commutes to Manhattan from the distant suburbs.
"The city of Bayonne is in a perfect position to revitalize itself through the advent of light rail," he said, pointing to the two most evident symbols of the city's hard times -- a 70-acre former Texaco site that needed years of environmental cleanup, and the shuttered Military Ocean Terminal, which not long ago employed 2,500 people.
Newly created, or de novo, banks, are often run by people like Mr. Mindiak -- who was born and raised here but lost his job as treasurer of the First Savings Bank of New Jersey when it was bought out by Richmond County Savings, which has its headquarters on Staten Island. Indeed, about 25 such banks have opened in New Jersey in the past couple of years, said Jim Meredith, senior vice president of the New Jersey League-Community and Savings Bankers.
"They are defined by their philosophy more than anything else," Mr. Meredith said. "Management tends to be very involved in the community and in local civic organizations."
One recent day, Mr. Mindiak was greeted by several passers-by during the one-block walk from the bank's temporary offices at 42nd Street and Broadway to its 4,700-square-foot construction site a little more than a block away. He said the bank's neighbors were shown blueprints before the building was even begun, and they were asked to offer suggestions or concerns.
"This is an extremely traditional town with traditional values," he said. For instance, he said research had found that in Bayonne, regular passbook savings accounts rather than high-interest-bearing CD's or money market accounts made up the highest percentage of deposits.
Once the new building opens on 40th Street, it will feature off-street parking, a three-lane drive-through window and two automated teller machines -- one of them a drive-through. They hope to keep the bank open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week, although they concede that those hours may not be feasible at first. "People shouldn't be waiting for us to open up, we should be waiting for them to come," Mr. Mindiak said.
His philosophy is in sharp contrast to many of today's large financial institutions. "In New Jersey, several out-of-state banks have come in and acquired banks," Mr. Meredith said, "and they are often not as responsive to the local communities and their small or mid-size businesses and local retailers."
In this instance, Mr. McCabe, who lives and works within a block of the bank, says that all of the board members and executives were born, raised or own businesses in Bayonne, which he believes distinguishes it from other area savings banks.
One Bayonne resident, John Halecky, a councilman whose family owns a pharmacy one block from the new bank, said he had recently bought shares in the bank because the board included so many familiar names.
"It's all the local movers and shakers," said Mr. Halecky, who added that he was also attracted by the prospect of investing in his hometown. "I think the future of Bayonne is bright."

HEADLINE: A Deep-Water Discovery;
Virtually Unknown a Few Years Ago, The Stonington Red Is Catching On

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

 BODY:
FROM November to June, customers hound Jo Bomster of Stonington Seafood Harvesters for what the locals call "Stonington Reds."
"They think we're hiding it in here. They think we've got secret pockets or something," said Ms. Bomster, whose family operates a wholesale and retail seafood operation near the Town Dock in the borough. 
 What people are clamoring for are royal red shrimp, a species that lives in such deep water that they are caught by just a handful of boats in the Northeast and only one in Connecticut. The shrimp was almost unheard of before 1995, but since its discovery word of the shrimp has spread. They have increasingly been turning up on dinner tables and in restaurants around the region, where, chefs say, the Red's higher fat content make them sweeter and more tender than Gulf Coast shrimp.
The shrimp can be found at the Daniel Packer Inne in Mystic and on the fruits de mer platter, as a fancy garnish, or as part of a ceviche in a large martini glass at London Lennie's in Forest Hills, N.Y. They're being sold at Citarella, a gourmet food store in Manhattan and the Hamptons. And at Rent A Chef, an upscale fish market with four locations in northwestern Connecticut, they're being bought by customers, many of them New Yorkers who have weekend homes in the area.
"We buy 200 to 300 pounds at a time," said Carol Herman, the owner of Rent A Chef. "One lady buys four or five pounds a week from us."
 The shrimp became available in the state out of pure economic necessity, when Ms. Bomster's husband, Bill, a scallop fisherman who was worried about his dwindling catch, decided to search for another way to make a living from the sea.
He obtained a $118,000 federal grant to look for scarlet shrimp, which were known to live in deep water off the coast of New England. With stocks of cod and other popular species overfished, the National Marine Fisheries Service was giving grants to Northeast fishermen to find and market so-called underutilized species.
Mr. Bomster headed to the Atlantic with his crew and also on board was a scientist from the University of Connecticut to help identify whatever Bomster found. He found few scarlet shrimp, but thousands of its cousin, the royal red shrimp. When he and others tasted the surprise catch, they knew they were on to something.
 Distributors such as Gambardella Wholesale Fish Dealers of Stonington and East Haven, and Emerald Seafood in New York City's Fulton Fish Market, are trying to get the word out about the shrimp to restaurants and fish markets in the tri-state area. Greater demand may convince other fishermen to make the $50,000 to $100,000 initial investment for the nets, gear, freezers and other processing equipment needed to catch and process the shrimp.
"People love them. Especially the high-end restaurants. They remember them from last year and they ask for them," said Thomas Flanigan, president of Emerald Seafood. "I could sell them all year long if I could get them."
But Alan Chaplaski, captain of the Stonington-based fishing boat, Neptune, who is renting Mr. Bomster's shrimping gear, can only fish the area from June through November because it is reserved for offshore lobster gear the rest of the year. Mr. Chaplaski, the only Connecticut fisherman catching the shrimp, would be unable to tow a shrimp net through the area during those times without damaging lobster pots.
Michael Gambardella, whose company sells about 20,000 pounds of the shrimp each year, said it has been a little bit of a battle to introduce a product most people have never seen. Much of the demand has been local and distributors have been trying to introduce the shrimp to the rest of the state and to New York.
"We've been doing it in bits and pieces," Mr. Gambardella said.
Nancy Balcom, the extension educator with the Sea Grant College program at the University of Connecticut in Groton, helped write the report about Mr. Bomster's grant results. She said there are not enough shrimp in the area Mr. Bomster explored to support a large number of boats. She is not surprised more fishermen have not started to catch the shrimp because of the expense of new gear and the uncertainty of finding new areas.
If the popularity of red shrimp increases, Ms. Balcom said more fishermen may decide to catch the shrimp, especially on a part-time basis. She said some red shrimp are also caught in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, but they are not sent to other parts of the country. In both places, they are found in about 50-degree water.
Mr. Bomster received the grant to locate areas where scarlet shrimp and other deep-water species live and do a marketing study and a scientific analysis. The goal of the study was to determine if there were enough scarlet shrimp to sustain a commercial fleet.
The grant paid for deep-water nets, almost two miles of wire need to tow it and other gear. It also paid for his crew, fuel, food, ice and the salary of a scientist who accompanied the crew. Without the grant, Mr. Bomster would not have been able to afford the search.
"We didn't have to worry about making money. We could move around and try different depths and different places," he said.
Mr. Bomster and the crew of the Patty Jo made three 10-day trips in 1995, covering an area from Block Island, R.I. to Virginia. Mr. Bomster hauled up few of the scarlet shrimp. But what he did find in his nets were hundreds of pounds of royal red shrimp. The shrimp, which can be as long as 10 inches, were mostly found in a 20-mile-long by half-mile wide stretch of the Continental Shelf about 100 miles southeast of Stonington. The focus of the grant quickly shifted to the royal red shrimp and the results were reported in a detailed booklet.
Today, the 50-year-old Mr. Chaplaski fishes that same 1,200-foot-deep stretch of ocean, leasing the gear and nets from Mr. Bomster, who returned to scalloping when that fishery improved.
Mr. Chaplaski and his three-man crew begins the four-day shrimp trips by steaming 12 hours to the fishing grounds. His crew works long hours with only a few short breaks for sleep. With no freezer capability on board, he must put the shrimp on ice and get them back to the dealer before they spoil.
He and his crew spend four days in port unloading shrimp, doing repairs and loading supplies before heading out to sea again.
Catching red shrimp is hard work for the crew. After they haul the bottom trawling net on board, they chill the shrimp and break off their heads by hand. They sort, wash and place the shrimp in a solution that prevents unsightly black spots from forming on their shells. They then put the shrimp back on ice. At the dock the crew has to remove the shrimp from the ice, wash and sort through them on a conveyor belt, weeding out damaged ones. On a typical trip, the crew will handle 80,000 shrimp.
The shrimp also move around the fishing grounds. This forces Mr. Chaplaski, who had been fishing his whole life and has associate degrees in science, engineering and commercial fishing, to make an educated guess about where they have gone.
"Learning their spots is a trade secret," he said with a smile.
Mr. Chaplaski said he knows of only two other boats, one each from New Jersey and Massachusetts, that catch red shrimp. He said there might soon be another Connecticut boat joining the group.
"It's a lot of work and people are making money doing other things," said Mr. Chaplaski, who catches squid, whiting and fluke the rest of the year. "Some people are also not as adventurous. They like doing something more conservative."
He decided to lease the equipment from Mr. Bomster in 1997 when fishing became poor in the summer.
"It looked like something good. I said, "This is a chance for me to get in on the ground floor," he said, referring to boats that typically flock to a new fishery once they see others being successful.
Ms. Balcom of the University of Connecticut said there has to be a steady supply to make the shrimp popular with consumers.
"If you can't meet the demand continuously, people tend to lose interest in a product," she said.
Ms. Balcom said a scientist at the University of Connecticut is hoping to obtain some live red shrimp from Mr. Chaplaski so he can attempt to raise them in an aquaculture setting. That could result in a more steady supply.
Mr. and Ms. Bomster freeze some of the shrimp and sell it to local restaurants and individual consumers. The shrimp is also sold at the Stonington Farmer's Market every Saturday morning and sells out quickly. Consumers can also buy it off the dock when it arrives.
Mr. Gambardella is selling it to restaurants and fish markets along the Connecticut coast. He has also shipped some to Spain and is trying to break into the trendy Los Angeles market.
Michael Stafford, the executive chef at the Daniel Packer Inne in Mystic, has been serving the shrimp ever since Mr. Bomster first caught them.
"Everyone who has them just loves them," he said. "On the menu I say they are 'amazingly sweet and incredibly tender.' Nobody has ever called me a liar."
Mr. Stafford serves the shrimp lightly sauteed with sundried tomato pesto, fresh Swiss chard, roasted garlic, Chardonnay and angel hair pasta. Others say the shrimp are so flavorful they eat them plain.
Royal red shrimp cooks much quicker than Gulf shrimp. Searing takes just 90 seconds. Mr. Chaplaski drops them in boiling water and then removes them when the pot boils for a second time. It's easy to overcook the shrimp, turning them to mush.
Some factors preventing the shrimp from making a big splash have been the limited supply and higher price. Without expensive freezing equipment on board, boats have to return quickly to sell the shrimp. This also limits the money boats can earn.
For the shrimp to really catch on with the public, Mr. Flanigan from Emerald Seafood, said the price would have to drop about 30 percent from it current $8 to $9 a pound.
"It's a nice item, but it's still pricey," he said.
Mr. Gambardella said that if a few high-profile New York chefs tried the Stonington Reds, they would become the next big thing.
"But we'll get it to the next level. I'm confident we'll do it," Mr. Gambardella said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Conversions and New Construction;
New Manhattan Hotels Are Finding a Ready Market

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE seemingly unending boom in the hotel business in New York continued unabated during the first half of this year, despite an influx of new rooms and the prospect of more to come.
According to a survey by PKF Consulting, which specializes in the hospitality industry, the occupancy rate in Manhattan reached 84.4 percent, a record for any six-month period since the firm began collecting statistics in the 1920's. 
 The average cost of spending a night reached $224.83 during the period, also a record, and an 8.0 percent increase compared with the same period last year. And the trend is upward. PKF reported that the average room rate for the month of June was $236.54, an 11.7 percent increase over June 1999.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm, which conducts a similar survey, reported the occupancy rate at 84 percent and the average room rate at $249 a night.
"Occupancy and room rates were at record levels, and this is supposed to be the slow half of the year," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF, who explained that demand for hotel rooms is typically lower in the January-to-June months than in July to December, a period of vacations and holidays when people are more apt to travel to New York.
"Hotels in the city are selling out 200 to 250 nights a year, which means they are turning away business, so I am not concerned that we are going to be adding some rooms," Mr. Fox added.
He said the strong market of the last few years has encouraged the development of hotel projects, including the conversion of office buildings and the upgrading of single-room-occupancy hotels to those catering to transients.
Some 4,000 to 4,500 hotel rooms are expected to be added to the New York market this year, one of the largest expansions in recent years.
Tourist interest in New York accounts for much of the demand for lodging in the city, as the crowds surging through Times Square and along Fifth Avenue every day attest.
But the buoyant economy, which is gobbling up office space in the city, is increasing demand from business travelers as well.
Bjorn Hanson, the global leader of the PricewaterhouseCoopers hospitality practice, has calculated that every additional 100 square feet of office space that is occupied in the city generates 0.7 room nights of hotel demand.
Responding to this demand, developers are rushing to complete new hotels, most of them conversions of existing buildings. An exception to this trend is the Sofitel that opened earlier month on 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas; it was new construction from the ground up. Rooms cost $350 a night, andsuites, $450.
Another new entrant in the market is the Red Roof Inn Manhattan, the franchise chain's first in New York City, on 32nd Street just west of Fifth Avenue in a converted office building not far from Herald Square. The hotel was developed by Apple Core Hotels, a company owned by the Horn and Kohane families that has four other moderately priced hotels in Midtown Manhattan and a hotel and conference center in Hempstead, N.Y.
The $23 million conversion of the 17-story loft building on 32nd Street has produced a hotel with 171 guest rooms plus a business center, exercise room, meeting space and a breakfast room.
Room rates will range from $89 to $329 a night, which is in marked contrast to some of the other new boutique hotels scheduled to open soon, where room rates will start at nearly $300 a night.
Vijay Dandapani, Apple Core's chief operating officer, said converting the old loft building to a hotel was difficult, particularly so because a retail store on the first floor refused to leave, limiting the size of the lobby. He said that passenger elevators are now where the freight elevators were in the old building, and the shafts for the old passenger elevators are occupied by a stairwell.
"Just about everything is new, but the four walls on the outside," he said.
Since the building is hemmed in on three sides on the lower floors, most of those floors were unsuitable for guest rooms, which have to have a window. So that is where the exercise, conference, business and breakfast rooms were situated. On the upper floors, windows have been punched through the walls, even though the view is often only of the roofs of lower buildings nearby.
BUT there will be some sweeping views from a glass-enclosed rooftop bar, which Mr. Dandapani hopes to complete within a year.
A similar rooftop bar already exists at the Best Western Manhattan, which Apple Core also owns. It is on the north side of 32nd Street, just to the west of the Red Roof, and hotel guests there can take in the sight of the Empire State Building looming in the background only a block away.
Apple Core's other hotels, all developed in the last five years, are the Quality Hotel & Suites at 59 West 46th Street; the Comfort Inn at 129 West 46th Street; and the Quality Hotel at 161 Lexington Avenue (30th Street).
Although all the hotels are operated in collaboration with national chains, Mr. Dandapani said Apple Core has its own reservation system, which brings in about 50 percent of the reservations independent of the franchise affiliations. It is staffed 24 hours a day, he said, to avoid forcing front-desk clerks to make reservations in addition to their other duties.
Mr. Dandapani said the Apple Core's occupancy rate runs well over 90 percent and said that the group was looking for other properties to develop as hotels in New York. But, he added, they must be well located and suitable for conversion.
One building that Apple Core bought but later decided was not suitable for its market is the old Leavitt Building at 130 West 46th Street. Acquired from Apple Core for the Mass Mutual Financial Group by Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers, the new hotel is scheduled to open next month as the Muse, with 200 rooms. It is being described as a boutique hotel that will emphasize personal service at rates that will range from $295 to $395 a night.
The hotel's proximity to the theater district will be emphasized in a ground-floor restaurant -- so far unnamed -- that was designed by David Rockwell, who did such restaurants as Nobu and Heartbeat. The exterior will have a simulated curtain of woven stainless steel drawn up to one side as if opening onto a stage. Inside, the decorations will include simulated theater scenery with banks of spotlights.
The restaurant will have 85 seats and will provide room service for the hotel and a complimentary buffet called the "midnight pantry," where guests can find cookies and desserts, fruit and cheese plates and ice cream after a night at the theater.
Another boutique hotel scheduled to open late this summer is the Dylan, in the former Chemists Club at 52 East 41st Street, between Madison and Park Avenues. The renovation of the 1903 building cost Morris Moinian, the developer, $30 million and produced a 108-room hotel, with rates of $295 to $450 a night.
The hotel's restaurant will be called Rx, with a nod to the building's past. The hotel will have two conference rooms that can be combined to seat up to 75 people. Guest rooms will have high-speed access to the Internet and a television set with Web access.
The Grand Central Partnership, the local business improvement district, is planting trees along the sidewalks in the area and installing antique-style street lamps with hanging flower baskets. Plans are to designate that section of 41st Street as Library Walk in recognition of its proximity to the New York Public Library and to install plaques in the sidewalk with quotes from famous books.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Democrats Pick an Odd Time To Fight Over a Distant Race

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Leave it to those fractious Democrats to remind everyone what is important in New Jersey politics.
Anyone who gave even a thought to politics in midsummer might have believed that the important events on the landscape were the presidential campaign and the race for the United States Senate between Representative Robert D. Franks and Jon Corzine. 
 Wrong. The important race is for governor, the one job in the state with real power, and Senator Robert Torricelli, who is still in his first term, reminded voters of that this month when he decided that he wanted the job after all.
Until now, the Democratic front-runner had been James McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge and the man who came within a percentage point of beating Governor Whitman in 1997 when other incumbent Republicans in the Northeast were winning by 20 percent. Mr. McGreevey has been assiduously raising money and corralling support for a second try ever since, and it seemed to be working -- until the man they call the Torch lit things up.
Until 10 days ago, Senator Torricelli had said he was interested only in running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, of which he is chairman, apparently because he believed there would be plenty of time to toy with the race for governor before next April's primary filing deadline. But Mr. McGreevey was rapidly sewing up the nomination and Mr. Torricelli evidently decided that he could not wait.
"He saw that he was crossing the Rubicon," State Senator Ray Lesniak, a long-time McGreevey supporter, said. "McGreevey was about to lock up the nomination -- he had raised more than $3 million for the party and the major counties were coming out for him."
But it was probably not only Mr. Torricelli who was suddenly interested in the governorship. The outpouring of support for him from around the state, from the leadership of Bergen and Somerset Counties, from -- of all people -- a roster of South Jersey Democrats appealing to the Bergen County man to run, suggest that, once the senator had informally announced, the party leadership was ready to rally to his side in the belief that Mr. Torricelli had the best chance to win.
"When the people in South Jersey said we like this guy from North Jersey, our ears picked up," said Rocco A. Mazza, executive director of the Democratic Committee of Bergen County. "We don't know of many times when that's happened."
So the Bergen Democrats, including Joseph Ferriero, the county chairman, issued a statement last Wednesday calling on Mr. Torricelli to announce formally and implicitly gave him their endorsement. The Somerset County Democrats, eager for a candidate who could pull swing voters from their suburban county, also jumped on board.
And in Hudson County, Robert C. Janiszewski, the county executive who is a rising power in the state Democratic Party, switched sides and came out for Mr. Torricelli. This prompted Mr. McGreevey to try to take back the appointment of Mr. Janiszewski's wife, Beth, to the $95,000-a-year job as director of the state committee on the ground that he had raised the money for her salary.
Significantly, Thomas P. Giblin, the state party chairman and originally a McGreevey supporter, denied the request.
Mr. Torricelli's backers say nice things about Mr. McGreevey on the record and less nice things about him under the shadow of anonymity. Publicly, they say the wholesale abandonment of Mr. McGreevey's camp owes simply to the view that Mr. Torricelli, a national figure with statewide recognition, is most likely to win, particularly if his opponent is another Italian-American, Donald DiFranceso, president of the state Senate.
"The party senses that McGreevey would make a fantastic candidate," Mr. Mazza said, "but the difference is that Torricelli has statewide stature and national stature, and is far superior in the gravitas department. It's the difference between filet mignon and New York strip steak."
Mr. Mazza said the choice amounted to having a good chance with Mr. McGreevey and a sure thing in Mr. Torricelli, and a sure thing is particularly what the Democrats say they need next year. For one thing, they believe that the Whitman administration has proved that, barring scandal or economic recession, a competent Democratic administration is good for at least eight years and in all likelihood a majority in the Legislature.
By last Thursday, Mr. McGreevey had regrouped his forces at a rally in Newark, which was attended by about 200 supporters from his core constituencies in unions and in the cities. They were loud in their support for the man who took on Mrs. Whitman in 1977, and loud in their contempt for Mr. Torricelli, who they say is dropping out of the sky at the last moment to reap what Mr. McGreevey has sown.
So the Democrats will end up with the one thing they did not want next year, a divisive primary fought out between the party leadership backing Mr. Torricelli and grass-roots sentiment for Mr. McGreevey.
Senator Lesniak seemed resigned to the idea that Democrats would fight among themselves, as they so often had, if only they would do it in the proper election cycle.
"We all wish this didn't happen," Mr. Lesniak said, "but we also wish that if there was going to be a fight, it would wait until after November, and after we've elected Al Gore and Jon Corzine."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Sohmer Building Being Converted to Apartments;
From Piano Keys to Condo Keys

 BODY:
The century-old, 13-story Sohmer Building at 170 Fifth Avenue, at 22nd Street, which once attracted piano purchasers to its showroom, is being converted to a residential condominium as its commercial tenants leave. Topping the building is a $7.5 million, 4,936-square-foot duplex that includes a golden-domed octagonal cupola featuring a 360-degree view, a 40-foot-high ceiling and a band of eight 8-foot-high clerestory windows atop another set of eight 10-foot-high windows at living-room level.
The 1897 Beaux-Arts building, which is part of the Ladies Mile Historic District, is to have 10 full-floor, 2,736-square-foot apartments below the duplex. 
 The structure was originally designed by Robert Maynicke, just southwest of the Flatiron Building, to house the Sohmer piano showroom and offices. Its exterior gold dome, recently regilded, is a familiar sight, glittering by day and illuminated by night.
Leslie Gill whose architectural firm is working with Bryce Sanders Architecture/Design on the conversion of the building, compared being in the cupola to "standing in the lantern of a church." She said that they were trying to make the space feel like "an urban retreat."
Mr. Sanders envisioned the 307-square-foot space as a library, including bookcases between windows and a telescope.
Sheldon Stein, president of the Valhal Corp., the developer, said that "shadows dance around the room from sunrise to sunset." Valhal paid $7.2 million for the office building in 1989.
Living in the dome isn't a new idea. Richard Welling, a founder of the City Club and a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, called the cupola home in 1908. His family had owned the building.
Valhal began converting vacated office space in the building a year and a half ago. A complete conversion was approved by the New York City Planning Commission early this year.
Besides the duplex, three other apartments are now available, costing from $1.75 million to $2.15 million. Five others have been sold, and four are occupied. The remaining commercial tenants are expected to move out over the next year.
Mr. Stein said his company was spending $7 million on the conversion into apartments. An additional $2 million is going toward new building systems, common areas and exterior renovation. The mansard roof is to be reclad with Vermont red slate, and modern storefronts are to be replaced by bay windows, each with metal ornamentation and copper roof. In the 1990's an aluminum flagpole replaced a rotted wood mast from which the piano company once flew its banner atop the dome.
A concierge will be on duty from 3 to 11 p.m. daily. Two elevators are to open into each apartment. Tenants can purchase space for storage or a wine cellar. The exclusive broker for the duplex is Sotheby's International Realty.
At Valhal's Web site, www.170fifthcondos.com, inquiries have mistakenly come in for piano appraisals and repairs.

HEADLINE: For Once-Gritty TriBeCa, a Golden Glow

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
TRIBECA, the old butter-and-eggs district of Lower Manhattan, isn't sizzling any longer. It's deafening.
More than a dozen construction and large-scale renovation projects are clamoring simultaneously. Jackhammers and backhoes are carving up Greenwich Street, which is being narrowed to create more of a pedestrian promenade. Equipment in the telecommunications hub at 60 Hudson Street rumbles into the night. 
 With all the activity spurred by a robust economy, walking through the once-somnolent TriBeCa is now "like walking through a war zone," said Madelyn Wils, the new chairwoman of Community Board 1, who has lived on Duane Street for 15 years.
But the din includes the playful shrieks of youngsters outside P.S. 234 on Chambers Street, a reminder that while TriBeCa has lost some of its diversity -- and the aroma of roasted coffee and roasted peanuts in the air -- it is "much more of a neighborhood now than it ever was," in the words of Bill Barrett, a sculptor who has lived and worked on Worth Street since 1976.
Even after the opening of the swank TriBeCa Grand Hotel, even under the global spotlight that followed the late John F. Kennedy Jr., who lived on North Moore Street, TriBeCa is still small town -- albeit a town that is industrial at its Belgian-block, iron-canopy core, where residents fight for every inch of lawn and garden.
Its villagelike insularity extends to development, which is dominated not by the mid-Manhattan giants but by smaller builders, mostly in their 40's, many of them local, some of them architects.
What they are building, make no mistake, is housing for the rich. Lofts overlooking the Holland Tunnel exit command $1 million and more. Warehouses and factories where space rented for $1 a square foot in the 1960's are being sold as condominiums for $500 to $800 a square foot.
Roughly half of TriBeCa lies within four historic districts that were designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1991 and 1992. Jennifer J. Raab, the current chairwoman, sees TriBeCa as a "textbook example of how economic development and preservation go hand in hand.
"The real estate market provided the investment that led to the stunning restoration of these gems," she said, "but without historic preservation regulation, there would have been no guarantee that restorations and new construction would have been as sensitive, which would have limited the economic value of the investment."
The rehabilitation of TriBeCa landmarks, though, has come literally at a high price.
"Their preservation and prettification proclaimed a new social reality," Joshua B. Freeman wrote in "Working-Class New York" (The New Press, 2000). "Workers of the type who once created the wealth of Gotham in these very buildings could not afford to enter their portals, nor would they be made to feel welcome if they could."
Carl Glassman, the editor of the monthly Tribeca Trib, belonged to a food co-op 20 years ago. There were no grocery stores then, let alone four-star restaurants.
"I bemoan the fact that only wealthy people can move into the neighborhood," he said. "But I don't have bad feelings toward the people who do move in. I would posit that they are a different breed from other Wall Streeters or new-money types. If you're going to spend $2 million to live in a warehouse, you're different from somebody who wants to live in the suburbs."
So, by and large, are the builders who cater to this market. Glenn D. McDermott, probably the busiest of the lot, has just formed Society B23, a nonprofit group whose mission, he said, is to "preserve the lifestyle" of the world below 23rd Street.
Mr. McDermott, 42, ran the Mudd Club on White Street in his youth and now runs GDM Projects, a 30-person design and development office in NoHo. He said he has 450,000 square feet of space in development in TriBeCa, with much more to come.
His 48 Laight Street project is a six-story loft with bold, horizontal bands of multipane windows along Hudson Street that create an industrial sense. The plan, designed by Dana Sottile of GDM, working with Fritz Johnson, won unanimous approval from the landmarks commission this month. "We appreciated the architect's attempt to make a contextual but modern statement in a historic district," Ms. Raab said.
Before he can build, Mr. McDermott must win a variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals since this residential project is within an M1-5 manufacturing district.
Working with the Whitehall Fund, Mr. McDermott is developing 124 Hudson Street, a nine-story condo at Ericsson Place, one of the first big new buildings in the TriBeCa historic districts. It was designed by Byrns, Kendall & Schieferdecker.
The superstructure is barely up and 18 of the 26 units have been sold, at an average of $750 a square foot, said the broker, James Lansill, director of development at Stribling Marketing Associates. The project, to be completed next May, will cost about $40 million, including land and construction.
Five of the buyers are expectant couples, Mr. Lansill said. Evidently, they are undaunted about moving next to the Holland Tunnel exit plaza (a distant successor to St. John's Park), a tangle of roadway and lawn, with Mark di Suvero's "Joie de Vivre" sculpture at the center.
Both 124 Hudson Street and Cobblestone Lofts, on the north side of the plaza, will have double-pane windows with soundproofing laminate. Barrie Mandel, of the Corcoran Group, the broker for Cobblestone Lofts, said 24 of 29 units had been sold to buyers drawn by the prospect of southern views of open skies and a work by di Suvero.
With Arthur Fefferman and Mark Wallach, Mr. McDermott is developing the Fischer Mills Building at Greenwich and Beach Streets, a 32-unit condo created from 19th-century buildings with two- and three-story additions. The $40 million project, designed by Byrns, Kendall & Schieferdecker, will be largely finished this year.
Also on Mr. McDermott's plate are 3-9 Hubert Street, a 12-story apartment building that is to rise along tiny Collister Street, in a venture with the Whitehall Fund, and 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, a renovation that will include eight floors of apartments and offices, with a penthouse.
John Petrarca, 48, a partner in the architectural firm Guenther Petrarca and a 20-year TriBeCa resident, is another ubiquitous figure. A leader in the "Greening of Greenwich" project, to broaden and relandscape the pedestrian way on Greenwich Street, he is also working on "Hidden TriBeCa," an illustrated book on the distinctive penthouses sprouting around the area.
He is developing the Reade Street Townhouses, five single-family homes on Reade and Greenwich Streets, one of which will be his. The other occupants come from the advertising, entertainment, financial and garment industries. All are under 50. All have children. At 40 Laight Street, a seven-story warehouse, Mr. Petrarca is designing a 14-unit condominium conversion for Bernhardt Development and Geometry Realty.
FOR Robert A. Levine, of the R.A.L. Companies of Hempstead, N.Y., Mr. Petrarca is designing Tower 270, the renovation of the 28-story Arthur Levitt State Office building at 270 Broadway, on Chambers Street, as residential and office space. The broker, Bruce L. Ehrmann, vice president of Stribling Marketing Associates, said the rehabilitation of City Hall Park made this location central to TriBeCa. The project will be finished in 2001.
Mr. Levine, 49, who has worked as a designer and planner, developed the Franklin Tower condominium, a renovated 17-story building at Franklin and Church Streets. Mr. Petrarca was the architect.
Another architect-developer, 47-year-old Aldo Andreoli of Sanba Design and Development Consultants, is creating 12 condos out of an exceptionally handsome 113-year-old former wrapping-paper factory at 140 Franklin Street. Mr. Andreoli has commissioned a lobby mural from Sol LeWitt.
To the north on Varick Street is the 17-story Atalanta, a former warehouse from which some 250 new windows have been carved, in a design by Richard Cook & Associates. The developers include Robert Tiburzi of Houlihan-Parnes Realtors; Angelo Cosentini and John Carson, partners in On the Level Enterprises, a construction company; Michael Greco and John Jacobson.
Mr. Cosentini, 41, and Mr. Carson, 44, are partners with Tom Currier in 58 Thomas Street, a new seven-story, six-unit building for which ground was broken last month. The architects are DeLaCour & Ferrara, who designed 5 Harrison Street, a new six-story, eight-unit building, for Mr. Currier and Philip Mendlow. Mr. Currier, 41, has lived on Jay Street since 1992.
An exception to the home-grown rule is the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, 2 Avenue of the Americas, developed by Hartz Mountain Industries, which opened in May. Its 203 rooms are arranged around a trapezoidal, eight-story atrium. The architect of record was John Prince, but Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz Mountain, credited his father, Leonard, with much of the design.
"He wanted a building that echoed the architectural character of the neighborhood," the younger Mr. Stern said.
Not every developer strives to be contextual. The Munitions Building condo at 60 Warren Street, and West Broadway, has a boxy four-story addition atop an intricately detailed five-story 1860's structure. The developers said they saved the building, which is outside the historic district and landmarks regulation, by making it economically viable. That is not how neighbors see it.
"The level of angst over 60 Warren has been astonishing -- people in court, emergency meetings of neighborhood groups, the community board up in arms," said Hal Bromm, president of the Historic Districts Council. Mr. Bromm, an art dealer and interior designer, has lived in TriBeCa since the early 70's and was a founder in 1984 of the Committee for the Washington Market Historic District, which sought a broader landmarked area than was designated.
Angst has also greeted the conversion of the former Western Union Building, 60 Hudson Street, between Thomas and Worth Streets, into a telecommunications center filled with mechanical equipment.
"I hear that building and I'm over at Independence Plaza, on the 20th floor," said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents Lower Manhattan.
The argument that 60 Hudson Street has always been a communications hub does not persuade Mr. Ehrmann, who has lived across Worth Street for 12 years with his wife, Sandi Slone, an artist. "That's like saying trolley tracks used to run down Broadway, so let's put in a jetport," he said.
The building is "making every possible effort to minimize noise," said Robert B. Getreu, senior managing director of GVA Williams, the managing agent for 60 Hudson Street. For example, he said, there are sound attenuators on all generators and new noise standards for tenants. Cooling towers are being erected on the rooftop, to keep heat exhaust away from neighbors.
"We end up being the scapegoat for the additional activity in TriBeCa," Mr. Getreu said. "It becomes frustrating. Everyone wants high tech in Manhattan. Our infrastructure is what allows that to be here. Then they say, 'Your infrastructure affects the people around you.' "
Residents of TriBeCa are also anxious about two city-owned development parcels. Last month, the Economic Development Corporation designated Halpern/Plaza Development Associates, which includes the Fisher family's Plaza Construction Corporation, to build a 13-story apartment building on a site known as 5C, bounded by Chambers, West and Warren Streets.
THE big question at Site 5C for the community is how much indoor recreational space, if any, the developers will provide. "We have a huge population growth down here and they are all families," Ms. Freed said.
Last month, the city requested proposals for a commercial building on the two-acre Site 5B, between Murray and Warren Streets, prompting concerns about "massive development encroaching on a residential neighborhood," Ms. Wils said.
These sites are the last open parcels in the 39-year-old Washington Street Urban Renewal Area, created by the clearance of 25 blocks along Washington Street, once the spine of a wholesale food district anchored at the south by the Washington Market hall.
The east edge of the renewal area, from Chambers to Hubert Streets, is being transformed by the $3 million "Greening of Greenwich" project under the Economic Development Corporation. The roadbed is being narrowed to create a pedestrian corridor with honey locust, maple and birch trees, benches, bike racks, a serpentine walkway and space for a farmers' market.
The project was designed by Signe Nielsen Landscape Architecture, which was also responsible for the recent recreation of Duane Park to evoke its lush, undulating appearance in the late 19th century. This $180,000 project was undertaken by the Friends of Duane Park, led by Lynn Ellsworth and her husband, William Duggan, and Deborah Allen and her husband, Oliver E. Allen, the author of "Tales of Old Tribeca" (The Tribeca Trib, 1999).
The Allens moved to Hudson Street in 1982. "Two years later, and we wouldn't have been able to afford it," he said. One index of the astonishing change in the neighborhood can be had at street fairs. "You've never seen so many people under three feet high," Mr. Allen marveled.
Steven Wils also noticed the growing number of children in the neighborhood, but it made him anxious. He operated Harry Wils & Company on Duane Street, across from the park, with 18 trucks coming and going around the clock, laden with butter, eggs, cheese, olives, chocolate, spices and oils.
"If there were 50 kids, now there were 150," Mr. Wils said. "It just wasn't safe anymore." Happily accustomed to living over the store, Mr. Wils reluctantly moved the business to Secaucus, N.J., in 1998.
He and his wife, the community board chairwoman, still live over the store, only the store is now a row of fine antique and furniture dealers, including Room.
Mr. Wils was the last butter-and-egg man but there is still an aromatic trace of Washington Market downwind of Transit Trading Corporation, 29 Leonard Street. "We're the only ones left," said the middle-aged man on the loading dock, before refusing further word and withdrawing behind sacks of oregano, fennel and caraway.

HEADLINE: THE CITIES;
For 25 Years, a Point of Light

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
When Sister Mary Vincent Sharp got the call that there was some free furniture at a house in Northeast Philadelphia, she had to get there.
When no one else was available to make the run over there during the Memorial Day weekend, the 74-year-old nun took her aging Ford Econoline truck into Philadelphia because she knew there were families here who could use the tables and chairs. 
 When a man called from Princeton and said he had a computer to give away, Sister Mary Vincent agreed to drive to Lindenwold -- where he would be spending the weekend -- so she could get it from him. She already knew the single mother with two school-aged children who could use it.
For the past 25 years, Sister Mary Vincent has lived in Camden and tried to connect people with what they need. In the Catholic Social Services office across from St. Joan of Arc Church, she is storing a few end tables for a woman who is getting a house and fielding calls from people who want to donate anything from appliances to dining room sets. A local newspaper once called her the chief recycler of nearly everything.
"She was on the forefront of everything, she was a pioneer," said Joseph Lafferty, who worked with Sister Mary Vincent here before going to work for the archdiocese of Philadelphia.
Seven years ago, for instance, Sister Mary Vincent and some volunteers came up with the idea to open a warehouse where low-income people could buy household goods for less than $20. When the Catholic church did not have a building that would work, she formed a corporation, got donations and opened the Community Resource Warehouse.
"Nothing she's done has been for herself," Mr. Lafferty said. "Everything is for the most disadvantaged person. If you need rent money or a doctor or food, she would get it for you. She's a tough cookie, but always with the grace of God."
Tough as she is, Sister Mary Vincent is wrestling health problems these days, though she is still trying to work and recruit volunteers. She has diabetes, high blood pressure and two knees that have been replaced. And she wants the work to go on, even when the day comes that she can not be a part of it. For now, She says she keeps going by napping every day from 4 to 6 p.m.
"She doesn't want to give up,' said Monsignor Robert McDermott of St. Joseph's Pro Cathedral in East Camden. "Sister is a very charismatic person, willing to do the little things that don't get a lot of attention. She's one of the real giants. This is her life and these are her people."
Her only passion outside of helping the poor is the orchids she tends at work and in the high-rise apartment she lives in here in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
"She always eats the three-day old bread and wears second-hand clothes," said Mr. Lafferty. "She does just what the Gospel says. She lives it. She lives with the poor and she'd travel 50 miles to get a fan if she thought someone could use it.'
Growing up in a middle-class family in Newark, Sister Mary Vincent did not live in poverty, though she saw it all around her and would volunteer to help the nuns there.
"I just got attached to them," she said. "I wanted to serve and work with the sisters and I wanted to do social work. The people were poor. They needed clothing, they needed everything."
After working as a typist in an insurance office for a year following her graduation from West Side High School, Sister Mary Vincent moved to Philadelphia and became a nun with the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. At the age of 23, she was sent to Puerto Rico, where she taught English for 13 years and got her bachelor's degree at the University of Puerto Rico.
When she returned to the United States, she got a masters degree in social work from Fordham University and worked with poor Spanish-speaking families out of a Catholic Social Services office there. In 1975 she was assigned to Camden and until a few years ago, she served as coordinator of El Centro, a Catholic agency here that provides services to the the city's poor, of which there is an abundance.
Since 1975, Camden has lost one in three jobs, and its residents' income is about half the state average. The city itself has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept afloat with cash from Trenton, which pays for 70 percent of the municipal and public school budget.
Recently, because of her failing health, Sister Mary Vincent has cut back on work to three days a week in the St. Joan of Arc office. But even on days off, she keeps an ear to the ground to learn where someone can pick up a donation or get a desk for their child.
"Everybody has a need," she said. "They run short of food every month after the 20th. We often need to give out toilet paper, shaving cream and detergent. Right now things are a lot worse. We have a lot of poor, large families and they can't make ends meet. There are jobs, but they are low-paying jobs. And today, kids ask for so much more."
Still, Sister Mary Vincent says she never loses hope for Camden or for the people she meets here. She sees hard-working families and volunteers every day.
One 85-year-old woman who lives near her office -- where there is a food pantry -- will run across the street to help unload bread deliveries from the truck.
"If she sees the truck pull up, she comes to help," said Sister Mary Vincent. "We have so many good helpers and good people who come in. One man with four boys comes to get bread or just comes to visit. Things just fall into place for us all the time. It's divine providence."

HEADLINE: Call It 'Ayatollah' or 'Caesar,' It's the Imperial Governorship;
When Comparing Power, New Jersey's Chief Executive, Unlike Peers in the Other States, Holds All the Cards

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
FROM Washington, it seems odd that Senator Robert G. Torricelli would want to be governor of New Jersey.
"He had really begun to build himself a power base in Washington," observed Norman Ornstein of American Enterprise Institute, who has analyzed politicians' behavior for years. "I'm still trying to get my arms around it." 
 From Trenton, it makes a lot more sense. Here, the governor's office is the place to make legislation happen, to reward and punish and to generally see people trailing obsequiously in one's wake. When it comes to power, the governor, as the only elected state official, has minimal competition.
So while the political conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles soak up the media attention and Jon S. Corzine and Robert D. Franks battle toward the most expensive Senate campaign in history, the conventional wisdom in New Jersey is that the election in November 2001 -- choosing a successor to Governor Whitman -- is the only one that really counts.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean put it this way: "In the interest of the political establishment, it outweighs the presidential race. We have a Senate contest this year, and nobody cares. Everybody is already talking about who's going to be the next governor, and they have been for a long time. And the election isn't even till next year."
Mr. Kean recalled that John Sununu, President George Bush's one-time chief of staff and a former governor of New Hampshire, called him "Ayatollah Kean," and he quoted a line from the conservative columnist George Will that a New Jersey governor is "an American Caesar." And in crediting his
advisers with talking back to him, Mr. Kean said, "It's easy for people to be afraid of the governor."
This state is nothing like New York, for example, with a lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and at least one big-city mayor who are willing and often able to sabotage the governor. And in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush does not have a formal cabinet but a collection of sometimes wayward officials, like the agriculture commissioner, who are elected and have power of their own.
Governor Whitman, while laughing amiably one recent afternoon at the notion that people are afraid of her, concurred that 'the governor does have extraordinary powers in this state."
Sticking to the tangible, constitutionally granted variety, she cited the conditional veto, by which she can effectively tell the Legislature what terms she will require for her signature, and the line-item veto.
Indeed, after State Senator John Lynch, a Democrat from New Brunswick, cast the Senate's only dissenting vote on Mrs. Whitman's budget last month, she penciled out $300,000 worth of projects for his district.
"There's hardly anybody who's active in public life who doesn't want something from the governor,' said Carl E. Van Horn, a political scientist at Rutgers who was Gov. Jim Florio's policy director. "The line I always heard was, 'Why would anyone care who's the U.S. Senator from New Jersey? After all, its only 24 jobs. The governor has thousands of jobs.' "
Moreover, the governor's thousands of jobs include all the important ones: attorney general, treasurer, secretary of state, many subcabinet positions and all the county prosecutors and state judges. They also include appointments -- some unpaid but ego-enhancing -- to every board from the New Jersey Birthplace of Football Monument Commission to the Rahway Valley Sewerage Authority.
There are a few other states -- Tennessee, Maine and New Hampshire -- where the governor is the only elected state official, but those governors have to share appointment powers with the legislature. Here, the Legislature -- specifically, the Senate -- can only consent.
Then there are the media advantages. Carl Golden, who was press secretary in both the Kean and Whitman administrations, said Mrs. Whitman in particular, "a terrific television presence," knew how to work her way into a national forum.
"That wouldn't have come her way if she were the governor of Delaware," Mr. Golden said. "If you want those New York and Philadelphia stations, you're in the right place. That's why God invented Bergen County and Cherry Hill."
Whatever their measure of power, scholars generally agree that among governors, New Jersey's is at the top of the list. Altogether, the governorship "is like royalty" here, Mr. Van Horn said. "Its very different from other states."
To the small cast of those willing to complain out loud, who in Governor Whitman's case are principally environmental groups and activists with black and Hispanic constituencies, it is indeed an imperial office. And as public crises tend to illustrate, the state's business is administered by a limited circle that owes its allegiance -- and salaries -- to the governor.
Take the volatile issue of racial profiling that showed the State Police had a history of stopping an inordinate number of minority motorists. The governor appoints the State Police superintendent, who reports to the attorney general, also appointed by the governor. When accusations reached a critical level last year, the investigation fell to the attorney general, Peter G. Verniero -- Governor Whitman's former chief of staff and now a State Supreme Court justice appointed by her -- who had insisted for two years that incidents of bias were isolated at most. At the same time, Mr. Verniero's office was appealing a Superior Court decision in Gloucester County that had found "a de facto policy of racial profiling" by troopers.
While Mrs. Whitman publicly deplored the practice and dismissed the police superintendant, she defended her attorney general and, after the intervention of the Justice Department, named him to the state's High Court. There, incidentally, he joined four other justices out of six who had been top staff members of the governor's who appointed them.
WALTER FIELDS, a Democratic political consultant in Trenton who has worked in New York, said such a scenario was unlikely in that state. "There are a lot of layers of politics in New York that you don't have in New Jersey," Mr. Fields said.
First are the elected counterweights to the governor, and not just the other state officials. "To be borough president of Manhattan or Brooklyn is really important," he said. "In New Jersey, the analogy is county executive, and they dont really matter."
Then, Mr. Fields said, there are the unofficial centers of power: "You have the third parties, the advocates. You have Al Sharpton, Calvin Butts. Those people, outside the institutions, become larger than life. Even the labor unions have more power. Even the Catholic Church."
Professor Van Horn said that while New Jersey was "a model of efficient accountability, it did not succeed in insuring diverse voices and viewpoints."
"Accountability and efficiency are not the only things that matter," he said. "On balance, I think it's better to have diversity. I believe in the distribution of power across institutions."
But when New Jersey's Constitution was rewritten in 1947, in the state's first attempt at modern government, power was purposely telescoped into one office. "The governor has the institutional power to make things happen," said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia who has written extensively on governorships. "Everyone is responsible to that one executive, and then the voters know who to credit or blame."
Indeed, government by competing officials can be inefficient, if inventive and interesting.
In New York, even though the governor and lieutenant governor run as a ticket, some lieutenant governors have been famously uncooperative. Lt. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak, for instance, ran against Gov. Hugh Carey in the primary after his first term. Later, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross feuded openly with Gov. George Pataki, who removed her police escort and removed her from the ticket for the next election, at which point she left the Republican Party to run against him.
In Mississippi, Gov. Kirk Fordice went to court to stop the lawsuit that the elected attorney general, Michael Moore, filed against the tobacco companies. The governor, claiming that such a step required his approval, said the suit "makes me want to throw up."
Or in Alabama, when Gov. Fob James Jr. questioned the federal courts' jurisdiction over the states, Attorney General Bill Pryor, a fellow Republican, declared that the governor's views "do not state the legal position of the State of Alabama."
For his part, Professor Sabato said he preferred the New Jersey model to those -- like his own, where the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general are elected independently -- that diffuse power. "The conflicts that occur between the lower elected officers and the governor are not awe-inspiring or revealing," he said. "They're about petty things."
Not surprisingly, New Jersey's former governors like the system here, too.
Mrs. Whitman's predecessor, Jim Florio, while citing the drawback that "you have no place to hide," said that "our system is wonderful in that you have real, fixed accountability."
"You can effectively be the legislative branch because of the veto," Mr. Florio said. "You can go out and mobilize people. The power is a legislative, an executive and a public-opinion-forming authority."
Former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne uses the example of the Pinelands -- which, he said, is what he most wants to be remembered for. "When I decided the Pinelands ought to be saved, I saved them," Mr. Byrne said, "first by telling my commissioner not to issue permits. Then I issued an executive order, then finally got a statute passed."
"What makes the job fun is you can get something done," he added. "It's a great satisfaction."
IN 1993, the job went to Christine Todd Whitman, whose experience in elected office consisted of serving as a Somerset County freeholder. With startling speed, even before she could deliver on her famous promise to cut taxes by 30 percent, she achieved celebrity.
Polls showed her approval rating jumping as much as 20 percentage points during her first year. In the meantime, the tax cuts inspired copycat efforts around the country.
Mrs. Whitman was one of People magazine's most intriguing people of the year in 1994, along with Heather Locklear and O. J. Simpson. In 1995 she delivered the Republican response to President Clinton's State of the Union message. Her future in the Republican Party seemed to be checked only by her pro-choice stand on abortion, which turned out to raise her stature with the party's recovering moderate wing.
But the glow faded with time. Talk of a vice presidential nomination flickered and then died, as it did again this year.
At home, property taxes were rising, along with Democrats' protests that the Whitman cuts were endangering the state's long-term fiscal health. And even though her party controlled both houses, she was not making friends in the Legislature. Nor has she made many since.
Even Democrats are guarded in their criticism, and many insist that they find the governor personally likable. But many say she has frozen out the Legislature.
"Has she ever learned to deal with it?' said the Senate minority leader, Richard E. Codey of Essex County. "Very rarely does she reach out."
"I was in Kean's office all the time," Senator Codey said. "Florio said, 'You guys control the Legislature, come on in.' Kean would pick up the phone and and say, 'I love what you said about so and so.' "
And while Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who plans to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, said Mrs. Whitman had made considerable progress on such big issues as auto insurance rates and open-space preservation, he added, "She came at the Legislature in a different way than I would."
"On just about every issue," Mr. Collins said, she could have smoothed the way by going to the Legislature earlier.
When she did not notify the Senate of her first choice for a new State Police superintendant, it was the Republicans who derailed the nomination; Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco chided the administration for "bungling" it.
Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Camden County, said no one from the administration consulted him or even notified him of the legislation it introduced recently to enable a state takeover of the city government. And when the governor goes to Camden, he said, "half the time, if she comes at 4 in the afternoon I get called at 9 in the morning, if I get called at all.
"You start to get the sense that this governer doesn't want you to be involved," Mr. Bryant observed.
Governor Whitman, while not quite acknowledging a diffident posture, said she usually met with Senate and Assembly leaders at the outset of a big legislative initiative and then left the rest to her staff.
Legislators often rely on her conditional and line-item veto powers by pursuing a project "because it responds to the needs of their supporters or constituents back home," she said, while "it's the governor's responsibility to keep imposing the broad picture on them."
As for her own initiatives, she said: "It's never troubled me, and I don't know if it's a male-female thing, but I never worry about compromise being a bad thing. Once I put something out there, as long as I get my overall goal, I don't care if all the lines are written exactly the way I want."
OF course, many point out that governors and legislatures are natural
enemies. State Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County who has fought with Mrs. Whitman -- "heatedly," he added -- on some environmental issues, said: "I never questioned her intent; she intended to do what was right for New Jersey.'
He added, "I've noted an absolute lack of anything you could call prejudice."
Assemblyman Leonard Lance, the chairman of the Budget Committee, said Mrs. Whitman's relationship with the Legislature was good -- no worse than Mr. Florio's or Mr. Kean's -- and he commended her tax cuts and initiative to preserve a million acres of open space. "The proof of the pudding is that what she has requested has been enacted," Mr. Lance said.
Still, Mr. Lance, a Hunterdon County Republican whose father helped draft the 1947 Constitution, said: "I would prefer to see slightly greater constitutional power in the branch of government in which I serve. I wouldn't mind seeing one or two other statewide elected officials."
As for how Governor Whitman has put her clout to use, opinions divide, understandably, along party lines. Republicans, who appreciated the tax cuts, were generally amenable to her social programs like expanded health insurance for children; Democrats said she had done little beyond happening upon a booming economy and allowing the state's debt burden to escalate.
"Hers is a traditional Republican approach that doesn't want to do a lot of things," Mr. Florio said. "It's easier to achieve your goals that way. What you've seen, in the last year especially, is the problems associated with too much of a passive approach to government, thinking that it runs by itself, whether it be E-ZPass or auto emissions."
The governor, after saying that Mr. Florio "must be a little envious," responded with a long list of accomplishments: tort reform, health insurance programs for children and working adults, increased education spending and farmland preservation, a new building code to encourage building in the cities.
She also defended her environmental record in fervent detail, saying of the environmental advocates, "Sometimes those people don't know when they've won."
To be sure, they are probably the governor's most relentless critics -- in part because she has cast herself as an ally. Bill Neil of the New Jersey Audubon Society said the administration's anti-sprawl campaign had not produced significant protection for undeveloped areas because "it would take a big, heavy political lift to do that for the state, and she avoids making tough choices."
"I think it's the mood of the times," Mr. Neil added, "whether it's Clinton or Whitman, to shoot low."
The public's judgment has been more favorable than not, although she came within one percentage point of losing re-election in 1997. In the Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, after overcoming very early voter skepticism she has consistently been ranked "good" or "excellent" by about 50 percent of respondents.
The poll's director, Cliff Zukin, said that put Mrs. Whitman well ahead of Mr. Florio and Mr. Byrne, though clearly behind Governor Kean. "Whitman is liked and Kean was loved," Mr. Zukin said. "When he was governor, people had an emotional attachment that they don't have to Whitman."
Being liked -- and having firm control of the state party -- was enough to assure Mrs. Whitman of the nomination for this year's United States Senate race, but last fall she abruptly dropped out of contention.
Now the conventional speculation places her in a cabinet post or ambassadorship if George W. Bush is elected president. But she maintained that "I really haven't spent a lot of time focusing on what's next," adding that the governor's office is "not a good place to look for your next job."
"It's going to be a tough transition no matter what," she said. "You go to a cabinet and it's the environment, or its commerce. It's just one thing. It's obviously going to be hard to funnel down, to take on a particular issue, or to be, say, in an ambassadorial post where you really don't have any influence over foreign policy at all.
"So whatever it is," she added, "it's going to be a real change."
THE angling for the governorship in 2001 began the moment James E. McGreevey almost defeated Mrs. Whitman in 1997. Until Senator Torricelli elbowed him aside, Mr. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge and a former state senator, was the Democrat's presumptive nominee. And all the while the two most powerful legislators, Senator DiFrancesco and Assemblyman Collins, were already competing for the Republican nomination.
Senator Torricelli is bad news for all of them. Given his capacity for rainmaking and revenge, he has realigned loyalties in his party leaders in just two weeks. Mr. McGreevey, on the other hand, is known as an inexhaustible worker but does not inspire fear.
Unless, of course, he becomes governor.

The Quiet on the Set Is Sounding Like Thunder

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
DRESSED in a pink tutu with double-decker wings, Todd Susman and his grouchy persona are trying to change the image of the tooth fairy forever.
For Mr. Susman, a 53-year-old actor, the offbeat role in ads for Sonicare electric toothbrushes is an opportunity to play a memorable personality like Mr. Whipple, the vigilant grocery-store manager of the Charmin commercials, and Clara, who asked "Where's the Beef?" for the Wendy's fast-food chain. 
 But with a strike by commercial actors against advertisers and agencies entering its 14th week, Mr. Susman will not be shooting new commercials for Sonicare, which is made by Optiva, as scheduled. Although he knows that the character, and the advertising campaign, could be jeopardized, he said the risk was ultimately worth it.
"Advertisers want to change the status quo forever," he said. "They have the money. They have the resolution, and if they can possibly do it they will."
As the strike stretches on, it appears to be more and more a sign of things to come. Movie and television production are already being accelerated as Hollywood prepares for the possibility of strikes by screen and television actors as well as writers when their contracts expire next year.
In a recent newsletter, the Writers Guild of America warned its members: "Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or the nicest car you can afford. If you have a TV staff-writing job, begin putting money away now. If you make a feature deal, bank every penny you can."
The writers and actors share a key complaint, about their pay for work shown on cable TV. In the early days of cable, union representatives say, actors and writers cut special deals below network rates to help the fledgling industry get off the ground. Now, they say, it's time for payback. "Cable has become a mature cash cow industry, very successful," said John McLean, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, West. "And we want our piece."
More broadly, the disputes arise from the changing face of television and the multitude of options created by advances in electronic media, including the Internet. Compensation for work shown on the Internet is another issue in the contract talks.
"We're in a whole new world here; we'll agree with them on that," said Todd Amorde, chairman of the national strike strategy committee for the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
For decades, television was dominated by the three major networks -- ABC, NBC and CBS. Now, there are seven broadcast networks and at least 50 national cable networks that are tracked by Nielsen Media Research, plus many regional channels that are not even monitored. Until the late 1970's, the three big broadcast networks captured more than 90 percent of the viewing audience. That share is now less than 50 percent.
"It's basically a different economic model," said Tim Brooks, co-author of an annual directory of prime-time network and cable shows. "You get this collision of interests as times change."
The Writers Guild's contract with producers expires May 1 next year, followed by the movie and television actors contracts July 1. No proposals are yet on the table. But union representatives said they want compensation for the increasing profitability of cable and of shows that are broadcast overseas. They also want a guarantee of fair pay for work that appears on the Internet.
In the strike by actors in commercials, the primary difference is simple: the actors want to be paid every time an ad is shown on television, and advertising agencies and marketers want to pay a flat rate.
On network television, actors who appear in commercials are paid under a system known as "pay for play." They receive a daily rate, currently $478.70, which includes the first broadcast. They are then paid each time the commercial is shown again, starting at $122.70 and decreasing over 13 weeks to $46.65. On cable, they are paid $1,014 for the 13-week cyle, no matter how many times the commercial is shown.
A commercial runs an average of 44 times over 13 weeks on the networks, according to Mr. Amorde. On cable, with more channels and lower costs for time, he said, advertisers have told him that commercials run 225 to 233 times over 13 weeks. But he says the Screen Actors Guild has found some ads that were shown as many as 5,000 times on cable.
Though actors usually spend only a day or two shooting a commercial, they spend much more time searching for assignments and auditioning. Apart from celebrities, the most successful actors who specialize in commercials can earn more than $50,000 in a good year. But most make just a few thousand dollars and rely on other jobs for most of their income.
Unions representing commercial actors have proposed a pay-for-play arrangement for cable at 37 percent of the network rate.
The Joint Policy Committee, representing advertisers and their agencies, has proposed to increase the payment for filming a commercial to $500, followed by a flat rate of $2,575 for 13 weeks of appearances on network TV. On cable, they have proposed increasing the rate for 13 weeks to $1,627.
Agreeing on these terms is essential before the negotiators start dealing with new technologies, said John A. McGuinn, chief negotiator for the Joint Policy Committee. "This strike is about modernizing this contract and bringing it into the Year 2000 so we can deal with the Internet," he said.
NEGOTIATORS have been finding little common ground. The talks, which had been suspended, resumed on July 20 after federal mediators called the two groups back to the table. But the negotiations quickly broke down again.
Actors want Internet use of advertising included in the contract, but Mr. McGuinn said he had not been authorized to negotiate in this area. The advertisers and agencies want both sides to study the issue and meet at least once a year, but they stress that they do not agree that the unions have a right to negotiate Internet rates.
A third sticking point involves the unions' desire to verify how many times a commercial is shown. The Screen Actors Guild says its survey of 38 commercials uncovered $110,000 in unpaid wages. The advertising industry proposes joining with the unions to choose a consultant who can search for the best way to monitor commercials. Recommendations from a committee representing both sides would be due 60 days before the expiration of a new contract in 2003.
Some advertisers are producing commercials with the blessing of the actors unions by agreeing to pay what the unions have proposed. But many other commercials are being made in defiance of the strike.
The unions, affiliates of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are trying to keep the heat on advertisers. Members are picketing production of nonunion commercials in an attempt to shut them down. Earlier this month, the actors picketed major offices of AT&T, which has been making commercials using nonunion actors.
In New York, the protesters were addressed by labor leaders, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, John J. Sweeney, and by actors like Susan Sarandon and Jerry Orbach.
Mr. Susman said he had been lucky enough to work during the strike by providing the voice of a dog in commercials for Laidlaw's Greyhound bus line, which signed the unions' proposed contract. Still, he marvels that commercial actors, among the hardest-working and lowest-paid members of the actors' unions, are bearing the brunt of the larger struggle. "How God and luck aligned in this particular situation so that we are the ones at the forefront of this fight, I will never know," Mr. Susman said. "But we know the fight we're in."

When Keeping Cool Is Not a Nicety, but a Necessity

BYLINE: By BEN UPHAM

 BODY:
When Joe Nemecek, owner of Adolf Kusy Meats on Washington Street, got to work on the morning of July 10, he heard a terrifying sound: the quiet drip-drip of ice melting.
During the weekend, a pipe had ruptured in the century-old refrigeration system that keeps the meat cold in the enormous freezers and coolers of Mr. Nemecek's business, and of other wholesalers and butchers in the meat market district. He and the others spent that morning carrying in blocks of dry ice to keep their freezers cold, or scrambling to find space for their stock in other warehouses before it began to rot. 
 "We have trouble every summer," said Mr. Nemecek, who had to throw away $10,000 worth of spoiled food. But he said he thought the Gansevoort Refrigeration Cooperative, which eight owners in the district formed in 1980 to run the refrigeration system, would fix it, as it had before.
Instead, co-op officials decided to shut the system down except for pipes serving one block-sized building known as the Gansevoort Market. And they told the other businesses that they were on their own.
Frank D. Platt, a lawyer for the co-op, said the pipes serving Gansevoort Market were above ground and so were easier and less expensive to fix than the pipes serving the other businesses, including Mr. Nemecek's, which are underground. "The economics just weren't there," he said, to fix the underground part of the system.
The pipes stretch from Jane Street in the West Village to West 15th Street, and from the West Side Highway to Hudson Street, an area once brimming with meat packers. But as meat businesses moved to cheaper space in the other boroughs, the outlying pipes were gradually turned off, or not repaired. Some remaining companies bought their own systems. Fewer companies using the pipes meant less money for maintenance, furthering decline. By this summer, only about a dozen companies on Washington Street and those in the Gansevoort Market were using the system.
A district manager from the United States Department of Agriculture said that food safety was never compromised during the recent breakdown.
Marty Heller of Endicott Meat and Poultry on Washington Street was already planning to move his business to Hunts Point in the Bronx. But he said the breakdown cost him thousands, and he called the co-op's decision not to fix the pipes insensitive.
Mr. Nemecek, who lost his lease in April when his building was sold to a real estate developer, said the breakdown "really put an extra nail in the coffin" for him, and for many of the other firms that have been struggling to keep up with rising rents.
Mr. Platt said that the market would be a different place in five years. "It's gotten to the point that the value of the real estate has overridden the value of having a meat market," he said. BEN UPHAM
 
A Rich History Lurks Behind the Sides of Beef
The meat market district is roughly defined by Hudson and Washington Streets east to west, and 14th and Horatio Streets north to south. It was originally the site of Fort Gansevoort, built during the War of 1812, and named for Peter Gansevoort, a Revolutionary War general. In the early 1880's, a farmers' market opened in the area; by 1888, meat wholesalers had moved in.
As recently as 1986, the district had more than 120 meat firms. But today fewer than half remain.
 With increasing real estate development in the West Village have come efforts to landmark the area, because of some significant events in United States history and cultural affairs. On July 11, 1804, after a duel with Aaron Burr in Weehawken, N.J., a mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton was ferried across the Hudson River to the Bayard Estate (near present-day Jane Street, one block south of the market area), where he died.
The De Lamater Iron Works, between 12th and 14th Streets on the river, built the boilers and engine for the Civil War ironclad ship Monitor, which defeated the Confederate Merrimac at Hampton Roads, Va., in 1862, after nearly sinking on the way.
From 1866 to 1885, Herman Melville, a grandson of General Gansevoort, commuted from his home in Chelsea to the Department of Docks building at the foot of Gansevoort Street, where he worked as a customs inspector. It was the writer's first steady paycheck. BEN UPHAM

HEADLINE: Four Corners;
When Shifting Groups of Immigrants Compete for the Same Turf, Even an Intersection Can Become Contested Ground

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
THERE is a saying among urban historians: You can always tell how a neighborhood is changing. The name of the outgoing ethnic group is on the funeral homes, and that of the incoming group is on the grocery stores.
In New York, ethnic groups move like tectonic plates, drifting land masses, sometimes colliding at their edges with unhappy consequences, sometimes slipping past one another with relative ease. 
 The signs of shift are everywhere. In the span of a few years, a Little Italy, a Koreatown or a Little Odessa is newly defined by the Mexican bodegas or Chinese shoe stores or Indian delis that press at its borders.
The phenomenon, which sociologists call ethnic succession, is as old as the city itself and may be heightened in New York because of its size and the multiplicity of ethnic groups jostling for the same turf.
A single street corner can become central to a group's identity.
"In New York, because we live so much of our life in public and the sidewalk plays such a role in our perception of the city, busy street corners demarcate territory in a way that may be much more significant than in other cities," said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College who specializes in immigration issues. "People feel an allegiance to a stretch of businesses or a corner because that's where the community is defined most publicly."
So, 20 years ago, Puerto Ricans in East Harlem knew that if they walked east past Third Avenue on East 116th Street, which was controlled by Italians, they faced the threat of physical violence. Today, the same corner is dominated by Mexicans, who were just as wary of the corner a decade ago when Puerto Ricans held sway there.
To outsiders, these shifts may be all but invisible. Sometimes the two groups occupying the same turf share physical attributes and speak the same language. But the differences are all too evident to groups trying to forge or maintain an identity.
The result can be out-and-out conflict, but more often it is a fluid process that involves intricate cultural negotiation. Here are four corners where those delicate negotiations are taking place today.
 
In Flatbush,
Russian Jews and Pakistanis
Yakov Semichan, 56, a Russian Jew whose barbershop has been at Coney Island Avenue and Glenwood Road in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn for nine years, was fighting the crosscurrents.
In the last five years, his original customer base, Orthodox and Russian Jews whose synagogues and kosher restaurants once dominated the corner, has been departing for wealthier sections of Flatbush. Pakistani immigrants and businesses that catered to them were replacing them.
But when two Pakistani barbershops opened across the street from Mr. Semichan's shop during the last six years, his business began to suffer.
Mr. Semichan, who has piercing blue-gray eyes and a gap-toothed grin, had bought Al's Barber Shop from another Russian Jewish barber in 1991, when he moved to Brooklyn from Moldova in the former Soviet Union, and renamed it Yakov's. At first, the shifting population did not affect his business. He was still the only barber on the strip.
"Hair is hair," he said over his shoulder as he passed the afternoon playing checkers with Nikolay Banov, a friend and customer from Kiev. "Jewish hair, Pakistani hair, it's all the same."
But Asghar Choudhri, president of the Pakistani American Federation of New York, whose headquarters is up the block, said many new immigrants saw otherwise.
"The Pakistanis all went to their own places," Mr. Choudhri said. "They stayed with their own. When the second Pakistani barber opened, that's when his business really went down."
In 1996, a Pakistani immigrant named Shabbir Hussain, who had owned four barber shops in his native city of Lahore, had arrived in Flatbush and was looking for a job. Mr. Semichan offered Mr. Hussain the battered red barber's chair in the front of the shop and put a bright green sign in the window advertising, "We speak Russian, English and Yiddish," along with Mr. Hussein's name translated into Urdu, the Pakistani language.
The two men now cut hair side by side in Yakov's Barber Shop, and the shop seems busy. But their situation is unusual. Although many elderly Jews still live on side streets like Glenwood Road and Avenue H, the two groups enjoy little interaction.
On Coney Island Avenue between Glenwood and Avenue H, almost all the businesses are owned by Pakistanis, Bangladeshis or other Muslims. These include Urdu Bazzar, a 99-cent store; Asian Grocery Halal Market; Bukhara Restaurant, which serves Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi cuisine, and Raheela Beauty Parlor. Children wear shalwar kameez, traditional Muslim garb.
But one block from Glenwood, the scenery changes. Just across Avenue H, the streets are populated by Hasidic Jews in black coats and hats. Though the two communities lead separate lives, they share certain traits. Both groups are religious and conservative, both observe restricted diets, and in both communities, women assume traditional roles. Both groups have had tense relationships with blacks and Hispanics in surrounding areas. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Choudhri of the Pakistani American Federation spent the afternoon on the telephone, complaining to the police that African-American teenagers were throwing bottles and rocks at a new mosque and cursing its congregants.
The Jews and Pakistanis lead largely separate lives.
"There has been no real interaction, except on the leadership level," said Rabbi Yechezkel Pikus, executive director of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Flatbush. "There's a sort of tolerance. You mind your business and I'll mind mine."

In Belmont,
Albanians Displace Italians
Felix Mastro, a former prizefighter, stood with his buddies, Sal, Johnny D., Guido and Mikey, in the blue light filtering through a canopy outside the Cosenza Fish Market at Arthur Avenue and 186th Street.
The four men were downing clams on the half shell and reminiscing about the old days, 80 years ago -- before any of them were born -- when pushcarts selling Italian goods rumbled along Arthur Avenue, the heart of the Belmont section of the Bronx.
"It all changed in 1933, when they opened the Arthur Avenue Retail Market," said Mr. Mastro, 70, still dapper in his brown sports jacket, who has lived in the neighborhood all his life. "They closed the last place where you could buy live chickens on the street over here just a couple of years ago. Very few Italians are left here now." It is a daily lament at this intersection.
At first glance, the Italian presence seems as bright as ever. Along Arthur Avenue, banners on lampposts proclaim "Welcome to Little Italy in the Bronx," beside Italian bakeries, meat markets and cheese stores. But in the last five years, as Italians have left Belmont for the suburbs, they have been replaced by Albanians.
Many Roman Catholic Albanians first moved to Belmont in the 1980's, when those who suffered under their country's fanatical Communist regime fled to the United States. The recent wars that drove thousands of Albanians from Kosovo produced the latest wave of immigration, which began about three years ago.
Albanians felt comfortable in an Italian neighborhood because Albanians and Italians are neighbors in Europe. They eat and drink similar foods, and they look somewhat alike. But the two groups have not always mingled peacefully, as shown by life on this corner. At Mike's Deli, an Italian specialty store inside the Arthur Avenue market, three of the countermen are Italian and three are Albanian. All the Albanian employees have adopted Italian-style nicknames -- Milane is Milano, Keno is Nino -- and each speaks some Italian.
"The Albanians get along fine with the Italian-Americans," David Greco, a second-generation Italian-American, said. "But the Italians from Italy feel as if the Albanians invaded Italy, so they're a bit hostile. One of my guys is constantly calling them ignorant. If I wasn't there, there would be a fight every day."
One combatant is Qamil Osmani, who goes by the nickname Ossie. Mr. Osmani, who worked for his country's Ministry of Defense under a previous regime, came to the United States in March to seek political asylum. He settled in Belmont because he knew that Albanians lived there and he had come to know Italians when he was serving in the Albanian Army a decade ago.
As for the Italian counterman who calls Albanians ignorant, he said: "I tell him, I'm not coming from the street. I have stayed with much better people than him."
Similar skirmishes are played out along Arthur Avenue between 186th and 187th Streets, which has become home to half a dozen Albanian stores, including the Kosova Commerce Corporation, which sells Albanian video and audio tapes and specialty goods; the Gurra Cafe, which serves Albanian cuisine; and the All Star Cafe, where the specials include typical Albanian dishes like chevapi and beef sausage.
Even though many Italians have left the neighborhood, they return to buy their prosciutto and osso buco. And some of the vendors of those items are now Albanian. George Dedvukaj, who was born in a small town in Montenegro, owns and runs Giovanni's Restaurant on Arthur Avenue near 186th Street, which serves brick-oven pizza in the Italian style. He bought the business two years ago from another Albanian.
"I think the Albanians helped the area," said Peter Servidio, an Italian-American who owns Peter's Meat Market across the street but moved to Westchester a few years ago. "They buy a lot, like the Italians used to, by the bucket. And as far as business is concerned, Italians are going to be here for years and years."

In Flushing,
Koreatown Becomes Chinese
The pungent scent of cilantro accompanied Sean Lee, wearing a cut-off T-shirt and a baseball cap, as he wandered through Green Farm, a Korean-owned greenmarket at Main Street and Maple Avenue in Flushing, Queens, furiously directing the movement of crates of watermelons and okra.
During a break, Mr. Lee, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 of his 32 years, pointed to the last vestiges of the old Koreatown at the edge of Flushing's shopping district. "Rose Handicraft was the first Korean store," Mr. Lee said, pointing toward a shop that rents traditional Korean kimonos. "Over here, the pharmacy is Korean and the stationery store is Korean."
In the last five years, many of the names on businesses on the corner have switched from Korean to Chinese, as Korean businesses have moved 10 blocks north to Northern Boulevard.
"This has become like a second Chinatown," Mr. Lee said. "They're bringing a lot of money from Hong Kong and China and investing it in this neighborhood."
Two factors are cited to explain the departure of Korean-owned stores.
"It's possible they've been pushed out because of the increase in Chinese business," said Daeyoung Kim, who is studying Korean-Americans at the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center. "But it also could be because the Korean stores have become more diversified." As business owners diversified the products they sold, Mr. Kim said, they needed more space, and moved to a part of the neighborhood where larger, cheaper stores were still available.
Green Farm, which opened 20 years ago, is now encircled by Chinese businesses. Across the street is China Trust Bank, housed in a modernistic glass structure. Next door is Tai Pan Bakery. Just above Green Farm, restaurateurs from Hong Kong are putting the finishing touches on East Buffet and Restaurant, an ornate, 17,000-square-foot restaurant and catering hall. The three-floor restaurant, whose decor includes a sweeping marble staircase, a wrought-iron banister from Greece and a 120,000-piece crystal chandelier, is the third establishment created by the group, which also runs a wildly popular Chinese restaurant in Huntington, N.Y.
"Most Chinese work late hours, and if you get off at 8 p.m., they can't get out there before we are closed," said Betty Cheng, one of the partners, explaining the decision to open in Flushing.
Although East Buffet will concentrate on Chinese food, it will also offer sushi, Korean food and European specialties.
Local residents remember that East Buffet occupies a site that once housed a successful Korean restaurant called South River, and that a Korean restaurant up the block experienced what Ms. Cheng called "another Chinese takeover." But she said she and her Korean neighbors, like those downstairs at Green Farm, get along well.
"They speak in their language, which I don't understand," she said, "but they eat at our places and we eat at theirs."
But Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York, is less sanguine.
"It is a bad thing that's happened here," Mr. Kim said. "Koreans have been pushed out by other ethnic groups. Landlords kick them out to get higher rents. We used to have 80 stores in that area. Now we have three or four."

In East Harlem,
Puerto Rican Into Mexican
Minutes after Mario Olmedo dropped his suitcase on the floor of his cousin's apartment in East Harlem 15 years ago, he heard a knock at the door. When he opened it, he said, three men assaulted him and robbed him of his watch, the only valuable he had brought from his home in Mexico City. Based on the tint of their skin and the cadence of their Spanish, Mr. Olmedo concluded that his attackers were Puerto Rican.
Whether or not he was correct, the encounter left him feeling that he had entered hostile territory. Until just about six years ago, Spanish Harlem was just one kind of Spanish, Puerto Rican. The corner of 116th Street and Third Avenue, where Mr. Olmedo opened a taco stand 13 years ago, was dominated by Puerto Rican-owned bodegas.
Puerto Ricans, in turn, had supplanted Italians, who first settled in East Harlem in the 1880's and numbered 80,000 by the 1930's. Conflicts erupted between Italians and Puerto Ricans as early as the 1920's. By 1930, most of the city's Puerto Ricans lived in the neighborhood, and the tensions between the two groups were legendary. Efrain Suarez, owner of Made in Puerto Rico Products, which sells CD's, books, coffee and other items from the island, stood on the corner and pointed east toward Second Avenue.
"When the Italians were here, Puerto Ricans couldn't go down that block," said Mr. Suarez, 55, who has worked in the neighborhood for three decades. "The farther you went down the street, the worse it got. If you went past Second Avenue, you were beaten up."
Until six years ago, it was Mexicans who had to confine their movements to the blocks west of Third Avenue. In the early 1990's, Mr. Olmedo bought a bodega owned by a Puerto Rican in the heart of the contested territory and replaced it with a tacqueria, La Hacienda, possibly the first Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. "We used to see a lot of Puerto Ricans chasing Mexican guys down the street to beat them up," he said.
Mr. Olmedo now owns a second Mexican restaurant, La Tacquicanda, just down the block, as well as an apartment building. But it took time to catch on. "People used to pass by and make nasty faces," said his teenage son, Omar, a younger, Americanized replica of his father.
That has changed, and no one chases Mexicans away from the corner anymore. After Mr. Olmedo opened his first restaurant, other Mexican immigrants started asking for advice on starting their own. Along 116th Street between Second and Third Avenue, Mexicans have made inroads. Amid 14 Puerto Rican flags hung from windows and fire escapes are at least eight Mexican-owned stores, among them Mexico Shoes, Azteca Unisex barbershop, Taco Mix taqueria and the Mexico Discount Center, a 99-cent store.
A vast majority of recent Mexican immigrants to El Barrio came from Puebla, a state in northern Mexico that has been battered by economic troubles and natural disasters.
Mexicans feel more welcome today. As if to prove the point, Mr. Olmedo gestured toward the back of his restaurant, where three men were eating together. "One is Mexican, one is Dominican and one is Puerto Rican," he said.
But resentment still festers in the hearts of some Puerto Ricans, who feel they have lost control.
"Puerto Ricans still consider El Barrio 'la cuna,' the cradle of Puerto Rican experience," said Henry Calderon, president of the East Harlem Chamber of Commerce.
Pepe Castillo, a Puerto Rican musician who works at Made in Puerto Rico, stood at 116th Street and Third Avenue gazing east, his brow furrowed as he extolled the virtues of "hard working Mexicans" who now dominate the block. "And it all started with the guy selling tacos on the corner," he said, in a tone tinged with loss.
Mr. Suarez sighed.
"What can you do?" he said. "The Puerto Ricans created a vacuum here. The original Puerto Ricans who came here have now retired, moved to Rockland County, Florida or back to Puerto Rico. Their children are professionals."
But, he added, "there is no decent housing here for them."
And though the mix on the corner has changed, the tension is nowhere near as fierce as it was when Italians and Puerto Ricans were the two groups.
"There is the fact that we would prefer it to remain Spanish Harlem," Mr. Suarez said. "And if the Mexicans keep coming, it will be Spanish Harlem. It will be a different kind of Spanish, but still Spanish Harlem."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH -- John G. Goode;
Smith Barney Fundamental Value Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
SUNMAID makes raisins from the grapes grown on the 40-acre farm in Fowler, Calif., where John G. Goode grew up. Mr. Goode, who still owns the farm, also runs the $2.55 billion Smith Barney Fundamental Value fund -- and he says managing its portfolio is much like farming.
"You plant the fields and hope you get a good crop," Mr. Goode said from his San Francisco office, which has a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. "But you have to keep the field tended and spend time cutting down the weeds." 
 His careful management has yielded a bounty for shareholders. The fund returned 19.92 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 7.28 percent for large-capitalization value funds in general and 17.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Goode, 55, looks for fallen stars among companies. "We're picking the leading franchises when share prices are depressed for reasons that we think are temporary," he said. "We find that even the best and brightest companies get involved in circumstances, such as product recalls, that make shares available at extremely attractive prices."
But a cheap price isn't enough; he wants to see a catalyst that will push a stock back up. "We try to pick rubber balls," he said, "not broken eggs."
He uses two computerized screens to whittle down the universe of roughly 10,000 publicly traded domestic stocks: One looks for excess cash flow over the past five years, while the other seeks high returns on the company's cost of capital. A few hundred companies qualify.
Mr. Goode then works with five analysts to select the 75 or so stocks that fit the themes and trends that they believe will be important over the next three to five years. The fund is now dominated by the market's biggest stocks, but he expects that to change.
"Our work suggests that smaller and mid-cap stocks will dominate the big S.& P. 500 stocks in the future," he said. Among the S.& P. 500 itself, he expects that "the not-so-nifty 450 will be much more attractive than the cult stocks" near the top of the list.
As inflation increases moderately, he is also moving toward hard-asset stocks like natural-resource companies. In that group, he especially likes Alcoa, one of the fund's top five holdings, because it is an efficiently run industry leader, he said.
He sees revived pricing power in many other old-economy stocks. "We're seeing higher prices for landfills, office space, electricity and natural gas," he said. "It will probably be a cyclical phenomenon, but it'll be a beauty over the next one to three years."
He spends about one-quarter of his time talking to company managers to gauge their acumen and their attitudes toward shareholders.
His valuation formulas vary by industry group, but Mr. Goode generally tends to buy shares when prices fall 20 to 40 percent from their 90-day moving average. When the price jumps far above that average or company insiders step up their selling sharply, he starts paring his position. Over all, the fund's turnover is a low 40 percent a year.
MR. GOODE regards Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company, as "the poor man's human genome play" because it specializes in drug-testing work, which will be required for new therapies emerging from genome research. Abbott's stock price is depressed, he said, because of concerns earlier this year that drug companies' growth rates were slipping. He added that the company's planned merger with Alza, the drug delivery company, "didn't happen, and that left a bad taste in investors' mouths."
The fund bought Abbott shares in January at $29.875; they now trade at $41.50, or 20.75 times Wall Street's earnings estimate of $2 a share for 2001. He expects Abbott's earnings to grow 13 percent a year through 2002.
About the same time, Mr. Goode bought shares of McKesson HBOC, the drug distributor. "We think the drug distribution business will be very attractive going forward," he said. "If you listen to Al Gore, more of the population will be covered, and drug distribution is one way to play that trend."
Wider use of generic drugs, which generate bigger profits for distributors than name-brand drugs do, will also help McKesson, he said, and he expects earnings to grow 15 percent a year for the next three years. The stock looked like a bargain, he said, after investors reacted sourly to a merger with HBO & Company last year, pushing down the price from $90 to less than $20 this spring.
The fund bought shares for $20.43; they now trade at $24.4375, or 18.79 times the consensus 2001 earnings estimate of $1.30 a share.
Another favorite is Countrywide Credit, the mortgage origination and servicing company. Mr. Goode called the stock an e-commerce play because the company does one-fifth of its business over the Internet. Interest-rate worries pushed down its stock price from $50 in early 1999 to the mid-$20's early this year; he got in for $24.99 a share in January. He noted investors' concern that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, "would tighten the screws in the economy, meaning that loan originators would be penalized as interest rates rose." But Countrywide's loan servicing business stood to benefit, he added, because higher rates would discourage homeowners from refinancing.
Mr. Goode expects Countrywide's earnings to grow 15 percent a year over three years. The stock now trades at $35.6875, or 10.1 times the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 a share for 2001.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
An Epitaph For a Rule That Just Won't Die

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
IT sounded like an epitaph for a venerated principle of economics, one that the Federal Reserve still invokes as a justification for slowing the economy.
The epitaph, in fact, came from the Fed, from Alan Greenspan himself in his latest round of Congressional testimony. The principle he declared inoperative maintains that full employment and low inflation are incompatible. That may once have been true, but the old connections are not evident now. And Mr. Greenspan's epitaph makes the Fed's next interest rate increase harder to justify. 
 The principle in question, known by the acronym Nairu, holds that when the unemployment rate falls below a certain level, inflation accelerates. One goal in slowing the economy is to increase unemployment to its "natural" level, the one at which the inflation rate neither rises nor falls. Equilibrium is a holy grail in mainstream economics.
Raising unemployment is not a pretty thing to do, particularly if people are being asked, or forced, to sacrifice their jobs in the name of a malfunctioning thesis. Mr. Greenspan had been publicly skeptical for months about Nairu, but in reply to a question from Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida -- "Do we need to move the unemployment rate back higher than 4 percent to achieve price stability?" -- the Fed chairman seemed to push Nairu into the bygone.
"My forecast," he said, "is that Nairu, which served as a very useful statistical procedure to evaluate how the economy was behaving, over a number of years, like so many types of temporary models which worked, is probably going to fail in the years ahead as a useful indicator."
Hearing this, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, asked sarcastically if Mr. Greenspan's fellow policy makers at the Fed would see a transcript of the chairman's epitaph. That was a jab at Lawrence H. Meyer, an influential Fed governor who embraces Nairu, which he puts at 5 to 5.25 percent. The Fed has already raised interest rates six times in 14 months to slow the economy, but Mr. Meyer would slow it more if unemployment fails to climb from its present 4 percent.
Mr. Greenspan's epitaph seems disingenuous. While burying Nairu, he embraces almost the same principle in a different incarnation. He speaks of running out of enough people to take jobs. Labor shortages would then give workers leverage to bargain for higher wages. Companies would raise prices to pay for the higher wages. Or, as Mr. Greenspan told Congress, "labor costs eventually would have to accelerate to levels threatening price stability."
That is Nairu, or lip service to Mr. Meyer's insistence that Nairu lives. For Mr. Greenspan, though, the natural unemployment rate appears to be 4 percent or so. The difference between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Meyer is an additional 1.4 million people out of work, maybe more. For them, the debate over Nairu matters.
NAIRU, or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, is really a description, through equations, of a set of conditions that link unemployment to inflation. Those conditions seemed a lot clearer in 1967, when Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, first described a natural rate of unemployment and mentioned the numerous factors, even states of mind, that must be "embedded" in the equations. In the 50's and early 60's, the math worked.
A low unemployment rate signaled a robust demand for goods and services. Encouraged by this, the United Auto Workers, for example, negotiated a wage increase with General Motors, and that increase became a pattern for other auto workers and for millions of employees in many industries. Employers, as a matter of course, raised prices to help pay for the higher wages. Demand made the price increases stick; today's flood of quick-to-discount competitors was not yet on the scene.
Since 1995, demand has been similarly robust, but raising prices is not as easy. Wages have risen in response to low unemployment, but not very much. The old Nairu links from unemployment through wages to inflation have not kicked in. All sorts of reasons are cited: rising productivity, falling computer prices, less expensive imports, low-wage immigrants, weak unions, corporate mobility, job insecurity. The list goes on, and the natural rate of unemployment, set at 6.5 percent in the 1980's, has declined today to 5 percent or less.
Or maybe there is no natural rate above zero. Maybe Nairu no longer works. Certainly Mr. Greenspan's disavowal makes it harder for the Fed to invoke tight labor markets as a reason to slow the economy in anticipation of rising inflation. Now more than ever, the Fed is under pressure to wait for inflation to actually accelerate before it acts.

Facing The Music

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Napster's big mistake, clearly, was basing itself in California. It should have operated out of Jersey. Not the homeland of Bruce Springsteen -- I mean old Jersey, the island in the middle of the English Channel. Or maybe the Isle of Man.
Napster, of course, is the company that made it easy for techno-savvy music fans to download free copies of their favorite tracks. Last week Judge Marilyn Patel ruled that this was piracy pure and simple, and ordered Napster to cease operations. To the surprise of most observers, a higher court has stayed that order; but Napster's future still looks very questionable. 
 The Jersey story has not been equally big news on this side of the Atlantic. But recently Jersey, neighboring Guernsey and the Isle of Man (in the Irish Sea) have come under fire as troublesome "tax havens." All three islands have a peculiar legal status: they owe allegiance to the queen but are not subject to the laws and taxes of Britain proper, and they have taken advantage of that special status to become places where money can be earned, stored and passed on to heirs free of tax. And thanks to the digital revolution, it has become much easier for companies and individuals to arrange their lives in such a way that the taxable bits -- in both senses -- show up where the tax bite (taxed byte?) is lowest. The result is that the islands average about $13 million in bank deposits for every inhabitant.
What unites these two stories? Both are about how technology is erasing boundaries -- the boundaries that we use to define intellectual property, the boundaries that we use to define tax jurisdictions. And in both cases the loss of effective boundaries, though it brings some direct advantages, threatens something important: the ability of creators to profit from their creations, the ability of governments to collect revenue.
In a way, the surprising thing about these developments is that they took so long to reach the front page. John Perry Barlow, the Grateful Dead lyricist turned cyberprophet, published his famous Wired essay "The Economy of Ideas" -- about how the digital revolution will eliminate intellectual property as we know it -- back in 1994. That's generations ago in Internet time. But digital events tend to be critical-mass phenomena: they build slowly and inconspicuously at first, then abruptly explode. Now, suddenly, both digital tax avoidance and digital theft have become major issues.
Or is it theft? Some enthusiasts for file-swapping like to claim that it isn't, that one person's decision to listen to a bootleg copy of Metallica's latest doesn't take the music away from anyone else. But of course it does. If a substantial fraction of buyers avoids paying for books, or music, or movies, it becomes that much less likely that the products will be created in the first place.
Yet even if Judge Patel's ruling is eventually upheld, it won't make much difference. Napster was a soft target, a centralized operation in which the pirated music resided on servers conveniently located where the short arm of the law could reach them. Ready to take up the slack if Napster shuts down are decentralized, "distributed" systems in which the music resides on the computers of many different people. And there is always the option of using servers located not in San Mateo but in more accommodating jurisdictions. Indeed, both Jersey Telecom and Manx Telecom are investing large sums in high-speed connections, with the hope that their islands will become homes to vast "server farms." Right now the selling point is tax avoidance, but I'm surely not the only person to notice that the same infrastructure would facilitate copyright avoidance as well.
Mr. Barlow has urged creators to follow the example of the Grateful Dead -- let the fans tape the music, and make it up on ticket sales. Somehow, I think that's a special case. He also talks cheerfully about how the 19th-century frontier was governed by the "unwritten Code of the West," which had the "fluidity of etiquette rather than the rigidity of law." Unfortunately, that etiquette didn't save the buffalo -- or give any consideration to the Indians.
The truth is that this story is much bigger than music, or even intellectual property. Something serious, and troubling, is happening -- and I haven't heard any good ideas about what to do about it.

Relishing Nicotine, Come What May

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: MIDDLESBORO, Ky.

 BODY:
At Cuz's Tobacco Outlet, one peculiar item looks like a length of brown rope folded into the shape of a large lollipop. A customer can grip it like a lollipop, and perhaps some do. Most, however, break off a bit and chew it a while, spit, and have another bit.
This item is called a twist. A section of wall is packed with different brands of cellophane-wrapped Red Ox twists, Hornet twists and Grizzly Sweet twists. Places like Cuz's also sell moist and dry snuff; plugs, which resemble dense black brownies; Apple Jack, Trophy and Rough Country chewing tobacco; Red Man totems, which are wrapped like candy bars; Bugler, Stoker's and Zig-Zag loose-leaf tobacco for roll-your-own cigarettes; and carton upon carton of cigarettes that cost as little as half as much as a "premium" brand, like Marlboro. 
 In these days of indisputable evidence of health hazards, of multibillion-dollar settlements against the leading cigarette makers, of declining smoking rates nationwide, the consumers hustling into Cuz's are a remarkable sight.
The use of tobacco, much of it in smokeless forms like snuff, plugs and chewing tobacco, remains firmly entrenched in Appalachia and in parts of the South and the Rocky Mountain states.
Along the main drags of the pillowy, kudzu-sculptured Cumberland hills of Appalachian Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia and in West Virginia, shops like Cuz's are rural siblings of the wood-paneled pipe and cigar emporiums that survive in many cities. These stores, and the convenience stores that sell wide varieties of cheap tobacco products, are as common as churches.
They cater to older farmers and coal miners with plugs, twists and chewing tobacco; to younger customers with moist snuff -- the one growing segment of the national tobacco market -- and to both with discount cigarettes.
Except for the women who buy the cigarettes, the stores' customers are men. "Men don't like women to chew tobacco," said Mable Partin, a manager at Cuz's. "You spit with all of it."
The shops sustain a subculture that still relishes nicotine, come what may.
Workplace smoking bans? Paying $16.06 for a carton of discount Maverick cigarettes and $3.06 for a pouch of Tennessee Chew, Earl Brimm explained that he works in a factory where he cannot smoke.
One chew lasts about an hour and a half, he said, and "it stops the craving for cigarettes." Spit, unlike smoke, has not been an issue at work. "I always have a box with some sawdust in it," Mr. Brimm said.
Cancer, strokes and heart attacks? "I had a heart attack," said Gillis Noe, 70, who was buying some twists and a $17.98 carton containing 12 three-ounce packs of Taylor's Pride chewing tobacco. "It destroyed 40 percent of my heart. I've had four bypasses."
Mr. Noe said his health problems plunged him into a funk. "Smoking was took away from me," he said, "and everything I like to eat. I can't get much to enjoy." So his cardiologist in Nashville let him run the risk of mouth cancer. "He told me to chew all I want to chew," he said.
Tobacco consumption nationwide has been dropping for decades. Smoking per capita plunged from 4,345 cigarettes a year in 1990 to 2,146 last year, the United States Department of Agriculture has reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the number of adults who smoke has dropped from 42 percent 35 years ago to 25 percent today. Use of chewing tobacco has declined even more.
Consumption of smokeless tobacco has been sliding for years, said Robert Maples, president of the Smokeless Tobacco Council, but it remains a sizable business, accounting for $2.3 billion a year in sales because of its strength in communities like Middlesboro.
And one widely used form of smokeless tobacco, the moist Copenhagen, Skoal and Kodiak snuff that comes in a tin the size and shape of a hockey puck, is still going strong. From 1990 to 1999, the United States Department of Agriculture reports, annual snuff production surged from 46 million pounds to 63 million.
One source of tobacco's perseverance is Kentucky, where 31 percent of the adults smoke, the highest rate in the nation. Another is West Virginia, which has the highest per capita use of smokeless tobacco.
While 1 percent or less of adult men in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island use it, the C.D.C. says, nearly 16 percent use it in West Virginia, 9 percent in Tennessee and 8.5 percent in Kentucky.
Compared to most of the rest of the country, the Appalachian states have also been reluctant to curb an industry that underpins their economies. Kentucky and Tennessee are the nation's second- and third-largest tobacco producers, after North Carolina, and the leading producers of the leaves used for smokeless tobacco.
To keep it cheap, Kentucky charges an excise tax of three cents on a pack of cigarettes, Tennessee 13 cents, and West Virginia 17 cents.
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey all tax cigarettes at least 50 cents a pack. Alaska's tax is $1.
Virginia, Kentucky and West Virginia are also among nine states that do not tax smokeless tobacco at all. Earlier this year, the West Virginia Legislature foiled the efforts of Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a Republican, to tax snuff and chewing tobacco.
Like the industry itself, tobacco users around here no longer pretend that smoking and chewing tobacco or dipping snuff are harmless, and any who do are reminded of the dangers with every item they buy.
A 16-ounce bag of Apple chewing tobacco warns, "This product may cause gum disease and tooth loss." The wrapping on King B twist reads, "This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes."
Instead of denying the risks, users defend their habit as an expression of personal liberty. Ms. Partin, who is 43, said she would like very much to stop smoking, but she enjoys it. "I've smoked since I was 8 years old," she said. "My mother died from emphysema from smoking. She was 60. That was her choice."
Whatever the national trends, the tobacco stores around here say they are doing good business.
Eleven miles north of Middlesboro, in Pineville, Glen and Shannon Sexton have an auto repair shop. Next door was a tobacco shop where business was slow because, they figured, the owner had lost interest and kept irregular hours. "So we bought the place," Ms. Sexton said.
Clean and fully stocked, the shop is thriving. But the Sextons are a little troubled about their new venture.
"We don't even smoke," Mr. Sexton said. "Or chew," Ms. Sexton added. "We don't know if we did a good deed or not," Mr. Sexton said.

A Costly Lesson About Best-Laid Plans

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

 BODY:
Few government-supported lending institutions have had the kind of high-profile start that the Los Angeles Community Development Bank received from the Clinton Administration five years ago. Vice President Al Gore traveled to Los Angeles himself and, with top city officials at his side, heaped praise on the $435 million bank and its plan to create inner-city jobs by lending to local companies that commercial banks had overlooked.
Now, as Democrats prepare to gather for their convention just a stone's throw from some of the city's most depressed neighborhoods, the bank is not just a disaster, but also an orphan. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which financed the bank, has said that managing it is the city's job. But the city's development program, Genesis L.A., barely acknowledges that the bank exists. And city officials have said the bank is too mired in red tape to be effective. 
 The bank's loan portfolio, meanwhile, is shot through with expensive defaults, and its management is mired in litigation with angry borrowers who contend that bank incompetence forced them out of business. One company, Summit Industries, has already won a $9.2 million judgment against the bank.
The bank is looking more and more like an expensive, well-intentioned but misguided experiment in inner-city economic development from which there will be painful lessons. Bank officials are now focused on salvaging some vestige of earlier programs in an effort to stay alive.
"It's been a true fiasco," said George Akers, whose failed company, Trinity Knitworks, was the bank's first borrower in 1996 and is now suing it, contending fraud.
The Los Angeles Community Development Bank has made a total of $118 million in loans, all to businesses within what is called an empowerment zone, a 19-square-mile patchwork of economically depressed neighborhoods. A total of $36 million of those have gone bad so far, the largest for $24.1 million to a failed dairy project, exceeding the bank's own lending limits.
Peter Taylor, chairman of the bank's board and an executive at Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm, said the bank had closed offices and slashed the size of its staff from 29 to 14. The bank is trying to reduce its debt to H.U.D. from roughly $100 million at the beginning of this year to about $20 million by year-end.
"The old approach to spurring economic redevelopment in the inner city didn't work," Mr. Taylor said. "There was way too much red tape and the board was overly politicized. So we're going to try a new approach. We're basically taking the year to restructure the management, restructure the board, restructure the staff."
He added: "There were wildly unrealistic expectations when this opened. We're going to be more realistic."
Roberto Barragan, the president of the Valley Economic Development Center, another government-supported lender in the area, said the only way to salvage the bank is to turn it into a private institution, but that can happen only after all the outstanding suits are settled.
"They have to stop what they were doing and operate in a completely different way," Mr. Barragan said. "Their lending mechanism was doomed. They did a good job in their micro-lending, but the changes now may be too little, too late."

The Hiring Doesn't Stop

BYLINE: By Mickey Meece

 BODY:
Corporate America's hiring binge will continue through the end of the year -- though at a slower pace -- especially in telecommunications, information technology and pharmaceuticals companies, according to a survey by Management Recruiters International of Cleveland.
Of the more than 3,600 executives in the survey, which is conducted twice a year, 53.2 percent said they planned to add to middle and upper management and professional staffs in the second half. That figure was down less than a percentage point from the first half. 
 Just over a third of the respondents, 35.6 percent, plan to keep staff sizes at current levels, down 2.6 percentage points. And 11.2 percent plan to cut back, versus 8.1 percent in the first half.
"If there is any slowing in the economy, and we certainly don't see it, the demand for people continues," said Allen Salikof, president and chief executive of Management Recruiters.
The biggest need was seen in telecommunications, where 80.3 percent of the executives planned increases, followed by information technology, 72.5 percent, and pharmaceuticals, 64.4 percent.
"We're seeing more companies that are willing to consider candidates outside their own industries, if their skills and experience are transferable," Mr. Salikof said. "When more than 80 percent of the executives surveyed in the telecom industry are seeking to increase their staffs, it's inevitable that they have to enlarge the pool of candidates." Mickey Meece

Pay Gap for Hispanic Workers

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
While the booming economy has provided a lift for many American workers, Hispanics earned half of what whites did in 1998, on average, with many stuck in low-paying jobs offering little promise of advancement, according to a report by the National Conference of La Raza, a Hispanic group.
Per capita income for Hispanics was $11,434 in 1998, the latest year for which data is available, compared with $12,957 for blacks and $22,952 for whites. 
 But Hispanics had the highest percentage increase in per capita income from 1997 to 1998: 4.5 percent, compared with 3.3 percent for blacks and 3.2 percent for whites.

HEADLINE: A New Age in Employment

 BODY:
Here and there, American businesses have begun to discover the value of hiring or retraining older workers. In some cases, those placements have been for specialized, high-income jobs -- as in the financial services sector, where companies like New York Life and Salomon Brothers Asset Management have begun hiring more salespeople over 50, in part because their age may give them an edge in a world where two-thirds of the money in the stock market is controlled by managers over 50. Other placements have been for specialized, low-income jobs, like the 100 women, average age 71, hired by Bonnie Bell to package lip gloss. They replaced a group of younger, less reliable temporary workers.
It is so far a tiny trend. But the reasons for it are big and growing, and the nation's employers need to learn from them. The unemployment rate has been hovering around 4 percent in recent months. The tight labor market, which has created intense competition for qualified employees at every level, may not be a fluke but a new reality. That is because it stems not just from a growing economy, and an older work force that has been retiring at progressively younger ages, but from a shrinking number of young workers, too. Thanks to lower birth rates, there are simply fewer young people available to fill new jobs. Within four years, for the first time in American history, there will be fewer people aged 20 to 29 in the population than people 55 to 69. The gap will grow. By 2020, the younger group may be 40 percent smaller than the older one. 
 By then, about half the boomer generation -- those 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 -- will have passed the age of 65. They are healthier than their parents. They will live longer, and two surveys in the last two years, by Fortune magazine and AARP, found that 74 to 80 percent of them expect to still be working in retirement. A recent Harris poll estimated that there are four million people over 65 who would like to be working
In the past, traditional biases against older workers -- that they are slow, less motivated than younger people and technologically inept -- have closed that door. But the changing demographics led William Zinke, head of a private human resources company, to commission a survey by Harris last fall of the human resource directors at almost 800 American companies. Eighty percent of them agreed that there was less turnover among older workers than younger ones, 74 percent said they were more reliable, and 71 percent said they had as much ability to acquire new skills. Sixty-two percent agreed that younger workers were actually less creative and innovative than older workers, and 80 percent said they had more absenteeism.
It seems a striking vote of confidence by the nation's corporate gatekeepers in the qualities of older workers. But their actions have not been the equal of their words. Those gatekeepers have been doing their best to push older workers out for years, because they are paid more than younger ones. As the boomer generation begins turning 55 next year, corporate America should be finding ways to retain, retrain or rehire old workers.

A Philadelphia Tryout for Clinton's Old Script

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THERE are three things you will have to look hard for as you tune in to the Republican National Convention here this week: A true-blue conservative icon on center stage. (There may be a few, but they will be sprinkled in a line-up that resembles a Benetton commercial.) Any utterance of the word "abortion." (You're more likely to hear the words, "poor" or "underclass.") The traditional savaging of the opposition. (Instead, look for subtle denigrations of the Clinton-Gore years and bipartisan overtures.)
If the Republicans seem timid about bashing President Clinton this year, it's only fitting. That's because they've stolen his political game plan. In fact the Grand Old Party is attempting to refashion itself entirely, clearly using Mr. Clinton as its model. 
 Eight years after Mr. Clinton captured the White House by venturing toward the middle and running against some of the orthodoxies of his party -- including those on welfare, teacher unions and racial quotas -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is trying a similar approach. While Mr. Bush is not moving as far as Mr. Clinton in forsaking the principles of his party, he sounds a lot like a Democrat when he holds forth about protecting Social Security, reaching out to the dispossessed and lavishing more money on public education.
Mr. Bush last week startled Democrats and Republicans alike when he spoke out about prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Mr. Bush has even appropriated Mr. Clinton's mantra from 1992, "a different kind of Democrat." He would be "a different kind of Republican," he reassures audiences.
This weekend, Republicans are advertising "a different kind of convention." This is what Americans will see on stage: A single mom. A grandmother and granddaughter talking about Social Security. A rank-and-file union member discussing his economic plight. A teacher chatting about education reform.
But to win the White House, Mr. Bush must prove that he is doing more than muffling the vitriol by yanking the Patrick Buchanans and Marilyn Quayles and Phil Gramms offstage. His challenge is to assemble a new Republican majority with the help of constituencies that voted Democratic four years ago.
To do that, he has to convince voters that he is not beholden to the right wing. With some success, polls show, Mr. Bush is making a play for the blue-collar Democrats and suburban women who backed Mr. Clinton overwhelmingly four years ago. He is reaching out aggressively to Latino voters. He even dared to speak before the N.A.A.C.P., not because he thought he could convert African American voters -- among the Democratic Party's most loyal backers --- but because of the signal it would send to moderates that he is inclusive.
Part of the calculation, too, is that such appeals could at the very least give minorities less reason to mobilize against Republicans on Election Day.
Mr. Bush can afford to reach out to moderates this year because the base of his own party, ravenous to reclaim the White House, is willing to make compromises. Not since the love fest for Ronald Reagan in 1984 have Republicans appeared so harmonious on the eve of their convention.
"If you spend one day of this convention making Republicans happy, you're wasting your time because they already are," said Rick Davis, a top official at four past Republican conventions.
As the campaign intensifies, though, Mr. Gore and the Democrats will increasingly portray Mr. Bush as Newt Gingrich without the scowl. To this end, they were handed some potent ammunition last week, when Mr. Bush picked Dick Cheney as his running mate.
The Cheney pairing suggested that Mr. Bush was harkening to his party's conservative past rather than seeking a partner who could broaden the ticket's ideological appeal. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, won credibility as a reconfigured Democrat by picking Al Gore -- assembling a southern moderate ticket.
Mr. Bush did not have to settle on a conservative. He has the latitude denied Bob Dole when, four years ago, he picked Jack Kemp as his running mate. Mr. Dole, however, needed someone to rouse the party's conservative faithful, who had not rallied around him, as they have around Mr. Bush.
Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, said he was reassured by the Cheney pick. "The fact that he's reaching out to swing voters is not a bad thing," he said. "You can trust the candidate. You know where he's coming from philosophically. He's not doing anything to alienate his base. That's the important thing."
Will he be as successful at co-opting -- or at least taming -- the opposition as Mr. Clinton? Or will he fail, as did Michael Dukakis in 1988? In that year's campaign, Vice President George Bush effectively branded him a Massachusetts liberal and card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Thus far, Mr. Bush and the Republicans have had it both ways. It happened this weekend in Philadelphia. The Bush-controlled Republican Party drafted a platform that cast off several hard-edged party positions of the past, like abolishing the Education Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. The hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on abortion -- with no exceptions -- despite a drive on Friday by some party members to soften the langauge.
It happened in Austin last week. There Mr. Bush was, introducing to the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as Democratic as Al Gore.
Mr. Bush declared that he called upon Mr. Cheney to help him "accomplish some great goals" for the nation: "To save and strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools." All but the last point -- "To rebuild our military to keep the peace" -- sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al Gore's mouth.
The Democrats, of course, are already working hard not to let Mr. Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to private schools.
Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological divides between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.
Still, Mr. Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Mr. Bush calls himself a "compassionate conservative," Mr. Eisenhower favored the term "dynamic conservatism."
William J. Bennett, the former education secretary, said the convention strategy is too middle-of-the-road for his taste, but defends it as smart politics."The convention is not as right-wing as I am," he said. "They're not taking advice from the old Washington hands. They're following their own counsel -- and doing it brilliantly."
Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their bread-and-butter issues -- prayer in school, and opposing abortion and homosexual rights -- get short shrift (or no shrift at all), Mr. Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who worry that the party is losing its soul.
David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, warned that Mr. Bush had better be careful that his overtures to moderates do not become more substantive. "The feel-good stuff and atmospherics is all fine," he said. "But when push comes to shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear distinction between their position and the Democratic position on the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting your base in danger."
For now, Mr. Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring conservatives than his father, former President George Bush, whose was never fully trusted on the right.
Mr. Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech, written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. "I just hope and pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, 'Read My Lips,' " Mr. Robertson said. "We don't need any tax pledge redux!"
So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political stage.

HEADLINE: Drug Runners Are Finding the Going Easy in Haiti

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: LEOGANE, Haiti

 BODY:
For Del Lydes, the drug planes that circle over the cornfields have become as common as the flies that buzz around his cows. They swoop down past the trees and roll to a stop along the two-lane road that slices through the fields. Then men with machine guns stash their cargo -- cocaine -- into cars.
"Around here it is a cocaine area," Mr. Lydes said. "A lot of people have moved. But others come at night to wait for the planes." 
 The "others" are his impoverished neighbors, who gather in hope of snatching a few bags of cocaine they can then sell for a fraction of the drug's street value in the United States. Recently gunmen kept a mob at bay while unloading the drugs, then abandoned the plane. The angry crowd tore it apart in a vain search for drugs.
"People think they are going to get rich from cocaine," Mr. Lydes said. "When they see a plane they gather around, but when the pilots see them they scare off the plane."
Unwittingly, these mobs have become perhaps Haiti's only front-line deterrent to the Colombian cocaine traffickers, who, ever adept at finding a weak spot in the Caribbean through which to funnel their drugs northward, have flocked to impoverished Haiti bringing cash, crime and corruption.
Haiti's inexperienced, understaffed and underpaid police force and courts have proved irresistible to smugglers who ferry cocaine aboard speedboats and small planes before hiding it in ships bound for Miami and Puerto Rico, or just trucking it into the neighboring Dominican Republic.
"My only broad-gauge assessment is that Haiti is a disaster," said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the United States anti-drug effort. "We've got weak to nonexistent democratic institutions, a police force that is on the verge of collapse from internal corruption and an eroding infrastructure that is creating a path of very little resistance. We are watching an alarming increase."
Since last October, United States Customs officials have confiscated almost 7,000 pounds of cocaine -- three times the total for the previous year -- in Haitian ships docked in the Miami River. American law enforcement officials estimate that about 67 tons, or 14 percent, of the cocaine that enters the United States now comes through Haiti.
In general, more than half of the cocaine headed for the United States flows through the Caribbean.
In recent years, American anti-drug agents have tried to focus more on Haiti, but have been hampered by a political paralysis that has left the country without a functioning legislature for the last year and therefore prevented passage of money-laundering laws. In addition, Haitian law enforcement officials say, the Americans are wary of sharing information.
Almost no drugs are confiscated in Haiti, which is woefully under-equipped to wage the war on narcotics. There is a three-year-old anti-drug police squad with just 25 members. Local authorities have no radar or helicopters to monitor Haiti's airspace and fewer than 10 boats to patrol the coastline. Some 250 police officers have been dismissed for drug-related crimes.
Evidence of the riches trafficking has brought can be seen in Belvil, a sprawling gated community of luxury homes that has boomed conspicuously in an otherwise desperate economy. New construction is everywhere, and new gas stations dot the Port-au-Prince area, some offering to wire money in $1,000 installments to Colombia.
In other parts of the country, the coasts are littered with the burned shells of speedboats and the roads with the wrecks of small planes that have skidded into steep embankments. No one knows how many make it through unscathed.
The Haitian police have seized some cocaine shipments in recent months, including 550 pounds inside a Belvil home. Local crowds have stolen parts of other shipments; in the town of Grand-Goave in May, the police recovered only 323 pounds of a suspected 4,400-pound shipment. Among those who tried to steal drugs was the town's deputy mayor, who was shot dead by his bodyguard in a dispute over his share.
"I think the volume is progressively increasing," said Pierre Denize, the director of the Haitian National Police. "The Colombians went from fast boats to more and more airdrops and clandestine landings. They have this world-renowned capacity to stay one step ahead of the repression."
Haitian law enforcement officials said that drug pilots had free run of the skies once the international airport and its radar closed in the early evening. Even when American surveillance planes spot a drug plane entering Haitian airspace, limited manpower and rough roads mean there is often little authorities can do to intercept it.
"We follow planes and boats into Haiti, but there is no endgame," said Raymond Kelly, the Customs Service commissioner. "There is no entity on the ground that can respond quickly. We need help. They need help."
Even searching sitting targets can be daunting to the few inspectors assigned to outlying areas, like the busy port of Gonaives.
"If you go to any harbor outside of Port-au-Prince and try to find a law enforcement person, it's like finding Waldo in those kid's books," said an American Embassy official. "Very few take the initiative to search the boats because they have no way out. Twice in the past year, the Haitian Coast Guard had to go to Gonaives to take personnel off the pier because they were being threatened."
The Drug Enforcement Administration has eight agents stationed in Haiti, where they train the local anti-narcotics squad, which in the last 12 months has confiscated $4 million in drug profits that were being smuggled out of the country. The United States Coast Guard also has permission to patrol Haitian waters, and it is helping the Haitian government open several new ports, which would allow Haitian anti-drug officers to spread out from Port-au-Prince.
Haitian officials said they have asked banks to collect information on people depositing more than $10,000 in cash. But money-laundering laws that would allow closer investigations have been stalled in Parliament. Immigration authorities require visas for visitors from Colombia, and the airport police routinely question arriving Colombians and keep their passports until they leave.
Haitian law enforcement officials, for their part, complain that cooperation with the United States has been disappointing. "Given how much cocaine the United States says comes through here, you'd think they'd be as good at catching drug boats as they are with stopping refugee boats, which they excel at," said a high-ranking Haitian official. "They say this is a war, but is it?"
Several high-ranking Haitian law enforcement officials said they almost never got advance word about suspicious incoming planes.
"The United States sits where it sits and says we are not doing anything about this," Mr. Denize, the police chief, said. "Hey, I'm willing. But I can't initiate the interception, or the radar, or the boats or the intelligence sharing. I can't go bust someone if I don't know who or where he is."
But American officials are worried that drug-related corruption has penetrated the police force and even the government. Earlier this year, the police inspector general was transferred to a diplomatic post when he investigated several police supervisors on suspicion of helping the drug smugglers.
There has also been constant talk that several recently elected senators of the Family Lavalas party, which is headed by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, are involved in the drug trade. Party officials deny this charge, saying it is misinformation spread by political opponents to discredit the party.
"I would suspect there are officials who are involved," an American diplomat said. "We have some evidence of that. The question is how high it goes up. We have no corroboration of any kind suggesting that it is at the highest levels of government."
Some American officials admit that they are careful when sharing information with Haitian counterparts. "The fact is we factor in corruption as part of our strategy when we are dealing with Haitian smuggling," a Customs official said.
General McCaffrey said that given the "collapsing" relationship with Haitian law enforcement agencies, the United States was focusing on the drugs after they leave Haiti and reach the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
"The ability of the noncorrupt Haitian law enforcement and customs authorities to combat this is diminishing rapidly," General McCaffrey said. "The political will to support them isn't there."

HEADLINE: Virginia's Desperate Step To Protect the Blue Crab

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

DATELINE: NEWPORT NEWS, Va., July 26

 BODY:
In the face of economic and environmental warning signs, state fishery authorities have taken the drastic step of declaring a vast 665-square-mile fishermen-free sanctuary through the heart of the lower Chesapeake Bay to provide safe passage for the millions of female blue crabs now on the southward trek to their high-salt spawning grounds.
The marine police are on the prowl by boat and airplane to keep poachers from the female crabs that are the key to maintaining what has been the Chesapeake region's most lucrative fishery yield. The no-harvest sanctuary was ordered because authorities say there has been a one-third drop in productivity and, of even greater concern, a 70 percent drop in the number of females of spawning age. 
 "This is rather alarming," said Jack G. Travelstead, director of fisheries for the Marine Resources Commission of Virginia. The commission oversees the region's major spawning grounds for the blue crab, which has long been one of the most fecund and resilient of bay creatures.
But marine scientists, mindful of the Chesapeake's disastrous loss of its once vast oyster crop, say the female blue crab population has not suffered so much since it was devastated by Hurricane Agnes in 1972.
"Our real concern is that if there's a natural disturbance on top of the current problems, we might teeter on the edge of the collapse of the blue crab," said Rom Lipcius, a professor at the College of William and Mary who is the crab expert for the state's Institute of Marine Science.
The roughly 55-mile-long, 10-mile-wide sanctuary for the migrating females is intended to serve as a deep-water corridor off limits to the watermen now plying the bay and its tributaries for the succulent catch.
"This is a pre-emptive strike against the increased numbers of crabbers in the bay and their shift to deeper and deeper waters in going after blue crab," said Professor Lipcius. He noted that a much smaller spawning-ground sanctuary had been maintained for decades but that something far more drastic proved necessary.
A range of contributing factors to the blue crab problem is under study by scientists in Maryland and Virginia. They include overfishing by watermen setting more crab pots, the erosion of bay grasses vital for young crabs' survival and the prodigious revival of striped bass, croakers and the other natural predators that savor crabs as much as humans do.
Even before the study is completed next year, fishing authorities decided last month that the threat to the bay's signature blue crab industry had grown serious enough to require an immediate declaration of the sanctuary. Crabbers were caught short as it was ordered to be in effect annually during the spawning season, from June 1 to Sept. 15. It covers the primary spawning corridor and grounds south from the Maryland border to the lower bay's mouth to the ocean.
"There's a question of whether this is good or not," said Dale Taylor, president of the Virginia Watermen's Association, summarizing various complaints of his 100-member organization that their livelihood could be seriously affected. "But I say let's try it and see what it does. We'd all like to build our stock up more," said Mr. Taylor, who worked for three decades as a marine patrol enforcement officer, then decided seven years ago to become a waterman and go after blue crab.
Out on the bay, crabbers heading home after predawn trips seemed to have assorted complaints and suspicions about the skein of underlying problems as they questioned whether the sanctuary would work.
"Time will tell," said Capt. Kenny Oliver of the Virginia Marine Patrol, cruising the bay and praising most watermen so far for respecting the sanctuary as a way to bolster the blue crab industry in the long run. The catch in recent years, says Professor Lipcius, has fallen off to about 60 million pounds of crab meat in Virginia and Maryland waters, as opposed to the 80 million to 100 million pounds taken in richer days in the 1960's.
"Let's take a look here," Captain Oliver said, pulling alongside the Evie J and hopping aboard to check out the catch of Mike Mahoney, a waterman for 18 years who has the muscular arms and weathered face to prove it.
"No problem for me," Mr. Mahoney said of the sanctuary, noting that he usually set his pots in shallower waters than the standard of 35 feet and deeper decreed for the sanctuary. He noted that some pregnant females could be legally kept if they were from shallower depths.
Captain Oliver and his partner, Officer Paul Newman, who are part of the state's 65-member sanctuary patrol, decide in spot checks whether the complexities of the crabbing regulations are being violated.
Captain Oliver intently studied the barrels of crabs Mr. Mahoney said he had caught outside the new sanctuary. He zeroed in on pregnant females, called sponge crabs because of the look of the bulky accretion on their undersides containing the millions of fertilized eggs they carry as they scuttle south to spawn. Outside the sanctuary, regulations say females with orange sponge can be kept; those further along to spawning, however, have dark-colored sponge and must be returned to the bay.
Such regulations are studded with loopholes in the eyes of critics. They complain that economic pressures have meant the government has shied from effectively controlling watermen and the number of crab pots they are permitted to set. Mr. Taylor, president of one of the dozen watermen's associations, said he was so tired of the disputes over precisely what was ailing the blue crab that he wanted to see an extended ban on the harvesting of all females anywhere in the bay as a loophole-free test.
"Crabs go through good years and bad," Mr. Taylor said. "But let's not take any females at all anywhere for three years and see how well that builds the stock," he said, upping the debate ante considerably.
For now, however, state regulators will stick with the sweeping sanctuary as the most telling signal yet of their determination to protect the blue crab stock and ward off another catastrophe on the order of the demise of the bay's oyster fishery.
"A lot of its effectiveness depends on peer pressure by the watermen themselves," said Mr. Travelstead, the state fisheries director. "The public has to buy it, or otherwise it won't work. We can't put an officer on every crabbing boat out there."

HEADLINE: Cuts in Loan Program Squeeze Doctors Who Work With Poor

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
When she finished her residency last year, Dr. Regan Andrade received a flurry of job offers near her New York City home. Saddled with $250,000 in student loans, however, she rejected them all. Instead, she signed up for a federal government program that offered a $50,000 bonus to practice in poor communities where doctors are hard to find.
So, last fall, Dr. Andrade packed up her three children and took a lower-paying position as a family practitioner in Newport, Wash., a rural logging town of roughly 2,000 people, where the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Her new employer was the only hospital in the county -- in fact, the only one for 30 miles around. It had 24 beds. 
 About six months later, settled and working, Dr. Andrade learned that she would not get a grant after all. Without any warning, the government program had run out of money.
"If I had any inkling that my loan repayment wasn't going to come through, I wouldn't have come. I couldn't have," Dr. Andrade said. "I'm disgusted. It feels like they're filling these needy areas without having to pay anyone to do it."
Multiply her frustration by 700. At least that many doctors, dentists, psychologists and other health professionals have signed up for two-year stints in poor urban and rural areas with the aim of paying back part of their student loans and, like Dr. Andrade, they are being told that the money they expected will not materialize, federal officials say.
The National Loan Repayment Program, a $30 million pool of money to attract health workers to remote towns and inner-city neighborhoods, has exhausted its funds after making only a few dozen grants to new applicants this year, threatening the government's ability to get medical professionals where they are needed most.
The reason: the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the program, cut its budget sharply this year to meet other spending requirements set by Congress.
With the remaining money, the department for the first time gave grants to people who were still waiting for awards from the previous year. It also gave additional funds to health care providers who had put in their required two years of service, hoping the money would be an incentive for them to stay put, rather than abandon poor communities as soon as their contracts run out.
That left newcomers to the program like Dr. Andrade in a financing limbo -- but few say they were ever told. The agency had no policy to warn them that there were prior claims on the money. Officials in Washington said they thought their field offices, scattered around the country, would take on that responsibility.
With a record number of professionals vying for the smallest amount of money in years, the budgetary shortfall is the worst in the program's 11-year history. And it is not likely to improve. The 1989 law authorizing the grants is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30 -- and agency officials fear it will not be reauthorized. Few members of Congress are familiar with the program because it has rarely come up in hearings since its creation and because many other health care programs have more effective lobbyists arguing for them.
In a year dominated by high-profile health care debates, including a patients' "bill of rights" and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, the program has received scant attention in Washington. As yet, no member of Congress has stepped forward to sponsor legislation to renew it, and with the end of the year fast approaching, officials wonder if there is still time.
"We desperately need a reauthorization," said Dr. Claude Earl Fox, who oversees the program for the department. Dr. Fox said the loan repayment program would still be eligible for one-year extensions at current spending levels, even without explicit reauthorization. But with a growing backlog of applicants, grants under the program would be even harder to obtain, he said.
Most of the professionals who were denied financing are already working in overburdened clinics, where they have logged thousands of hours treating indigent and uninsured patients. Some have been on duty for more than a year, expecting their grants would arrive at any time. Most say they did not learn that the money would not come through until several months after they had accepted positions that typically pay less than jobs in private practice or at health maintenance organizations.
Some have still not been told, despite calling repeatedly to ask when their money would arrive, since the department missed many of its own deadlines for letting providers know their status.
"That's what really upsets me," said Dr. Roxanne Collins, a dentist who has worked at Las Clinicas del Norte El Rito in rural New Mexico since March of last year. "They didn't even bother to tell me that they didn't have the funds."
After graduating from the Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University in 1998 with $150,000 in student debt, Dr. Collins says she passed up positions paying $40,000 more than what she now earns in favor of loan repayment. It seemed like a good idea at the time, she says, since her preference has always been to work with Spanish-speaking immigrants. But she says her salary alone is barely enough to make her $2,000 monthly loan payments. "If I had known I wouldn't get a grant, I wouldn't even have bothered," she said.
A few of the doctors have begun investigating whether they have any legal recourse to force the government to come up with the money for the loan payments. But government officials say they have not reneged on any written commitment, since the medical professionals signed employment contracts with the clinics, not the government.
Grappling with the budget shortage, the department saved its new grants for areas with the greatest need. And so it unexpectedly eliminated more than 100 clinics that had long been approved for loan repayment from its list of eligible sites.
"I feel like I'm playing a game, but they keep changing the rules on me," said Mary Joan L. Murphy, a nurse practitioner in New York who says her clinic was deemed ineligible after she worked there for more than a year.
The unpredictability of the process has alarmed officials of community health centers, which are the only primary health care option for many of the nation's poor and uninsured, a population with particularly acute medical needs. Recruiting trained specialists is a daunting task for the centers, and many worry that the scarcity of new grants will greatly worsen staffing shortages, especially at clinics in rural areas.
"We use loan repayment as our primary recruiting tool," said Stephen D. Wilhide, chairman of the National Rural Health Association committee that is leading the effort to lobby Congress for reauthorization. "We could simply not get enough doctors without it."
The same is true for many inner-city clinics that have recently hired physicians with the promise of loan repayment, unaware that a mere handful would be approved. Unless grants are virtually guaranteed in the coming years, many clinics fear they will no longer be able to bring new medical professionals on board.
"This has definitely affected our credibility," said Vicki L. Marie, a recruiter for Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Services, a chain of clinics serving Cleveland's African-American population. Last year, the health service hired two physicians with the expectation that they would get their loans repaid, just as it has in past years before grants were in such short supply. "Now, we're just sitting here hoping that these providers don't leave and go to a more lucrative practice," she said.
But in fact, compelled to pay off their loans, and in some cases feeling betrayed, some clinic staffers say they are already looking for better-paying jobs elsewhere.
Three years ago, Colleen Wall-Hoeben, a clinical psychologist, moved to the windy buttes of Wyoming in order to get money to repay loans. The job she accepted, she said, paid roughly half the salary of $75,000 to $100,000 that awaited her at a Salt Lake City private practice, but it would enable her to erase her debt.
Or so she thought. In May, Dr. Wall-Hoeben received a letter informing her that the program had run out of money, a formal notice that many have yet to receive.
"It doesn't make sense to stay, earning at that low of a level, with the hope of someday getting the loan repayment," Dr. Wall-Hoeben said. "It's a lot of hard work, and there's more money to be made at other places."
Faced with the prospect of losing some of their most qualified staff members, some health centers are scrambling to raise money to compensate them for the loss in federal subsidies. But community clinics' fund-raising capabilities are limited, since most rely on government grants to keep their doors open.
Nor can most clinics tap into patient fees to pay for higher salaries. Required by law to serve anyone in need of treatment, most government-funded health centers see a disproportionate number of uninsured patients who are asked to pay what they can. Other patients are mostly covered by Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that had their reimbursement rates cut under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
Besieged by calls from cash-short clinics, the National Association of Community Health Centers began lobbying members of Congress this spring, pushing for an expansion of the loan repayment program. After meeting with representative from both parties, the association secured a $4 million increase in the House budget for the program, but no growth in the levels proposed by the Clinton administration or by the Senate. Association officials are fairly confident that the increase in the House, though small, will make it into the final budget for the program.
"That's peanuts; that's not enough," said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who began looking into the program last month.
Representative Maloney said it was unlikely Congress would consider releasing additional money through an emergency measure, as it did in June to support troops in Kosovo, combat drugs in Columbia and provide relief for wildfire and flood victims.
With that in mind, community health centers began an effort to get the program's legislation reauthorized, a rare opportunity to showcase the importance of loan repayment and press for more money.
But the coalition was riddled with internal conflicts, and it quickly disbanded after dividing over how much money should be designated for different medial specialties.
"These squabbles have frozen any action on the Hill," lamented Dan Hawkins, policy director of the National Association of Community Health Centers.
Health department officials are equally frustrated that the reauthorization effort appears to have been shelved. Under current law, all cash awards to health workers are taxable, a disincentive the program has overcome by adding money to each grant. For years, department officials have sought to rewrite the law to make the grants tax-free, a change that would free money to pay for 200 more clinicians each year.
Still, the department says it would have to place at least 20,000 clinicians, compared with the 1,900 it now supports, to assure poor communities adequate access to health care.
"The bottom line is, the need is appalling in comparison to the resources available," Dr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: President at Center of Venezuela's Delayed 'Mega-Election'

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, July 29

 BODY:
Two months after a first attempt collapsed in ineptitude and scandal, Venezuela will try again on Sunday to hold the biggest vote in its history, a "mega-election" in which thousands of candidates, from President Hugo Chavez down to state legislators, are competing.
Mr. Chavez himself is the only real issue in the vote, which he called in hopes of winning a new six-year term. Despite an economy that shrank by more than 7 percent last year, record unemployment and a big jump in crime, public opinion polls are unanimous in predicting a Chavez romp by a margin of 15 percentage points or more. 
 The battle for 23 governorships and 165 seats in a new one-house National Assembly is expected to be somewhat closer, with most opinion surveys predicting that Mr. Chavez will fall short of the two-thirds majority he will need to gain quick approval of his far-reaching social and economic reform program. Such a result could force him to pursue a more moderate course and negotiate with the opposition.
Those races are expected to be particularly close in areas where the multiparty coalition supporting Mr. Chavez was unable to unite behind a common candidate, possibly splitting the pro-Chavez vote and allowing his opponents to win.
Since he was first elected in December 1998, Mr. Chavez has blamed a "rancid oligarchy" of political and business interests for the country's malaise. In a typically fiery speech on Wednesday ending his campaign, he asked his followers for a landslide victory to "liquidate our adversaries from the field of battle" once and for all and allow him finally to carry out the "peaceful social revolution" he has long promised.
Mr. Chavez's main challenger is Francisco Arias Cardenas, who, like Mr. Chavez, is a former army colonel who took part in a coup attempt in 1992. The men then spent two years in jail together and were friends and political allies until early this year, when Mr. Arias angrily accused the president of concentrating all power in his own hands, alienating the United States and falling under the spell of Fidel Castro.
Venezuela has become "a de facto dictatorship," Mr. Arias charged at a news conference here on Friday. "Corruption, poverty and unemployment are accelerating," he said, because the Chavez administration has "violated all the norms and protocols" of good government and pursued economic policies that were hostile to free enterprise.
There is also a third candidate, the former Caracas mayor, Claudio Fermin. He has no chance of winning, and has come under pressure from the Arias camp to withdraw, but chose to remain in the race because, he said, he did not think the choices available to voters should be limited to two military officers who have tried to overthrow the government.
This will be Venezuela's sixth vote in less than two years, including three to draft and ratify a new Constitution expanding presidential powers, and voters are showing signs of boredom and impatience. On Friday, Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel predicted to reporters that half of the 11.8 million eligible voters would stay home because of "voter fatigue" and a lack of suspense about the outcome.
"Frankly, I'm getting tired of having to cast a ballot every few months or so," said Zoila Chacon Jimenez, a sales clerk in a department store here. "Democracy is great, but what we really need is for somebody to do something about the economy, and the quicker the better."
Sunday's vote was originally scheduled for May 28. But when the National Electoral Council, dominated by inexperienced Chavez supporters, proved unable to provide the ballot information needed for new computerized voting machines, Mr. Chavez reluctantly urged a postponement rather than running the risk of seeing the legitimacy of his expected landslide victory tarnished.
Council members at first sought to blame an American company hired to supply the technology for the vote, but that explanation convinced no one here, and a public furor forced the entire commission to resign. This week, the country's chief prosecutor filed corruption charges against five former members of the council.
Mr. Arias and other opposition figures have complained of irregularities in the new council's organization, saying oversight measures that "would have generated confidence have been eliminated." But international observers maintain that although some technical flaws remain, they can find no evidence of a government effort to steal votes.
"We have no concern that the integrity of the election has been endangered at all," former President Jimmy Carter, leading a 48-member observer delegation, said at a news conference here Friday. Ruben Perina, head of an Organization of American States observer team, added, "We see this vote very differently from the May process." He attributed the accusations to a growing "polarization and mistrust in the political culture here."

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
With G.O.P. Guests, Camden Tries to Paint Over Its Rot

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
FOR just one evening, this city is trying not to ooze misery. It deployed the Public Works Department's only grass cutter to mow vacant lots downtown, forsaking 2,000 others that need tending. The streets need cleaning, but the city's seven sweepers are old and broken. Camden has 3,500 vacant buildings, but only a three-man crew to keep them boarded up.
The Republicans are coming to Camden tonight, and the task of making the East St. Louis of the East presentable would have challenged Potemkin himself. 
 Welcoming ceremonies for the Republican National Convention will be held on Camden's waterfront, the only redeveloped slice of the city. It offers great views of Philadelphia's skyline, and of the lighted boat show and fireworks planned on the Delaware River.
But coming to New Jersey through Camden is like entering a split-level through the mud room, and cleaning for the guests has been a chore.
Just over the Ben Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia, state and regional officials recently spent $45 million to condemn and level the unsightly buildings of businesses on Admiral Wilson Boulevard, including topless joints and by-the-hour hotels.
Camden has 209 miles of roads, but attention has focused on four routes through downtown to the waterfront. Crumbling buildings have been knocked down, rotting trees uprooted, flowers and shrubs planted, broken windows covered with fresh gray boards and light posts decked with banners. The road to the newly docked U.S.S. New Jersey is lined with shipping containers that hide industrial detritus. On the waterfront, mulch has been blown among fresh beds of flowers, and at the Children's Garden near the state aquarium, the newest creature is an elephant topiary named George, as in W.
"That first impression is important," said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, tonight's host. But it can also mislead.
As the V.I.P.'s gaze at Philadelphia, here's what will be festering in the city of 82,000 behind their backs: school dropout rates as high as 60 percent. Almost 40 percent of households earning less than $20,000. A tax base that yields only about $29 million for combined city and school expenses of $350 million. A mayor indicted on corruption charges, like two of his last four predecessors.
"It's a casualty," said the Rev. Michael Doyle, a priest in South Camden for 32 years, "and America is to blame for a Camden. They don't see it that way. It's like a drunk on a grate and people say, 'It's not my problem.' If you can't save a Camden in a powerful economy, then when will we be able to make it livable? When?"
There are glimmers of hope -- a few remaining corporations, the waterfront, some renovated housing -- but they are hard to spot amid weed-choked lots, abandoned homes and the addicted roaming like stray dogs.
GOVERNOR Whitman, who is waging a legislative battle to seize control of Camden, said she was shaken by the depth of its problems during a nighttime tour with state troopers in 1996. That trip recently produced a photo of the smiling governor frisking an innocent black man. Back here Thursday to award some grants, she said that after that tour, "all I could think of was: What would I have been like if this was my environment growing up?"
Shinnelle Queensbury, perhaps, could suggest an answer. At 14, she lives in the South Camden neighborhood the governor visited the other day. Despite a family history laced with drugs and prison, Shinnelle is a serious student at the Creative Arts High School, taking summer enrichment courses and singing and dancing in a local production of "Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know." Despite the pressures of the street, she could do a one-girl show of the same name for tonight's visitors.
"Wait until you get to my block," she said, leaving the commotion around the governor. She lives with her grandparents, and there is only one other house on her side of the street that is not boarded up. "A brick fell out of that house and almost hit me," she said of a crumbling building on the corner.
On her block, she said, "the police patrol, but the drug boys run." Her teachers are encouraging, but neighbors razz her because, she said, "I like to talk with proper English." Imagine coming home from school happy, she said, only to learn that "one of your relatives has done something wrong or someone was shot in front of your aunt's house."
Long ago, Camden adopted Walt Whitman's poetic line, "In a dream I saw a city invincible." That dream is long gone, but flashes of resilience remain. "I'm really trying," Shinnelle Queensbury said, crossing the deserted street on her way to sing and dance, "but there's so many things pulling me down."

HEADLINE: Social Work In the City: Rewards And Risks

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
It was 3 p.m. one recent day at Columbia University, and seven graduate students, who ranged in age from 25 to 58, sat in a circle in Room 308 of McVicor Hall, home to the university's School of Social Work.
The instructor, Judith Marks, read from the students' reports about their work with clients. But weeks of newspaper headlines, and the presence of a reporter, later provoked a discussion of social work and its rewards and perils. 
 Tiffany F. Goldberg, a 25-year-old from Madison, Wis., had been struck on the back of the head with a chunk of concrete by a man on a Manhattan street in a seemingly random attack. Ms. Goldberg, who plans to attend Columbia's social work school this fall, had expressed concern for her assailant. She speculated that he had had a troubled childhood.
The students, who were upset by the randomness of the attack, said they admired Ms. Goldberg's generosity of spirit. They said it was consistent with a social worker's outlook on violence -- to always try to understand its roots.
"Society is into blaming individuals," said Kristen Miller, 27, one student. "Violence is intergenerationally transmitted."
Ms. Miller, who grew up in Morristown, N.J., and works with mentally ill children in Newark, said she felt sad for Ms. Goldberg when when she heard about the attack. But she thought the incident might have been avoided if "society provided the resources people need," she said. Specifically, she advocated more funding for treatment of the mentally ill.
However awash New York City is in Wall Street bonuses and budget surpluses, venture capital and disposable income, it remains for some people one of the world's great social work laboratories -- full of poor, troubled people, children at risk and marriages coming apart. And its magnetic pull brings people here from all corners of the country.
Christina Kucera, who recently completed the social work graduate program at Hunter College and is from Columbia, Mo., said, "Moving to New York, I think I've compromised my safety, but I'm much more concerned for the safety of the people I've worked with.
"I chose to move to New York because it has one of the largest social service networks in the country," she said. "I also chose New York to practice because of the diversity of the people and the complexity of the sociopolitical climate. Under Giuliani, social services have been cut back. Nevertheless, I think even in these difficult times, New York City is an exciting place to study and practice social work."
Anne Condon, a 26-year-old student at Columbia's School of Social Work, said the attack on Ms. Goldberg had frightened her because it had been random. But Ms. Condon, who grew up in Pearl River, N.Y., said that she, like Ms. Goldberg, would probably look at the environment the assailant came from and the problems he faced had she been the victim. Social workers, she said, seek to find out why things happen.
And that includes the causes of violence, especially after incidents like the attack on Ms. Goldberg or the stabbing death in 1999 of Amy Watkins, a student at the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work who had come from Kansas. Ms. Watkins was slain near her apartment in Brooklyn. Her killer has never been caught.
Gary Parker, 32, who graduated from Hunter's School of Social Work in May, came to New York from Methuen, Mass., 10 years ago. He decided to study social work so he could help change society.
"I was struck by the continuing disparity of income -- how people were excluded from jobs, education, housing and opportunities in general," he said. "The system is working against the poor as far as pulling them out of their economic hardship."
Mr. Parker, who knew Ms. Watkins, helped set up a scholarship in her name at Hunter. Like Ms. Goldberg, she had the kind of idealism that motivates most people in the social work field, he said.
"Amy was a beautiful person with a vision of justice and social equity," he said. "A lot of people would think she was overly compassionate."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Committee Rebuffs Efforts To Pull More to the Left

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, July 29

 BODY:
Repeatedly brushing aside amendments from its embattled liberal wing, the Democratic Party's platform committee today adopted a party blueprint that hews closely to Vice President Al Gore's centrist views on trade, fiscal policy, national defense, crime and welfare.
The 48-page document approved today was a fitting successor to the platform created for Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992, which broke sharply from the party's liberal roots. Today, the 186-member committee, dominated by Gore supporters, again and again knocked down efforts to tug the party back toward the left. 
 Proposals supporting universal health care, a moratorium on the death penalty, punishments against corporations that pay low wages, tougher rules for international trade, and better health care for prisoners were withdrawn or overwhelmingly defeated.
Over the objections of a small band of liberals, the committee approved planks putting the party firmly behind a limited missile defense system, aggressive debt reduction, modest tax cuts and expanding global trade through the World Trade Organization.
The liberals did not go down quietly. Talking to reporters outside the committee room, members of a group calling itself the Progressive Caucus to the Democratic National Convention complained that their views had been ignored and that the Gore campaign had pressured committee members to vote against their planks.
"They talk about a big tent," said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Cleveland. "But this tent just got a bit smaller."
Tom Hayden, a state senator from Los Angeles who is also a Gore delegate, said the platform had failed to address the challenge of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who strongly opposes the World Trade Organization and who, polls show, has been drawing voters away from Mr. Gore in California.
Mr. Hayden said the center-straddling platform would turn off the party's liberal base, making it more difficult to find committed campaign foot-soldiers. As a result, he warned, Mr. Gore would have to rely on negative attacks against the Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney.
"It's very hard to lift the enthusiasm of tens of thousands of people to make phone calls," he said.
The Progressive Caucus did not have much support in the room today.
No major environmental groups were present to raise objections to the platform.
An observer for the United Auto Workers, which objects to Mr. Gore's trade policies and has not endorsed him, said the platform committee had addressed the union's concerns in private negotiations.
And an official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed Mr. Gore, said that despite its flaws, the platform was generally acceptable to organized labor, the single most important constituency in the Democratic coalition.
"We've succeeded in moving the party from free trade toward fair trade," said Gerald Shea, an adviser to John Sweeney, the president of the labor federation.
Despite the complaints from the liberals, party leaders portrayed the platform debate as more open than the Republicans' process. And they said that the fault lines within their party over trade and national defense are not as deep as those dividing the Republicans on abortion and education.
"There are sections of this platform that I am not wild about," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a co-chairman of the platform committee. "But the bottom line is, we know how much different and how much better this is than the Republican alternative."
Al From, chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, said, "Don't forget, we followed a lot of the policies the Progressive Caucus would like us to follow now in the 1970's and 80's, and we had the kind of stagnation that turned core Democrats away from us."
The platform goes to a full vote by the delegates on the second night of the Democratic convention next month. No amendments will be allowed from the floor, and it seems unlikely that liberals will be able to muster enough support to force a floor vote on a minority report.
One of the liveliest debates today was over a proposal to strike language endorsing development of a limited national missile defense system.
Liberals contended that the idea was unproven, costly and likely to ignite a new arms race. But Mr. Gore's supporters argued that remaining silent on missile defense would give the Republicans ammunition to attack Democrats as soft on defense. Mr. Bush supports a global missile defense system. The progressives' amendment was tabled.
On the contentious issue of trade, the platform says, "It's clear we live in a globalized world, and that there is no turning back." The platform obliquely endorses a concept known as fast track -- without using that phrase -- calling for broad presidential powers to negotiate trade compacts without Congressional approval.
To appease labor unions and environmental groups, the platform says workers rights, human rights and environmental protections should be negotiated in all trade agreements.
On crime, the platform endorses "tougher penalties -- including the death penalty -- for those that dare to terrorize the innocent." But it also calls for DNA testing and "effective" legal counsel for death row inmates.
A few members of the committee had proposed calling for a moratorium on capital punishment. But they withdrew the amendment for lack of support. Instead, the committee adopted this language: "In all death row cases, we encourage thorough post-conviction reviews."
The platform adopts debt reduction -- President Clinton's guiding economic principle -- as the heart of Mr. Gore's economic policies. And it calls for using the federal surplus to strengthen Medicare and Social Security.
In its longest section, on education, the platform supports using federal money to increase teachers' pay, reduce class sizes, rebuild crumbling schools and help families pay for college tuition. But it also calls for requiring teachers to pass periodic reviews making it easier to close down failing schools.
The platform, like Mr. Gore's campaign agenda, firmly endorses a woman's right to an abortion, strong gun regulations, a hate crimes law, sweeping campaign finance reform and an end to racial profiling.
On the environment, supporters of Mr. Gore proposed an amendment endorsing several of the vice president's campaign pledges: to restore the Everglades, restrict oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida and prohibit drilling or logging in the wildest areas of the national forests.
Committee members from Alaska and many of the Western states objected to the language, saying it would hurt local economies. But the measure passed by the narrowest vote of the day, 47 to 33.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
A Closer Look at the Planks

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Though some planks in the Republican platform remain firm, there are some notable additions and, in some cases, a softening of tone. Here are excerpts and notes about what is new and what has stayed the same. ROBIN TONER
 
On Abortion
The Supreme Court's recent decision, prohibiting States from banning partial-birth abortions -- a procedure denounced by a committee of the American Medical Association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide -- shocks the conscience of the nation. As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. This is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. ... 

On Immigration
Our country's ethnic diversity within a shared national culture is unique in all the world. ...
Another sign of our unity is the role of English as our common language. It has enabled people from every corner of the world to come together to build this nation. For newcomers, it has always been the fastest route to the mainstream of American life. English empowers. That is why fluency in English must be the goal of bilingual education programs. We support the recognition of English as the nation's common language. At the same time, mastery of other languages is important for America's competitiveness in the world market. We advocate foreign language training in our schools and the fostering of respect for other languages and cultures throughout our society.
 Throughout much of the last century, the twin tyrannies of Communism and Nazism inadvertently gave an enormous treasure to the United States of America, the genius and talent and industry of those who found freedom on our shores. Our country still attracts the best and brightest to invent here, create wealth here, improve the quality of life here. As a nation of immigrants, we welcome all new Americans who have entered lawfully and are prepared to follow our laws and provide for themselves and their families. In their search for a better life, they strengthen our economy, enrich our culture and defend the nation in war and in peace. To ensure fairness for those wishing to reside in this country and to meet the manpower needs of our expanding economy, a total overhaul of the immigration system is sorely needed. ...
 
On Education
It's long past time to debate what works in education. The verdict is in, and our Republican governors provided the key testimony: strong parental involvement, excellent teachers, safe and orderly classrooms, high academic standards and a commitment to teaching the basics -- from an early start in phonics to mastery of computer technology. ... Federal programs that fail to support these fundamental principles are out of date -- and under a Republican president, will be out of time. ...
We recognize that under the American constitutional system, education is a state, local and family responsibility, not a federal obligation. Since over 90 percent of public school funding is state and local, not federal, it is obvious that state and local governments must assume most of the responsibility to improve the schools, and the role of the federal government must be progressively limited as we return control to parents, teachers and local school boards. ...
 
On Abortion
Recognizing the recent Supreme Court decision, this puts the party firmly on the record against partial-birth abortions.
 
Beginning here, the text is verbatim from past platforms, reflecting Gov. George W. Bush's promise that he would leave the anti-abortion language intact.
 
Supporters of abortion rights say this provision is particularly galling, since there has been no serious push in Congress for a constitutional amendment in many years.
 
Abortion rights supporters consider this a judicial litmus test -- a promise to appoint judges who oppose abortion. Mr. Bush says he does not support a litmus test, but he did agree to preserving this platform plank.
 
On Immigration
The provision on English is slightly softer. Four years ago, the platform called forthe official recognition of English as the nation's common language.The draft from party leaders deleted that; but it was reinserted by delegates, with a slight change -- it dropped the word official.
 
Mr. Bush is trying hard to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrants, recognizing that the Republican Party has an anti-immigrant image among many voters. Over all, the passages on immigration are more welcoming and inclusive than in the platform from four years ago. There is no longer a provision that would have denied automatic citizenship to the children born to illegal immigrants.
 
On Education
This section is Mr. Bush's attempt to claim the education issue, of growing importance to voters, particularly suburban mothers who are expected to be critical this fall. He is running hard on his education record in Texas.
 
Four years ago, Republicans advocated the abolition of the Department of Education. That provision was dropped this year, reflecting the influence of Mr. Bush, but conservatives are still adamant about limiting the role of the federal government in education.

HEADLINE: Schumer Urges Power Plants Be Built

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Warning of a looming electrical power shortage in New York City and its suburbs, a report to be issued today by Senator Charles E. Schumer recommends large new investment in power plants, transmission lines and alternative energy sources.
The report, coming at time when unusually cool weather has dampened the traditional surge in the demand for power to run air-conditioners, concludes that other factors have caused electrical use to keep climbing over a six-year period. The factors include more computers and other high-tech equipment. 
 Using data from Consolidated Edison and Keyspan, the report says electrical use on a typical summer day has increased 20 percent in New York City and 23 percent on Long Island since 1995.
"We need to face the music," Mr. Schumer said. "If we ignore the looming, chronic energy shortage, we risk the economic well-being of the entire region."
The report by Mr. Schumer, an advocate of deregulating the electric power industry and of cleaner power plants, recommends that new plants be built in the New York region. It does not address the politically divisive question of where to build them, and he could not be reached yesterday for further comment.
Some city officials, including City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, and utility executives have repeatedly urged new power plant construction. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has charged that the utilities fail to buy enough backup power from other producers, as is allowed under industry deregulation. But the mayor has not said whether he favors new power plant construction in the region.
Mr. Schumer's report recommends other new investments in transmission lines that would better connect the New York utilities to sections of the country where electricity is more plentiful, and in fuel cells and other alternative energy sources. He also calls for financial incentives for businesses and homeowners to reduce use.
The analysis by Mr. Schumer's staff, which incorporates data from the National Weather Service, concludes that residents and businesses have increased the use of electricity for appliances other than furnaces and air-conditioners and that spikes in demand are now less closely associated with the weather.
It found, for example, that New York City residents used 11,231 megawatts of power on the day in June when the temperature reached 88 degrees. But city residents used only 10,551 megawatts on a summer day in 1995 when the temperature soared to 95 degrees, the report says.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK;
The East End's Mom-and-Pop Economy Gets A Makeover

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
NOT long after Joe Gurrera opened the first Long Island outpost of Citarella's, the Manhattan gourmet food shop, newspapers reported that Calvin Klein drove by in his Mercedes and had a traffic scrape. The Water Mill site was identified as Citarella's Plaza, dishing out a hefty serving of Hamptons-style A-list publicity for the new store.
The Hamptons buzz machine revving into gear? Or a simple bit of good luck for Citarella's? 
 "Really, I didn't know anything about it until I read it in the paper myself," Mr. Gurrera declared. He quickly changed the subject back to food and the new 7,000-square-foot store.
"Over 200 types of cheese in here," he announced. "Seven kinds of blue cheese alone. You want meat, just walk over here. Follow me. Now look at this meat selection. Do you see the marbling? You're looking at quality."
He led a visitor past shelf after shelf of private recipe sauces, marinades, soups and other upscale treats, toward a seafood display that stretched the length of the wall. Some 80 types of fish and shellfish, both raw and prepared, glistened on chipped ice. Eyeing the display were Sheldon and Joyce Pitkin, from Southampton and the North Shore Towers in Queens.
Until Citarella's opened in May, finding such takeout gourmet fare in the Hamptons was very difficult, Mrs. Pitkin said as she selected grilled pompano for that evening's dinner. Mr. Pitkin, who chooses rotisserie chicken when it's his turn to order, was already over in the baked goods section surveying desserts.
"These people have already become two of my best customers," Mr. Gurrera said.
Strolling around his store and greeting customers by name, Mr. Gurrera seemed the epitome of the local storekeeper with deep community roots. In fact he is new to the area. Usually he is in Manhattan attending to his other ventures: the Third Avenue store, the Chelsea commissary where food is prepared and shipped, the wholesale outlet in the Fulton Fish Market, a new restaurant taking shape near Radio City.
Why the Hamptons? Simple, he insisted: the landlord offered him a deal too good to turn down.
Competition? He dismissed the concept with a wave of the hand: "Tell me, who else out here is doing what I'm doing? Name them."
What Mr. Gurrera is doing in the broader sense is bringing Manhattan-style retail concepts to the East End, and he has plenty of company. This year the fashion designer Betsey Johnson and two upscale, up-Island women's fashion boutiques -- Georgina's and Jimmy's -- have opened storefronts in East Hampton.
The Hamptons already have national or up-Island names like London Jewelers, Coach, DKNY, Saks Fifth Avenue and Joan & David, and trendy merchants have been elbowing mom-and-pop storekeepers out of East End retail space since at least the 1970's.
But the pace of change is leaving many residents wondering where they can buy milk, eggs and the kind of underwear that does not sport lithe young models partying on the packaging.
The changes "reflect the way the Hamptons are becoming chic-er," said Marina Van, longtime executive director of the East Hampton Chamber of Commerce. "People are dressing up more. It isn't O.K. anymore to go everywhere in jeans and T-shirts. People are buying nice clothes to wear, and the stores in town reflect that."
At Georgina's Boutique, shoppers can spend $5,000 on an evening dress, said the owner, Christina Makowski. Many customers recognize the store from its flagship branch in Manhasset and a newer branch in Hewlett Harbor.
It isn't just the money-is-no-object fashion crowd. Mass merchandisers like Starbucks and Kmart have opened in Bridgehampton, where a new Barnes & Noble branch is rumored to be in the works.
Residents respond with mixed reactions and clear hierarchies of desirability. A new branch of a store that already exists in the area is better than an interloper with no previous local presence. A store owned by a resident trumps a store owned by outsiders. Converting an existing building is better -- far, far better -- than building new.
Most residents agree that the hulking superstores should stay west of Riverhead, but reasonably sized outlets are welcome. The disagreement is over what size is reasonable. Both A&P and King Kullen already operate supermarkets here, but encountered opposition when they announced plans to open larger stores. The struggle for community approval could stretch out for years.
It's a point of status among local residents to shop at local stores, or at least to proclaim they do. But second-home owners routinely make detours off the expressway to stock up on items that cost noticeably more east of Riverhead.
"When Starbucks opened in Bridgehampton, it was clear to me that we'll be seeing more of the national chains coming to the East End," said Marcia Rosen, a marketing consultant based in Westhampton Beach. "But that's not to say that the local retailers are going to roll over. To succeed as an independent merchant out here really requires you to understand what makes the Hamptons the Hamptons. People who shop here are buying more than just the product, they're buying atmosphere. And they're willing and able to pay for atmosphere."
Steven Gaines, who operates a Web site called ihamptons.com and is the author of a best-selling book about Hamptons status-seeking called "Philistines at the Hedgerow," feels a sense of loss each time a local merchant closes for the last time.
"I used to love to walk by a store called Pets Painted With Love, in East Hampton," he said. "People would bring their pets and the owner would paint their portraits. Today, that store is Ralph Lauren. The Ralph Lauren store is wonderful, but something unique is gone forever."
He continued, "Starbucks? That's an abomination. Enormous sign. Red velvet banquettes. Velvet? The Hamptons? Please!"
It's no surprise that mass merchandisers covet the East End. Every summer the population swells from 125,000 to 600,000, producing a median household income exceeding $85,000. But the very seasonality that entices savvy local merchants has in the past deterred the mass merchandisers.
That situation is changing.
"Many of the second-home owners are now here year-round," said Herbert Sherman, a professor of professional studies at Southampton College. "Technology enables professionals to live here and telecommute to Manhattan or elsewhere. Retirees are making their second home their retirement home. The year-round population is growing."
That includes laborers, many of them immigrants working in the construction and landscaping trades who enjoy increasing buying power. "For the first time, the Hamptons now has a real Mexican restaurant with Mexican customers," Professor Sherman said. "I don't mean Tex-Mex, I mean rice and beans."
Throwbacks to earlier, less glitzy times remain. On gritty Front Street in Greenport, The Arcade is a five-and-dime store that dates from the mid-19th century. During the week working-class residents come in to buy inexpensive clothing and household goods including fabrics and sewing supplies. On weekends tourists come in and gape as if the sundries and notions, the fixtures and displays were all a theme park display.
The survival of the store as a purveyor of necessary goods to working people is vital to the community, both economically and culturally, Mayor David Kapell said.
"This is a store that sells needles and thread, for goodness sake," the mayor said. "It's what Main Street America used to be. It sets us apart from the other East End communities, and frankly, that's exactly what we want to preserve."
It is exactly those other communities, and the wealth they represent, that appeals to a growing number of mass merchants. Despite such difficulties as seasonality and, increasingly, staffing, the East End as a market is increasingly in demand -- as much for marketing reasons as for profitability.
"The East End is increasingly filled with prestigious retailers," said Cindy Smith, president of the Retail Marketing Group, a division of EGC Media in Hicksville. "You have your permanent population, your second-home owners, and plus you get tremendous tourism. When people travel they see new products and often try them out. Back home, the products seem more familiar because of that exposure."
The changes have not left everyone pleased. Retailers, including Hildreth's -- purportedly the oldest department store in America, founded in 1842 -- have thrived by offering personalized style and a merchandise mix carefully selected for local preferences.
"My name is on the front of the building, it's painted on the trucks, it's printed on the bags," said Henry Hildreth, the fifth generation of his family to operate the store, on Main Street in Southampton. "If something is not right, I'm going to stand behind it, just as my father did."
Two stores away, Herrick Hardware has been in the Herrick family for four generations. Unlike the vast majority of Main Street hardware stores across the country, Herrick is not operating under the shadow of a Home Depot. Zoning practices, political consensus and community activism combine to make it unlikely that a megastore will open east of Riverhead anytime soon.
"There's no Home Depot down the block, but that isn't to say I have no competition," said Herrick Hardware's proprietor, Noel Hare, who married into the family business. "There are lumber yards and hardware stores in every village. Yet I draw customers from other villages, and I attribute that to service. That in the long run is what makes the difference between a mass merchant and an independent retailer."
Not every retailer shares his attitude. According to Mr. Gaines, paying outrageous prices seems to have become a competitive Hamptons sport, with an ancillary contest in which customers vie to be the most unpleasant. At one well-established upscale food shop, he said, a young clerk tried to dispatch a particularly disagreeable customer by pricing salad at $86 a pound.
Sounding incredulous, Mr. Gaines reported that the customer simply shrugged and said, "Fine, I'll take two pounds."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MONEY;
Perks for Biggest Donors, and Pleas for More Cash

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 29

 BODY:
The Republican convention opening here on Monday is really two conventions, one for the delegates in the hall and another for the party's biggest contributors, who will be treated to a panoply of perks, from yacht rides to skyboxes high above the convention floor.
With a record $137.4 million in large contributions already collected, the Republican Party is flush with soft money, the unrestricted party checks. But one of the central purposes of the gathering is to motivate the party's most generous supporters to raise and give still more. 
 The Republican Party is poised to collect tens of millions of dollars more in soft money from corporate interests after the convention. A core group of business donors -- oil, tobacco, guns, real estate and software -- now form the financial backbone of the modern Republican Party. r
The ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is generating even greater enthusiasm in the business world and corporate donors have helped put the Republican Party in the best financial shape it has ever enjoyed going into a general election.
To capitalize on the popularity of Mr. Bush, the second-term Texas governor, the party has created a new level of top givers -- the Regents, individuals and companies who have given the party at least $250,000 since January 1999. As of July 1, the Republican Party had more than 100 such donors, who will be rewarded at the convention with skybox seats, private dinners with party leaders, Champagne receptions and deluxe hotel accommodations (most of the Regents are staying at the Four Seasons). A few will be going on a fishing trip with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
In the past, political conventions have revolved around the drama of delegates selecting a presidential and vice-presidential nominee or fights over platform issues. With these issues largely decided before the convention, entertaining donors and pushing them to contribute more for the general election have become central parts of the proceedings.
During the four-day convention, television cameras will focus on the stage where Mr. Bush will accept his party's presidential nomination and other party figures will speak. But much of the convention's real business will take place off-camera in hotel suites, hospitality tents, restaurants and country clubs where donors will be rewarded for past generosity and asked to give again.
For the party's top underwriters, there will be an array of gold-plated events in Philadelphia, including cocktails with Gen. Colin L. Powell and an evening cruise on the Delaware River aboard the "Enterprise," the yacht owned by Richard M. DeVos, the Amway founder, who is a Bush supporter.
The evolution of two distinctly different conventions, one a televised coronation of the Republican ticket, the other a behind-the-scenes parade of big donor events, is a striking development, said historian Richard F. Fenno Jr. of the University of Rochester. "I'm not sure those two conventions even meet," Mr. Fenno said.
Mr. Bush has excited the corporate world more than any recent Republican presidential nominee, party leaders say. His running mate, Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary who until his selection was the chairman and chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, the world's largest oil field services company, also generates enthusiasm in corporate boardrooms.
"It excites the business community when they see people on the ticket who know what it takes to meet a payroll, fill out regulatory forms and pay taxes," said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Already, Mr. Bush's campaign has collected a record $90 million in federally restricted, individual donations of $1,000 or less; nearly one-quarter of that amount was raised by a national network of 212 business executives and wealthy individuals who call themselves the Pioneers.
Interviews with many of the top 25 soft money donors to the Republican National Committee reveal that they are united by their opposition to what they describe as intrusive government regulation, their desire for much lower taxes and their loathing of lawmaking by litigation.
Mr. Bush's proposal for a deep tax cut and his record of passing legislation to limit civil lawsuits in Texas are extremely appealing to the Republican Party's major underwriters. Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore's environmental views, among other issues, make some donors in the business community nervous.
According to David B. Magleby, director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, many of those who write six-figure checks to a political party do so for calculated business reasons. "This is money coming from interested companies and interested individuals who have agendas," Mr. Magleby said.
The stakes for these donors are large: government appointments, from the Supreme Court to the Environmental Protection Agency; antitrust enforcement; tax policy; land use decisions; oil drilling permits; regulatory decisions.
"Given the stakes they have, the investment they have made in this convention in Philadelphia is very modest, given the potential rate of return," Mr. Magleby added.
The Democrats, of course, will be giving royal treatment to their largest donors at their convention in Los Angeles, too, with labor unions, trial lawyers and Hollywood executives among the biggest underwriters of the Democratic ticket. But the Democratic Party is struggling to compete with Mr. Bush and the Republican Party in America's corporate suites.
Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party press secretary, emphasized that the party gets the bulk of its financial support from 570,000 small donors, including 140,000 people who contributed to the party for the first time this year.
"Our fund-raising success is a measure of the broad and deep support that our party, its principles and our nominee -- Gov. George W. Bush -- have across this great land," Mr. Pascoe said.
Three of the Republican National Committee's 10 largest donors, Philip Morris, the National Rifle Association and Microsoft, have contributed record sums to the Republican Party this year at a time when they face legal and legislative assaults led by the Democrats.
The Enron Corporation, the Republican National Committee's second-largest donor, strongly favors the party's economic policies, particularly its preference for free trade and a hands-off approach to the regulation of business, including enterprises as different as derivatives trading and Internet commerce.
The companies and the individuals who make up the list of top contributors to the Republican National Committee say they are delighted by Mr. Bush's rhetoric and his record.
Perhaps most important, Mr. Bush supports limits on damages in product liability lawsuits and on fees for trial lawyers and opposes federal anti-tobacco litigation. In Texas, he was also responsible for a $1.7 billion property tax break and environmental waivers for the oil and energy industries and has opposed most gun control legislation and government lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
"I am not sympathetic to lawsuits," Mr. Bush said at a campaign stop in Washington State in February. "Write that down. I worry about lawsuits on job creation. If you are looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to litigate."
This is music to the ears of most business executives.
A spokesman for Philip Morris, the Republican committee's largest single donor at $619,000 as of June 30, said that the company supports Republicans because they are "people who share similar views on issues that are important," including the regulation of tobacco. Another industry official said he expected that Mr. Bush would treat cigarette companies fairly, while President Clinton has used the industry as a whipping boy.
Few companies have as much at stake in November's election as Enron, the giant Houston energy and trading concern that, over the years, has been Governor Bush's largest corporate sponsor as well as a generous soft-money donor to the Republican Party. Enron and its chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, have been the top patrons of Mr. Bush's political career since his first campaign for Congress in 1978. Since January 1999, Enron and its executives have donated $615,550 to the Republican National Committee, the second-highest amount of any individual or corporation in that period.
Mr. Bush's tenure in Texas has been beneficial to Enron: he backed several of the company's most important legislative initiatives, including electric utility deregulation and limits on civil lawsuits.
Enron is even more explicit about why it wants to see Mr. Bush and other Republicans elected in November. A June 15 internal memorandum to executives soliciting contributions to the company's political action committee lays out the reasons: Enron faces numerous legal and regulatory challenges, the memorandum says, including taxation of electronic commerce, restructuring of the electric industry, international trade legislation, regulation of power plants and oil pipelines and a variety of environmental and tax issues.
The memorandum, which cites a $1 million fund-raising goal, details suggested "voluntary" contributions for Enron executives, from $500 a year for a low-level manager to $5,000 a year for a member of the executive committee.
A Democratic Enron employee who received the letter said some employees found the solicitation objectionable. The employee also said that some employees have begun to complain that too many corporate resources are being spent to support Mr. Bush's campaign.
"The wholehearted endorsement of Governor Bush, and the brazen use of the corporate machinery to ensure his election, seems distasteful," said the employee, who insisted on anonymity.
Mark A. Palmer, a vice president at Enron, said the political action committee is intended to improve Enron's name recognition. "We are one of the few companies in this industry that has advocated 100 percent for open markets and for taking away the monopoly protection that this industry has enjoyed for so long," Mr. Palmer said.
The National Rifle Association is the fifth-largest donor to the Republican committee, with contributions totaling $508,000 since the beginning of 1999. The group has given other Republican committees an additional $250,000, while donating nothing to the Democratic Party.
Mr. Bush opposed state and federal lawsuits against gun makers and supported the N.R.A.'s version of a bill to require background checks at gun shows. In the House, Mr. Cheney was a staunch ally of gun owners.
Sam Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly Jr., longtime friends of Mr. Bush, are among the most generous individual underwriters of the Republican Party. They have supported Mr. Bush not only with $500,000 in donations to the party but also with a $2.5 million television advertising campaign against his rival in the Republican primaries Senator John McCain of Arizona last winter.
Sam Wyly's businesses have fared well during Mr. Bush's tenure as Texas governor. Two years ago, one of the Wyly firms, Maverick Capital, won a state contract to manage $96 million of the University of Texas endowment fund.
Mr. Wyly said that he supported Republican economic policies, but that he hoped to make the party more broad-minded on social policy.
"I've got a long history working for minorities," Mr. Wyly said, "and I think our efforts make it easier for people of similar persuasions to feel more comfortable with the Republican Party."
Sam Fox, the chairman and chief executive officer of Harbour Group, a manufacturing company in Missouri, is the individual who has contributed the most to the Republican National Committee -- $575,000. But in an interview this week, he insisted that he gives a lot to the party because it shares his goal of "good government and no debts."
"When we part with $250,000 of after-tax money that is not deductible, we have to believe in the cause," Mr. Fox said, adding that he is motivated by a desire "to see honor and dignity restored to the White House."

 CORRECTION:
A chart on July 30 based on data from the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research organization, about the 10 largest donors to the Republican National Committee, with an article about large, unregulated donations to the Republican Party, included one company erroneously. Sam Wyly, who founded Maverick Capital, and his brother Charles J. Wyly Jr. together donated $505,000 to the Republicans in this campaign, but they no longer have any relation to Maverick Capital; people connected with the company were not among the party's 10 biggest donors.
The chart also described the company incorrectly. It is a money management firm, not a venture capital firm in the energy business.

 BODY:
Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, is post-everything. Born in 1958, he came along too late to be influenced by the civil rights struggle, the Vietnam War, the 60's, Watergate. The first presidential campaign Lazio volunteered to work on was Gerald Ford's in 1976. This is not just a matter of historical curiosity. Our political life is dominated by figures who came of age in the 60's and whose views bear the mark of these great events, just as the outlook of preceding generations was shaped by the cold war, World War II and the Depression. Think of Hillary Clinton, Lazio's opponent, who was born into a Midwestern Republican family and whose complacent sense of the order of things was upended by the liberal social gospel of her Methodist church. Even Gov. George Pataki, a genial Republican who is an ally of Lazio's -- and with whom Lazio is often compared -- became a Goldwater conservative in the 60's. Large, polarizing events force choices, and those choices create a certain crispness in point of view.
Rick Lazio is genuinely suspicious of crispness. "Rick is not just 50-50 on the issues," says Peter King, a fellow member of New York's Republican delegation in Congress. "Within those issues he tends to take the middle position." King, a conservative, takes a rather dim view of Lazio's difference-splitting politics; Lazio himself says that his moderate moderateness makes him an effective legislator as well as an appealing candidate. 
 Rick Lazio has popped up at an extremely nonideological moment in American history. There are no burning moral questions at the heart of our national politics this election season; there are, in fact, hardly any burning questions at all. Politics right now is not about marshaling forces for change, but about making the fine adjustments that will preserve things more or less as they are.
Lazio is running to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the monstre sacre of New York politics, a living summation of the epic battles of the last half-century. Lazio is betting that Moynihan -- his sense of himself and of politics itself -- is already the past.
On a hot Saturday morning last month, I watched Rick Lazio deliver the commencement address at West Islip High School, a big two-story tan brick structure that looks like every high school built in the 1950's. Lazio is West Islip, class of 1976 -- the school's most famous graduate. He spoke from one end of the football field, with the class seated in blue-and-white gowns before him, the band to his left and the parents and little brothers and sisters broiling away in the grandstands on either side.
The crowd was almost all white; about half the graduates were Italian-American. Lazio's manner was artlessly modest; he has an excited, high-pitched voice and a vowel-flattening Long Island accent. He talked about his happy boyhood going to the beach with his pals, and eating at the Long River Chinese Restaurant, and clamming in the Great South Bay. (Clamming in the bay has become Lazio shorthand both for "authentic New Yorker" and for "environmentally conscious.") He worked a few variations on the theme "dare to dream." He told the kids how much their parents loved them. And he closed with a dazzling array of aphorisms: "Treat others as you would like to be treated. . . . Honesty, loyalty and trust combine to make an honorable life. . . . Be a good child to your parents, and a good parent to your children. . . . Go through life with a crick in your neck from looking backward on the path where you came." The speech sounded as if it had been stitched on samplers.
I got to talking afterward with a silver-blond woman sitting behind me. Her name was Donna Brogan, and it turned out that she had been Lazio's classmate. The conversation went like this:
"Remember anything particularly noteworthy about him?"
"Not really. He was just a nice, average guy."
"Smart?"
"Well, maybe a little smarter than usual."
"Anything else come to mind?"
"Not really. He was just a nice, average guy from a nice, average town."
There's a clarion call for the voters of New York: vote for Rick Lazio, the candidate from "Pleasantville."
In fact, Lazio comes from the dead center of Long Island. To the west, closer to New York City, is Nassau County, famous for the big-city-style Republican machine that produced Alfonse D'Amato. To the east, at the tip of the island, lie potato fields and the soigne Hamptons. Western Suffolk County, which Lazio represents, is one long chain-store-and-strip-mall suburb, a safe, pleasant and provincial world stretched out along the Long Island Railroad and the Long Island Expressway. The citizens themselves are urban escapees, young families who moved out from Brooklyn and Queens in the 50's and 60's. When I asked Tony Appolaro, the county Republican chairman, to describe Islip, the township that includes West Islip, he said, "A lot of blue-collar, highly populated areas, very conservative, very strong family values, all Republicans."
Lazio grew up in a home-owning, small-business world. His father, Tony, owned a small auto-parts store, and the family -- Rick and three older sisters -- lived in a modest Cape Cod a few blocks from the water. Rick was just another kid biking around town, collecting baseball cards, shooting hoops in the driveway. He showed absolutely no signs of early promise. At West Islip High he was president of the prom committee, not the student government. He attended Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, but Glen Johnson, the adviser for his thesis in political science, only dimly recalls Lazio, and says that he was "a perfectly acceptable student." The late 70's was not known for student activism, and Lazio and his friends didn't spend much time engaged in passionate political disputes.
But politics, in a more quotidian sense, had always been part of Lazio's life. His father was a gregarious character, a joiner, and he was a figure in local Republican circles just as he was in the Kiwanis Club, a committeeman and a ubiquitous volunteer who got to drive the big shots around town when they came for fund-raisers. Sometimes Rick would keep him company when he delivered petitions, or go with him to party headquarters on election night. It wasn't conservative Republicanism or plutocratic Republicanism or Rockefeller Republicanism; it was, if anything, small-town, Fourth of July Republicanism. "I wouldn't say it was real doctrine at all," says Lazio. "It was more like rooting for a team."
Indeed, any search for doctrine is in vain. When I asked Lazio about the origin of his political views, he said, "I think the most dominant beliefs for me are the beliefs that were transferred to me growing up -- the sense of family, watching out for others, of work, of not expecting to get something for nothing but expecting that there will be a sense of responsibility that comes with opportunities." Hillary Clinton had pretty much the same values transferred to her, but values this consensual dictate nothing about political views -- and preclude nothing, which is perhaps their virtue in Lazio's mind. Lazio can not only work with anyone, he can also potentially side with anyone. He does not, he says emphatically, have a "rigid ideology."
After Vassar, Lazio enrolled at American University law school in Washington, and when he graduated he returned to West Islip. His father was confined to a wheelchair after a stroke, and Lazio felt that he was needed at home. He took a job as an assistant district attorney and dabbled in local politics on the side. In 1989, soon after he left the D.A.'s office, John Cochrane, the county Republican leader, asked Lazio to run for a seat in the County Legislature. Cochrane says that he saw in Lazio an attractive, well-spoken young man who had been "brought up with a strong party influence." Lazio agreed to run, and beat the Democratic incumbent. That same year, he married Patricia Moriarity, a nurse and the sister of a law school buddy.
He was a conscientious legislator, along with being handsome and genial, and it quickly became clear that he was destined for larger things. Here, for the first time, Lazio demonstrated an instinct for the main chance. "He was a cut above the typical county legislator," says Patrick Halpin, a Democrat who was serving as county executive when Lazio took office. "However, he was not one to embrace or advocate a cause. I frankly can't recall a situation where he used any of his political capital to advance a cause." Nor, in fact, can anyone. Appolaro, the county chairman, told me that Lazio "is recognized as someone who listens to his conscience," but when I asked for an example, he drew a blank. Lazio developed a reputation for holding onto his vote until the very last moment, which fellow Republicans interpret as painstaking consideration, and Democrats as fear of controversy.
Lazio's first and only truly extraordinary achievement in politics was his 1992 defeat of Representative Thomas Downey, a Democrat and 18-year incumbent whose seat appeared unassailable. Paul Aniboli, a close friend of Lazio's and at that time the political director of the Republican National Committee, says that he, Lazio and a few others had been struck by how poorly Downey had done against feeble opposition in 1990. Lazio declared in early 1992 and was promptly embraced by the party as an unusually worthy sacrificial lamb.
Then, in the spring of 1992, the House banking scandal hit, and Downey was found to have bounced 151 checks. ABC News showed Downey on a Jet Ski at an insurance-industry junket. A private poll showed that Lazio went from 25 points down to 25 points up once voters knew about these peccadilloes. Lazio made the scandal the issue, tearing into his immensely better-financed and better-connected opponent. Aniboli says of his friend: "He is an amiable fellow to shake his hand, but he is a street fighter. He was not afraid to run a difficult campaign."
And he beat Downey in what was otherwise a big year for the Democrats. Lazio's career was born, and with it an unassailable confidence in his political talents -- and in his political prospects.
Rick Lazio has reached the age when his high school classmates are putting on weight and losing hair. Not he; Lazio looks terrific in his white oxford shirts, and he has only the tiniest threads of gray in his thick black hair and an adorable little wave that curls over his forehead. He has finely modeled lips, and he might almost be pretty were it not for the smooshed nose, which looks like a token of combat (but isn't).
Lazio's air of perpetual youth is not only a matter of looks. He is one of those people who goes through life with the brightness knob turned all the way up; he has George W. Bush's high spirits, but without his sardonic smirk or ironic wit. Lazio has a way of booming "Good morning!" -- even to a pack of reporters waiting to jump down his throat -- that puts you in mind of a visitor to an elementary school class. During a farm breakfast he attended late last month, he was given some milk from one of those little cartons that kids get at school. "Where's Pat?" he cried, looking around for his wife. "This is great! She should try some of this."
Lazio has been a tremendous relief for Republican leaders who had grown increasingly fretful about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's rather sullen noncampaign campaign. Lazio is as loyal a party man as Giuliani was solitary and refractory. Last summer, when Lazio and Giuliani were both jockeying for position, Governor Pataki barely made a secret of his dislike for the mayor -- and his fondness for the youngster from Suffolk. Giuliani had not only given the governor innumerable causes for offense, but as Senator he would also plainly challenge Pataki for supremacy in the state party. Lazio would play by the rules. Pataki's aides, who at times talked about the mayor as if he were a dangerous lunatic, made all the right introductions for Lazio when he canvassed for support upstate. Pataki told Lazio, according to Lazio, that he would make "the best Republican candidate for Senate in a very, very long time."
But Lazio obediently dropped out of the race last summer when Pataki felt that he had to support Giuliani. When Lazio jumped back in after Giuliani, beset with prostate cancer and a girlfriend, announced two months ago that he would not run for the Senate, Pataki immediately made it clear that he was in Lazio's camp. Other potential challengers, including Peter King, never had a chance.
By the time Lazio entered the race, Hillary Clinton's campaign was finally looking like a well-oiled, if not terribly effective, machine. Lazio had to create a campaign staff, a campaign headquarters, a message and a schedule on the fly -- and all while continuing to show up in Congress. Week by week, the campaign has been getting less impromptu and more professional. Lazio surprised New York Republicans by passing over Kieran Mahoney and Arthur Finkelstein, who together had masterminded Pataki's gubernatorial victories and Al D'Amato's successful Senate runs, but who were also associated with D'Amato's loss to Charles Schumer in 1998. Instead, Lazio hired as his media adviser and chief strategist Mike Murphy, who engineered John McCain's presidential bid. Lazio already had $3.5 million in the bank when he jumped into the race, and he has since raised another $4.5 million. (Raising money to run against Hillary Clinton is not exactly uphill work.) And he very quickly pulled even with Clinton in the polls, in spite of the fact that few voters had any clear idea what he stood for or even who he was. A recent poll showed the candidates tied; 40 percent of voters viewed Clinton negatively, while only 13 percent viewed Lazio negatively.
Not being Hillary is a central element of Lazio's appeal. When I first spoke to him last summer, with Giuliani still very much in the picture, he was planning to offer himself as a kind of safe harbor for those who couldn't stand either the mayor or the first lady. "A pleasant person that is nonpolarizing," he said, "is very difficult to demonize."
Being undemonizable would seem like a negative virtue, especially when the predecessors in the office to which you aspire are such large and demonizable figures as Bobby Kennedy and Pat Moynihan and even Alfonse D'Amato; but Lazio's modest conception of himself is one of his strongest selling points. Under attack recently for allegedly turning a $16,000 profit by trading on inside information -- the S.E.C. is now conducting an investigation -- Lazio looked into the camera and declared, "All I can say is I'm an average, middle-class guy." He had, he said, talked to Pat, and she had said: "You know what? We're honest, decent people. I clean my own house."
When he travels these days with Pat and their two daughters, Molly, 8, and Kelsey, 7, which he does as often as possible, Lazio presents a family-values tableau that Clinton cannot match. The Lazios project the air of unfeigned happiness that the Clintons themselves never quite managed even in their best days.
And then there is Lazio's own emollient magic. In the middle of a campaign swing across central and northern New York earlier this month, the candidate stopped at the Bernardino senior citizens complex in Syracuse to talk about the need for federal support for seniors' housing. Jane O'Hea, a feisty 73-year-old, asked Lazio where he stood on abortion -- perhaps the only thing approaching a burning issue for some citizens -- and Lazio explained that he was pro-choice, though he opposed "partial birth" abortion. Following the speech, as well as a cameo appearance by Molly and Kelsey that elicited the most heartfelt sighs, O'Hea made her way over on her walker, looked Lazio straight in the eye and said: "I don't like your stand on pro-choice, O.K.? The fetus has a soul, and it's murder as far as I'm concerned. I get quite emotional about it."
Lazio bowed his head and murmured, "It's an emotional issue, and I absolutely understand that." O'Hea brightened, and as she turned her walker around, she chirped, "And you're very nice, and I'll probably vote for you anyway."
Lazio is happy to talk about less divisive issues like the economy and education. He favors a "balanced approach" of spending restraint and tax cuts, and he complains of the "Washington arrogance" of interfering with what should be local decisions and supports charter schools, vouchers and reforms in teacher training and licensing. But Lazio is probably slightly to the right of the average New York State voter on these issues, so he tends to soft-pedal his views and focus on the area where he has a leg up on Clinton: his legislative experience.
Lazio speaks often of the many things he has done for New Yorkers in his eight years as a legislator -- creating work incentives for the disabled, reforming public housing, making prescription-drug coverage available for seniors, expanding access to cancer care. In recent weeks he has taken to framing what is meant to be a rhetorical question: "Can you name me one single thing that Mrs. Clinton has done for New York?" Lazio is careful not to use the word "carpetbagger," but he never fails to observe that he has pumped gas in New York, paid taxes in New York and waited on checkout lines in New York. He seems almost to be daring Clinton to claim that she has gone clamming in South Bay.
Indeed, pleasant though he is, Lazio has not hesitated to run a "difficult" campaign against Clinton. He links her name to the word "mud" as often as possible. And he recently responded to an ancient and dubiously founded tale of an anti-Semitic remark by Clinton by saying, "I don't know who to believe." Lazio is plainly hoping that the election will ultimately be a referendum on Hillary Clinton. Given his low profile and her consistent high negatives in the polls, this is not an unreasonable expectation. After Syracuse, Lazio climbed back on the Mainstream Express, as his bus is subtly called, and headed off to Buffalo, where he traded his navy suit for a cranberry polo shirt and khakis and waded through a throng of jolly, beer-drinking white-collar workers engaged in a modest postwork bacchanal called Thursday on the Square. Very few of them had any idea who Lazio was, but it scarcely seemed to matter.
As he introduced himself to a knot of young women, one turned to the other and said, "He's got better legs." Lazio pressed onward and stuck out his hand and introduced himself to a middle-aged man holding a beer in a plastic cup. The man said, "You the one that's gonna beat Hillary?"
"I am," Lazio said, smiling.
"Then God bless you; I'd vote for you a hundred times if I could." And as the man wandered off, he muttered, "Kill the bitch."
Hillary Clinton spent the early part of the summer working to define Rick Lazio before he could define himself. Her goal was to sell the argument that Lazio is too conservative for swing voters, that he is an amiable character who takes his marching orders from a right-wing Republican leadership in the House. This argument appears to have made absolutely no headway so far, though it turns out to contain a fair amount of truth.
Lazio arrived in Congress in 1993, before there was a Republican majority in the House. He quickly came to be identified with the group of moderate Republicans from the Northeast who found a lot to like in President Clinton's New Democratic agenda. He was one of only 40 Republicans who voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993, and the following year he voted with the president 72 percent of the time, which placed him third in that category among House Republicans. Congressional Quarterly's concise description of Lazio was, "He is a confirmed moderate who expects to wind up among the Democrats' most consistent allies."
Lazio's world was transformed by the election of 1994, which vaulted the Republicans to majority status in both houses. Now the Republicans were dominating the legislative process, and all of the moderates began to vote with the party more often than they had before. In 1995 Lazio voted with the president only 34 percent of the time, which represents the largest swing of any of the moderates. I asked Lazio if he had come to see the merits of the "opportunity society" conservatism that Jack Kemp, Newt Gingrich and others were championing at the time -- a dynamic species of Republicanism he had never encountered in Suffolk County. Lazio probably regarded this as a trick question. "I don't think so," he said carefully. He added that he eschews "harsh partisanship" and judges each bill on its merits.
An alternative view is that Lazio recognized that he could advance within the new leadership by being the kind of moderate whom conservatives could work with. He had already made a name for himself in G.O.P. circles merely by beating Tom Downey; and then he had come to Newt Gingrich's attention when he went toe to toe with Speaker Tom Foley on provisions of the crime bill, which the Democrats were dearly trying to pass in 1994. Lazio was eager for advancement; but unlike most ambitious people, he had the kind of anodyne personality that muted conflict. He was an insider and a team player. Lazio says that his own natural tendency is "to build communication among people with diverse views and to try to get people to reason together." One person who has worked closely with Lazio says more pointedly, "He's not about to irritate people with a gratuitous press conference or even an off-the-record comment about another member." Lazio was a bridge waiting to be used.
Good things began happening to him as soon as the new leadership took over. Tom DeLay, the new whip, made Lazio a deputy whip responsible for counting heads in the moderate group. As a freshman, Lazio was given a seat on the prestigious Banking Committee, and in 1995 he became chairman of the Housing Subcommittee; in 1997, Speaker Gingrich granted Lazio's request to keep his position while he also joined the Commerce Committee, despite party rules that limit members to one of those assignments. And the following year, after he rallied to the side of the embattled majority leader, Dick Armey, a figure whom many moderates had come to view with as much alarm as they did Gingrich, Armey made Lazio a deputy majority leader, thus making him the one avowed moderate in the inner circle of leadership.
The Northeastern moderates, known as "the Lunch Bunch," had a representative in leadership meetings; Lazio was not only the first of these ambassadors, he was also asked to remain after his term had ended. The moderates say that Lazio's gift for getting along with absolutely everyone, unto the veriest bomb-thrower, served their cause well. "He has a directness that doesn't carry an overlay of intensity," says Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. "But he acts with intensity."
Sherwood Boehlert of New York says that, despite misgivings, he voted for Armey to remain as majority leader in part because Lazio assured him that "our voice would be heard in the majority leader's office." And Lazio, he says, was as good as his word. Many of the moderates felt that they had to pass minimum-wage legislation in 1996, but Armey had said that he would resist an increase "with every fiber of my being." Ed Gillespie, Armey's former press secretary, says that Lazio "explained to Armey that when you represent a district with heavy union membership, minimum wage is a key issue, and he explained how you could do it in a way that the more conservative members could live with." Lazio then helped put together a compromise that paired a wage increase with a tax credit for the small businesses that would have to bear much of the cost for the increase. Gillespie says that "Armey is very fond of Lazio and very loyal to him."
Lazio has served in Congress during a time of almost unprecedented turbulence inside the Republican Party. The party tore itself apart over the consequences of the 1995 government shutdown and the impeachment of President Clinton; Gingrich was ultimately deposed, and Armey came close. The moderates and the leadership have been at war, and yet Lazio has never lost his bona fides with either side. This is a sign either of extraordinary political deftness or of an unwillingness to stand up and be counted. Even Lazio's supporters say that he rarely engages in debate, and Peter King, the combative Nassau County Republican, observes: "Rick's natural instinct is to not create tension or to not exacerbate tension. On the one hand, you could say that he's a conciliator. On the other side, you could say that he shies away from confrontation."
Indeed, when I asked Christopher Shays, a moderate from Connecticut and a big Lazio booster, to tell me about a time Lazio had put himself on the line, he was just as stumped as Tony Appolaro had been. "I'll get back to you," he said. But he didn't.
Like almost all Republicans, Lazio voted for most of the articles in Gingrich's Contract With America (8 out of 10) and voted for the G.O.P. budget bills that ultimately led to the government shutdown. But he did not join the increasingly noisy revolt against the leadership after the fiasco of the 1996 election. Both Peter King and Michael Forbes, who represents the eastern tip of Long Island, publicly criticized Gingrich and were thoroughly marginalized as a consequence, Forbes so much so that he ultimately switched to the Democratic Party. Lazio supported Gingrich to the end, enhancing his influence and preserving his effectiveness.
Forbes now speaks very bitterly about Lazio. "Rick has been on a singular track to advance himself," he says. "We're all ambitious, but there's a certain code you're trying to follow. The guy does have this almost unethical approach to things."
One cannot, of course, easily draw the line between a prudent circumspection and unprincipled opportunism. On the impeachment issue, for example, Lazio charted his usual tortuous course. For many months he took the position, favored by many Democrats and some Republicans, that the president deserved censure rather than impeachment. He repeated this view to many constituents in Suffolk and to the editorial board of Newsday, the Long Island daily. The White House had him down as a definite censure vote, though he remained officially undecided.
And then, a few days before the vote, when DeLay had begun ratcheting up the pressure on the undecided, Lazio called a news conference to announce that he would vote for two of the four impeachment counts, thus allowing him to be on both sides of the most contentious issue of his political career. Shays, who voted against impeachment, says that Lazio "agonized over what was the right vote, not the political vote." On the other hand, some Lazio supporters were disgusted; a Suffolk businesswoman told me that she had taken the extreme step of volunteering for Hillary Clinton's campaign. (She asked that her name not be printed to avoid repercussions with her employer.)
The central questions about Lazio's Congressional career are these: What price has he paid for his privileged position with the House leadership? Has his ambition led him, as Michael Forbes argues, to compromise his principles? Certainly Lazio's voting record has remained generally moderate and includes many votes against leadership. He voted for the Brady law, which mandated a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases; he is generally considered a friend to the environmental movement; he has voted for full financing for the National Endowment for the Arts (though he has also voted at other times to sharply cut arts financing); he favors campaign-finance reform; he opposes ending affirmative action in higher education.
But Lazio has also voted for deep cuts in social programs, to eliminate the Department of Education, for a ban on homosexuals in the military. Many of his fellow moderates cast the same votes; what is intriguing about Lazio's record is a pattern of voting with the leadership and against virtually the entire body of moderates, especially on the symbolic and social issues that most of the moderates find embarrassing, but that conservatives like Armey and DeLay take so seriously.
A striking example, which his opponent has already begun to harp on, is abortion. Lazio considers himself in favor of abortion rights, as he told Jane O'Hea. At the same time, he regularly votes for restrictions on access to abortion and opposes the use of Medicaid to pay for abortions. This is not an uncommon position, but Lazio has also voted for anti-abortion measures that virtually all pro-abortion-rights legislators in both parties opposed. In 1999, for example, he voted in favor of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, a personal favorite of Dick Armey's, which would have made it a separate offense harm or kill a child in utero, even if the perpetrator had no idea that the women in question was pregnant. If the fetus -- in any stage of development" -- died, the accused would be charged with murder, which is to say that the unborn child's life status would be equal to the mother's even if it was only moments after conception.
It may be possible to reconcile a vote for such a bill while remaining in favor of abortion rights, but it's not easy to imagine how, so I recently asked Lazio, as we were sitting in the waiting room at a private airfield in Buffalo, to explain to me his general views on abortion. It's not in Lazio's nature to have general views on something, and the subject plainly made him uncomfortable; as he spoke he kept trailing off. "I think what's really important about the issue is to try to come at it with a sense of respect for people who have passionate views on both sides," he said. "I don't make either camp happy all the time, I don't make either camp unhappy all the time, just because I'm looking at this issue and trying to find the most reasonable outcome for me."
And what about the Unborn Victims of Violence Act?
"I don't think that's what it said at all," Lazio said, when I explained the language of the bill. In a later discussion I read him the exact language, and Lazio said that "many people who are pro-choice support the idea that there is status to the fetus." He also pointed out that the legislation did not criminalize abortion itself.
Julie Piscitelli, spokeswoman for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, argues that Lazio is "doing the minimum so that he can say to the sizable pro-choice majority in New York, 'Hey, I'm in favor of choice,' but then he's not really being there when he's needed, not really being pro-choice." Michael Forbes, who is himself unabashedly anti-abortion, says, "Rick Lazio is no pro-life person; that's just Rick Lazio in pursuit of the Conservative Party line." Or perhaps, since Lazio could have satisfied the Conservatives simply by voting against "partial birth" abortion, it was Lazio currying favor with Armey and his army.
Lazio's time in Congress is littered with such votes. In 1998, for example, he was virtually the only moderate who voted for the so-called Religious Liberty Amendment, a Constitutional amendment that stated, "The people's right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be infringed." The amendment would have overturned half a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence and enshrined a wholly new standard of church-state relations in the Constitution.
Lazio also startled Republican supporters of a patients' bill of rights earlier this year when he voted against a bipartisan bill and for two other versions that leadership had permitted to be offered as alternatives. The insurance industry violently opposed giving patients the right to sue, and the alternative bills offered patients a far more circumscribed access to the courts. Lazio says that the bipartisan bill would have led to "unlimited lawsuits," which in turn would have caused employers to limit costs by dropping people from the rolls. But 68 Republicans voted for the measure, including many out-and-out conservatives, as well as all of the legislators who had practiced medicine. The bill passed easily (though a Senate version remains stalled). Lazio's vote was seen as an act of loyalty to the leadership.
Lazio's own specialty in the House has been housing, an unrewarding subject that very few lawmakers, and scarcely any Republicans, even try to score points on. Lazio is considered a standout even by people who can barely bring themselves to praise Republicans. Irene Baldwin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, says that Lazio has stood up to Republican attempts to slash the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to weaken the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which prohibits redlining by banks. Other housing advocates praise Lazio for his role in financing for the homeless, as well as in providing housing for senior citizens and the disabled. The housing issue has generally allowed Lazio to show the pragmatic, mildly reformist species of Republicanism with which he arrived in Washington.
Lazio's reputation as both a moderate and a legislative craftsman rest on a massive public-housing reform bill that passed in 1998, and that achieved the extraordinary distinction of being embraced equally by the White House and the Republican House leadership. But Lazio's role in passing the legislation does not entirely bear out the claims made on his behalf.
In 1996, Republicans introduced bills in the House and Senate to reform public housing. Both bills addressed the central problem of public housing by allowing housing authorities to reduce the high concentration of the very poor, by holding failing authorities to specified standards and by consolidating an array of programs into a few block grants. The Senate bill, which was broadly similar to a reform measure the Democrats had introduced the previous term, was unanimously approved by committee.
Lazio's House bill, on the other hand, provoked ferocious partisan debate. It would have deregulated rents, placing housing units out of reach of many poor tenants. In addition, Lazio seemed to take the welfare reform legislation that had just passed as his model, for the House bill also would have required tenants to adopt a "personal improvement program" and allowed authorities to evict tenants who failed to satisfy the terms of a new "community work requirement."
Lazio has said that his favorite New York senator from the past is Robert Wagner, the great New Deal liberal, father of public housing and author of the 1937 act that created the federally financed public housing system. But in a later version of his housing bill, Lazio proposed repealing the 1937 act. Lazio says that since Wagner "couldn't in his wildest dreams have imagined the economic and social problems" that have come with public housing, he'd like to think that Wagner would have supported repeal.
And yet both Republican and Democratic aides involved with the legislation say that repeal was wholly unnecessary and could have served no purpose save the symbolic -- to take a scalp from the New Deal liberalism that Lazio professes to respect but that the Sun Belt conservatives who ran the Republican Party despised. Indeed, Lazio's bill seemed written as a model for the radical restructuring of the relationship between the government and the poor that the Contract With America had prescribed. It was the Senate legislation that was pragmatic; Lazio's could almost be called rigidly ideological. As one aide says: "There were five parties to the legislation -- the Republicans and Democrats in the House, the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the Administration. Four parties were in broad agreement throughout the process. The outlyer was Lazio." Caught between his pragmatic bridge-building temperament and his wish to shine before the House leadership, Lazio seems to have chosen the latter.
The legislation kept stalling because Lazio refused to compromise with Senate Republicans. Throughout the winter of 1997 and the following spring, Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who led the Joint Economic Committee, held a series of meetings with Lazio. Normally such meetings are conducted at the staff level. "This was unprecedented," says a Republican aide; "I've never seen anything like it." Both Mack and Alfonse D'Amato, who also sat on the committee and took a keen interest in housing issues, were growing increasingly frustrated with Lazio's intransigence and his insistence on symbolic issues. D'Amato was so disgusted that he stopped talking to Lazio altogether. (The relationship has remained very strained.)
In the end, Lazio gave way on one pet issue after another. The features that distinguished Lazio's bill from the Senate bill, and from the old Democratic legislation, largely evaporated, though a few elements remained, including a requirement that tenants not covered by welfare reform -- which is to say, very few of them -- be required to work eight hours a months. It was generally agreed that Lazio had delayed the bill for a year, to almost no ultimate purpose.
Still, the bill that finally emerged from this agonizing and dilatory process was widely welcomed. The administration took credit for the bill, and so did Lazio. Indeed, Lazio held a news conference that revealed how very high the stakes had been for the Republican leadership. Standing with Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, Lazio declared, "Who says the Republicans don't have an urban policy?"Rick Lazio's distinguishing feature may well be audacity. He's not audacious in the way of, say, Peter King, who openly criticizes his own party and ensures himself thereby an almost unlimited supply of press attention. Lazio is not, God knows, gadfly material. He is, rather, audacious in a way that is perfectly in keeping with his genial, unobtrusive nature, his modest gifts and his single-minded focus on the goal before him. Though his temperament in many ways resembles that of George W. Bush, it is well to keep in mind that Lazio's father supplied him with far fewer advantages in life than did Bush's. Lazio has had to succeed on his own, and because his native talents are scarcely outsize, it is his ambition that has seen him through. Lazio has always been something of an upstart; it took an upstart's moxie to run against Tom Downey, to slug it out with Speaker Foley, to hold up the legislative process while he quarreled with the upper house. And if Lazio weren't audacious, he wouldn't be running right now.
Lazio has been thinking about this race since November 1998, when Chuck Schumer toppled Alfonse D'Amato. "We talked about it the night Al D'Amato lost," says one of Lazio's advisers. "In fact, it was probably within minutes of the polls closing." D'Amato would no longer be sucking up Republican money and would be far less capable of doing him harm. Of course, New York's other incumbent at the time was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had traditionally run up enormous electoral margins and was widely considered impervious to challenge -- as Tom Downey had once been. "Nobody in his right mind would have run against Moynihan," this adviser says, "but Rick wanted to do it." And when Moynihan dropped out, Lazio was fully prepared to challenge Giuliani in a primary until Pataki called him -- the day before he was to announce his candidacy -- to say that he would be publicly supporting the mayor.
And Lazio was ready to run even though he knew that a loss would bring to an end the Congressional career he has cultivated with such care. I asked Lazio if his upset victory over Downey had made him feel that he could beat anyone. He demurred, as he does at all suggestions that hint at grandiosity, but he said, "One thing that race left me with is the sense that you can't be too intimidated by poll numbers."
Lazio is obviously not intimidated, though it's also true that he's playing in a much bigger and more public arena than he ever has before. He hasn't had a seriously contested race since 1992. One of Lazio's great problems will be convincing voters that he is grown-up enough to be a senator: New Yorkers do not want to feel that they're replacing Pat Moynihan with Beaver Cleaver. And Lazio cannot afford to dissipate his family-values advantage, which might well happen should the S.E.C. investigation of his trading patterns turn up anything untoward.
Indeed, Lazio may succeed in parrying Hillary Clinton's ideological thrusts and still be left with questions about his character. This seems odd, since character would appear to be precisely what has taken Lazio so far. But that's not quite right; Lazio's great gift -- and George W.'s, too -- is not character but personality. Lazio, like Bush, is an ingratiating fellow, modest and friendly, universally welcoming. He seems genuinely to live inside his sugary aphorisms. But voters tend to reserve the word "character" to describe how a candidate behaves at moments of difficulty. It's not enough, and perhaps not even necessary, for the people we elect to be good children to their parents and good parents to their children. They have to make hard choices; and Lazio, the man who admires Dick Armey and Robert Wagner, may still have something to prove in that regard.
Or perhaps he doesn't. If voters no longer feel that they're entrusting large choices to politicians -- and perhaps they don't -- then character may well be a thing of the past, too.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 7-30-00;
School's Out For Never

BYLINE: By Margaret Talbot; Margaret Talbot, a contributing writer for the magazine, is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.

 BODY:
In the late 70's, when I was a high school student, you went to summer school if you (a) had failed a class or (b) had absolutely nothing better to do. At my high school, (b) meant a choice of health and hygiene, taught by the football coach; driver's ed, taught by a short-tempered Algerian man with an uncertain command of English ("Fascinate your seat belts!"); introductory Spanish, taught by a blowsy recent divorcee who openly favored the boys; typing, taught by a woman with an undue interest in the paranormal; or "sociology," taught by a Weird Al Yankovic look-alike who wrote "Stay in touch -- all over my body!" in the girls' yearbooks. No one under the age of 15 even went to summer school -- they were off at day camp making lanyards or singing "There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea" or hanging upside down on the playground monkey bars or chasing the ice cream truck or something.
Summer school is different today, though: more rigorous, socially lustrous and, at the same time, more inclusive. Yes, there is lots of remediation, especially in urban areas like New York, where something like 60 percent of the city's students are supposed to be in class this summer. (Fifty percent of them are truant.) But if more students who would otherwise be held back a grade are now taking summer courses, so, too, are more driven, collegebound types whose parents hope for higher test scores and like the idea of structured, year-round learning. So are younger kids. This summer, school attendance is up all over the country. 
 Certainly, trying to make sure that kids have acquired math and reading skills before they're bumped to the next grade is all to the good. Certainly, there are many worse places to be -- starting with in front of the TV and ending with, oh, jail -- than school in the summer. And as summer-session boosters never tire of saying, the whole idea of a June-to-September break is arbitrary anyway: who says you can't go to school year-round now that our few remaining farmers no longer need their children's help in July and August?
Still, you have to wonder whether the new emphasis on spending more time in school -- the push for five-year high schools, the abandonment of recess and the prospect of year-round schooling are the other faces of this movement -- isn't partly an effort to substitute quantity for quality. Sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet at a lousy restaurant.
You have to wonder too whether all the anxiety about lost skills and summer slumps -- Learning Takes No Vacation: How Parents Can Help Kids Overcome What Educators Call the Summer Slide" warns a headline in a recent parenting magazine -- isn't a little overwrought, and when it comes to middle-class families, a little misplaced. (A 1996 study showed the loss of reading skills over the summer months varied with socioeconomic status; children of poor families lost the most while those of middle-class families held steady or improved.) Perhaps affluent older parents imagine their children's brains are like theirs, finite spaces out of which 70's song lyrics must be moved to make room for new Web browsing skills, say, or George W. Bush's campaign promises. I hear my husband and me telling our 4-year-old what a good memory he has, and hear not just our positive reinforcement, but slightly jealous admiration. If we took the summer off, sure, we would forget a lot. But we are not 4, or 8, or 14.
Sometimes I think that what we are constructing, with all our talk about enrichment opportunities and skills maintenance and neural pathways, is an elaborate defense of what working parents must, after all, do, which is find someplace to put our kids while we are at work. Painstakingly, and in the most sophisticated terms, we translate necessity into virtue. What a relief to imagine our kids soaking up intellectual benefits that mere time with their parents could never provide! Except that sometimes when I look around my neighborhood this summer and try to find a playmate for my 4-year-old and realize that nearly all the probable candidates are in science camp or summer school, I think maybe we've gone a little far. When Judith Johnson, a former official at the Department of Education, notes in a recent radio interview that 11-year-olds may have to forfeit summer breaks because they will someday have to "compete" in the "international workplace" and that "all of the children around the world are seeing summer as another opportunity to learn," I wonder if we are being a bit too instrumental about our summers. It's true that summer vacation is a mere artifact of the days when farming played a bigger role in our economy, but by now it's a precious artifact, with an accretion of sweet associations and a sense of possibility all its own.
None of my favorite childhood memories of summer are about summer school. They're about the summer when my father was on the road and my mom discovered her own version of the 60's, put on her summer shifts and kicked off her shoes and walked for miles with my sister and me through unfamiliar residential neighborhoods, into the navy blue twilight. Or the summer my brothers taught me to body surf. Or the August afternoons when my cousins and I played endless games of Marco Polo in the backyard pool. I have no idea why any of this should stand out in my mind. They were uneventful summers, and I'm sure did nothing to raise my test scores. I suppose it's because some of those people are dead now, and some I hardly see, and the memory of their attentions is precious. I suppose it's because those times were so entirely without aim, without strategy, so unpractical in every way.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
AOL's rivals want to see its instant messaging system open up before a merger makes the company any bigger.

BYLINE: By Laurie J. Flynn 

 BODY:
TO hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case for opening up its instant messaging service -- or I.M., as it is known in the trenches -- is a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of autocratic rule.
"Mr. Case, on behalf of the I.M. industry and users everywhere, tear down this wall!" Ross Bagully, chief executive of an America Online rival, Tribal Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve Case. "Users of I.M., like users of e-mail and the telephone," Mr. Bagully said, "deserve the right to free and open communication." 
 Outside the F.C.C. building a handful of protesters marched with signs that read, "Free I.M.!"
The "wall" that Mr. Bagully referred to is the partition that keeps America Online's instant messaging service a closed system -- one that effectively prevents users of other companies' instant messaging services from exchanging messages with users of AOL's service. Instant messaging enables people to send messages over the Internet that pop up on a recipient's screen almost instantly, allowing people to communicate in "real time."
In an unusual twist, the Microsoft Corporation is among a dozen or so smaller players in the I.M. market that decry what they consider to be AOL's market-dominating behavior in instant messaging, and they are demanding that it step up efforts to make its system interact with theirs. Among the other companies that share the 10 percent of the I.M. market not occupied by AOL are Yahoo, Odigo, iCast and Tribal Voice.
It was the outcry by competitors that landed instant messaging on the agenda of the F.C.C.'s hearing, along with other issues -- most notably the question of equal access to Time-Warner's giant cable network -- as the commission reviews the pending merger of AOL and Time Warner. As far as instant messaging is concerned, competitors contend that AOL's closed network stifles innovation and stymies growth in their industry.
With nearly 180 million registered users so far, I.M. is particularly popular with teenagers and families. But analysts predict that within a few years business people will account for nearly half of all I.M. users.
It is important to note that the debate is not about whether the various instant messaging systems will ever interoperate. Instead, the questions seem to be when and how. Even AOL does not dispute the need for an interconnection standard. But like most market leaders, the company would prefer to control the standard.
So the debate comes down to which side you believe. AOL contends that the development and testing of an instant messaging standard will take over a year. Its critics accuse the company of stalling in order to better solidify its market position.
At last week's F.C.C. hearing, Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services, said it would take a year for the industry to hammer out interoperability on a technical level, and even longer to complete the necessary testing for quality assurance. The company has continually insisted it needs time to ensure the privacy and security of its customers, particularly against spammers -- people or advertisers that blast unsolicited messages to hundreds or thousands of recipients.
Mr. Schuler compared the development of I.M. interoperability to the interconnection of e-mail networks, which the Internet industry did not achieve until about a dozen years ago. "The problem was that no one envisioned spam -- it didn't exist yet," Mr. Schuler said. "Had people understood what spam was they would have developed protocols in a different way. Unfortunately, the Pandora's box is opened now and can't be shut on e-mail interoperability." Mr. Schuler said AOL's competitors in instant messaging did not understand -- or have sufficient sympathy for -- the scope of the spam problem and how it might impact instant messaging. "Nobody else has 23 million people paying them to provide an environment that's monitored," he said.
In the meantime, the company said, it has already "opened" its network through royalty-free licensing agreements that allow Internet service providers and Web companies to use AOL Instant Messenger technology to create their own messaging software.
But AOL's competitors see the spamming and security argument as a smoke screen. "They've been saying that the last few months, but they've never backed it up with facts," said Avner Ronen, chairman of Odigo, which is based in New York.
Last month, when AOL submitted its proposal for an I.M. specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the industry committee whose job it is to create a technical standard, competitors criticized its plan as unacceptably vague -- and a further sign of foot dragging.
A year can seem an eternity on the Internet. So last week, a few days before the F.C.C. hearing, I.M. companies formed a new group to hasten the arrival of a standard, even if only a temporary one. The group, which calls itself IMUnified and is led by Microsoft, plans to release a temporary specification next month that would permit I.M. systems to talk to one another while a long-term solution is developed.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ronen said, "We hope AOL will come to its senses and cooperate."
The I.M. dispute has been fraught with nastiness from the outset. Starting last year, Microsoft and other AOL rivals began using technical loopholes to interact with AOL's I.M. users. Each time, AOL technicians have quickly patched the holes. Odigo, a small I.M. provider with about a million users, says that on 17 recent occasions it found a way to connect its customers to AOL's, and that each time AOL blocked it.
AOL considers these efforts "attacks" on its system and vows to defend itself against security breaches; its competitors contend their I.M. customers deserve to be able to freely exchange instant messages with users of other services.
In the end, the AOL-Time Warner merger probably does not hinge on resolution of the instant messaging dispute. Certainly of greater concern to the F.C.C. commissioners last week seemed to be whether the merged company would make good on its promise to give all Internet content providers open access to its cable systems.
But AOL's critics fear that open I.M. access will arrive even more slowly if it does not happen before the world's largest Internet service provider becomes part of the nation's largest Internet and media company.
"We know from history," Mr. Bagully said, "that those who unfairly exploit a market dominance don't get nicer as they get bigger."

An annual survey of agency-client relations shows that tensions have eased in many areas.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
DEALINGS between agencies and advertisers are improving after two years of strained relations, according to an annual survey. But difficulties remain in some important areas.
The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies and client companies to evaluate their working relationships, show that tensions have eased, thanks to efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides. "We're seeing a lot of steps in the right direction," said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the 2000 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations. 
 Ms. Salz, who has sponsored the survey annually since 1986, said she was most pleased by this finding: When agency executives were asked for what percentage of their clients were they able to do their "best advertising," the mean percentage was 65.4 -- the highest figure ever in that category. "We hypothesize that this is related to a renewed appreciation for advertising" among marketers, Ms. Salz said, generated by the recent spate of extensive campaigns for dot-coms, which "allowed agencies to feel they were doing better, more creative work."
"Even though there are a lot of opinions that such advertising was not as strong as it should have been in building brands rather than just name awareness," she added, "for better or worse dot-com advertising has created an increased focus on advertising" and "how it must be used to work most effectively."
Coincidentally, the 2000 survey sought to determine for the first time whether there were differences in the relationships marketers have with interactive and traditional agencies. The advertisers responding to the survey said there was more tension in their dealings with interactive shops and more focus on money; in addition, they said they provided more strategic direction to their interactive agencies.
The agency executives, for their part, said working with dot-com clients was more tense and time pressured but offered more teamwork.
The results of the Salz Consulting survey have seesawed in recent years. In 1996 and 1997, there were strong suggestions of improved relationships, followed by widespread signs of setbacks in 1998 and 1999.
In working together to create campaigns to turn consumers into customers, "the agency people are often very focused on using creativity to get attention," Ms. Salz said, "while the advertisers are very focused on hammering home the benefits, making sure the strategic message comes through." The resulting tensions are manifested in divergent answers to survey questions.
For instance, when asked if there has been more teamwork in relationships in the last year, 54 percent of the advertisers responding to the survey said yes, compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.
When asked if they agreed that there was more focus on money in the last year, 54 percent of the agency executives said yes, compared with 32 percent of the advertisers.
And when asked if there was more or less focus on how they work with each other, 57 percent of the advertisers said "more," compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.
Still, there were several indications of better relations. When asked if there were more or fewer hassles -- dude, that's the way the question was worded -- in their dealings with each other, only 12 percent of the agency executives said "more," while 12 percent said "fewer" and 73 percent said they saw no change. The results were similar among advertisers as 23 percent said there were more hassles, 20 percent said there were fewer and 57 percent said they saw no change.
When asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers was 7.2, an increase from 7.0 in 1999.
Tellingly, advertisers that compensate their agencies based on performance criteria like sales rather than conventional commission or fee methods ranked the quality of their advertising higher, a mean rating of 7.5 compared with 7.0 for those who use conventional methods. That was the first time advertising created under performance-based compensation plans was deemed superior.
And after three years of declines, advertisers indicated that advertising was becoming more important to them. When asked how much sales could improve if their agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean figure the respondents gave was 26.1 percent. By comparison, last year the mean figure was 21.4 percent, the lowest response since the recession year of 1991.
Speaking of economic conditions, Ms. Salz was asked if the record boom in ad spending as the American economic expansion enters its 10th year was serving as a lubricant to reduce friction between advertisers and agencies.
"We're all very happy when budgets are increasing and advertising is driving sales, but I don't think it's the budgets that have affected what the agencies are feeling," Ms. Salz replied. "It's more about the work they're producing."
The survey was conducted in April and May for Salz Consulting by Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J. Salz Consulting sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising development for marketers like American Express, Clorox and Compaq.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Vivendi-Seagram deal, and the stock prices, analysts say, are suffering from a lack of data.

BYLINE: By Geraldine Fabrikant 

 BODY:
WHAT is a Vivendi?" That is what some bewildered Wall Street media analysts were asking last month when Vivendi S.A. announced that it was buying the Seagram Company for what was then $34 billion in stock.
Many of those analysts are still trying to figure out what Vivendi is -- or at least what it is up to with Seagram. And their puzzlement has made them reluctant to offer investors guidance on whether to buy or avoid the shares of both companies. 
 That reluctance has translated into listless stock prices for both Seagram and Vivendi. Seagram shares are trading well below the premium Vivendi has agreed to pay. And in Europe, Vivendi shares have dropped roughly 27 percent since rumors of the deal first circulated.
In the United States, a core group of analysts say they have received little insight into the economics of the merger between Seagram, a liquor and media company based in Montreal, and Vivendi, a diversified French company that has stakes in the water, environmental, industrial, telecommunications and entertainment businesses.
"The folks at Vivendi have gotten very ham-handed advice from their bankers," said Christopher Dixon, media analyst at PaineWebber, who is one of those frustrated by how little guidance he said Vivendi had been giving to analysts and institutional investors. Lazard Freres in Paris represented Vivendi in the merger, while Goldman, Sachs represented Seagram. Both investment banks, and the merging companies, declined to commment.
Mr. Dixon and other analysts say that Vivendi, which until the announcement of this deal was not well known in the United States, had been adding and spinning off assets at a dizzying pace. This makes the company's financial performance and growth prospects hard to calculate, even before the Seagram deal. And since the deal, they say, Vivendi has done little to explain the value of acquiring Seagram or to articulate a growth plan.
The communications gap stems in part from the trend toward global mergers. Investment analysts in this country are accustomed to receiving detailed financial data from each partner in a merger. They expected Vivendi and Seagram to provide the data that would enable them to make projections. While some of those figures are public, much of Vivendi's data remains veiled, an analyst said, because "French accounting rules do not necessarily disclose how things are being consolidated."
To be sure, such projections are produced by enthusiastic and aggressive investment bankers and chief executives eager to consummate a merger. Whether or not the future proves them accurate, they are at least a basis for analysts to start building their own estimates.
 But in this case, there is little to build upon. More than a month after the deal was announced, on June 20, there are few specifics, according to several analysts. "If you call the company, they will tell you they are anticipating 40 percent growth," one analyst said. "But they don't tell you how they will get that growth. They tell you it will come from telephone and entertainment, and then tell you they will get back to you."
An executive close to Vivendi and its bankers at Lazard Freres responded that Vivendi had been forthcoming with financial data and that much of the information was publicly available. But an analyst pointed out that because Vivendi was now projecting faster growth than the company's historical growth rates, past data was not all that enlightening.
Part of the problem in global deals lies in logistics and geography. When Vivendi announced the purchase on June 20, it was 8:45 a.m. in Paris -- 2:45 a.m. in New York -- an hour when few analysts are glued to their television sets or computer screens. Vivendi officials flew to New York that day and held a news conference. But a subsequent conference call with analysts seemed only to annoy Wall Street.
"They came on the phone and never really described the deal," Mr. Dixon recalled. "They just took questions." It was a stark contrast to the custom of executives at American companies, who typically make detailed presentations of merger plans.
Several weeks later, Vivendi and Seagram held a conference call. This time, Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr. fielded questions solo for 45 minutes, because Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, was late, compounding Wall Street analysts' irritation. Ed Hatch, an entertainment analyst at SG Cowen, said, "The call was a big feel-good meeting, but it was totally useless."
Some believe that the scarcity of data is having a negative effect on the two companies' stock prices.
Under the terms of the deal, each Seagram share would be exchanged for 0.8 Vivendi share -- assuming Vivendi's stock remains below $96.69.
Based on Friday's closing price in Paris for Vivendi of 86.5 euros a share, or $79.84, the 0.8-to-1 ratio means that Seagram theoretically should be trading at $63.87. But Seagram shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed Friday at $56.50 -- or an 11.5 percent discount to the deal's valuation.
"Since the merger is expected to close by the end of the year, that discount could be compelling for investors if they could have confidence in the Vivendi story," said Scott Davis, who follows Seagram for First Union Securities. But, he added, "the information on Vivendi is still forthcoming."
Mr. Dixon of PaineWebber attributes the two stocks' performance to the lack of guidance from the companies. "The net result," he said, "is that everyone has shrugged their shoulders, walked away and said, 'Who needs this now?' "
Mr. Dixon is among the shruggers. "If you are going to invest in the entertainment industry," he said, "remember Woody Allen's famous line, 'The secret to success is showing up.' They haven't even done that."

San Francisco Paper's Sale Cleared. And Now?

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Caught like a subway train in a system with malfunctioning signals, San Francisco's newspapers have been stuck in place for almost a year. Last week, a federal judge threw a switch, and the city's leading newspaper owner, the Hearst Corporation, moved quickly forward.
Legally freed to complete its deals to buy The San Francisco Chronicle and sell The San Francisco Examiner, Hearst did both in 26 hours. 
 Now, with the antitrust battle apparently behind it, Hearst has important decisions to make. Having promised that all Examiner employees can work at The Chronicle, it must consolidate two newsrooms. It must select a publisher and a top editor and it must decide what battles to fight in a several-front war.
There will be a new and different Examiner. Ted Fang, the new owner, is free to remake it in the image of his family's other publications as an emphatically local community paper that wears its political agenda on its sleeve. Should The Chronicle, which sells more copies outside San Francisco than in it, go ultra-local in city coverage to compete?
Jay T. Harris, the publisher of The San Jose Mercury News, (circulation 289,000) The Chronicle's Silicon Valley competitor to the south, has taken the battle for readers into San Francisco, where he now has 2,000 readers. Mr. Harris has added 200 newspaper boxes and 70 retail sales outlets -- all the better to sell the new edition, which drops "San Jose" from its name plate.
Should The Chronicle (circulation 465,000) respond in kind, expanding its coverage of Santa Clara County, and of the Silicon Valley business empires that are the showpiece of the national economy?
National newspapers like USA Today, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are a growing presence. Metro, the Swedish-based company that brought its free tabloid product to commuters on Philadelphia's bus and subway system earlier this year, is hoping to start up in San Francisco. Should The Chronicle offer more news digests, like Metro, or its own national and international coverage?
San Francisco is going to be more competitive than it has ever been, said William Dean Singleton, chief executive of the MediaNews Group, whose papers in Alameda County are an irritant on the Chronicle's southeast flank. P. Anthony Ridder, chief executive of Knight Ridder, which owns The Mercury News as well as The Contra Costa Times, east of San Francisco Bay, suggests dryly that readers would be well served by the competition and better served if they bought his newspapers.
Some journalists in The Chronicle's old newsroom are eager to compete regionally. With enough invested by Hearst, they think The Chronicle can rise to heights that have eluded it. Ken Conner, an assistant city editor, welcomes competition with The Mercury News. "We are serious," he said. "They are serious. It would be a great newspaper war."
But decisions usually require planning, and while the antitrust case brought by Clinton Reilly, a multimillionaire real estate executive, remained undecided, Hearst forbade Examiner and Chronicle executives from talking about the future. Now they can talk. But who will lead the discussions? The career of Timothy O. White, the Examiner's onetime publisher is in limbo. Testimony during the antitrust trial disclosed that Mr. White had suggested "horse-trading" with Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. (I support your campaign, you stop opposing Hearst's plans.)
Perhaps Steven Falk, the president of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, the business arm of both papers, which have had a joint operating agreement since 1965. Perhaps someone like W. Lawrence Walker Jr., a decade ago the No. 2 executive at the San Francisco agency, and now a seasoned publisher at Hearst's San Antonio Express-News with practical experience in shutting down a joint operating agreement.
It is unclear who will be picked first, an editor or a publisher. It is also unclear if candidates include people at other newspapers. But soon, someone has to decide if the home-delivery schedule needs to be moved up, to compete with The Mercury News. Someone will have to tell the reporters what jobs they will be doing. If only one television critic is needed, what happens to the second one? How many metropolitan columnists should there be?
For Gerald J. Roberts, The Chronicle's current managing editor, the top three priorities are creating a robust Sunday paper, expanding coverage of local news, and coverage of collegiate and high school sports.
For Phil Bronstein, The Examiner's executive editor, city and suburban news coverage are crucial, but the most-pressing priority is business coverage ("this is the center of a universe, if not the universe, in technology.") Both men want some foreign coverage; both mention Asia and Mexico.
For Jay Harris, at The Mercury News, everything matters. "As the impact of Silicon Valley expands," he said, "we want to expand with it." And the richest readership lies northward, in The Chronicle's heartland.

Phone Workers Threaten A Strike Against Verizon
In what would be one of the biggest strikes in a decade, 85,000 telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening to walk out next weekend in a struggle that pits old-line labor against the New Economy.
The workers are facing off with Verizon Communications -- the name that Bell Atlantic adopted last month after acquiring GTE -- in large part because they fear the company's widespread use of lower paid, nonunion workers in its fastest growing businesses, most notably wireless phones, will endanger the wages and benefits of unionized workers.

Report on Organic Food Challenged
A report by the ABC correspondent John Stossel on "20/20" in February cited research that showed organic food seemed more likely than conventional food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He also said that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce. But the researchers who were hired to do the testing said they never tested for pesticide residue. And ABC executives are looking into whether the statement about produce was made without any basis in fact. C11.

HEADLINE: In America;
Listening To Women

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom says most Americans are happy in these best of economic times. Jobs are plentiful. Wages are increasing. Inflation is low. And even the traditionally hard-core unemployed are finding work.
But not everyone is happy. And a lot of those who are unhappy are women. 
 A nationwide series of focus groups conducted jointly by leading Democratic and Republican pollsters largely contradicts conventional wisdom and could change the way the presidential race is viewed.
The focus groups show that "women are largely pessimistic about the present state of the nation," and, to a surprising degree, feel they are not benefiting significantly from the improved economy. They feel they are working longer and longer hours just to make ends meet, and that the increasing demands of work leave them less and less time to spend with their families.
At the same time, the focus group participants expressed deep concern over the moral direction of the country, and what they perceived as the absence of a solid sense of values being passed on to the nation's children.
The economy may be breaking statistical records, but it has not been able to offset this deep discontent.
"I think women are asking, 'What if this is as good as it gets?' " said Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster who is surveying American women in the joint project with Republican pollster Linda DiVall.
From coast to coast, at gatherings of women from widely varied backgrounds, the focus group leaders heard heartfelt and poignant expressions of frustration, disappointment and even discouragement.
A common theme was that while there certainly were big winners in the booming economy, there were many more ordinary families that were working hard but barely holding on from week to week.
A detailed report on the focus groups said women were worried about their children growing up in environments that are entirely different from their own backgrounds. It said: "With the rise of single parent and dual income households, they are concerned about children's lack of guidance and their loss of appropriate role models. With parents busy meeting financial demands, participants believe children have few sources from which to learn family values or a sense of morality besides from television and the streets."
Ms. Lake and Ms. DiVall organized the focus groups and are conducting a series of nonpartisan national polls to determine -- as the election season unfolds -- what issues are of most concern to women. The project is called "Women's Voices 2000" and is sponsored by the Center for Policy Alternatives, a nonpartisan public policy group, and Lifetime Television, a cable network that bills itself as "Television for Women."
The report on the focus groups will be released tomorrow at a press briefing in Philadelphia, where the Republican National Convention is being held. "We're hoping the candidates see this as a wake-up call," said Carole Black, president and chief executive of Lifetime. "They need to hear what women are saying."
Some of the most heart-wrenching comments at the focus groups came from African-American women. They shared the concerns of other participants but also spoke movingly about the personal impact of violence and deteriorating values, and their very real fear that their children -- their sons, especially -- might not even survive adolescence.
"It was very sobering and very depressing," said Ms. DiVall. "A lot of them feel they are doing absolutely the best they can to protect their kids, but it's the outside environment that is pressing in on them and they feel they have no control over it."
Politicians have tended to argue economic issues and values issues as if they were separate categories that could be addressed independently. But the women who participated in the focus groups seemed to be saying that economic pressures made it more difficult for their families to deal with the many outside influences shaping the values of their children.
The interrelationship of values and the economy is a difficult theme for politicians to articulate. But it is close to the core of the real world of working Americans.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urging Milosevic Opponents to Unite for September Vote

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, July 30

 BODY:
American officials are putting strong pressure on the president of Montenegro and the leader of Serbia's largest opposition party to take part in Yugoslav elections called in September, according to Yugoslav politicians and Western officials.
The American officials argue that a united opposition in Serbia, together with voters in Montenegro, Serbia's increasingly independent partner in the Yugoslav federation, would have a good chance of defeating President Slobodan Milosevic in the presidential and parliamentary elections he has called for Sept. 24. 
 Mr. Milosevic and his allies have begun a new wave of repression and altered the Constitution to create direct elections for his position -- which he otherwise would have to relinquish next July.
The only time the opposition triumphed in past elections was when it united for municipal elections in 1996, winning in Belgrade and dozens of other cities. Mr. Milosevic initially refused to recognize the victories, setting off three months of protests.
If the coming elections are manipulated or stolen, as expected, the Americans argue, the opposition will have another rallying cry for anti-Milosevic demonstrations. But a boycott provides no chance to beat Mr. Milosevic, they say, and a divided opposition has almost no chance to win.
In late 1997, Milo Djukanovic broke with Mr. Milosevic and won the presidency in Montenegro. He has allied himself with the West, but is refusing to take part in the September elections, arguing that the constitutional changes were made without consultation with Montenegro and aim to reduce its influence.
Mr. Djukanovic's officials say that to take part in the elections would only ratify Mr. Milosevic's constitutional coup and legitimize the likely outcome -- a Milosevic victory, fair or otherwise.
The changes to the Constitution have also removed previous requirements for a minimum turnout of half the eligible voters -- apparently to blunt any opposition boycott or the effect of widespread apathy among a generally depressed electorate.
Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the largest single opposition party in Serbia, the Serbian Renewal Movement, says he will not take part in federal elections if Mr. Djukanovic will not. Mr. Draskovic also argues that the elections cannot be free and fair -- with attacks on opposition politicians, the judiciary, student protesters and government pressure on independent news media.
The rest of Serbia's political opposition, largely grouped into the Alliance for Change, says it will take part, and is urging Mr. Draskovic to follow suit.
Mr. Draskovic is almost sure to take part in the local elections, where his party has many seats and privileges to defend. A boycott of the elections would cause a revolt in his own party, Draskovic aides admit.
A likely opposition presidential candidate is Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who is considered free of corruption or of cooptation by the West -- distinguishing him from Mr. Draskovic or his great rival, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party.
In May, the government took over the Belgrade television station Mr. Draskovic controlled, Studio B, and prevented the independent radio station, B2-92, and two others from broadcasting in Belgrade.
The government has been regularly suing the independent news media under a tough information law passed in October 1998 and has also restricted newsprint to major independent publications, particularly Blic, a popular tabloid whose circulation has been reduced by nearly half.
And last week, in a trial that produced outrage domestically and internationally, a Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, was convicted by a military court in Nis on charges of espionage and sentenced to seven years in prison.
Mr. Filipovic, who works for the independent Belgrade publication Danas, Agence France-Presse and a London-based Internet site called the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, wrote a number of articles that annoyed the government, including one that cited an internal Yugoslav Army report on unhappiness and remorse over the brutal tactics used against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo -- tactics that caused Mr. Milosevic and four top aides to be indicted by an international tribunal on charges of war crimes.
Unusually for a suspected spy, Mr. Filipovic signed his name to his articles, and no evidence was presented to indicate that he had secret contacts with any foreigner or intelligence agency.
The government has also accused other independent journalists in Serbia of being spies and working on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency or the same NATO countries that bombed Serbia last year, but in no case has provided evidence.
While those forms of pressure are hardly new in Serbia, they are increasing and indicate pre-election nervousness in the Milosevic camp.
"Milosevic is very shaky and obviously very concerned about these elections," said Ognjen Pribicevic, a Draskovic aide. "His worry is not just because of the opposition, but because the situation in Serbia is disintegrating in every sense, economically and politically."

HEADLINE: Dejected Fishermen Blame Mosquito Spraying in Mysterious Lobster Deaths

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., July 28

 BODY:
John Makowski is a fourth-generation lobsterman, or at least he was until the mysterious death of most of the lobster population in western Long Island Sound last fall. And though he does not have a degree in marine biology, Mr. Makowski, like many of his former colleagues, said he was convinced that millions of lobsters were killed by the pesticide spraying to fight the West Nile virus.
It is a suspicion that some scientists are taking seriously, saying there are plausible indicators -- but not definitive proof -- that the pesticides could have played a role in the catastrophic lobster kill. And as communities across the region continue to grapple with dual concerns, the West Nile virus and the chemical spraying, the lobster deaths and the fate of the lobstermen put out of work suggest that the stakes can be high and the facts often elusive. 
 On Tuesday morning, just hours after New York City concluded pesticide spraying in Central Park, Mr. Makowski and about a dozen other demoralized lobstermen were in the offices of the Norwalk Seaport Association submitting paperwork to get federal disaster money authorized for them by Congress. The mosquitoes may be back this year, several pointed out, but the lobsters are not.
They were skeptical about theories last year that a micro-organism, a paramoeba, could have killed the lobsters. "There has been a lot of talk about this paramoeba," Mr. Makowski said. "But paramoeba is in the water all the time. It's not something that in 200 years has ever wiped out a fishery."
Like insects, lobsters are arthropods and are extremely susceptible to pesticides, he said.
Last year's die-off, marine scientists say, was the worst ever to hit the Sound.
Officials estimate that about 11 million lobsters, more than 90 percent of the full-sized population, died in the Sound last fall, putting hundreds of lobstermen out of business in Connecticut and New York. Millions of younger lobsters, too small to be harvested, are also believed to have died. The Sound is the nation's third-largest lobster source, after Maine and Massachusetts, generating $45 million in annual sales.
Lobsters and other crustaceans are vulnerable to many things, including changes in water temperature and oxygen content that can prove deadly. The effects of dredging and sewage treatment can also be lethal. But many lobstermen believe that the pesticide spraying last September and the die-off were not a coincidence. They theorize that the pesticides were washed into the Sound by heavy rain, including Tropical Storm Floyd, and that those chemicals combined with overflows of chlorine and sewage from water treatment plants weakened the lobsters' immune systems, allowing the paramoeba to kill them.
Scientists have mixed views, but generally regard the theory as plausible and well worth researching. The death last year of other crustaceans like crabs and starfish suggests that whatever happened was not specific to lobsters.
And Dr. Richard A. French, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Connecticut, who identified the paramoeba in the dead lobsters, said investigators had ruled out several known causes of lobster deaths, including bacterial, viral and fungal agents. He said researchers have been collecting lobsters since June 1 to test the pesticide theory and are anxious to do so. But until the tests are done, the theory remains just one of many possibilities.
"If I had any concerns it would be that there are concentrations that could affect the animals in a way that makes them more susceptible to other causes of mortality," he said. Even basic tests like exposing healthy lobsters to the paramoeba to see if it kills them directly have not yet been done.
And while lobster kills have happened before, he said, "The biggest problem with past history of mortalities in the Sound is there were never investigations as to the specific cause, mainly because they haven't been significant enough to damage the market they way they have this time."
Outside the Seaport Association, Jeff Samson, 44, held a small bag filled with pink receipts documenting sales for the last three years and copies of income tax forms to prove his losses. The numbers: 50,989 pounds of lobster caught in 1997; 53,792 pounds caught in 1998; 18,496 pounds caught in 1999. "This year I might get 1,000 if I'm lucky," Mr. Samson said, adding that he has taken a job driving an oil truck, and can afford to fish only part time.
With hundreds of lobster traps sitting on the docks in towns all along western Connecticut and the north shore of Long Island, many lobstermen are questioning whether politicians overreacted to the West Nile virus, noting that far more people die of the flu. And several are irked by what they consider to be brazen comments by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City about his willingness to kill fish and other animals if necessary to protect human beings from infected mosquitoes.
"I think they really overdid it," said Anthony Coviello, 56, a lobsterman who lives in Rowayton. "If you are going to spray to protect lives and it's going to protect lives, then pay me for my damages because I'm out of business."
Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly said his primary concern is the health of citizens, and officials throughout the metropolitan region have said that pesticides were used in accordance with federal regulations.
Mike Horvath, the president of the Western Long Island Sound Lobster Association, said lobstermen recognize the public safety concerns.
"The determination to spray," he said. "It's a public health decision and lobstermen are not qualified to make that decision and yet I think we should ask who is qualified to make this decision, and that's what we are asking."
The Western Long Island Sound Lobster Association has hired its own researchers in hopes of more conclusive findings. Congress has authorized $13.9 million in response to the lobster deaths. Half will go to direct aid for unemployed lobstermen and half will go to research. And Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it will conduct a separate six-month, $125,000 environmental study of the Sound, not focused on pesticides, to help determine what killed the lobsters.
Experts generally agree that insecticides, by definition, are deadly to crustaceans. "It is well demonstrated that a lot of these pesticides kill lobsters better than they kill mosquitoes," said Mike Loughlin, a freelance biologist who tested dead lobsters in Connecticut last year and is now researching salmon for the National Marine Fisheries Service. "Almost saying the name of a pesticide will kill a lobster," he said. "They are that sensitive to some of them."
But Dr. Robert Bayer, the director of the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, which is testing the effects of pesticides, said the situation in the Sound is complicated.
"I think there are other pollutants that could fit into the picture and it's hard to define what those might be in Long Island Sound when you have got the megalopolis around it, which actually could affect the way lobsters respond to many things, including pesticides," Dr. Bayer said.
And Ernie Beckwith, the chief of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's marine fisheries division, was more cautious. He said there was also evidence suggesting the pesticides were not involved. "I don't think we have proven anything yet," he said. "We had lobsters dying in places where we didn't have spraying going on."
He said much more research was needed to determine the proximity of pesticide spraying to the water and the lobsters and to understand the effects of dilution and water movement.
"I think there are a lot of other factors going on here. I don't know what role the pesticides could have had," Mr. Beckwith said. "It could have been one of many factors that effected lobsters in a negative way." He added, "You also have to consider that we are very close to the southern range of lobsters, which makes them much more vulnerable to changes in water temperature and oxygen. They are really cold water animals."
Mr. Beckwith also said his agency was doing everything it could to aid the lobstermen and to better understand last year's die-off.
Whatever the cause, the fact remains that what was once a vital industry has been all but wiped out. Marine scientists say it will take at least five to seven years for the lobster population to recover, if it recovers at all.
Mr. Makowski has put his boat up for sale and plans to sell his house. He has two daughters, one about to start college. To pay bills, he has taken a job on land, with a ventilation company in Massachusetts.
Waiting to file their paperwork at the Seaport Association, the lobstermen said that not only have they lost their livelihoods, they have lost each other. "I used to talk to him three, four times a day, where our wives would be mad at us," Tony Carlo, who is now delivering furniture in New Jersey, said of Mr. Coviello. "Now, I don't even see him."
Gary Olewnik, 45, is surviving on a pension from a former job and insisting on trying to trap lobsters, but he is barely making back expenses. "I'm paying for my boat and I'm paying for my fuel," he said. Mr. Coviello has put his beloved boat, a custom-built beauty named Black Mountain Risin', up for sale.
"We can't collect unemployment and there's no severance pay," Mr. Coviello said. "It wasn't our fault. We didn't get up and quit fishing. Somebody killed these lobsters. This is nothing but pollution that did this. I honestly believe it. Between the pesticides and the sewage treatment plants, there was nothing else." He added: "To be wiped out completely, you can't tell me it wasn't something different. Between three weeks and one month, we were completely out of business."

HEADLINE: The Petro-Curse

 BODY:
Equatorial Guinea is a poor Central African nation that is hoping to become a rich Central African nation. In 1996, American companies began to pump major oil deposits from the waters around Equatorial Guinea and production has been rising steadily. If the new oil revenue is managed well, it can educate, heal and provide jobs for the country's half-million people.
But oil brings risks as well as opportunities. Rarely have developing countries used oil money to improve the lives of the majority of citizens or bring steady economic growth. More often, oil revenues have caused crippling economic distortions and been spent on showy projects, weapons and Paris shopping trips for government officials. The people of misgoverned Equatorial Guinea may see few benefits from their nation's oil. 
 Petroleum helps a nation most when its government already has democratic accountability, fiscal discipline and a bureaucracy that is based on merit and is relatively free of corruption. Norway, which first struck oil in the North Sea in 1969 and started getting substantial income from it 10 years later, has managed its resources wisely. Norway used oil money as a catalyst to broaden the country's manufacturing base. It required oil investors to put money into other industries as well. Thanks to oil, Norway now sends three times as many people to college as it did in the mid-1980's.
Most oil producers, however, do not have Norway's advantages. In many cases, such as Nigeria, oil revenue has simply disappeared into the overseas bank accounts of dictators and their cronies. Oil is particularly corrupting because it is hard to keep track of and easy to turn into cash. It is tempting to spend the sudden windfall on pharaonic works or arms. OPEC countries spend more of their G.N.P. on weapons than do other developing countries.
Oil-producing countries also score lower in health and education than many poorer nations. Kuwait has twice the per capita income of Barbados, for example, but people in Barbados live better. The biggest problem is that even though petroleum provides few jobs, fluctuates wildly in price and will some day run out, the sudden profits can lead to a reliance on oil and a withering of the rest of the economy. Norway was cautious because it studied the experience of the Netherlands, which suffered in the 1960's when natural gas revenues were allowed to hide problems in other industries.
In Venezuela, oil allowed the central government to hire huge numbers of unneeded workers, finance inefficient state enterprises and obtain large loans. Oil exports also led the government to set exchange-rate policies that made the rest of its exports uncompetitive, which then reinforced its dependence on oil. In the last decade, when other Latin American countries were carrying out needed economic reforms, Venezuela's oil cushion sapped the political will for needed austerity programs. Many Venezuelans believe that oil has also undercut the importance of personal initiative by offering wealth without work.
The leaders of Equatorial Guinea say they are determined not to make the mistakes of oil-rich but still-impoverished Cameroon, Gabon and Nigeria. But even leaders aware of the pitfalls of oil will not be able to avoid them if corruption and mismanagement are endemic.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE CAST AND THE CONFLICTS -- THE PROTESTERS;
Updated Refrains of the 60's As Dissenters Hit the Streets

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 30

 BODY:
Devotees of lively political protest, a fading art in recent decades, had something to cheer for and against today as an eclectic, ragtag assortment of causes snaked and howled through the heart of this city, giving pause to Republican conventioneers intent on decorum.
A rich assortment of several thousand dissenters -- all of them orderly, many rambunctious -- dominated the eve of the convention as marchers consciously sought to revive some old-time 60's rhythms and jingles, but with strategic updating. 
 "Hey, hey! Ho, ho!" began one group, a generation removed from the old "L.B.J." punch line, who bellowed a coda edited for current events: "H.M.O. has got to go!"
"What do we want?" came one marching question. And the answer ("Freedom!" in the old days) came back: "Health care!"
For all the altered stakes, veteran witnesses of the antiwar demonstrations of the 60's felt a pang of nostalgia. Particularly when guerrilla-theater demonstrators capered past with large papier-mache heads of piggish plutocrats and Darth Vader caricatures of politicians. Chanting denunciations of corporate wealth and the two-party system, they happily rose to the bait of a few fundamentalist Christian counterdemonstrators lobbing bullhorn taunts from the sideline.
"Hey, environmentalists, get a life!" boomed John Franklin, wielding a printed billboard that judgment day was near. "God will take care of the trees, then he'll take care of you on the Last Day, for all the clear-cutting of babies," he said, mixing the abortion issue in for good measure.
The marchers offered as good as they got, several offering an obscene blend of gesture and advice. Mr. Franklin, a 58-year-old veteran of varied protests of the 60's, admitted later in an interview: "At least the kids are trying, scratching away, although they don't quite have it. It's like watching a cartoon, but it's nostalgic. They're trying."
Arms outstretched, Michelle Christedes intervened as a peaceful parade monitor between the caustic Mr. Franklin and an unshaven young man in a sundress who drew tension-tinged laughter in impishly shouting contentions about the sexuality of Jesus.
But the peace was maintained. Other causes strutted by: opposition to the death penalty, to sweatshops, to the antimissile defense movement and a score more, many of them clearly pressed by crowds of galvanized young people.
"I've been waiting for them a long time," said Ms. Christedes, a 53-year-old psychology consultant who said she felt some of the fury and swagger of her youth when she marched against the war in Vietnam as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Berkeley.
"The old me generation sold out," she said, hoping for better. Not all the evidence was encouraging. One young man, dressed melodramatically in the black garb and red bandanna of the self-styled anarchists, brandished a bottle of Gatorade and a cell phone on his way to the rhetorical ramparts.
Safely beyond all sight and sound of the demonstrators, Rand S. Larson, a convention delegate, sipped a rum and diet cola at a new oasis in town, the Ritz-Carlton bar, which just opened in a palatial six-story marble bank building on Broad Street.
"I've not seen any of the protest," said Mr. Larson, a first-time delegate from Richmond, Vt., who sported a bright "V.I.P." tag atop his necklace of credentials. "I don't really fear any trouble from the demonstrators, although my wife and 11-year-old son are coming down and I hope they have a good, safe time," he said.
Mr. Larson savored his drink after working for days to tamp down dissension as a member of the party platform committee. "We dealt with all the right issues in a climate of respect," he insisted of a platform smooth as a runway for the candidates' landing.
As a man strolled past the bar with one of the day's least contentious T-shirts ("Dartmouth Fall Foliage Squash Tournament"), the Ritz's Sunday brunchers seemed all gentled out and ready to convene, far removed from the dissenting crowd on the other side of City Hall.
Once outside, however, Joe Bramante, a freelance Democrat from Derry, N.H., bearded delegates with a big, bluff hello, then asked, "So, how's the economy?" Before Republicans could answer, Mr. Bramante spun a hand-printed sign on its stanchion: "I am Bill Clinton's Number One Fan!" And he told each of them about the booming economy as they sought escape.
Farther east in the city, tourists approaching the Liberty Bell were distracted by a display of hundreds of pairs of shoes lined up as part of the Silent March demonstration, the empty shoes representing the thousands killed annually with handguns. A barefoot, grandmotherly woman walked stolidly past, bearing her own printed protest: "Too angry, too female to vote Republican."
The day's larger march of dissenters presented a gathering of various causes, from NOW to the N.A.A.C.P., from folk-singing unionists to animal rights demonstrators, under an umbrella label called Unity 2000. Some self-proclaimed student anarchists marched amiably with the larger parade, but they have hinted they may try to act up by midweek with some hit-and-run street initiatives.
"So far so good," said Police Commissioner John F. Timoney, who has been darting between demonstrations as a member of the police bike patrol in helmet, shorts and monogrammed "P.C." shirt. "But it's early and you never get cocky," he said, noting that other marches potentially more troublesome begin on Monday. "We can work out deals, even if we don't quite like the deals," the commissioner said in emphasizing flexibility as his chief weapon for getting through convention week.
This was demonstrated on Saturday evening as the police quickly put aside confrontation and became escorts of an ad hoc march of 200 teenagers who showed up on Chestnut Street loudly devoted to the cause of virginity. "Free sex kills!" they warned. "Honk if you're a virgin!" they pleaded as restaurantgoers stared from sidewalk cafes for a passing moment before turning back to their food.

HEADLINE: Leaders March In Camden To Protest Plans For Takeover

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., July 30

 BODY:
It was a pro-democracy rally against the ouster of the lawfully elected government of an entire American city, taking place across the river from the cradle of liberty, practically within earshot of the thousands of journalists gathered for the Republican National Convention.
But when Camden's leaders took to the streets for the first time yesterday to denounce New Jersey's plan to take over their crumbling city of 85,000, only about 45 people showed up. 
 "Democracy for Camden" was the protest's theme, but its purpose seemed blurred, with some placards demanding reparations for slavery and an end to the Navy bombing of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
Despite the national attention bound to be drawn to what would be the largest municipal takeover since the Great Depression, and despite the assertions of several of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's fellow Republicans in the State Legislature that the takeover plan is dictatorial, it was a tiny crowd that turned out to march politely down Admiral Wilson Boulevard, a police escort in the lead and a string of vehicles from news organizations filling in the rear.
Mayor Milton Milan, who is under federal indictment on corruption charges, did not attend, nor did Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the City Council and a fierce opponent of a state takeover. But Ali Sloan-El, a Council member and the organizer of the march, said that even a small number could get its message to the Republicans gathering this evening on the Camden waterfront for a reception held by Mrs. Whitman.
"We're trying to get the nation to see that Camden is dealing with some serious issues," Mr. Sloan-El said. "The governor says she wants to take over the city and take our vote away without telling us anything about what we will get in return."
Camden has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, and has been subsisting on state revenues to fill the gap in its budget.
But years of state supervision of the city has failed to produce results, Mrs. Whitman has said, and she introduced legislation earlier this month that would permit the state to take over city government.
Brother Zawdie Abdul-Malik, a member of Camden's elected Board of Education, also marched and carefully corrected reporters' spelling of his name ("My father was a mister," he said. "I'm a brother.")
Mr. Abdul-Malik, whose school board is also under state scrutiny, said the demonstration was meant to warn state officials not to take the city's leadership for granted.
"This march is intended to let the country know that there's just a high level of dissatisfaction with the way the state is proceeding on this takeover," he said.
Mr. Abdul-Malik and the protesters may have more friends in the Legislature in Trenton, in the short run at least, than they imagine. The takeover bill was introduced in the last days of the current legislative session's spring term, and many lawmakers read about the proposal's management plan without having first heard much from administration officials about the urgency for action that the governor perceives in the city.
Legislative Democrats, who are in the minority in both houses, are broadly opposed to a complete takeover of a Democratic-voting city. They said their members would probably wait to see how the majority modified the bill before deciding how to act.
Many of those Republicans are also uncomfortable with the idea of voting to usurp the right to self-representation in a mostly black and Hispanic city, and putting an unelected state official in charge of an entire city.
That uneasiness is particularly strong among the many members of the Legislature who also hold, or who have held, elected municipal office themselves.
Senator Leonard T. Connors Jr., a Republican, is the chairman of the Community and Urban Affairs Committee, through which the takeover bill would presumably have to pass. He has also been the mayor of Surf City since 1966, and he said he had serious reservations about taking away municipal authority.
"I think it's a pretty strong bill to impose on people, to disenfranchise the voters of a municipality," Mr. Connors said. "If there's corruption, it can be dealt with in the courts of law, but the operation of local government should not be summarily dismissed and turned over to the bureaucrats in Trenton. I don't think they are going to do any better than those folks." Without yet taking a formal position, the New Jersey League of Municipalities, which represents 560 New Jersey local governments in Trenton, has also made members' feelings clear.
"We're basically opposed to the whole concept of having some state-appointed administrator go into Camden or any other municipality," said William G. Dressel Jr., the league's executive director. "Quite frankly, we may be talking about Camden today, but we could be talking about any other municipality tomorrow."
Indeed, partly to avoid seeming to single out the state's most stricken city, the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, Senate Bill S1507, does not even mention Camden.
Jane M. Kenny, the commissioner of the state community affairs department, which oversees local government, acknowledged that her office had a way to go in persuading legislators and municipal groups of the dire nature of Camden's problems. Ms. Kenny said she had been focusing her efforts on urban legislators.
"I very pleased that they are engaging in a discussion with us, and I think that, obviously, we need to engage further and make sure the legislators fully understand the deep problems we are facing in Camden," Ms. Kenny said. "I don't think all of them do at this point. I don't think they fully understand the insidious nature of the problems we face."
Ms. Kenny said that the state was prepared to accept some modifications in the bill, particularly, she said, for changes that would give the Camden City Council a more prominent role under a state manager.
But the commissioner made it plain that the state would fight to keep most legislative and administrative powers in the hands of a "chief management officer," as the legislation puts it, selected by the state.
"We have to have a strong hand," she said.
Senator Martha W. Bark, a Republican from the Camden suburb of Medford and the bill's sponsor, also said the legislation's perceived anti-democratic elements may be softened.
"This bill will go through a thorough hearing and it will be modified," Senator Bark said. "People have reached out to me and told me what they feel are right and wrong approaches. I will listen to all of those. However, I still feel very strongly about the opportunity to do something for Camden.
"The state has put in a lot of time and money and the city is still not turned around."
As for being anti-democratic, Ms. Bark said, the state has been taking over urban school districts and usurping the powers of ineffective but elected school boards for years without much of an outcry beyond the districts in question. Yet that argument hardly satisfied Senator Connors, the chairman of the Urban Affairs Committee.
"Is there is a crisis in Camden? Damn right there is -- I'm not going to say there isn't," Mr. Connors said. "But it isn't any bigger crisis than in Newark, and didn't we take over the Newark schools and run them into a $58 million deficit that the taxpayers now have to pick up? So what makes the bureaucrats think they will be the super wizard that can run Camden any better?"
But Ms. Kenny said that a takeover would "open up" the city government to new faces and new skills from Camden residents. She might have had someone like Jeff Slaton in mind, a young construction supervisor currently working on Newark Airport projects. He said he was at the march because his wife wanted him to come -- she is a city ward committee member -- but as he stood at the fringe of the demonstration, he said a state takeover might not be such a bad idea.
"We've seen the old way of doing things, and we can see it's not working," Mr. Slaton said. "I think it may be time to try the state takeover as a temporary thing, to give the citizens a chance to elect someone who's capable of running this city."

HEADLINE: Phone Workers Fight for Place In Wireless Era

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In what would be one of the biggest strikes in a decade, 85,000 telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening to walk out next weekend in a struggle that, stripped to its essentials, pits old-line labor against the New Economy.
The telephone workers, who belong to the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, are facing off with Verizon Communications -- the company formed when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE last month -- largely because they fear that the company's widespread use of lower paid, nonunion workers in its fastest growing businesses, most notably wireless phones, will endanger the wages and benefits of unionized workers. 
 The stakes are large because Verizon, with 260,000 employees, has far more workers than any other American telecommunications company and is the nation's largest wireless company. Almost 80 percent of the more than 120,000 workers in the company's local telephone division are unionized, compared with a mere 46 of the 32,000 workers in Verizon's wireless division. If the unions win changes that would make it easier to unionize wireless workers, the impact on the company could be felt throughout the nation.
"Right now the chances of a strike are better than 50-50," said Morton Bahr, president of the communications workers' union, which represents 72,500 of the workers who might walk out.
The walkout, threatened for 12:01 a.m. next Sunday, could cause problems for 25 million businesses and households stretching from Virginia to Maine. It would involve operators, service representatives and repair workers, and could cause the same inconveniences that local and long-distance customers experienced in previous telephone company strikes: delays in repairs, installing new lines, ordering new phone service and getting questions answered about telephone bills.
Company officials say they are taking the strike threat seriously because the two unions involved in the dispute have never been shy about striking. In 1998, they struck Bell Atlantic for two days, winning a no-layoff clause and improved pension benefits. And in 1989 they staged a 17-week strike against Nynex, which later merged with Bell Atlantic, rebuffing a company demand to have workers pay monthly health insurance premiums.
The challenge for the two unions is daunting because they are finding it tough to keep pace with a fast-changing company in a fast-changing industry. Indeed, the unions are struggling to adapt to many developments common throughout the New Economy: new job categories, new types of compensation like profit sharing, and the increased use of contingent workers like temporary hires and independent contractors.
The former Bell Atlantic now owns the telephone companies around the country previously operated by GTE, whose workers will not strike next week because they are covered by a different union contract. Verizon, (pronounced ver-EYE-zon), also operates the nation's largest wireless telephone network in a partnership with Vodafone AirTouch, a European company. In addition, Verizon, which long focused on local service as Bell Atlantic, has recently entered the long-distance market in New York state and hopes to win regulatory clearance in other states as well.
In this maelstrom of mergers and reshufflings, of new businesses and new technologies, labor leaders fear unionized workers will be squeezed or even laid off as Verizon attempts to pare labor costs by, for example, contracting out work to nonunion firms.
The main issues in the dispute, union leaders say, are job security, higher pensions, feelings of stress at work, and the union's demand for an easier way to unionize the workers in the company's wireless operations.
Union officials voice fears that if they fail to unionize the wireless workers, Verizon will aggressively shift business -- and jobs -- from its unionized operations to its lower-paying nonunion operations. Union officials complain that many of the more than 5,000 jobs in Verizon's new and fast-growing business installing digital subscriber lines for computers are nonunion.
"The union is looking at a situation where the industry is changing very fast and with the advent of wireless and Internet services and digital subscriber lines, we are battling with the company over keeping that work as union work," said Bob Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers. "We want to see the industry change and grow, but we want the union to share in that growth and we want those jobs to remain good jobs that pay enough to support families."
The communications workers estimate that Verizon's unionized service representatives are paid an average of $26 an hour, about double the pay of service representatives in the nonunion wireless operations.
The union acknowledges that Verizon's top nonunion craft workers, like line repairmen and installers, are paid $27.30 an hour, on average, 24 cents more than the $27.06 an hour the unionized craft workers earn.
But union leaders say the big difference between union and nonunion workers comes in benefits. The unionized workers pay no premiums for family health insurance coverage, while nonunion workers must pay $600 to $3,500 a year depending on the health plan. And unionized workers have a pension as well as a 401(k) plan, while most nonunion workers have just a 401(k).
In a demand that unions are increasingly making as they seek to organize more workers, the communications and electrical workers want Verizon to allow unionization of its wireless operations through an expedited process known as a card check. In that process, a company agrees to let workers join a union if a majority of employees at a work site signs cards saying they want to join a union. Labor leaders say it is far easier to organize workers through card checks than through elections, which often take months to hold and can bog down in years of litigation.
"Our members understand that if we don't organize the people in wireless, then when the unorganized numbers grow anywhere near the organized, there's a direct threat to the wages and benefits that we achieved over 60 years because the nonorganized are not getting anywhere near what the members are getting," said Mr. Bahr, the union's president.
The unions are also demanding that Verizon pledge not to fight any unionization efforts. As an example of management's anti-union efforts, the communications workers say supervisors at the Verizon Wireless call center in Woburn, Mass., have barred workers from distributing pro-union literature and have asked workers who among them is supporting the unionization drive.
Steven Marcus, a Verizon spokesman, insisted that the company is pro-union, not anti-union, and he talked in nonconfrontational tones.
"Our goal is we want to be a union-represented company that can compete successfully with many companies in our marketplace that are not unionized," he said.
Worried about the company's plans to cut expenses, the unions are demanding job security provisions, among them a no-layoff clause and restrictions on contracting out work and transferring operations from one state to another. Verizon officials say that to remain competitive, they need to retain the right to contract out work and move operations.
Seeking to ensure that thousands of union members will back a strike, the communications workers' union has held training sessions for more than 700 workers over the last four months. The sessions teach workers how to carry out a strike, and educate them on changes in the industry and the importance of unionizing Verizon's nonunion workers. These trainees are then responsible for mobilizing other union members behind a strike.
For some Verizon workers, a strike cannot come soon enough if it brings about measures to reduce stress on the job. At many call centers, customer service representatives who take orders for new service or answer questions about bills say they are inundated with calls, and that management often requires them to tack four extra hours onto their shifts.
Patricia Egan, who works in a Verizon facility in Queens answering questions from residential customers, said, "We generally work from 8 in the morning until 4, but often we're forced to work until 8 at night. It wreaks havoc. People go to school and they're forced to miss classes. Many workers are single parents, and this forced overtime is a nightmare. It creates serious problems for their child care arrangements."
She would like the union and company to agree on measures to reduce stress and forced overtime.
Mr. Marcus, the Verizon spokesman, said, "On the stress issue, we recognize that's a concern. We hope we can address it and resolve it."
Verizon's first quarter operating profits were $1.27 billion, but net earnings were $731 million, or 46 cents a share, reduced by a one-time charge related to its investment in Cable & Wireless Communications. Verizon has not yet announced second-quarter earnings, but earlier this month, the company said second-quarter sales rose about 15 percent.

HEADLINE: Barak Seems in Position to Survive Vote in Parliament

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 30

 BODY:
Thanks to complex backroom maneuvering on the eve of a no-confidence vote in Parliament, it appeared today that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel would be able to keep his battered government afloat for the next three months.
And meetings between senior Israeli and Palestinian officials today indicated that the effort to find peace is also still alive, despite the failed summit meeting at Camp David last week. 
 For Mr. Barak, much of the speculation in the last few days centered on whether Foreign Minister David Levy, who has a history of changing sides, would resign over the Camp David peace talks and return to his roots in the rightist Likud Party. That could have set off a voting shift to the opposition in Parliament that would have forced new elections.
But early tonight Mr. Levy announced, after meeting with Mr. Barak, that he would remain in the cabinet for now and abstain from the no-confidence vote on Monday.
Instead of trying to topple Mr. Barak, Mr. Levy said, he would try to persuade him to create a broad-based government of national unity.
"I am making all possible efforts to create a unity government, and if by Wednesday I do not succeed, I will resign from the cabinet and support the bill for early elections," Mr. Levy said on the Israeli radio.
But the threat to resign on Wednesday has little practical weight because that is the last day Parliament is to meet before adjourning for a three-month vacation that is so regular a part of Israeli political life that it is unlikely to be interrupted.
Mr. Levy could vote Wednesday for a Likud bill that calls for Parliament's dissolution and new elections. But the bill is to be referred to a committee controlled by Mr. Barak's One Israel Party, which can bottle it up.
Mr. Levy has criticized Mr. Barak for offering concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem and other issues without, Mr. Levy contends, being offered anything in return. Mr. Levy has also complained that he has been left out of the loop on this, the major foreign policy issue.
During the Camp David summit meeting, which he declined to attend, staying home as acting prime minister, Mr. Levy made a sympathetic visit to a hunger strike by Jewish settlers protesting the talks.
Mr. Barak, apparently in an gesture to Mr. Levy after his announcement today, said, "I have to make peace, or at least an interim agreement, with the opposition."
He said he needed to work with the opposition on the economy, education and social problems, issues that even his supporters have criticized him for neglecting in his concentration on peace efforts.
But he quickly returned to his main focus, saying he would work with the opposition "so that we may be able to try, not at any price, but, yes, with all our strength, to bring to the state of Israel security and peace and a different future for all our children."
Last year, Mr. Barak won a strong mandate in the general election. But electoral changes introduced in 1996 -- under which Israelis vote directly for prime minister as well as separately for Parliament -- have produced a fractured Parliament with a profusion of narrow-interest parties and the need for coalitions, which have proved unstable.
Mr. Barak lost his parliamentary majority in the legislature on the eve of the Camp David talks, when three religious or rightist parties quit to protest the talks. That reduced his core support from 69 seats to 42 in the 120-seat body.
Mr. Barak has not ruled out a national unity government, particularly if there is an outbreak of Palestinian violence. But bringing Likud or the religious parties into his coalition would probably halt peace efforts.
Likud, for its part, said in a statement today that it had decided against joining a government of national unity and that it intended to topple Mr. Barak, whom it accused of lying to the people and breaking his promises to the public not to surrender any part of Jerusalem.
"There is only one way now to stop the danger -- hold early elections," said the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon.
Mr. Sharon, a hawkish former general, said Israel needed a government that could reach "a peace that was safer, a peace that was better, a peace that would last generations, a peace with a united, undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital."
And he said: "Under no circumstances should we succumb to any temptation to form a national unity government because today we know exactly where things stand. There is only one option: to replace the government as soon as possible."
Meanwhile, senior negotiators from Camp David -- Saeb Erekat for the Palestinians and Oded Eran for the Israelis -- met in Jericho today to show symbolically that the peace effort was continuing. Their discussions were said to have included such unresolved issues as a long-declared plan to move Israeli troops and the release of prisoners.
Ranking Israeli and Palestinian security officials also met in Gaza in the early evening, part of a joint effort to keep a lid on violence from extremists on each side.
Indeed, the Palestinian police in Gaza arrested the second-ranking leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, in his home before dawn today. There was no immediate official explanation, but he and other Hamas officials have been vocal in their criticism of the Camp David talks.
During a demonstration in Gaza last week, Mr. Rantissi called on Mr. Arafat to abandon the peace talks and resume an armed struggle, or jihad.
"Yes to the rifle!" he exhorted the crowd. "Yes to jihad!"
Mr. Arafat, for his part, arrived in Saudi Arabia today for talks with Crown Prince Abdullah and others in the Saudi royal family apparently aimed at building support for some kind of Arab summit meeting to work out a joint position on issues in the peace talks, particularly the crucial question of the status of Jerusalem and its holy places. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was in Libya today on a similar mission.

HEADLINE: 5 Rescued in Brooklyn Apartment Fire

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
In the chronicles of New York City firefighting, the things that happened at 315 Livonia Avenue in Brooklyn yesterday will hardly warrant a footnote. No one was killed or seriously injured, the flames were confined to one apartment on the 13th floor and five members of a family were rescued by firefighters.
But for those five family members -- and for two firefighters who ran into their blazing apartment, crawled down a smoke-filled hallway and shared their air packs with the trapped woman, her brother and her three children until help arrived -- it was a day of survival and heroism, a poignant day to remember. 
 "I have a 6-year-old son myself," Lt. Dennis Gordon, 42, said after the rescue, in which he and Firefighter Michael Cummings, 44, joined the family behind a wall of flames and shared their lifesaving air, as well as the peril, for eight minutes as deadly smoke encroached.
The drama began about 8:15 a.m., fire officials said, when Kim Williams, 32, awoke to discover flames engulfing the living room of her three-bedroom apartment, 13-E, at the S. J. Tilden Houses on Livonia Avenue at Mother Gaston Boulevard in the Brownsville section.
Ms. Williams, shrieking in terror, roused her sleeping brother Eric Mitchell, 36, and her children -- Marcus Russell, 5, Donnell Russell, 4, and Taquenan Russell, 3. They were forced to retreat down a hallway to a back bedroom, where they huddled for 15 minutes on the border of hope and dread.
"We couldn't get out," said Ms. Williams, who shut the door against the nightmare and huddled on the floor with her children and brother. The room soon began to fill with smoke. They opened a window, but that only seemed to draw more smoke from under the door.
There had been no time to call the Fire Department. But a next-door neighbor, Barbara Evans, 65, heard noises, saw smoke in the hall and called in the alarm. She and two sons, Kevin and Derrick Davenport, also threw wet rags to the family from a hallway window.
Under the command of Chief Robert Brown, firefighters of Ladder Company 120 and Engine Company 231, six blocks away at 107 Watkins Street, arrived within minutes. The plan was to hook up a hose to the nearest standpipe, on the 12th floor, tapping into a tank on the roof of the 16-story building and a hookup from the standpipe's base to a hydrant on the sidewalk.
But the standpipe valve on the 12th floor, apparently unused for years, was sealed up with paint, and the firefighters lost precious minutes struggling to open it.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Gordon and Firefighters Cummings and Brian Gallagher, 35, all of Ladder Company 120, entered the apartment and found the living room and kitchen area almost completely engulfed. Furniture and cabinets were burning, flames were shooting out shattered windows and blinding smoke filled the rooms.
The firefighters each carried about 130 pounds of gear, including air packs that each held about 17 minutes of compressed air, and face masks that enabled them to breathe in rooms where the gases from smoke can quickly be deadly.
Firefighter Gallagher also carried a portable fire extinguisher. While he attacked flames to cut a momentary path, Lieutenant Gordon and Firefighter Cummings plunged across the kitchen and into a 25-foot hallway, which in two zigzag turns led to the three bedrooms.
Smoke already filled the hallway, and they fell to the floor, where it was least dense, and crawled forward to search for victims. They could see almost nothing.
They searched two bedrooms and found no one. Minutes later, they reached the back bedroom, where the family members were trapped. The firefighters could hear them gasping, coughing and trying to scream, but could not see them until they were virtually face to face.
"They were all huddled on a mattress under the window," Lieutenant Gordon recalled. "The smoke was burning their eyes and throats. The kids were going limp from lack of air. The littlest one looked like she was going to pass out. She was not responding."
By that time, Firefighter Gallagher's portable extinguisher had run out, the flames had begun to fill the hallway, and the firefighters, too, were trapped. "There was nowhere we could go," Lieutenant Gordon said. "We had to stay there until help came with water."
As they waited, the two firefighters immediately took off their air masks to share with the family members. Each was given 20 to 30 seconds of air before the mask was moved onto another face. Lieutenant Gordon said up to eight minutes elapsed before help came.
"I was pretty confident," he said. "We were in radio contact. The others knew we were there. It was just a matter of time until they got through with water."
The two youngest children, Donnell and Taquenan, fell unconscious.
Finally, firefighters cleared the standpipe and brought heavy water to bear on the flames. Firefighter Gallagher was the first to follow his comrades down the hallway, crawling under the smoke. He carried Taquenan out to safety, while Firefighter Cummings carried Donnell out. Lieutenant Gordon then led the two adults and Marcus safely out.
Mr. Mitchell was taken to Kings County Hospital Center and treated for smoke inhalation. Ms. Williams and her three children were treated at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, also for smoke inhalation, and the children were admitted overnight for observation.
The Red Cross sheltered the family, and relatives, neighbors and friends said they would help, too. Ms. Williams is unemployed but enrolled at Medgar Evers Community College. The family's apartment was a charred shambles: the furniture, the clothing, photographs, the children's drawings and collages, all destroyed.
"We lost practically everything," a downcast and exhausted Ms. Williams said at the hospital last night. It had all happened so fast -- the fire, the rescue, the rush to the hospital -- that there had been no time to thank the firefighters.
But Lieutenant Gordon, 22 years in the department, and Firefighters Cummings and Gallagher, both sons of New York City firefighters, had not waited around to be thanked.

HEADLINE: Officials Say Chavez Wins In Venezuela

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, July 31

 BODY:
Rallying to President Hugo Chavez's call for radical social and political change, Venezuelans on Sunday granted the former paratrooper a new six-year term with enhanced powers, top officials said.
"This is a day of revolution," Mr. Chavez, 46, who in 1992 led an unsuccessful military coup attempt, said after casting his ballot this morning at a suburban polling station. "Today a new republic is being born." 
 The ease with which Mr. Chavez will be able to carry out his revolution, however, depends on the outcome of races to elect 165 members of Congress and 23 state governors.
Results of those races were still being tallied early today. Supporters of the president are expected to win a majority of the posts, but polls indicate that Mr. Chavez may fall short of the two-thirds majority he needs in the National Assembly in order to govern without constraints.
Mr. Chavez has promised to use his time in power to sweep away the last remnants of the traditional political order in this nation of 23 million people that in recent years has been the United States' top oil-supplier.
Hours after the polls were supposed to close, there were no official results. However, both the head of the outgoing legislature and the interior minister, Luis Davila, said on national television that preliminary official results showed that Mr. Chavez had won handily.
Voter surveys posted by the the newspaper El Nacional gave Mr. Chavez as much as a 20-point margin over his main challenger, Francisco Arias Cardenas.
In the last 18 months, Venezuela's poor, disillusioned by decades of corrupt and unresponsive government, have united around Mr. Chavez and his plan for a complete overhaul of society.
The preliminary results, announced late Sunday night, were quickly followed by fireworks and other celebrations across the capital. Thousands of jubilant Chavez supporters wearing the red beret that is the emblem of their movement marched with flags and banners on the Miraflores presidential palace downtown, demanding that Mr. Chavez appear on "the people's balcony" to address them.
When he finally emerged, wearing the same red beret and a military-style uniform, Mr. Chavez called for national "unity, persistence and patience." But he once again resorted to the language of conflict and confrontation that has become his trademark, boasting that "we have routed the forces of the adversary" and warning that "one battle has ended and another is beginning."
The vote on Sunday was the culmination of a contentious process of sweeping political change that began with Mr. Chavez's landslide victory in a December 1998 presidential vote. As a candidate, he promised voters a "peaceful social revolution" if elected, but also said he would need a new constitution with expanded powers in order to carry out the transformation the country needed.
In three elections last year, a constitutional assembly was first convoked and next selected and then finally it submitted a new charter to voters for approval last December.
As a result, Mr. Chavez's term of office was expanded from five to six years, and a ban on sitting presidents seeking immediate re-election for one more term was removed -- creating the possibility that Mr. Chavez could remain in office until 2013.
Even before the changes were approved, though, the Congress, dominated by discredited opposition parties, and the Supreme Court were eliminated and replaced by weakened entities that have proven subservient to Mr. Chavez and his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition.
The authority of governors and mayors was also reduced, the role of the armed forces was vastly expanded and a Chavez loyalist was placed in charge of the powerful state oil company after it was purged.
With the new Constitution in hand, Mr. Chavez called a vote to elect a new unicameral congress, as well as governors, mayors and state and municipal legislators, a total of more than 6,200 elected posts. In what he described as an attempt to "relegitimize" his rule, he also submitted the presidency to a new vote, anticipating no real challenge.
But in February, Mr. Cardenas, a former army colonel who was Mr. Chavez's second-in-command during the 1992 coup and spent two years in jail with him afterward, broke ranks and announced his own candidacy.
Mr. Chavez, he charged, was assuming dictatorial powers, tolerating the corruption he had pledged to eradicate, alienating the United States and forging an undesirable alliance with President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
In an unusual last-minute incursion into the campaign, Mr. Castro invited a group of Venezuelan journalists to Cuba on Saturday and issued a ringing endorsement of Mr. Chavez, wishing him "good luck and lots of votes" during a rambling news conference that was televised live here. "Hugo, I am sure that nothing or no one can hold you back," the Cuban leader said.
Mr. Castro's remarks, which appeared to violate a ban on politicking here after the formal close of the campaign, came days after a man turned up claiming to be a Cuban intelligence agent and said that Mr. Castro has sent 1,500 operatives here to infiltrate the Venezuelan government. As the news conference was taking place, Mr. Chavez called Mr. Castro, and the two men discussed baseball before ridiculing the accusations of a Cuban spy network operating here.
Since taking office 18 months ago, Mr. Chavez has consistently praised Mr. Castro and the Cuban revolution while attacking his domestic critics as "a rancid oligarchy" and pursuing a nationalist and populist political line. The resulting polarization of Venezuelan society, with the poor overwhelmingly lining up behind Mr. Chavez and the middle class reluctantly supporting Mr. Arias, was once again on display during the balloting on Sunday.
One of Mr. Chavez's strongholds here is a working-class neighborhood called 23 de Enero, the site of a popular uprising in which hundreds of people died in 1989, after the government raised gasoline prices. The area voted heavily for Mr. Chavez in 1998, and appeared today to have rallied to his side again, with scarcely a supporter of Mr. Arias to be found during interviews with voters.
"Venezuela has awakened, and we will never let ourselves be fooled again," said Julia de Tirado, 61, who described Mr. Chavez on Sunday as the antidote to 40 years of corruption and misgovernment under a pair of traditional parties. She praised him for being "honest and hard-working" and said that "if he were not our president, things would be disastrous."
But across town, at a polling place at a private high school in the middle-class neighborhood of Chacao, a woman conducting an exit poll for a local firm said Mr. Arias appeared to have a two-to-one advantage over Mr. Chavez. Among the the most vociferous of those voting against the president was Irma Galindo de Baez, 50, who was wearing a button that proclaimed "throw the crazy man out."
Mrs. Baez said she voted for Mr. Chavez in 1998 because "Venezuela needed a change -- it couldn't go on with the dictatorship of the political parties." But "this government has been a disaster," she said. "This guy has really scared us" with his incendiary language, "there has been a lot of corruption," and the police have allowed a farm owned by her family to be seized by peasants.
Mr. Chavez himself voted early, thanked Venezuelans for choosing "a new horizon, a new path," and then spent several hours playing baseball. Later, though, he met with his economic team to draw up what he described as "measures of great impact for the first 100 days of the new government," and on Sunday night he said he will address the nation on Aug. 2 to announce the details of "a new economic model for Venezuela."

HEADLINE: Urban League Leader Advocates New Standard in Capital Cases

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The president of the National Urban League, Hugh B. Price, called on governments yesterday to institute a tougher standard of guilt for judges and juries in death penalty cases to ensure -- "beyond any doubt" -- that the innocent are not executed.
"It's barbaric for the state to kill someone who isn't a mortal enemy," Mr. Price told 1,500 people in a speech that kicked off his organization's annual convention at the Urban League's headquarters on Wall Street in Manhattan. "The folks on death row may not be angels, but they are children of God." 
 Aside from the new burden of proof in death penalty situations, Mr. Price voiced support for affirmative action, called for a new commitment to prepare the nation's youth for high-tech employment in the new economy, and called for blacks to use the strong economy as a springboard to self-sufficiency.
"We must summon the will and the resources to mount the next great surge toward the American mainstream," Mr. Price said.
In his speech, Mr. Price called for a repeal or nationwide moratorium on executions.
But if executions are not halted, he said, politicians should stiffen the standard of guilt in death penalty cases from "beyond a reasonable doubt" to beyond any doubt at all.
Of today's standard, Mr. Price said: "I believe that standard is too lax when someone's life is at stake. Politicians know full well that some innocent people will be executed. But most of them lack the courage to say what error rate they find acceptable." Under Mr. Price's proposal, if the judge or jury found that some doubt existed and the death penalty could not be imposed, they could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and impose a lesser sentence.
The issue of the death penalty and how it is imposed has drawn heightened public interest with the execution of Gary Graham in Texas.
George W. Bush, the Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential nominee, defended Mr. Graham's execution, but critics said his defense was doomed by incompetent counsel that failed to uncover evidence that could have cast doubt on his guilt.
